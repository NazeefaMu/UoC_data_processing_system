Abbotts close link with Rajapaksas was a mystery-Ranil
	
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbotts close relationship with the Sri Lankas Rajapaksas was a mystery to Sri Lankans, and that Australias new Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton, would be unlikely to get the warm welcome received under the previous government.
In an exclusive interview with The Australian, the veteran politician also said that the Australian governments silence on alleged human rights abuses was the price it paid to secure co-operation from the former Rajapaksa government on stopping asylum-seeker boats.
In a weekend interview at the Prime Ministers official Temple Trees residence in Colombo, Mr Wickremesinghe confirmed the involvement of people connected to the previous government in people-smuggling operations.
It was being done by people with Rajapaksa connections, but once this deal was done between Australia and the Rajapaksa government, where you looked the other way (on human rights abuses), then secretary of defence got the navy to patrol, he told The Australian. You could not have got anyone out of this country without someone in the security system looking the other way, the police or the navy.
He understood people-smuggling was a major issue for Australia and his government would continue to crack down on departures. This should have been done anyway (by the Rajapaksa government) but they didnt do it. They wanted to strike deals, he said.
The Sri Lankan Prime Minister said former immigration minister Scott Morrison had breached protocol by refusing to meet with then opposition Tamil National Alliance politicians when he last visited Sri Lanka and as a result his successor could receive a frosty reception from the TNA, now a key member of the new ruling coalition.
It was a slip-up on the part of the Australian side, he said. I am not against the Australian government, but I think you must learn from your experiences. Some other countries must also that fully backed the Rajapaksa regime. When human rights were being trampled, and democracy was at bay, these countries were silent. That is an issue for Sri Lanka.
Australia has been accused of refusing to speak out on alleged war crimes committed in the last months of Sri Lankas 26-year civil war with Tamil separatists in which as many as 40,000 civilians were killed, and on subsequent allegations of human rights abuses, because it needed the Sri Lankan governments support to stop the flow of boats. While fellow Western nations have pushed for an independent investigation through the UN Human Rights Council, Australia has said it is not its place to publicly lecture Sri Lanka on human rights.
Mr Wickremesinghe, the 65-year-old leader of Sri Lankas centre-right United National Party, became Prime Minister for the third time last month after former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his powerful family were voted out of government. The new administration has promised to punish those who illegally profited under the Rajapaksa regimes crony capitalism.

Pakistan set to sign civilian nuclear deal with SL
	
	Pakistan and Sri Lanka are set to sign civilian nuclear cooperation deal when President Maithripala Sirisena visits Pakistan in late March.
	President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to be here on March 31. The details are being worked out. The civilian nuclear cooperation deal will be signed during his visit, said a senior government official in Islamabad.
	President Sirisena, who assumed office in January, has been invited to visit Pakistan by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The official said Islamabad has received the schedule, proposed by Colombo, for their Presidents visit on March 31. Sri Lanka had to sign a deal for nuclear cooperation with Pakistan for civilian purposes under the umbrella of International Atomic Energy Agency in 2014 and for the purpose the then Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had planned to visit Pakistan but the visit could not take place due to the sit-in staged by Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf.
	Sri Lankan high commissioner for Pakistan air chief marshal Jayalath Weerakkody, who was commander of Sri Lankan air-force before assuming the diplomatic assignment in Pakistan, has confirmed the plan to visit Pakistan by his former President but that did not materialise.
	He has also hinted at signing a deal with Pakistan for civilian nuclear cooperation.
	Diplomatic sources say Sri Lanka is maintaining a balance in its ties with important countries of the region as the President will visit important regional capitals one after other during the year.
	Prime Minister Sharif was among the first foreign dignitaries who made a phone call to President Sirisena on his historic victory in polls in January.
	The Prime Minister had also invited the Sri Lankan President to visit Pakistan, which was accepted. Since then the two foreign offices were engaged in making arrangements for the agreed visit.
	The Sri Lankan President also plans to proceed to China soon after visiting Pakistan as he has already visited New Delhi where he signed an agreement with the Indian government for civil nuclear cooperation.
	Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also visit Sri Lanka in March, but no schedule has yet been confirmed by the either sides.
	Sri Lanka is keen to initiate its nuclear programme and it is eyeing the Chinese reactors for the purpose.(The Asian Age)
