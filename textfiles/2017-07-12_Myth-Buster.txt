MYTH: Drinking green tea can help you lose weight and boosts your metabolism  

 

BUSTED: There is some truth in this. Green tea has antioxidants and also has a small amount of caffeine, therefore, as a stimulant when taken regularly, it can help increase one’s metabolism. What is advantageous about green tea is that you have it without milk and sugar, so there are no calories gained. This is why people lose weight when they drink green tea. People can also have plain tea without milk and sugar and get the same result, but you rarely see anyone drinking plain tea without one of these. Plain coffee too has the same effect as it is a stimulant, but if you add cream or sugar the results are lost, explained Professor Arjuna de Silva, Professor in Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ragama.
