The US Embassy has yet not given approval to the visa application submitted by Democratic Party Leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka two weeks ago, sources close to Field Marshal Fonseka said today
Sources said the US State Department has blocked Field Marshal Fonseka's visa application for the past two weeks in connection with war crimes charges against Sri Lanka during the time he was the army commander.  
“Most probably this must be why the US embassy has refused him a visa to visit the US. There are no other issues,” they said.  “He has not visited the US during the past five years and his green card has also expired.”
Sources also said Field Marshal Fonseka had applied for a visa to visit his daughters living in the US and to meet the Sri Lankan community living there.
It was also reported that Sri Lankan Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam had also contacted the State Department to obtain the visa for the Field Marshal. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
