‘Aussie’ flu pandemic could wipe out 33 million


	



 

UK, (Daily Mail), 8 March 2018 -  Humanity would be virtually powerless to stop the spread of a killer flu virus that could take 33 million lives in just 200 days, experts have warned. 

 
Professor Robert Dingwall, a flu expert, said that covering your mouth when you sneeze and washing your hands are the most effective ways to stop the virus spreading - but even these measures are unlikely to be enough.   


His warning comes after Dr Jonathan Quick, Chair of the Global Health Council, warned that a deadly flu mutation could take place any day and prove to be the deadliest pandemic in human history.   


One such new strain, which is believed to be partially responsible for a 40 per cent increase in flu-related deaths in the US and UK, is dubbed the ‘Aussie flu’, because it originated in Australia.
