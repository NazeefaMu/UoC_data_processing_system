Parliamentarian Vasudewa Nanayakkara said that after the announcement of the forthcoming local government elections, the joint opposition would contest the election under a symbol belonging to one of the six parties in the joint opposition.

He said the joint opposition did not want to form a new political party and denied rumours about forming a new political party.

Addressing a media conference in Borella, the MP alleged the SLFP's problem was that the party was captured by those who had no public support. (Vineetha M Gamage)
