President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday he would consider changing the fisheries portfolio from Minister Mahinda Amaraweera so that he could be given different responsibilities to handle development work in the Hambantota district.

Addressing a function in Hambantota, he said he learnt of the problems that arose due to the assignment of fisheries related responsibilities to three ministers representing the Tangalle electorate.

“I learnt today that there are three Ministers from this electorate looking after the fisheries sector. One is Mr. Amaraweera, and other State Minister Dilip Wedarachchi. The third one is provincial fisheries minister H.W. Gunaseana. All are from the same electorate. So, I thought of making some changes in the Cabinet portfolio,” he said. (Sanath Gamage)
