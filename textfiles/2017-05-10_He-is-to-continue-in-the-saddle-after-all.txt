He is to continue in the saddle after all


	



 

A glowing compliment paid to a satin coated bully-boy-type purohita of his party by the Green leader recently has taken the winds out of a widespread speculation that the latter is due to lose his portfolio in the top team reshuffle said to be in the offing. 

 


The Green leader, incidentally Number two in yahapalanaya had complimented the purohita concerned for his great efforts to bring about a quick economic recovery at a recent conference with Number One where the proposal to remove him from the current portfolio had come up, they say. 


Given the stand taken up by the Green leader, the proposed reshuffle has gone into a tailspin, they say. This also means the much publicized plan to switch the much maligned purohita to Foreign Affairs and the current holder of that portfolio to the one thus falling vacant has to be thrown overboard, they say.
