You may not have even thought about your retirement as yet, but it is inevitable. It makes sense that you take a minute to think about what sort of a retirement you fancy, so you can start planning early to make sure it turns out just the way you want it to!
That is exactly what AIA’s latest Facebook application makes you do. The first of its kind in Sri Lanka, the ‘What type of retiree are you?’ personality test allows you to pick from a selection of future lifestyles, so you can get a glimpse of what your future could have in store. 
Where would you like to live at retirement? Perhaps a luxury apartment, a serene villa, a cosy cottage or an elders’ home? Would you like to ride around in a luxury, standard or cost effective vehicle or will you opt for public transport? And of course one of the most enjoyable things about retirement
is travel, so do you look forward to luxury holiday destinations around the world, will you limit it to inland travel only, or will you be happy just watching the travel channel?!
Whatever your retirement aspirations may be, its best you start thinking about it early, so you can afford the retirement you dream of. As AIA’s Head of Marketing Suren Perera pointed out, “people don’t realize that there is a gap between what they will have at the point of retirement and what they will actually need to live the lifestyle they want. A typical retiree will live up to 25 years after retirement and this can perhaps be the best time of their lives, provided they can afford all the things they want to do.” 
He added, “That is why we developed this game, to urge Sri Lankans to actually start thinking about their futures, in a fun and engaging way, while realizing their own future aspirations”. 
As Asia’s leading insurer AIA is committed to creating awareness on the importance of planning ahead, being prepared and closing the gap between what you have and what you will need for a comfortable retirement. So here’s your chance to find out what type of retiree you are. Have a go, on AIA Sri Lanka’s facebook page:
