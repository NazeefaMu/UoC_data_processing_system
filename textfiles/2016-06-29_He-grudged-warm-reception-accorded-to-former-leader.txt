The former strongman received a rousing welcome from the compatriot community during his recent visit to the Nippon land. 

 


A certain high-up here had been highly chagrined over the warm reception accorded to the leader now out of power. He is an individual who had found a niche in yahapalanaya as an advisor on political affairs.


This high-up had on his own sent an ‘official communication’ to the Nippon authorities saying that the Sri Lankan visitor being  only an ordinary MP now, the state- sponsored privileges be scaled down to his present status. 


On being told about the ‘official communication’ by an authoritative source and the former strongman had shrugged it off saying: “Ah! There’s nothing to worry about it.” 


The visit over, the former strongman and the five Diyawanna members who accompanied him had called at the Nippon main airport to take a flight back home.


 Later the former strongman had along with others joined a long queue of passengers to take their turn to board the plane. However, the Nippon authorities and the airline officials having spotted the former strongman standing in the queue had greeted him with respect due to a VVIP and escorted him and his entourage to the plane meant for their homeward journey.
