Colombo High Court today noticed Minister Rajitha Senaratne, his wife, both sons and eight others to appear in court on April 2 to inquire into a habeas corpus application seeking that a girl allegedly abducted and detained by the respondents be produced in Court.
The petitioners had sought an interim order against four of the respondents seeking that the petitioner’s daughter Dinithi Aloka Ranasinghe be produced in Court and handed over to the custody of her parents.
They also requested Court to direct the JMO to examine her and submit a report to Court and to hand over the custody of their daughter Aloka to a person authorised by Court during the hearing of the habeas corpus application.
The petitioners appealed the High Court to refer the inquiry into the habeas corpus application to a Magistrate.
They said their daughter was born on November 15, 1997 and was a student of the Asian International School where she sat the London GCE (O/L) examination last year.
The petitioners state that during a party hosted by the respondents last year the third respondent sought permission from the petitioners to speak to Dinithi Aloka.
This request was declined and sometime later the 1st respondent had appealed to the petitioners to allow the third respondent to speak to Aloka before the third respondent went abroad.
On February 24, last year Dinithi Aloka had telephoned the petitioners from her school and had told them that her Art Class would be over by 3.30 p.m. and to pick her up from school.
The petitioners said that when they went to the school they had found that their daughter Aloka was not in school. On inquiring from her friends they found that Aloka was seen inside a vehicle with the registration No. GL 7370 which belonged to the first respondent
The petitioners said thereafter on several occasions they had tried to gain access to their daughter but all the efforts had failed and had such complained to the police.(TFT)
