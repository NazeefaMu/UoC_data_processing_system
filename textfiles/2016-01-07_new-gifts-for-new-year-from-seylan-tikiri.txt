“The first month of the academic year is always exciting for children where they expect new books, uniforms and most importantly attractive stationery. We are delighted to mark the beginning of 2016 for the kids with an exciting incentive scheme that will both promote the habit of savings and help make classroom activities exhilarating and colourful,” said Seylan Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Personal Banking Tilan Wijeyesekera
“Due to the popular response received last year, we have extended this promotion from pre-school kids to grade five students. ‘Seylan Tikiri’, the country’s premier minor savings account, has always gone that extra mile to appreciate the loyalty and partnership we enjoy with kids and their parents through various reward schemes,” he added. 
For the second consecutive year, Seylan Tikiri, the flagship brand of Seylan Bank, is geared to provide a cheerful start for the children for the new academic year. With the objective of fulfilling kids’ dreams for a fresh start in the new academic year, Seylan Tikiri has planned to offer them stimulating incentives for their studies. Vis-à-vis last year’s promotion, which was limited only for preschools and Grade One students, this year’s gift scheme is extended to children up to Grade Five.
The promotion will commence from January 1, 2016 across all Seylan Bank branches islandwide. Every new Tikiri account opened or new deposit with Rs.1,500 will be entitled for a free ‘pencil case’ and every new Tikiri account opened or new deposit with Rs.3,500 will be entitled for a free ‘student bag’. With this incentive scheme, Seylan is also encouraging parents to commence lifelong savings plans for their kids. 
Seylan Bank’s minor savings scheme, Seylan Tikiri, has a history spanning 28 years and is one of the most sought-after children’s savings accounts in Sri Lanka. Seylan Tikiri is renowned for being closely connected with its customers and consistently engages with them through various exciting value-adding activities by providing the best benefits to their young customers. While encouraging the savings habit from a tender age, the bank rewards the child depositors with novel and innovative gifts ranging from mugs, school bags, video game pads, remote-controlled helicopters, organs, bicycles, DVD setups, tabs, to LED TVs. 
Recently Tikiri has added a scooter to its gift portfolio. The success of Seylan Tikiri is attributed to its fast response to changing market trends and needs of their customers. Seylan Bank’s belief is, if children get involved in banking practices from their early childhood, they will learn about finance, fund management and practice savings throughout their adult lives.  
Seylan Bank, ‘the bank with a heart’, identified as one of the six systemically important banks in Sri Lanka by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, has expanded its network to 159 branches and more than 181 ATMs, exclusive of its student saving centres, islandwide. Understanding the needs of their valuable customers, Seylan has continuously provided with innovative value additions to its products and services.
