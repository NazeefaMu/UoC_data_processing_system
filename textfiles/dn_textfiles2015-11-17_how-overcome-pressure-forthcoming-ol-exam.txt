How to overcome the pressure of forthcoming O/L Exam

The end of the year is speeding towards us. Little less than half a million students are prolifically getting ready for GCE Ordinary Level Examination. Teachers and parents alike are busy in the last minute guiding and encouraging students. Department of Examination is dealing with necessary arrangements to hold the examination. The whole month of December is dedicated for this great exercise. With the release of the examination results, a substantial percentage of children leave schools owing to poor results, poverty and other factors. Their preference is to join the labour market seeking an early employment rather than continuing further studies. Those who are successful, proceed for AL with the selected stream of studies of their choice. Thus, GCE Ordinary Level is decisive and crucial in the selection of children’s future educational directions and career paths.
The syllabus of OL is rather extensive consisting of nine subject areas. In addition to subject matter coming under the purview of each subject, OL is expected to develop a wide range of other important skills concerning children’s development such as language competencies, social skills, learning techniques, decision making, team work and attitudinal development. The underlying objective of the examination is to assess the knowledge imparted to students on core curricula. Intensity of the syllabus keeps teachers and students extremely busy throughout the whole academic period. In the end, preparation for examination is naturally strenuous for children. Stress is one of the most terrible experiences that children encounter before an impending examination. It is exceedingly increased when examination is nearing.
The intention of this small attempt is to bring to the notice of our parents some significant points of parenting when their children are sitting for OL examination. Parenting is a rewarding and exciting function which varies from stage to stage depending on the age specific goals and objectives. Children sitting for OL examination are in their teens during which biological and psychological changes begin to take place in their bodies and minds. The role of parents in OL exam phase is considerably significant and it is a hard and a learned task especially during adolescence.
Emotional and psychological issues
Along with physical and emotional changes occurring in the teenage, children develop a range of diverse problems during exam phase. Headaches, physical pains in various parts of the body, constant tiredness, dizziness, increased heart rate, excessive sweating etc. are some prominent physically witnessing symptoms among children. They look ill tempered and depressed. Due to loss of appetite they cannot eat well. Children come across sleeping difficulties when exam is coming near. Bowel movements become irregular. Emotional and psychological issues such as anxiety and nervousness are common natural reactions emerging during examination period. Children sitting for a public examination having a considerable number of subjects like OL for the first time cannot bear these worries mounting within them. They desperately need parental support at this critical period. Parents have to play a multi-faceted role as a friend, a guide, a facilitator and a source of encouragement helping them to study, revise lessons and face the examination peacefully.
The first and foremost is to provide a favourable and peaceful environment at home. The home atmosphere would be a facilitating and supportive one without noises and disturbances. A carefully arranged ventilated room is conducive and encouraging the child to study.
Cleanliness of the room is important. Parents should necessarily persuade children towards studies. It is essential to educate the child about the vitality of getting through OL and the tangible benefits in facing an exam such as developing memorization, enhancing writing skills, accepting challenges, gaining confidence and emotional resilience required by the child to cope up with future responsibilities as an adult.
Tranquility and peacefulness of the mind provide a strong basis when start revision of lessons. Leaving the children alone allowing them to deal with exam stress and panic is destructive.
Parent, in regard, must be able to recognize and share the child’s feelings. A close acquaintance with children is a vital element in parenting so that children do not have anything to hide from their parents. Both mother and father need to develop the habits of talking to the child affectionately, listening carefully, absorbing and providing appropriate directions as to how he could get rid of such disturbing feelings. Parents must not allow the child to feel the family worries and problems since such behaviour can intensify the worries of the child at this crucial period. Maintenance of calmness and relaxation at home is beneficial.
Last few days prior to examination
Certain parents establish unrealistic expectations for their children which are impossible to realize. Failure to achieve anticipated grades at the examination can lead to psychological downfall and self defeating. Exerting unnecessary pressure will end up with damaging effects. Confidence building on the child’s capability to perform at the exam and gain desired results would adequate. The life does not depend only on getting through OL, but there are other alternatives to succeed the life. Intelligent parents are more concerned with the children’s wellbeing rather than exam results.
Convincing and ensuring the child about these realities is very effective for him/her to ease the exam burden. Unfortunately most parents promote their children in academic success neglecting other important areas in life.
Parents must keep in mind that succeeding in academic field alone does not produce a balanced personality. Playing games, watching television, association of peers and relatives, enjoying the nature and developing cultural values etc. are essential elements in the overall development of a child. Children therefore, need to be provided with separate times for studying, playing, taking meals, watching television, enjoying the family relationships, religious performances and once in a way outing etc.
Teenagers by nature, disagree with punitive strategies and nagging by parents. The more you impose punishments, the more children become adamant. Patient listening is more constructive than nagging. There is an undesirable habit among some parents to compare their own child with his/her colleagues who are considered to be well behaved and academically thriving. Evidence has suggested that positive reinforcement is more productive than criticizing and comparison. Such an approach damages the child’s self esteem.
Parents must understand that anxiety and nervousness of children aggravate when exam is coming closer. Continuous physical pains, changes in functioning of bodily organs and various other complexities develop faster. Some of the children feel that they did not adequately prepare for exam. Some others have confusions over what they have learned so far. Forgetfulness is another serious issue during the eve of the exam. Some of the children are affected by fear arising over achieving expected grades. These symptoms and complexities appear in children at different intensities. Apart from a few, most children cannot withstand them. Last few days prior to examination are extremely crucial where close association and guidance by parents is imperative. Parents can be supportive pillars in the revision exercise, relieving stress and improving the tranquility of children’s minds.
Following are some of the effective suggestions to enhance memorizing and revision exercise and stress reducing practices that could be applied.
Assist the child to manage the limited number of remaining days effectively. Help organizing notes, textbooks and study related other materials in a systematic manner enabling the child to pick them up easily. Discuss with him/her and arrange the most preferable time for study. Before starting lessons the child should have a self determination to accept the challenge and achieving satisfactory results.
The willpower of the mind and courage is advantageous more than anything else. Ask the child to take regular intervals about ten minutes while studying. During these short breaks the child could go out of the study room and refresh the body and mind. End of the day he could engage in some physical activities like, cycling, walking, swimming, gardening or meditation which largely help avoiding stress.
Discussions and reviewing lessons with peers is an effective revision technique for some children. According to their preference and willingness group discussions of this nature could be arranged with random supervision by parents. Children must avoid studying new areas relating to curricula, that he could not touch earlier, during the last few days prior to examination. Focusing on what the child has thoroughly studied will help him/her to face the exam with a positive mind.
Past question papers of OL examination are readily available. Children can collect relevant question papers and answer them with fixed time. If this is done genuinely within the time indicated, it is a sound practice and a rehearsal for impending examination. Some vague idea about the pattern of questions and possible topics that might come up at the exam can be guessed through reviewing and answering past papers.
Simulating a mock exam will help children decreasing the exam panic and anxiety. Advice the child to visualize the exam process and mentally engage in individual steps involved.
When he has practiced the imaginary exam process several times, he can enter the actual exam hall and perform the exam confidently with reduced stress. It has been proved that mental rehearsing builds up confidence when it comes to actual situation. Another simple stress releasing technique is breathing exercise.
The child is to take a deep breath in to fill up his chest, hold and let out a big sigh. Letting out a big sigh is said to be the fastest way to relax your body and decrease the nervousness. This breathing exercise needs only a few seconds. The child can repeat the same as many times as he wish during the day.
Successful exam performance
Physical health of the child is also vitally important at this period. Parents need to ensure that the child get a balanced diet so that s/he does not get physical weaknesses or ailments during examination. Enjoying the meal together with the child with relaxed conversation is much beneficial. He should not be allowed to overwork during this period. A sound sleep is necessary to maintain health and improve concentration and thinking ability. Carrying out physical exercises is an effective practice that will boost up energy level of the body.
The child has to spend the last day before examination relaxing. Heavy involvement in studies in the whole day including night is a bad habit which is to be avoided. Concentration and memorization of short notes under each topics/subjects would benefit. He needs a full sleep during the whole night. Getting ready with necessary documents and materials and being present at the centre in time, with calm mind, is very important on the examination day. Then the child can relax for sometime before exam starts. The child should be aware how to perform answering process during examination. Rushing through the question paper in a hurry is not advisable. S/he should take time to read through the instructions and questions carefully several times. Then to follow the instructions properly and select questions that s/he could answer best. Start answering the easiest question first and rather difficult one last. In order for success, child must answer fully all the required number of questions in each paper. Equal allocation of time for each question is very important. Finally, s/he need to save few minutes to go through answer scripts before handing over.
For successful exam performance, discourage children from discussing foregone papers and concentrate on the next one.
Parent’s role is to educate and facilitate children on these revision techniques and stress management methods, encourage them to get used to. Exam panic and worries can accordingly be reduced to a greater extent and perform at the examination well.
