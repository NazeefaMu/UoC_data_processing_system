Croatia beat Russia on penalties
	
Russia's remarkable World Cup run ended in a heart-breaking quarter-final defeat on penalties as Croatia bounced back from a late extra-time equaliser to set up a last-four meeting with England.
Defender Mario Fernandes, who had brought his side level through a header in the 115th-minute, missed what proved to be the decisive spot-kick, with Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic making no mistake as he ended the hosts' remarkable run at this tournament.
Immediately after his penalty went in Rakitic was mobbed by his team-mates - in repeat scenes of Croatia's last-16 shootout victory over Denmark.
Despite defeat, the home fans broke into heartfelt applause as they cheered their beaten side long and loud after the final whistle in recognition of their achievements against the odds.
Brazil-born defender Fernandes' miss - blazed low and wide of the post - was the second of two failed Russian spot-kicks.
Fedor Smolov missed the first with a weak Panenka effort that was easily stopped by Danijel Subasic, while opposite number Igor Akinfeev stopped one - a fabulous low save from Mateo Kovacic.
But in the end that was irrelevant. As was the stunning goal that gave Russia the lead in this, their first quarter-final appearance since 1970 and the days of the Soviet Union.
That came through a Denis Cheryshev first-half curler from outside the box, his fourth goal of the tournament and one of the finest at this World Cup.
But only eight minutes later an Andrej Kramaric header amid slack marking brought Croatia level, and after the break Ivan Perisic saw a low shot crash against the post and out across the face of goal as Zlatko Dalic's side began to control the game.
Yet they only led for the first time when Domagoj Vida's header found its way into the net through a crowd of players in the first half of extra time.
And after Fernandes' late equaliser from Alan Dzagoev's free-kick - the midfielder was making his first appearance as a substitute since suffering injury in Russia's opening game - you felt the momentum would be with Russia.
But victory was Croatia's, and it means they emulate their great side of 1998, who were beaten in the semi-finals by eventual winners France 20 years ago.(BBC)

## Title: 126 woman inmates transferred from Welikada to Angunakolapelessa

126 woman inmates transferred from Welikada to Angunakolapelessa
	
126 woman inmates serving long-term or life sentences at the Welikada Prison had been transferred to the new high-tech prison complex constructed in Angunakolapelessa, Commissioner General of Prisons H.M.N.C. Dhanasinghe said.
He said that considering the heavy traffic inside Welikada, the prison authorities had taken the measure.
However, the relatives of the inmates, who were unhappy about the transfer, told the Daily Mirror that they would face inconveniences such as travel issues when visiting the inmates.
Responding to the issue Commissioner General Dhanasinghe stated that although the transfer would inconvenience the relatives of the inmates, it would benefit the inmates, as their comforts would be upgraded at the Angunakolapelessa Complex, with its high standards.
Woman inmates had to undergo severe inconveniences as there was no hospital for them at the Welikada to undergo in-house treatments, the Commissioner said.
However, the Angunakolapelessa Prison is equipped with a modern hospital, which provides women inmates with high standard medical facilities, up to treatment at OPD level, he said.
According to Mr Dhanasinghe, the Welikada Prison had a capacity to hold about 300 women inmates but at present, there were about 700 inmates.
There were only fewer than ten woman inmates at the Angunakolapelessa Prison and is capable of housing about 300 inmates, he said.
In 2014 February the then Speaker of the House Chamal Rajapaksa laid the foundation stone for a modern prison facility in Angunakolapelessa and it was declared opened in October 2017.
The Angunakolapelessa Prison complex is the countrys only modern prison that meets the international standards.
The Ministry of Prison Reforms recently said the Angunakolapelessa prison complex would house most notorious criminals of the country.
The prison complex is equipped with many facilities for aquatic, indoor and outdoor recreation and a number of vocational centres for skills development. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
