Where is genuine freedom? FSP


	

The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) today questioned whether there was genuine freedom in the country as pledged by the ‘Good Governance’ and said the freedom had become a privilege limited to the accomplices of the Government.


Staging a protest in Pettah (Colombo), the FSP said the government came into power promising to take action on the incidents such as the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, political activists Lalith and Kugan and the murder of newspaper editor Lasantha Wickrematunge but it had not delivered justice to any of these incidents so far.


FSP Central Committee Member Duminda Nagamuwa said both the President and the Prime Minster had previously promised to release political prisoners but they had failed to do so after coming to power.


“Now the government says that there are no political prisoners and they have been arrested on charges of terrorism. Yahapalanaya assured that there will be no political victimization but today they have arrested our member, Kumar Gunaratnum, only because he voiced against the government’s opinion. He is a political prisoner today,” Mr. Nagamuwa told Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
