A small group of political big guns had recently held a secret conference at the residential premises of a certain Devalaya. 
A former political leader, his sibling and two Diyawanna members from the Colombo district had attended this conference. 
At this conference, the sibling of the former political leader had briefed the others on the steps being taken on forming a new political party. 
It had also transpired during the discussion that several Green party stalwarts and a group of Red party organisers led by that party’s former leader were expected to join the new political party.
