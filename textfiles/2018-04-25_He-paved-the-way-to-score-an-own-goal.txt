There is a leading businessman connected to a very high political family who played an important mediator role in a bid to ensure the passage of the recent no confidence motion, they say. 

 


It is a well-known secret that it was this businessman who was the livewire behind bringing about a rapprochement between Number One and the former strongman. 


The JO stalwarts charge that this businessman misled the former strongman into believing that the success of the no-confidence motion was a cinch. “All stories this businessman had been telling our Lokka proved fairy tales at the end,” a JO front-liner said. 


The former strongman had been looking for the businessman following the defeat of the motion to give him a mouthful, but the man had gone into oblivion ever since the event, they say.
