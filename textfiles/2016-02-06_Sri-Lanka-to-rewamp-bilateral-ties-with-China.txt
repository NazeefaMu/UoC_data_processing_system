In a bid to revamp bilateral ties with China, two ministers will visit that country during the end of this month to hold talks with the Chinese leaders on all aspects of bilateral relations including matters pertaining to the presently stalled Colombo Port City Project, it is learnt.

Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake will leave for China on February 9 on a four-day visit. It will be followed with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visiting China on a later date.

Mr. Samarawickrama said he and Mr. Ratnayake would also work out preliminary arrangements for the Prime Minister’s visit. In addition to bilateral discussions with Chinese government officials, he said there would be talks with the officials of the Export-Import Bank of China to strengthen financial cooperation between the two countries.

Mr. Samarawickrama said discussions would focus on the proposed Free Trade Agreement with China and the Chinese-funded projects in Sri Lanka including the port city project.

The US$1.4 billion dollar Colombo Port City Project, the largest Chinese investment in Sri Lanka, was launched by the previous government in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping . However, the new government, formed after January 9 last year, suspended the project funded by the China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC) after concerns were raised over some matters connected to the project.

Meanwhile, the new government has recently hinted that it would give its nod to the project. During the previous regime, China invested heavily in Sri Lanka’s infrastructure projects. (Kelum Bandara)
