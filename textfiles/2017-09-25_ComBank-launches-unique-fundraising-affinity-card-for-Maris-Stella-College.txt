Commercial Bank of Ceylon has launched a co-branded credit card with Maris Stella College, Negombo, in a collaboration that will help raise funds for the 95-year old school.


The customised affinity card will be available in the Platinum and Gold tiers to members of the Maris Stella College Old Boys’ Association (OBA) and the bank will contribute half the annual fee of each card, as well as a percentage on every transaction conducted with the cards, the bank said.


The bank said it will also waive the joining fee and offer a host of connected features free of charge. This includes free SMS alerts on transactions, free Internet banking, free e statements and free use of the bank’s mobile app.


Additionally, the holders of the Commercial Bank – Maris Stella College affinity card would be eligible to benefits under the Combank Max Loyalty Rewards programme, the only loyalty scheme in Sri Lanka that offers loyalty rewards points on both credit and debit cards.


“This partnership is a great example of how an affinity card can be used to support a worthy cause while promoting the convenience it represents,” Commercial Bank Head of Card Centre Thusitha Suraweera said.


“We expect this affinity card to make a meaningful contribution to Maris Stella College’s fundraising efforts, since it provides an easy way for old boys to contribute towards the development of their alma mater.”


Commercial Bank cards are the fastest growing cards in Sri Lanka and enjoy market leadership in credit and debit card cumulative point-of-sale usage. The bank offers a variety of credit cards in the Silver, Gold and Platinum tiers of both Visa and MasterCard as well as Visa Signature, World MasterCard and Visa Infinite cards in the premium segment. The cards are equipped with ‘Tap & Go’ NFC technology and are backed by a strong NFC point-of-sale (POS) network.
