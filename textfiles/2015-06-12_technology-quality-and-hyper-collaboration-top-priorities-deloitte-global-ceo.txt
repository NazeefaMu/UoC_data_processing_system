Punit Renjen took the helm Monday as the new Chief Executive Officer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited (Deloitte Global) and defined the global organisation’s priorities, led by driving a shared sense of purpose across a network operating in more than 150 countries with more than 220,000 people.
“All of Deloitte’s stakeholders – clients, colleagues and the communities in which we work – expect us to make an impact that matters for them,” said Renjen. “That means we must commit to achieving clear leadership in critical areas through very focused priorities.”
Renjen framed a set of strategic priorities, including increasing investment to apply leading technology to serve clients across core businesses of audit, tax, consulting, enterprise risk and financial advisory services. Other top priorities include setting the standard for quality around the world, employing “hyper collaboration” among the network’s member firms to deliver global capabilities tailored to local needs and creating a distinct development experience to attract and inspire talent.
In addition to driving delivery of exceptional core services to clients across a range of industry sectors, Renjen plans to grow the Deloitte network’s capabilities in areas such as cognitive technologies, cloud computing, digital and social applications, cyber, risk and crisis services.
“Advanced technology is changing the way clients do business, and maintaining our lead in capabilities is crucial to help them navigate that change,” said Renjen. “In addition, we are committed to building and maintaining trust in capital markets and confidence in business institutions. We will do this by combining insights and innovation to deliver fully integrated tax services, world-class innovation in audit and consulting services that deliver measurable impact.”
Linking a company’s core activities to a greater sense of purpose has long been a passion for Renjen. Noted Renjen, “Increasingly, companies are seeking ways to integrate social impact into their core business, rather than relying on corporate citizenship programmes alone. This positive trend will help drive a sense of purpose; however, it is important businesses take a broad view when thinking about impact to include clients and employees, in addition to affecting the communities in which they work and live.”
SJMS Associates represents Deloitte in Sri Lanka as an independent correspondent firm that provides services that assist the growth and competitiveness of businesses, including assurance and advisory, tax and financial advisory services, consulting, restructure and corporate recovery services.
