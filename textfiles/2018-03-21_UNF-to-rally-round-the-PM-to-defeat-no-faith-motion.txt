UNF ministers, state ministers, deputy ministers and parliamentarians, at a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in the chair, unanimously decided to confront and counter the JO-sponsored no-confidence motion against him, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister, Gayantha Karunatilaka said.

He said State Ministers Wasantha Senanayake and Palitha Range Bandara had also agreed to the decision arrived at and would vote against the motion if it was presented in Parliament.

Ministers Rajitha Senaratne and Champika Ranawaka raised this matter at yesterday’s Cabinet meeting and underscored the fact that the government should not fall prey to the conspiracies hatched by the JO and collectively confront and counter them.

“We are confident that the joint opposition will be unable able to collect the minimum number of 113 votes to pass the no-confidence motion. I personally feel they will not even get anywhere near,” Minister Karunatilaka told Daily Mirror.

He said the three reports on the restructuring and reorganization of the UNP would be presented to the Working Committee this weekend and would be implemented with any amendments.

Meanwhile, a senior SLFP minister told Daily Mirror the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe might be handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today.

“However, we are determined to protect Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe,” he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
