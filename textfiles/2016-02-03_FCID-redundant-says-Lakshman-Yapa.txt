The procedures of the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) were not clear, the State Finance Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said today.

While addressing a media briefing the minister said, there were several financial fraud investigations in progress. 

“President Maithripala Sirisena has empowered the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), while the Police Commission had been appointed and it had been given independent powers as well. These two Commissions are enough to conduct these investigations,” the Minister said.

“Institutions have now being established to investigate on bribery and corruption in a fair manner. It is better to not to go with instant procedures like the FCID investigations, which may create wrong public opinion.

“There are specified procedures for investigations and the procedures should be communicated to the public in a proper way and we already have Government approved procedures,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
