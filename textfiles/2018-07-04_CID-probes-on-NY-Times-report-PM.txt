Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today following a complaint lodged by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had launched an investigation into the article appeared on New York Times that at least US$7.6 million was dispensed from China Harbour’s account at Standard Chartered Bank to affiliates of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s election campaign.

In response to a question raised by UNP MP S.M. Marikkar, whether the Government would appoint a Commission and investigate the allegation made by the article, the Premier said the Police had handed over the investigations to the CID and that necessary action would be taken after the investigations were concluded.

Mr Wickremesinghe said New York Times had claimed that its journalists had been threatened and added that it was a disgrace to the country's image and demanded that such threats should be withdrawn.

The Premier said the Joint Opposition resorted to violent and indecent behaviour disrupting Parliamentary affairs on Tuesday with a view to suppress the allegation made by the New York Times. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
