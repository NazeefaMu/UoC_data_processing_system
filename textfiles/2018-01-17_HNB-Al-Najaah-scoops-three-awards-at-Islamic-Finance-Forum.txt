Hatton National Bank’s Islamic Banking product, Al Najaah won three accolades at the recently concluded Islamic Finance Forum, South Asia (IFFSA) awards night, competing against Islamic Banking giants from Pakistan, Kuwait, Bangladesh and Maldives.


The two Silvers and one Bronze awards were won for ‘Islamic Financing Entity ’, ‘Islamic Window’ and ‘Islamic Finance Deal of the year’ for 2017.


Head of HNB’s Al Najaah, Hisham Ally collected the awards at a glittering ceremony in Colombo. The awards night was the culmination of the day long IFFSA conference under the theme ‘Cooperation, Consolidation, Concentration’ which saw industry leaders and experts deliberating on a multitude of contemporary issues with a focus on South Asia.


Held for the second successive year, IFFSA recognises the contributions made by individuals and institutions to the international banking and finance industry in the South Asian Region. Upbeat on the win, Hisham Ally who heads the Al Najaah team, emphasised the importance of great team-work in achieving such awards. “To compete and win against Islamic banks operating in large Islamic countries and to win is such a feat that could be achieved only with dedicated effort. All thanks go to my wonderful co-workers,” he stressed.


Notably, HNB’s Al Najaah, launched in 2012 has enjoyed an upward streak in its five year journey, winning several awards and accolades and firmly establishing itself as a strong entity not only in the Capital, Colombo but in the Central and Eastern provinces where it enjoys a large customer base. 


Corporate Banking DGM Ruwan Manatunga reiterated the importance of having a veteran banker such as Ally, to lead the energetic team and achieve success in a short period of time.


HNB now has a dedicated customer centre for Islamic Banking business, which serves all customers and renders all banking operations. Located on Marine Drive in Colombo 3, the centre comes with facilities such as cash operations, remittances, ATMs (including cash deposit option) and ample vehicle parking space. The center operates like a normal branch office of HNB, serving customers across the length and breadth of this country.
