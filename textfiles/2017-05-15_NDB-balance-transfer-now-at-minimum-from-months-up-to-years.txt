NDB balance transfer now at 2.5% minimum from 3 months up to 5 years


	

NDB introduced its credit card balance transfer option earlier this year to support you from overcoming your credit card balances through attractive interest rates.  NDB has continued to successfully offer options of choosing your own repayment period in equal instalments from three months and now up to five years. 
NDB is the only bank to offer this option for as long as 60 months. The one-time upfront fees start from as lowest as 2.50 percent and the upfront fee would be charged on day one on the amount transferred and no other charges/interest would be levied. This option will be beneficial especially during this time where consumers are most likely to be overwhelmed by credit card bills due to seasonal spends.
April deliberately becomes the month of expressing joy and spending time with family and friends but often resulting in severely stretched finances with credit card bills hitting record highs. The natural inclination to ‘buy now, pay later’ is quite standard during the festive seasons, up until it becomes reckless and financially pressured due to post spends.
However, using credit cards is of absolute convenience and offers great benefits if used responsibly. Therefore, it is advisable to stick to a planned budget, which would stop you from overspending and by making an effort to pay your credit card balance on time, in full to avoid additional charges piling. There are many ways of getting the most from your credit card rather than having to face unwanted financial pressure. Hence, developing good financial habits and understanding the purpose of your credit card is imperative. 
Applications for NDB ‘Good Life’ credit cards could be made at any one of the NDB branches islandwide.
