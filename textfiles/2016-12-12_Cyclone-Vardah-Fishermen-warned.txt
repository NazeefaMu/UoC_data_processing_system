The Meteorology Department today warned the naval and fishing communities living by the Northern, North-eastern and Gulf of Mannar sea areas to refrain from engaging in naval and fishing activities today due to the severe cyclonic storm “Vardah” which is located about 400 km away from Kankasanturai coast

The cyclone is likely to move westward towards India, the Department said. 

“Due to the influence of the cyclone, strong winds about 100-120 kmph, rough seas and heavy showers are expected within 200-300 away from Kankasanturai. Sea conditions are not suitable for fishing and naval activities and it is very risky and dangerous,” it said. 

The Department said there is no direct effect from the cyclone for the land area of the country.
