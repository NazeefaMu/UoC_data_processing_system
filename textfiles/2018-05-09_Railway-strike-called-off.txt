The strike by railway unions demanding the government rectify salary anomalies was called off with immediate effect an hour after it was launched today.

Convener for the Collective of Railway Trade Unions, Janaka Fernanado, said the decision was made after Minister Sarath Amunugama spoke to union leaders over the phone.

“He confirmed that our issue was taken up at the cabinet meeting,” Fernando said.

The strike was launched at 11.40 a.m but was called off after 12.30 p.m soon after the Minister called. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
