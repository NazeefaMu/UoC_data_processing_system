PSSL is the oldest photographic society in Sri Lanka and this annual event had been conducted for more than 61 years consecutively. With a rich history traced back to the year 1906, when the Amateur Photographic Society of Ceylon was formed by Henry Lorenz Wendt, the father of Lionel Wendt - lawyer, artist, pianist and photographer, the Society has continued to be at the pinnacle of photographic activities in Sri Lanka throughout. The Society was revived in 1934 as the Photographic Society of Ceylon at the residence of Lionel Wendt, who continued the work begun by his father, along with a small group of enthusiasts interested in pictorial photography. The Society is housed at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre since the 1950’s, thus becoming the only society of photography in Sri Lanka, having its own studio, office and darkroom facilities. With a membership of close to 400 photography enthusiasts from various walks of life, the PSSL has numerous initiatives for member engagement such as specialty workshops and photographic excursions. The Certificate in Applied Photography (CAP) continues to be offered by the Society to all those interested in gaining a basic understanding of photography. A large number of CAP participants have emerged as award winning photographers both locally and internationally.
