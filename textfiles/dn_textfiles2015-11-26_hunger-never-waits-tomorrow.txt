Hunger never waits for a tomorrow

The international community has embraced a new goal, the eradication of hunger by 2030. A majority of the countries FAO monitors—72 of 129—have achieved the Millennium Development Goal target of halving the prevalence of undernourishment between 1991 and 2014. More than 600 million people are still likely to be hungry in 2030. Some 800 million people continue to suffer hunger, and almost a billion live in extreme poverty.
Feeding the world
By 2050 we’ll need to feed two billion more people without overwhelming the planet? Agriculture is among the greatest contributors to global warming, emitting more greenhouse gases than all our cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes combined—largely from methane released by cattle and rice farms, nitrous oxide from fertilized fields, and carbon dioxide from the cutting of rain forests to grow crops or raise livestock, accelerates the loss of biodiversity. As we’ve cleared areas of grassland and forest for farms, we’ve lost crucial habitat, making agriculture a major driver of wildlife extinction, pitting conventional agriculture and global commerce against local food systems and organic farms.

How can the world double the availability of food while simultaneously cutting the environmental harm caused by agriculture? Jonathan Foley in the National Geographic has provided ideas.
Step one: Freeze agriculture’s footprint
Agriculture’s footprint has caused the loss of whole ecosystems around the globe, including the prairies of North America and the Atlantic forest of Brazil, and tropical forests continue to be cleared at alarming rates with most of the land cleared used to produce cattle, soybeans for livestock, timber, and palm oil.
Step two: Grow more on existing farms
Nearly all new food production in the next 25 years will have to come from existing agricultural land. Only 55 percent of food-crop calories directly nourish people. Meat, dairy, and eggs from animals raised on feed supply another 4 percent. Improving nutrient and water supplies where yields are lowest could result in a 58 percent increase in global food production.
Step three: Use resources more efficiently
Nature’s own water filters, giant Japanese scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off Canada’s Vancouver Island. The farm also uses sea cucumbers and kelp to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish.
Finding innovative ways to better target the application of fertilizers and pesticides by using computerized tractors equipped with advanced sensors and GPS, applying customized blends of fertilizer tailored to their exact soil conditions, which helps minimize the runoff of chemicals into nearby waterways. Organic farming can also greatly reduce the use of water and chemicals—by incorporating cover crops, mulches, and compost to improve soil quality, conserve water, and build up nutrients. And replacing inefficient irrigation systems with more precise methods, like subsurface drip irrigation. Advances in both conventional and organic farming can give us more “crop per drop” from our water and nutrients.
Step four: Shift diets
It would be far easier to feed nine billion people by 2050 if more of the crops we grew ended up in human stomachs. Today only 55 percent of the world’s crop calories feed people directly; the rest are fed to livestock (about 36 percent) or turned into biofuels and industrial products (roughly 9 percent). Though many of us consume meat, dairy, and eggs from animals raised on feedlots, only a fraction of the calories in feed given to livestock make their way into the meat and milk that we consume. For every 100 calories of grain we feed animals, we get only about 40 new calories of milk, 22 calories of eggs, 12 of chicken, 10 of pork, or 3 of beef. Finding more efficient ways to grow meat and shifting to less meat-intensive diets—even just switching from grain-fed beef to meats like chicken, pork, or pasture-raised beef—could free up substantial amounts of food across the world.
Because people in developing countries are unlikely to eat less meat in the near future, given their new found prosperity, we can first focus on countries that already have meat-rich diets. Curtailing the use of food crops for biofuels could also go a long way toward enhancing food availability. By 2050 the world’s population will likely to increase by more than 35 percent. To feed that population, crop production will need to double.
Step five: Reduce waste
An estimated 25 percent of the world’s food calories and up to 50 percent of total food weight are lost or wasted before they can be consumed. In rich countries most of that waste occurs in homes, restaurants, or supermarkets.
In poor countries food is often lost between the farmer and the market, due to unreliable storage and transportation. Consumers in the developed world could reduce waste by taking such simple steps as serving smaller portions, eating leftovers, and encouraging cafeterias, restaurants, and supermarkets to develop waste-reducing measures. Of all of the options for boosting food availability, tackling waste would be one of the most effective.
Taken together, these five steps could more than double the world’s food supplies and dramatically cut the environmental impact of agriculture worldwide. But it won’t be easy. These solutions require a big shift in thinking. We need to find a balance between producing more food and sustaining the planet for future generations.
The evolution of aquaculture
The world now produces more farmed fish than beef. Aquaculture has expanded 14 fold since 1980. Farmers are growing everything from premium salmon to humble sea cucumbers. And last year, consumption of farmed fish exceeded consumption of wild fish for the first time, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.
How to farm a better fish
Aquaculture has expanded about 14-fold since 1980. In 2012 its global output, from silvery salmon to sea cucumbers, reached more than 70 million tons - exceeding beef production clearly for the first time and amounting to nearly half of all fish and shellfish consumed on earth.

Population growth, income growth, and seafood’s heart-healthy reputation are expected to drive up demand by 35 percent or more in just the next 20 years. With the global catch of wild fish stagnant, experts say virtually all of that new seafood will have to be farmed.

Whether you’re raising fish in an offshore cage or in a filtered tank on land, you still have to feed them. They have one big advantage over land animals: You have to feed them a lot less.
Fish need fewer calories, because they’re cold-blooded and because, living in a buoyant environment, they don’t fight gravity as much. It takes roughly a pound of feed to produce a pound of farmed fish; it takes almost two pounds of feed to produce a pound of chicken, about three for a pound of pork, and about seven for a pound of beef. As a source of animal protein that can meet the needs of nine billion people with the least demand on earth’s resources, aquaculture—particularly for omnivores like tilapia, carp, and catfish—looks like a good bet.
Pounds for pound
Different sources of animal protein in our diet place different demands on natural resources. One measure of this is the “feed conversion ratio”: an estimate of the feed required to gain one pound of body mass. By this measure, farming salmon is about seven times more efficient than raising beef.
Fish farmers have been getting more efficient, farming omnivorous fish like tilapia and using feeds that contain soybeans and other grains; salmon feed these days is typically no more than 10 percent fish meal.
The amount of forage fish used per pound of output has fallen by roughly 80 percent from what it was 15 years ago. It could fall a lot further, says Rick Barrows, who has been developing fish feeds at his U.S. Department of Agriculture lab in Bozeman, Montana, for the past three decades. “Fish don’t require fish meal,” says Barrows. “They require nutrients. We’ve been feeding mostly vegetarian diets to rainbow trout for 12 years now. Aquaculture could get out of fish meal today if it wanted to.”
Replacing fish oil remains trickier, because it carries prized omega-3 fatty acids. In the sea they’re made by algae, then passed up the food chain, accumulating in higher concentrations along the way.
Some feed companies are already extracting omega-3s directly from algae—the process used to make omega-3 for eggs and orange juice. An even quicker fix, Stanford’s Rosamond Naylor says, would be to genetically modify canola oil to produce high levels of omega-3s.
Farming soars as wild catches stall
With demand rising and many marine fish stocks already overfished, nearly half of all seafood now comes from aquaculture, which has grown at a double-digit clip for decades. Most of the growth is in Asia, home to 90 percent of fish farms. China, the world leader, imports additional fish to make fish oil, fish food, and other products.
