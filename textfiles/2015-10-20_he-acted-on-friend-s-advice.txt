He acted on friend’s advice!


	


This former Diyawanna member recently created a sensation in political circles when he suddenly made several allegations against the former strongman whom he earlier treated as his mentor. He did not spare the other members of the former royal family either. 
However, the politico made a follow-up statement which was an obvious attempt to undo the damage caused by his attack. This made certain inquisitive ones to make inquiries as to why he had suddenly gone soft on his mentor again.  And they soon discovered that a certain Diyawanna member from the hills, another die-hard follower of the former strongman had prevailed on his colleague to make a retraction. 
However, the special security provided by the authorities to the former Diyawanna member soon after turning his guns on the former strongman is yet to be withdrawn, they say.
