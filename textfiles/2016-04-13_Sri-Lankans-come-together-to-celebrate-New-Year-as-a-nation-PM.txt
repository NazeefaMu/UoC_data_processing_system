Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his message for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year said that, this year, Sri Lankans come together to celebrate the Sinhala & Tamil New Year as a nation in which democracy reigns and human dignity is respected; where people of all ethnicities and religious backgrounds are free to rejoice during a season of fellowship, hope and unity.

“As always, the Sinhala & Tamil New Year presents a wonderful opportunity for families and friends to spend time together in a spirit of renewal and new beginnings. Today, we can celebrate the New Year as citizens of a free country while upholding the strongest democratic principles – I am grateful to those who made it all possible.

As the New Year dawns, let us remind ourselves that we have challenging but achievable tasks before us; let us work towards making a significant economic and social transformation to herald in prosperity for all.

I wish all Sri Lankans a prosperous Sinhala & Tamil New Year.”
