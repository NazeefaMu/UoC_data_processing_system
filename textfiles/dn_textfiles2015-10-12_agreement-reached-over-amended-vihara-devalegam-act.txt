Agreement reached over amended Vihara Devalegam Act


An agreement has been reached regarding the amended Vihara Devalegam Act in consultation with the Supreme Sangha Sabha led by the Most Ven. Tibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
He was speaking to the media after discussions with the Karaka Sangha Sabha led by the Malwatte Prelate at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy on October 10.
Minister Rajapakshe said the Vihara Devalegam Act formulated in 1931 had several outdated clauses.
No conclusive decision had been reached up to date although it had been a subject of discussion for the last 10 years or so, he said.
Malwatte Chapter Lekakhadhikari Ven. Pahamune Sumangala Nayaka Thera told the media that although there were problems regarding the Vihara Devalegam Act they were able to reach an agreement because these problems had been resolved.
He said although they had discussions with the former President too regarding the Bim Saviya Act they could not reach an agreement as to how it would impart on the
Vihara Devalegam Act.
But those misgivings were overcome during discussions with Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksha on October 10, he said.
Buddhasasana Ministry Secretary Vasantha Ekanayake and Buddhist Affairs Commissioner Chandraprema Gamage were also present.
