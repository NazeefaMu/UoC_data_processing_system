Elvis stays top of UK album charts

He may have only ever set foot in the UK fleetingly at Prestwick Airport – but Elvis mania is once again sweeping across the nation.
Elvis, the undisputed King of Rock N’ Roll, has secured a second week at the top of the official UK album charts, with ‘If I Can Dream: Elvis Presley with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra’.
The album - released by Sony Music Entertainment - sold 88,603 in its second week of release.
That was 9,550 MORE copies than it sold in its first week. That made it the first album to debut at No1 and then sell more copies in its second week on sale for three-and-a-half years (Gary Barlow/Commonwealth Band’s Sing, May 2012).
It also saw The King beat off the Fab Four, with The Beatles’ 1 landing at No5 in the album charts.
Elvis’ album has now sold a total of 167,656 copies in just two weeks of release – and is already certified gold.
Executive producer Priscilla Presley said: “I have been truly humbled by the reaction to this record in the UK. I know that Elvis always held the fans in the UK with great affection. He would have been thrilled with both this record and to know that, even now, he has so many fans on this side of the Atlantic.” Elvis is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, having sold – astonishingly - more than ONE BILLION records worldwide.
