HSBC launches seasonal campaign ‘Un-Worry’


	

This festive season, HSBC is requesting all customers to ‘Un-Worry’ their season as the bank is offering existing customers multiple savings with zero-percent plus installment plans, 10 million rupees in cash back rewards and zero-percent cash installment plans of up to 100,000 Rupees for customers who apply for any new HSBC credit card until 31 December.


Retail Banking and Wealth Management Country Head Nadeesha Senaratne said: “We understand that the festive season is a month of high expenses, as there is so much to get done before the new year. The season is not just for those celebrating this time, but for everyone and you should not have to hold back on those special moments with your loved ones. We want customers to make the most of this time by spending on anything they want, where ever they want without having to worry about the finances to fund it. Thus, in the spirit of giving, we are happy to offer multiple savings with zero-percent plus installment plans and cash back rewards as well as a zero-percent cash installment plan of up to 100,000 Rupees which works as a cash advance. So Cardholders can stop worrying and start celebrating with some extra cash in their pocket 
this season.”


HSBC’s cash installment plan is offered to customers who apply for an HSBC credit card to be able to expand their holiday celebrations with family and friends and spend on anything they want, be it shopping, holidaying, special celebrations or planning for the new year. The cash installment plan is payable in 12 monthly installments for approved credit cards and is actually a saving, with no hidden charges.


Similar to a salary advance, the card installment facility would be credited to the customer’s existing HSBC account following the credit card approval and for the new-to-bank customers who don’t maintain a HSBC account, the funds would be sent via a cashiers order to the customer’s home for encashment at the customer’s convenience.


Additionally, cardholders can enjoy up to 10 million worth of cash back rewards until 24 December 2017. Cardholders who swipe their credit card for an accumulated spend of 3,000 Rupees with a minimum of three transactions during the week, will be eligible for a cash back reward of Rupees 1,000. Each week 1000 lucky winners will be awarded, throughout 
the promotion.


Through the banks ongoing zero-percent plus offer, existing cardholders can celebrate the festive season in decadence by shopping for household goods, jewellery and accessories, or even buy insurance policies and holiday packages at a number of retail outlets. They could convert their spending into zero-percent plans for 12 months. Moreover, 1,100 cardholders will have their first installment waived off up to a maximum value of 5,000 Rupees during the promotion that is valid until 31 December 2017.


Cardholders can avail the zero-percent plus offer when they shop at Abans, Singhagiri, Singer, Softlogic and Softlogic Max or Damro showrooms, Vogue Jewellers, Raja Jewellers, Swarnamahal Jewellers, Bullion Exchange, Colombo Jewellery Store, Mallika Hemachandra Jewellers, W.A. De Silva and Co, or any registered Insurance Company and Airline or Travel Agent they choose to buy airline tickets or holiday packages.
