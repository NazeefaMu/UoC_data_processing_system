	Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera today said they are expecting UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein to visit Sri Lanka before the end of the year.
	The official invitation for High Commissioner Zeid to visit Sri Lanka was extended in February but no confirmation was made with regard to the dates of his visit.  Last year, during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit to Sri Lanka, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a joint statement, invited the UNHRC Chief to visit Sri Lanka within the year.
