The long awaited Positron Emission Tomography (PET) CT scanner which was purchased by public contribution was ceremonially handed over to Maharagama Apeksha Hospital by Kadijah Foundation President and the Fight Cancer Team (FCT) Founder Dr. M S H Mohamed today.

The high-tech state of the art machine which costs around Rs.202 million became a reality due to the contribution of 20 million people and the commitment of some 150 dedicated members of the Kadijah Foundation and the FCT.
Hundreds of people including the donors who supported were present at the Apeksha Hospital on foot in front of the Wellawatte Roxy Cinema via Nugegoda in a majestic parade showing the strength of the nation.

It was declared open by the hand of a small kid suffering from severe cancer. Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Apeksha Hospital staff also participated in the event. Pix by Lahiru Harshana
