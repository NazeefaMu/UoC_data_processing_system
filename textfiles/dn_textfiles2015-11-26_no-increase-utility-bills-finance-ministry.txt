No increase in utility bills - Finance Ministry

Electricity, water and telephone bills will not increase, the Finance Ministry emphasized. The increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed in the 2016 Budget will have no affect on the utility bills, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The blanket tax percentage of 11 percent charged at present has been re-bundled into three different tax categories, accordingly prices of a number of essential items will go down, he said.
All retail and bulk sale items which was previously charged VAT at 11 percent will be exempted from VAT according to the new system.
Accordingly prices of all items in the market should go down.
This is apart from prices of the 11 items which were reduced by the budget. Further water, electricity and telecommunication which are essential services provided to the public under government control will also be exempted from VAT, the minister said. Since there would be no VAT charged on these services, the rates of those services will not increase, the Finance Minister claimed.
The 11 percent VAT currently charged on all imported and locally produced items will be reduced to eight percent according to the new proposal, reducing the prices of imported goods as well.
Karunanayake emphasized that there is no truth in the argument presented by some that the price of commodities will increase due to the proposed increase in VAT charge.
