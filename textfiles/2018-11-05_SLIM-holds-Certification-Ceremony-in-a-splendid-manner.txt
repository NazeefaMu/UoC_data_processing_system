The Chief Guest Mr. Ruwan Liyanagamage, Director of Chisel Holdings (Pvt) Ltd and Past President of SLIM in his address noted that the Sri Lankan school system usually focuses on engineering, medicine and accountancy. However the competitive job market in the world has challenged this conventional thinking and has called for more disciplines in the education system. “So we should start gearing towards more professional qualifications in order to secure a good job.  Holding a Certification in Marketing will be a stepping stone for this world of professional qualifications hence this will open up a lot of opportunities for you and help you excel in your career,” he said. 

 

Mr. Dilith Jayaweera - Chairman TV Derana, the Guest of Honour, noted that, “SLIM, recognized as the national body of marketing in Sri Lanka is renowned for vast advances made over the years in the vital area of Marketing Education. So receiving an education from SLIM will be a badge of honour and your qualifications will be recognized anywhere in the world. I thank SLIM for taking the initiative in educating the country’s youth and providing a quality education in marketing for the present and future marketers in the country”

 

SLIM President, Mr. Pradeep Edward mentioned, “We take pride in educating Sri Lankans in marketing. In addition to providing high quality education in Marketing, we also train them to enhance their individuality by helping them recognize their skills and capabilities. Hence we focus not only on improving their education but also grooming quality marketers in the country. Further this year SLIM obtained both ISO 9001:2015 and ISO 29990:2010 certifications, which shows that SLIM ensures the highest standard of quality education to all our students”.

 

SLIM Vice President - Education, Mr. Suranjith Swaris said, “SLIM has humbly served the nation for the past 48 years by producing high quality Marketers in the country. We continue to provide marketing education by identifying more trends in marketing and adding more value to the fraternity through updated programmes and excellent delivery. The faith that the corporate sector has in SLIM is evident through the continuous requests for ‘tailor-made’ courses. We will continue to protect that faith and do what we do best – produce excellent Marketers to the marketing industry in the country.” 

 



 

SLIM CEO/Executive Director, Sanath Senanayake said that SLIM has reached the peak as a mentoring entity with endorsements from the Sri Lankan marketing fraternity that includes the corporate sector. “By taking the initiative in educating the marketing fraternity for the past 48 years, SLIM has been successful in placing Marketing as a key driver of economic growth.
