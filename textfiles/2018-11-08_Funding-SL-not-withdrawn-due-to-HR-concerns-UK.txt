The British Government had not withdrawn any funding to Sri Lanka due to human rights concerns between 2016-2019, State Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field has said.

In response to a question by Shadow Foreign SecretaryEmily Thornberry on Monday, the State Minister said they were committed to supporting the rebuilding of Sri Lanka following its long civil conflict.

“All funding provided to Sri Lanka through the Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund is designed to support reconciliation, the rule of law and improved human rights, and we are committed to supporting the rebuilding of the country following its long civil conflict,” he said.

He said he announced an additional £1m funding through the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) to support the resettlement of families displaced by war in the north and east of Sri Lanka in August. 

“In total, the UK is providing Sri Lanka with £7.9 million of Conflict, Stability and Security Fund funding over three years (2016-2019), including support for police reform, reconciliation and peacebuilding, and de-mining in the north of the country,” he said.
