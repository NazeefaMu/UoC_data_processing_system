PM to meet all TU representatives tomorrow

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to meet representatives of all trade unions on Saturday to discuss their concerns on the proposals in Budget 2016.
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne addressing the Cabinet press briefing at the Parliamentary complex yesterday, said the Prime Minister would consider the objections and proposals of the trade union activists during this meeting.
The minister made this observation in response to a question by a journalist on the Government's reaction to the growing protests and trade union actions against certain proposals in the Budget.
The minister observed the protesting trade unionists were those who supported the Government to come into power, adding that Trade Union Alliance Convener Saman Rathnapriya had made it clear that their aim was not to make it an anti-government protest , but to win their demands by pressing the Government.
The minister also said the Prime Minister held a discussion with all the Trade Union representatives on Wednesday on the budgetary proposals regarding the EPF and ETF. "During this discussion they praised the Prime Minister. Even SLFP trade union leader Leslie Devendra commended the opportunity given to them to raise their concerns on the Budgetary proposals. They were not against the proposal, but were of the opinion that these Funds must be managed under the Central Bank.
The Prime Minister told them to submit a report containing their own proposals, so that the Government could study it before coming into a conclusion. "We follow the Lichchavi principles and the existing matters will be resolved through negotiation.
The second round of talks will be held next Saturday" the minister said.
