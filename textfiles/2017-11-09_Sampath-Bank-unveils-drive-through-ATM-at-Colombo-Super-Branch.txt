Sampath Bank unveils drive-through ATM at Colombo Super Branch


	



In line with its commitment to providing the highest levels of service to its customers, Sampath Bank commissioned a drive-through automated teller machine (ATM) at its Colombo Super Branch premises, located at No: 103, Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 7.


The ATM was ceremonially unveiled by Sampath Bank Managing Director Nanda Fernando in the presence of the members of the bank’s corporate management, on November 7.


The drive-through ATM provides Sampath Bank customers with a host of services including cash withdrawals, cardless cash facility, credit card settlements, utility bill payments, mobile cash facilities, balance inquiries and many more. 


The customers of other banks too can withdraw cash at this ATM using their American Express, Cirrus, Diner’s Club, Mastercard, Maestro, Union Pay and Visa credit and debit cards.


Located securely within the branch premises, it provides an added layer of safety and convenience as the patrons of the ATM can drive in through a dedicated entry driveway and access its services from within their vehicles, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. This eliminates the need to park one’s vehicle, walk up to the ATM, complete the transaction and get back to the vehicle.
The new ATM joins Sampath Bank’s network of 387 ATMs around the island, which includes Sri Lanka’s first banking robot that works in the form of a humanoid teller that was unveiled at the bank’s head quarters branch recently.


Sampath Bank has strengthened this network further by joining LankaPay, the largest ATM network in the country, which enables customers to transact at over 3,000 ATMs islandwide.
