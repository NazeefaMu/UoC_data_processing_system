PM slams opponents of India trade deal as 'traitors'


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday branded as ‘traitors’ those opposed to a proposed trade deal with India, a day after the opposition criticised the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) as an attempt to "foreignise" the economy.

Speaking in southern Hambantota port, Wickremesinghe once again took on the trade union and other professional organisations. "Those who are against this are traitors because they want us not to find employment for the youth," he said.

Wickremesinghe said it was a misconception that the country would be flooded with Indians who would invade limited job opportunities in Sri Lanka in the IT sector. "In the previous CEPA deal there were provisions for goods services. Here we only seek technology and goods, no services," he said.

He said investment by the Chinese in Sri Lanka would be useless without having a vast market as that of India. "We need to tap into bigger markets to create employment. My government has the mandate to create jobs," he said. (DNA)
