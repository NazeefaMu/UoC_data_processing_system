A prominent Opposition politico created a stir in military circles recently, when he tried to forcibly enter an Army base in the North.

 

The politico had claimed that he had a right to enter an Army camp given his official status in the Opposition. However, Army authorities had refused him access to the camp as he had failed to obtain due permission in advance.

The Army authorities had reported this incident to Police. However, Police have called off further action on the matter on instructions from a high Police authority, they say.
