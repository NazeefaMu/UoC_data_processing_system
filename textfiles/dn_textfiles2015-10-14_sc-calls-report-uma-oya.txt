SC calls for report on Uma Oya

The Supreme Court directed the Attorney General to inform Court whether the government would take action to solve the hardships faced by the people due to the Uma Oya multi-purpose project, within one week.
The Supreme Court made this direction sequent to a fundamental rights petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice and four individuals, including M.D.P. Manatunga, residents of the Bandarawela area who have been victimized due to the Uma Oya multi purpose project.
The case was taken up for support by a thee-member bench, comprising Acting Chief Justice Eva Wanasundera, Priyantha Jayawardena and Anil Goonaratne.
Further hearing was fixed for October 23.
The petitioners claim that as a result of the Uma Oya project, not only have their homes and crops been destroyed, but they have lost access to clean drinking water, citing this as a violation of their fundamental rights.
Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, N. Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation and Agriculture, the Central Environment Authority and the Attorney General, have been named as respondents in the petition.
Attorney-at-Law Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the petitioners.
