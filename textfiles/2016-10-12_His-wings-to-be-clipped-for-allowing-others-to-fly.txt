His wings to be clipped for allowing others to fly


	



 

The chief purohita who arranged for a group of councilors to enjoy a holiday in Russia at public expense after pulling the wool over the eyes of the Big Boss and the governing one got a dressing-down from the ‘palace’ recently. 

 


The harangue from the palace that lasted for about 15 minutes had ended with the severe warning that any future move on his part involving the squandering of public funds would result in his wings being clipped. 


After receiving the warning call, the chief purohita had remained indoors for the rest of the day trying to recover from the shock.


Meanwhile, the group that left for Russia has returned home and the other group now sulking over the loss of their turn to go on the jaunt following the taboo slapped by the palace is said to be directing their ire at the chief purohita and the governing one in particular, they say.
