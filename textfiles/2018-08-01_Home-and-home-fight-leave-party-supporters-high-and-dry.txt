Home and home fight leave party supporters high and dry!


	



 

There is a big row raging between the gem-rich district’s Green Madam and a young Diyawanna Green one from the same district and most affected because of this row are the party loyalists from the latter’s constituency, they say.

 


The Green party supporters from all parts of the district including those from the young Diyawanna one’s electorate have made it a practice to approach the Madam seeking her intervention to get solutions to their problems or redress for their grievances. However, nowadays whenever party supporters from the young member’s electorate visit the Madam’s political office in the city, her aides would describe them to her as loyalists of her young rival. As a result, the Madam would ignore the requests made to her by such party supporters, they say. The Madam had turned her guns on the young Diyawanna member after hearing a tale that the latter had complained to the party leader that he was finding it difficult to work in cooperation with her adding that she was no longer welcome to his electorate.
