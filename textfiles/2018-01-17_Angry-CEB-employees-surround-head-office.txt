A tense situation reported at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) head office after several high ranking CEB officials, including its Chairman, were being detained by trade union members.

Ceylon Electricity Board Employees' Union Convener Ranjan Jayalal said the Chairman had neglected to pay the salary increment to employees despite it being a directive of the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyabalapitiya.

Mr. Jayalal said the increment was held back by Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda following a request made by the CEB Engineers unions, due to a long standing dispute.
