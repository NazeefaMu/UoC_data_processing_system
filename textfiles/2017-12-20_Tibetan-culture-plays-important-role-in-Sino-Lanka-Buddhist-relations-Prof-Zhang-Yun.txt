In the wake of criticism in the Western world against China on the situation in Tibet, a delegation of the Institute of History Studies and China Research Centre was in Sri Lanka to brief on the situation there. Director of the Center Prof. Zhang Yun said Buddhism was a major part of the Tibetan culture and that the Chinese Government took efforts to promote that culture as an integral part of Chinese society. International collaboration and academic exchange are key activities of the Chinese Tibetology Research Center. The Center has successfully held three international seminars for Tibetan studies. In 2001, about 220 scholars from 14 countries attended the Beijing International Seminar for Tibetan Studies.

There is distortion of truth by the Western media on the ground situation
	Buddhism has become an important and inalienable part of Chinese society
	We want Sri Lankan people to understand what we are doing in Tibet
Excerpts from the interview:

Q What is the real purpose of your visit to Sri Lanka?
Our delegation is a Tibetan cultural delegation. We came here as part of a Tibetan cultural exchange programme. Buddhism is a major part of the Tibetan culture. That is the background of this visit. Tibetan culture will play an important role in China- Sri Lanka Buddhist relations.

Q Your visit takes place in the backdrop of Western criticism against what is allegedly being done in Tibet. What is your view?
That is one of the main purposes of our visit this time. That is to introduce our Tibetan culture and introduce our policy on the religion. We want to introduce our policy on the freedom of religion. We want Sri Lankan people to understand what we are doing in Tibet. The perception, expressed by the Western media, has been fed by Tibetans in exile. Of course, there is a distortion of the truth about the ground situation in Tibet.

There was a famous temple in the western part of Sichuan province of China. It is also a Tibetan Buddhist temple. The Central Government of China is renovating it. The Western media have projected such renovation work in a different perspective. It contradicts our real purpose. We do it to preserve the Tibetan culture in that area. The Western countries, or the media for that matter, have distorted facts about such renovation work. In fact, it is projected as if we are destroying that culture.

Q How do you define religious freedom?
Everyone has the right to decide whether to believe in a religion or not. Everyone has the right to believe in whatever religion he or she likes. Also, everyone has the right to give up his or her religion. Anyone, hitherto remaining as non-religious, has also the right to embrace new religious belief. That is how we define religious freedom.



Q What is the importance of Buddhism to foster cultural ties between Sri Lanka and China?
Chinese monk Fa -Hien spent twelve years in India. He also came to Sri Lanka. By the time, he was more than 70 years old. He had the spirit to explore more and more about Buddhism. He had the spirit to explore different cultures in India and Sri Lanka. At the time of Fa-Hien in Sri Lanka, his vision was to study Vinaya Pitaka among other discourses.

He brought it to China from here and established order among monks there at that time. That is very important for the Chinese. There are historical cultural exchanges. Among them is the arrival of Fa-Hien monk.



Q In developing the Chinese identity, how important is Buddhism?
Throughout history, we have three kinds of doctrine dominating our society. One is the Confucianism. It is more about politics and daily life of people. The other two are Taoism and Buddhism. Taoism is China’s own religion. Buddhism came from India and played an important role in the Chinese culture. Buddhism has a lot of influence on the daily life of Chinese society. Buddhism has become an important and inalienable part of Chinese society.

Q What is your impression about Buddhism in Sri Lanka?
I do not know much about Sri Lankan Buddhism. But, I know it has had a lot of influence on people here in instilling discipline and harmony among people.
