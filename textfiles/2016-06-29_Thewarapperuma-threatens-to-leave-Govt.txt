Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Palitha Thewarapperuma said today that he would quit the Yahapalanaya Government, if the demands of Meegahathenna Primary School parents were not met.

The Deputy Minister and several parents of the students of the primary school had commenced a hunger strike since Monday (27) outside the Matugama Zonal Education Office, claiming that the authorities had failed to respond to their demands.

Mr. Thewarapperuma said that several parents had gone to the President’s Secretariat to discuss the matter.
“If there is Yahapalanaya, there wouldn’t be such a problem. If the President fails to fulfill the demands, I would leave the Yahapalanaya Government,” he said.
