President Maithripala Sirisena in Polonnaruwa yesterday (1) said that each member elected to the local bodies would receive a sum of Rs.5 million to carry out development work in their villages.

He added that their performances while utilising these funds would be scrutinised and if they have acted honestly without getting involved in acts of fraud they would be rewarded with double that amount which could be used to further develop their areas.

The President made these remarks at a meeting held after the vesting of a new 2-storey classroom building of the Girithale Janapada Junior School in the Hingurakgoda Education Zone at a cost of Rs 6 million allocated under the Re-awakening Polonnaruwa Development Programme of the government.
