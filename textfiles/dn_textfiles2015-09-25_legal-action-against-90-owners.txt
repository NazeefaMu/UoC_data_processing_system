Buses sans route permits on Northern line
Legal action against 90 owners

Legal action will be taken against owners of 90 buses operating between Colombo and Jaffna route and short distance routes within the Northern Province without route permits.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva instructed National Transport Commission (NTC) officers, the IGP and Police Chiefs in Vavuniya to inspect the buses and initiate legal action with immediate effect.
The minister made these remarks while visiting the construction site of a new bus terminal being built by the NTC at a cost of Rs. 200 million in Vavuniya.
De Silva said the Rs. 10,000 fine imposed on a bus plying without a route permit was not adequate.
"The fine should be increased to Rs. 100,000. The Amendment Bill in this connection will be presented to Parliament," the minister said.
He requested officials to inspect all buses using Vavuniya as the base.
It has been found that these buses belonging to politicians, public officers and wives of senior public officers operate on temporary route permits, the minister said.
The new bus terminal which has the state-of-the art facilities, can accommodate 34 buses at once and also provide facilities for the operation of around 100 buses plying between Jaffna and Colombo daily.
