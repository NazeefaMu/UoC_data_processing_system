The government will clarify in Parliament as to how the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technological Partnership (ILETP) differ from the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) once its finalized, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama told Parliament today.

Mr. Samarawickrama who was responding to an oral question raised by opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila, said it was not possible to the state as to how ILETP was going to differ from CEPA as the proposed agreement was yet to be finalised.


However the minister assured that the agreement would be favourable towards Sri Lanka. He said the total exports of countries such as Malaysia to India exceeded 7 billion USD while Sri Lanka's exports were Rs. 700 million USD. He said this situation will be taken into account before finalising the agreement.  (Yohan Perera)
