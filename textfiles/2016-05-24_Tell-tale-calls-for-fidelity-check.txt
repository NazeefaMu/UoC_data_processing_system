Tell-tale calls for fidelity check!


	



 

This better half of a former provincial purohita from a cool climate suspects the fidelity of her husband so much that she has made it a practice to check the incoming and outgoing calls registered on the latter’s mobile phone.

 


This politico, now a Diyawanna member, has made it a point to studiously delete all incoming and outgoing calls on his mobile phone before leaving the council for home after the day’s sittings.


On being inquired by a colleague about this regular practice, the Diyawanna member had replied: “Machang, the moment I enter home, my wife grabs my mobile phone and checks the calls I have made and received and am called upon to account for every such call… She makes my life the hell the day she finds one single suspicious call.”
