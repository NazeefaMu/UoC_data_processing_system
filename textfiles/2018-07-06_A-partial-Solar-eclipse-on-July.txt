A partial Solar eclipse on July 13


	

A partial Solar eclipse will occur in the 2nd quarter of Punawasa constellation in the Zodiacal sign of Gemini (Mithuna) beginning 07.16 hours (local time) on Friday July 13.

 

The greatest eclipse will occur at 08.32 hours.  It will be visible in parts of Southern Australia such as Melbourne, Stewart Island and Hobart.   A Solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun totally or partially obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. 


According to the ancient Indian Rishis it is inauspicious to start any important event in life or embark on any plan or program for that matter on the day of a Solar or Lunar eclipse and during the three days both preceding and following the day of the eclipse counting a total of seven days.


It is also the general opinion of the savants of Astrology that it is  inauspicious to commence any important event or plan during the running of either the Zodiacal sign or the constellation in which the eclipse occurs either on the day of the eclipse or within the seven days preceding or the following the day of the eclipse which add up to 15 days.
