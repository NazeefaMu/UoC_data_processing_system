Amid controversy over the opposition leader post in Parliament, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday staked its claim for the post saying that it was the single largest party outside the government in the House.
TNA leader R. Sampanthan told Daily Mirror that the United National Party (UNP), the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA), the Tamil National Alliance or Ilankai Tamil Arachu Katchchi(ITAK) , and the Democratic National Alliance(DNA) were the only four parties having parliamentary representation at the moment.
However, he said both the UNP and the UPFA had got together to form the new government and, therefore, the TNA with 13 MPs was the opposition party with the greatest number of members.
“Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) leader Dinesh Gunawardane cannot ask for it because his party contested under the betel symbol of the UPFA. The UPFA is part of the government now. So we are the largest party in the opposition,” he said.
However Mr. Sampanthan said it was a matter for Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa to decide on.
Already, moves are underway to secure the post for Mr. Gunawardane backed by a section of UPFA MPs.
The Speaker is expected to announce his ruling tomorrow.(KB)
