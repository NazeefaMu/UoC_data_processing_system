Harmonizing name value with birth-date value


	



 

We have so far discussed the significance of the basic numbers from 1 to 9 and that of the general numbers from 10 to 72. Now let us learn how to employ our knowledge acquired so far to adjust the name value with the birth-date value.  If the name value and the birth-date value are in harmony, well and good.  If they are not, we have to modify the name value to have it in harmony with the birth-date value.  Because we can change the name suitably, but we cannot change the birth-date. 

 

Take the case of a person born on 06.06.1974. His name is Ravinath Balawardhana. Being born on the 6th his life-path number or destiny number is 6. 

 

 

The numerical value of his name should be as follows:

 

 

R = 2 A = 1 V = 6  I =  1 N = 5

A = 1

T = 4

H = 5

     25

 

 

B = 2

A = 1

L = 3

A = 1 

W = 6

A = 1

R = 2

D = 4

H = 5

A = 1

N = 5

A = 1

     32

 

Grand total = 25+ 32 = 57

 

 

The numerical value that the name yields is 57.  According to the significance of this number we have already learnt in previous articles, the owner of the name is sociable and has pleasing manners.  He would achieve success in life due to persistent efforts and perseverance.

 

Here again the name value of 57 is good when it is reduced to the basic number we get 5 + 7 = 12 = 3 which is in harmony with the birth-date number. 

 

Next let us see whether the number of the name value vibrates in harmony with the destiny or the compound number.

 

The destiny number of the native should be 06.06.1974 =   6 + 6 + 1 + 9 + 7 + 4 = 3 + 3 = 6

In this case, we find that birth-date number destiny number and name value number are quite in harmony. 

 

Therefore, the native would enjoy the favourable results signified by the number 57 as quoted (in bold italic type) above. 

 

In the next article, let us discuss the case of  another person  whose name value  is not harmony with  the birth-date  to illustrate  how the name  has to be modified  to yield a  number which would produce favourable results.
