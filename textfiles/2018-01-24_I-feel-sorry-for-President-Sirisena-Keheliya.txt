Commenting on the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday, in which he made an appeal to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to give him the strength to punish rogues; Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella said yesterday that he felt sad for President Sirisena.

“It appears to me that the Premier is obstructing the President to conduct investigations against the culprits and bring them to book. 

“Moreover, there also seems to be confrontations between the Premier and the President. Therefore, it is impossible to govern the country when there are conflicts between the Head of the State and the Head of Government,” Rambukwella told a news conference.
