Moves and counter-moves


	



 

Several JO members who are skeptical about the blooming of Pohottuwa are said to be frequently visiting on the sly the political head of a Colombo-based diplomatic mission of a powerful Western country. 

 


At least two of them have assured the powerful diplomat that they are awaiting the most opportune time to switch sides.


One of these politicos pally with the diplomat is a talkative character from the South and the other is a stalwart from the central hills, they say. 


The JO bigwigs who had learnt about the conduct of the ‘renegades’ within their ranks had, in a tit for tat move, enticed several unhappy dissident government members for secret talks to brief them on the group’s plans for the future. The yahapalanaya high-ups who have got wise to the moves by the JO bigwigs have deployed NIS sleuths at strategic points to monitor all suspicious movements, they say.
