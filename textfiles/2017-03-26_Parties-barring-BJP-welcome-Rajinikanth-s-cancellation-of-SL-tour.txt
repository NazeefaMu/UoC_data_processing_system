Parties barring the BJP on Saturday welcomed the cancellation of super star Rajinikanth’s Sri Lankan trip to participate in a function to inaugurate 150 houses constructed by a private firm Lyca for island Tamils.

The three leaders mentioned in the statement of Rajinikanth-MDMK general secretary Vaiko, VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan and Thamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi leader T. Velmurugan- welcomed the cancellation, while state BJP state president Tamilisai Soundarrajan said the actor should not have cancelled the trip as his visit could have been a consolation to the Lankan Tamils.

Vaiko said he conveyed his objection to Rajinikanth through telephone as he did not want to politicize it. The actor had earlier planned to visit the island based on wrong information, he added. Welcoming the announcement, Thirumavalavan said Tamils all over the world felt that his visit could harm their interests, while Velmurugan thanked Rajini for his decision. AIADMK spokesperson Vaigaiselvan also thanked the actor for understanding the sentiments of Tamils, cancelling the visit.

Rajinikanth had cancelled the visit citing the opposition to it from political leaders. Although, he did not agree with their views, he accepted their affectionate requests.

He explained that he wanted to visit the Tamil areas where heroes lived and sacrificed their lives for their land and race. He also wanted to meet Tamil people and request Lankan president to find a solution to the attacks on Tamil Nadu fishermen, the actor had said.(Deccan Chronicle)
