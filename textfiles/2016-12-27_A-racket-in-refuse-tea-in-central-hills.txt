A racket in refuse tea in central hills!


	

It is illegal for anyone to store, transport or export refuse tea. However, complaints being received from foreign trade sources that some of our tea shipments have been found adulterated with refuse tea are galore.

 


By the way, a racket of procuring and storing refuse tea for exports is reportedly being operated with the connivance of two big cops in an area known for ‘Davul’ stones in the Central province. 


Teams sent by higher authorities several times to raid the dens had failed to nab the culprits as the ‘patron’ cops had forewarned the latter every time a raid was to be made, they say.
