Trump calls for President Obama to resign


	

Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump said in a statement on Sunday that President Barack Obama should resign.

The statement came after a mass shooter at an Orlando nightclub killed at least 50 people and wounded 53 others.

“In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words ‘Radical Islam,’” Trump wrote. “For that reason alone, he should step down.”

In his brief address earlier Sunday, Obama said the shooting was “an act of terror and an act of hate.”

Trump also criticized Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, in his statement. (Telegraph)
