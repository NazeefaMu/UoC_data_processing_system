Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Ministers in the present government, in a letter addressed to the President, have sought permission from the Central Committee (CC) of the SLFP to resign from their respective portfolios, the DM Online learns.
“We assumed duties as Ministers following a decision by the SLFP Central Committee and we do not agree with the sporadic resignations we have witnessed without the approval of the Central Committee. It does not befit a party such as ours to do so without the approval of the CC. Hence we seek the convening of the CC to take a decision on it,” the two page letter said.
The letter further details the ascension of President Sirisena as the leader of the SLFP and calls for the decisions of the party to be taken with consensus. (Sanath Desmond)
