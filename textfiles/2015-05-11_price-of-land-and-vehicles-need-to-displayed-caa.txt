	The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) yesterday emphasized the need to display the price of properties and vehicles that are up for sale.
	The Authority said the display of prices was a necessity under paragraph 26 of its Act.
	CAA Chairman Rumi Marzook said some consumers had complained that they were misguided as the selling prices were not displayed on products.
	The Authority said people faced great difficulties due to unscrupulous acts by some brokers with the aim of making excessive profits. The CAA has planned to conducts surprise checks on institutions that sell motor vehicle and land at which the selling prices are not indicated.
	When publishing advertisements in newspapers, films, TV, video, audio, broadcasting centres, internet or other print and electronic media, it is essential to state the prices according to the gazette notification of 07.01.2011.
	The CAA Chairman said prices are generally mentioned in the print media but it is hardly so in the electronic media.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
