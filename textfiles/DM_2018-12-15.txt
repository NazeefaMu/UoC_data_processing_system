a.f.dawood - a versatile pedagogue and  story writer
	
I was profoundly shocked to learn the demise of A.F. Dawood 
With whom, for nearly fifty years, my harmonious relationship with him stood 
His earthy life ended in 2015 in the night of December thirteen 
Carry I a rich storehouse of memories which will remain evergreen. 
I have vivid memories when I met him at AMA for the first time 
This was when we were carefree and in youthful prime 
Blossomed our friendship sans any hiccups over the years 
Meeting, discussing, caring, sharing amid joys and cheers. 
A unique friendship that stood tall, great and very strong 
As offspring of well respected parents whose genes we adorn 
A born artist, versatile teacher, good story teller-all he cherished 
A pedagogue par excellence whose explanations all relished 
A strict taskmaster who executed his duties with keen devotion 
Being a person of principles, he believed in steadfast dedication 
Believed in ethics and good morals that enhanced his integrity 
Passionate to serve all with humility, decorum and dignity 
Displayed courtesy and decency with his admirable,
amiable nature 
Imparting knowledge, indulging in writing that grew in stature 
Worked strictly according to his planned scheduled time 
And did not wait leisurely for the clock to chime 
As a regular writer of short stories, he made his mark 
Their publication made him as happy as a lark 
Readers of the popular Sunday Observer will greatly miss 
His arresting, captivating stories read with much relish. 
As an active social activist, I had an occasion to remark 
That he should launch a book, and so we decided to embark 
With Gods grace, it happened on June 12, 2014, indeed a pleasure 
Encompassing some gems inside, what a fine treasure! 
As a long time, bosom pal, I felt I was duty bound 
To organize the launching ceremony for his stories to go around 
Such a gifted writer, he eminently deserved many awards 
But never went behind big personages to win rewards 
I cherish the memory of that memorable launching day
When he and I made speeches in our own inimitable way 
When his magnum opus was launched, it was his finest hour 
But, Alas! soon he kissed good bye in keeping with the
Makers power 
Just 2  years after the launch, my close friend had to leave, 
Making us, kith and kin, wife and three children grieve, 
Cutting short his versatile teaching and gifted writing skills. 
We mortals are helpless; death inevitable as Allah wills 
We can only pray him to grant him Jennathul Firdous, Aameen.

A. Metthananda Your loss is irreparable
	
It is with utmost sorrow we record the recent demise of Mr. A Metthananda who was a lovable erudite English teacher par excellence. He was a thorough gentleman who was a leading light to many students irrespective of their age or 
profession. We came to contact with him while he conducted English classes at Gangaramaya Temple in about 1985. His way of teaching was magnificent, so much so that one could hang onto his lips. He possessed a very thorough knowledge of English, especially English idiomatic expressions and various other beautiful expressions. His teaching style was that, he took a situation and taught a repertoire of expressions, phrases related to the situation. There was absolutely no difficulty in imbibing knowledge from him. His students were not mere students. It was a motley gang with Engineers, Doctors, Lawyers, Army Officers and what not. All had a great time at his classes as it was a virtual free-for-all to banter and crossword in English. Some of his students are now active politicians, legal luminaries, high ups in the Sri Lanka Army. He had great qualities about him and he never worshiped the shrine of Mammon. He was never worried about the payments like a village Vedamahattya. All his wealth was books and stacks of papers which contained English phrases jotted down by him.

Knowledge is like a pocket clock which should be taken out only in need and after that it should be rested as before

 
Apart from the treasure of knowledge he imparted on his students, he inculcated good qualities in us with life home truths. He was able to tide over calamities which befell him but could not escape the mandibles of death, again and again 
confirming the truth of the line of the Pali stanza Uppagithwa Nirujjanthi. He always dressed nattily, combed his hair neatly and carried the halo of gentlemanliness wherever he proceeded. When we asked him about this, his answer was that he took the good things from the Westerners throwing the bad things away as a swan churns out water from milk. Once I was in a difficulty and I made a clean breast of me to him. He gave me an unputdownable book to read and if I remember correct it was Life the Greatest Adventure. Such were his noble qualities. 
He was always a hail fellow well met type of a person and never strutted about like a peacock. His motto was that Knowledge is like a pocket clock which should be taken out only in need and after that it should be rested as before . Although lately he could not do his teaching with the great profundity he did before, still he conducted classes to various officers in spite of his debility. He timed and pronounced English with a mellifluous tone and we now badly miss his tintinnabulation and iridescence. 
A pall of miasma silhouettes our minds because of his loss which is irreparable. Thank you great master, thank you for all what you have left behind indelibly in our mourning minds.

Brexit: Time for another referendum
	

Ireland, for the first time in its history, has become more powerful than Britain
Economic growth dropped almost to the bottom of European league table

The whole debate about Brexit has had a weird quality about it from beginning to end. Prime Minister Theresa May voted in the referendum two and a half years ago to remain in the European Union but then as a quid pro quo for being made prime minister she has led the charge to implement Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party, voted to remain but has made it clear that he too prefers out, albeit keeping the UK in the Customs Union.
Mrs. May muddied the waters even further when in a radio interview she was asked how she would vote if there were a second referendum replied that she didnt know.
Yesterday, at the eleventh hour she postponed a parliamentary vote on whether to approve or not the treaty negotiated with the EU on Brexit.
The former prime minister, Gordon Brown, writing in the Financial Times, has pinpointed another act of weirdness. Because the country is in the throes of only Act One of our European drama at least two and possibly more years of acrimonious EU negotiations still lie ahead It is said the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and expect different results.

Facing total defeat, Mrs. May should grab the nettle and announce a new referendum immediately. The remains would certainly win

After yesterdays non-vote in Parliament on whether to accept the 585-page compromise deal hammered out over two years by the UK and the EU Commission the UK faces a stalemate. Some including Mrs. May, with their heads in the clouds, are still calling for the agreement to be tweaked so that a slightly revised version can be voted on again. But the truth is any attempt to revise the text would not be allowed. Yesterday, Donald Tusk, President of the EU, made that clear. Only talks to seek clarification will be allowed. The negotiators would then go round and round, doubtless coming back to where they are now. Soon, next March, Britain will be evicted from the Customs Union of the single market (the open trade agreement) and sit on the margins of decisions made by the rest of the EU. The UK will not be at the table but will be duty bound to implement EU decisions.
The fact is the UKs relationship with the EU is in limbo. Meanwhile, the exodus of financial institutions, manufacturers, European doctors, nurses, dentists, plumbers and university dons, continues. Economic growth has dropped almost to the bottom of the European league table. The deficit is growing again, despite the governments cruel policy of austerity that has savaged the lives of the poorest. The government, preparing for the worst, is stockpiling medical supplies and food. If there were no deal, it is estimated that 80% of Britains trade through the cross channel ports will be affected by new border controls, leading to three kilometre-long queues of lorries.
In fact its checkmate. It has been for a long time but many parliamentarians, the right-wing media (but not the BBC) and perhaps most of the public have only begun to realise this recently. Why Because of the issue of Northern Ireland which is part of the UK, which they have downplayed.
A year ago, Mrs. May signed a formal agreement with the EU guaranteeing there would never be a physical border across the island of Ireland. Thus, the Republic of Ireland in the South has had a veto over the negotiation result. Ireland, for the first time in its history, has become more powerful than Britain.
We should not have been surprised, though at first Mrs. May tried to play its significance down, suggesting that the border problem could be fixed by uninvented technological means. She has not been able to avoid a debate with the EU about it. In fact, it takes up almost half the agreement.
As Alex Barber in the Financial Times wrote yesterday: If the Irish backstop plan is ever applied, it will cast the EU in a unique and awkward role that it once shunned. Much of Northern Irelands economy would be policed as if Britain had never left the EU Perhaps, for the first time, the European Court of Justice and the European Commission would assume direct authority across part of a non-EU State, acting without the usual democratic structures that underpin their writ.
Yesterday, this very court ruled, again to the governments chagrin, that according to Article 50 of the EU Constitution, the UK could stop its negotiations and tell the EU it wanted to remain in the EU and it wouldnt be penalised for such a step.
Step forward those who have campaigned for a new referendum in which the Leave decision could be reversed. Hundreds of thousands have demonstrated in favour of this -- one of the largest demonstrations in British history.
Facing total defeat, Mrs. May should grab the nettle and announce a new referendum immediately. The remains would certainly win. But then Mrs. May implied in that radio interview that it could be that she too would vote remain.

Debate over legitimacy of Trumps 2016 win rages
	

By Marc Fisher (c) 2018, The Washington Post Dec 14, 2018 - 6:22 PM- WASHINGTON - As if the country didnt have enough to be divided about, now the forces aligned for and against President Donald Trump are battling over whether his presidency is legitimate. 
The evidence emerging in recent days and months that multiple crimes were committed in an effort to help Trump win the presidency is fuelling arguments from Democrats and other Trump critics that the man in the Oval Office got the job through nefarious means. Even with no proof that those crimes swayed votes, the critics say, Trump has no moral hold on the office. 
First came the statement by federal prosecutors in New York that Trump attorney Michael Cohen sought to influence the election from the shadows by arranging to pay hush money to women who said they had extramarital affairs with Trump. Then, on Tuesday, executives at the National Enquirers parent company admitted paying hush money to prevent news of the candidates alleged infidelities from influencing the election.

EC Chief to seek SC ruling on PC polls
	
Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said on Thursday the EC would seek a ruling from the Supreme Court on the measures on the measures to be taken to conduct the provincial council elections in 2020.
He said though political parties were levelling allegations against the EC for the delay in holding PC elections but that they were not responsible for the delay.
The PC elections can be held after the finalisation of the delimitation process or under the previous electoral system or under the mixed system or under the new system, the EC Chief said.
He said according to their assessment, the presidential election should be conducted before December 9, 2019.
We can hold any election within a span of two months. General elections should be held in October, 2020. But, we also have to wait for the verdict of the Supreme Court with regard to the ongoing case, the EC Chief said and added that all three elections - the presidential election, general elections and provincial council elections should be held in 2020.
He made these remarks to the media after a programme held in the Hambantota District Secretariat to raise awareness among government officers attached to election duties. (Sanath Gamage)

Either support Ranil or be in opposition: SLPP tells TNA
	
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) should decide either to ally with the United National Party (UNP) or to sit in the opposition, MP Kanchana Wijesekera said.
He told a news briefing the recent conduct of the TNA had been quite partial to the UNP in Parliament.
We witnessed the TNA voting in favour of the confidence motion in support of Ranil Wickremesinghe. They cannot continue to be like this. If they are to play the role of the opposition they should work against the government, he said.
He said if the TNA wished they could form a government with 117 seats in Parliament with the UNP and added that wont happen because TNA had said they would not join any party to form a coalition government.
If they want to support the UNP, they should handover their opposition post to a party that has secured the most number of seats in parliament. They cannot sit on the fence, he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

## Title: Gender inequality at workplace

Gender inequality at workplace
	
I believe workplace is a great platform to shape societal gender inequalities. This article will bring about reviews of theory and research on gender inequality in organisations; reviews of empirical evidence on gender inequality at work, beginning with studies that explore the cultural, relational and structural mechanisms to reproduce gender inequality in organisations and moving towards discussing research on mechanisms in order to uphold equality. Undoubtedly, more theory and research ought to be focused on the remediation of inequality in terms of discussions on two pathways; the first is an institutional theory of remediation, examining the ways in which institutional environments and actors can weaken gendered organisations; and the second is a political theory focusing on the means and conditions for women to act as agents of organisational change.
Dr. Hemamalie Gunatilaka, senior lecturer (Grade 1) attached to the Business Administration Department of the Management Studies and Commerce Faculty, Sri Jayewardenepura University, with over 25 years of teaching experience in relative fields of organisational behaviour and change, principles of management and qualitative research methods, had this to say in sharing her views;

I believe bringing women to the forefront will undoubtedly solve many issues and their way of managing will help overcome problems which men will even fail to realise existed

When it comes to academia, the concept of gender in the Sri Lankan context has not been taken up until the recent past. Hence, as a woman and an academic hailing from a privileged social background, I was disheartened by the way I was treated for being a woman. This made me think that if I were treated this way, then how would the poor and lower-class women be treated, being the majority of Sri Lankan garment factory workers within an industry governed by males! These horrendous thoughts led me into pursuing my PhD in such a discipline and henceforth I started reading more on related aspects thereby gathering knowledge on how this was happening worldwide. Subsequently, I started searching for others who were interested in this arena and found Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe who was into similar regimes. She had even established a centre for gender at the Kelaniya University thereby taking the initiative in gender mainstreaming within the university sector.
I should say that in Sri Lanka, gender has been researched before, though mostly in a societal level. Despite the fact that I come from a management background, I thought it would be interesting to probe the role played by gender in workplaces. I kept searching and researching for a good place to read for my doctorate and that was when I found the Centre for Women and Gender at University of Warwick -- one of the top 10 universities in the UK. This varsity functions under the Sociology Department capitalised as the third in the UK. Having decided on the university, I wrote to Prof. Nickie Charles -- by that time I had a draft proposal ready so I wrote to her with my proposal along with my CV to which she responded instantly. She found the particular subject area to be interesting and said such a discipline had hitherto not been studied in the global south. She expressed willingness to supervise my work and at the same time recommended another erudite personality, Dr. Carol Wolkowitz, to be my co-supervisor.
I then started my PhD which was a study for four years and as I said earlier, I was keen in looking into the garment industry. Although prior studies have been conducted into the subject, elements such as gender, religion, age and so fourth had not been researched. Previous studies only focused on welfare, exploitation, unionization and aspects of relativity. The other fact remained to be that previous studies lay within the free trade zone, which urged me to select factories outside such parameters.

Using the initial literature framework, I looked at the theoretical structure focusing on gender inequality. I cannot argue on this aspect but what I underscore is that all humans should be treated equally and that everyone should be able to enjoy freedom

I believe these factories may have the distant ownership, which might influence the way they manage, ultimately affecting the employees. Scale of the industry, location or may be the market they serve, were taken into consideration. I set my mind on three garment factories nestled outside the free trade zone. One large-scale factory, located in the heart of Colombo and owned by a Muslim family, had more than 10,000 workers serving the international market. Men were at the top. The second was a middle-scale factory in a remote area where the owner was a Sinhala-Buddhist woman with some 6,000 employees serving the international market. Another factory owned by a Tamil Hindu was located in the suburban with 40 employees who served the local market.
This was where I experienced organisational politics. There were comprehensive interviews and three-month observations in each of these factories. A nine-month study inclusive of 36 interviews -- six men and six women at each factory from the owner to those serving in managerial posts.
I walked into these factories and collected data for nine months. I then returned to the UK for data analysis. I established that when inequity reproduces in an organisation, not only gender but social status, race, religion, age and sexuality come into play.
Using the initial literature framework, I looked at the theoretical structure focusing on gender inequality. I cannot argue on this aspect but what I underscore is that all humans should be treated equally and that everyone should be able to enjoy freedom.
The university has found a Centre for Gender Mainstream within the university towards which Prof. Maithree Wickremesinghe has given leadership. Furthermore, the UGC has a centre for gender equity and equality. And now, each university has a Gender Cell or Gender Centre. When I came down last May, I was made the Directress for Gender Equity and Equality at Sri Jayewardenepura University.
My efforts here are to raise awareness on gender by bringing it into the mainstream. When decisions are being made, gender has to play an equal part on both sides. Also, I am trying to establish a centre to make people aware that these kinds of centres do exist.
I believe bringing women to the forefront will undoubtedly solve many issues and their way of managing will help overcome problems which men will even fail to realise existed.
I want to promote the methodology learnt through my PhD which is something novel to Sri Lanka. It is a qualitative approach which allows you to get into peoples experiences, to listen to them and give them a voice through your research than merely filling up a questionnaire. I am trying to give something to the country by ushering a change.
The doctorate I earned from University of Warwick, UKwas possible mainly due to the sacrifices made by my family, only son and husband whose unconditional support I recall with great appreciation.

GMOA says no to Rajitha as Health Minister
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday they had requested President Maithripala Sirisena not to appoint Rajitha Senaratne as the Health Minster.
Addressing a news briefing, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said they had requested the president for the second time in the wake of the spreading speculation that the new cabinet would be appointed on Monday (17).
Despite acquiring the Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH), Dr. Senaratne wasted public funds by pumping in more than Rs.250 million to the institution and pointed out that during his tenure as health minister, several wrongdoings had taken place in the tender procedure for purchasing pharmaceuticals, Dr. Aluthge alleged.
Dr. Aluthge said the benefits he had received either directly or indirectly instead of listening to the advice proffered by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should be investigated and added that delaying to investigate actions of the former minister would allow him time to destroy or amend documents in relation to the charges.

## Title: I resigned to make way for Prez to form new Govt.: MR
## Section: Breaking News

I resigned to make way for Prez to form new Govt.: MR
	
Mahinda Rajapaksa saidin a statement a short while ago that he resigned from the position of Prime Minister to make way for the President to form a new government.
He made this statement at his residence in Wijerama after signing to the resignation letter.
I have no intention of remaining as Prime Minister without a general election being held, and hampering the President in any way, Rajapaksa said.
The full statement made by Mr. Rajapaksa is as follows,
Most venerable members of the Maha Sangha, Clergymen of all religions, Members of Parliament, Ministers, and dear friends,
The Supreme Court has delivered a judgement against the holding of the general election that had already been declared. Since that judgement is a long and complicated document, I will study it carefully and in due course express my views on the constitutional impact it will have on the functioning of the parliamentary system of government in this country. Today however, I wish to speak on the political implications of not being able to hold the general election that had already been declared. We are now in direct confrontation with a group of political parties that have continuously engaged in various subterfuges to avoid facing elections. When this group of political parties tried to get the local government elections postponed indefinitely by petitioning courts over the delimitation of wards, we were able to hold the local government election only because the Chairman of the Elections Commission intervened and declared that he would hold elections at least in respect of the local government institutions that had no delimitation issues pending before courts. If not for that intervention, the people would not have got even the local government election.
Elections to provincial councils have been delayed by more than one year and three months, but no one has any inkling of when those long overdue elections will be held. The law has been manipulated in such a way that those elections will be put off indefinitely. In September 2017, when the Attorney General said that a two thirds majority will be necessary to pass the law designed to postpone the provincial council elections, the then government kept Parliament going till night time and with great effort, mustered the necessary number of MPs to get the law passed. So desperate were they, that when some smaller political parties said they would not vote for the law unless the proportional representation quota was increased from 40% to 50%, the government agreed to that demand in the corridors of Parliament so as to get the required number of votes. They had to perform demeaning contortions to get the provincial council elections postponed.
The people have now been deprived of the general election that had already been declared. After the President dissolved Parliament on 9 November, the political parties opposed to the election petitioned courts and obtained a stay order on the dissolution and with the cooperation of the UNP Speaker, they engaged in various activities to demonstrate that they had a majority in Parliament. But it was only on 12 December when a resolution was passed expressing confidence in Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe and requesting that he be appointed Prime Minister that the people of the country were able to see the real state of things.
A total of 117 MPs voted calling for Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe to be appointed as Prime Minister. Fourteen of those votes belong to the TNA. Even though the TNA also requested that Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe be appointed Prime Minister, on the same day, TNA Parliamentarian Mavei Senathirajah made a special statement in parliament on behalf of the TNA saying that though they voted for Mr Wickremesinghe to become Prime Minister, they would not join the government and would remain in the opposition. So what has actually happened here is that the UNP which has a minority of 103 seats, has been taken hostage by the TNA. If they do not adhere to the diktat of the TNA, the UNP minority can lose their parliamentary majority at any moment. The TNA now holds the remote control in Parliament.
On 12 December, even before the Supreme Court judgement was delivered, Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke in Parliament about bringing in a new constitution. This new constitution has already been drafted and published in the newspapers as well. Under the provisions of that draft constitution, this country will be divided into nine semi-independent federal units. The new constitution will also abolish the executive presidency which means that the presidential election that is due before the 9th December 2019, will not have to be held. The new constitution will also change the system of electing MPs to Parliament which means that the parliamentary election due in 2020 can also be postponed citing delimitation issues the same way that the provincial council elections have been put off indefinitely. That is what they are now preparing for.
The UNP-UPFA coalition that had been formed under Articles 46(4) and 46(5) of the Constitution relating to national governments, fell apart when the UPFA left the coalition on October 26. Thereafter, a number of UNP parliamentarians joined us and we became the largest group in Parliament. After the general elections of 1994, 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2015, it was always the largest group in Parliament that was invited to form the government as no party obtained a clear majority. In all those instances, the government was formed first, and the working majorities were obtained later.
After we formed a government on 26 October, the President declared a general election. When I was sworn in as Prime Minister on 26 October, that was to form an interim government that would last only for about two months until the conclusion of the general election which was scheduled for the5th January 2019. A President cannot stand by and do nothing when the whole country was facing destruction at the hands of the people running the government. When the main opposition force which is in effect the alternative government is invited to form an interim government that will last until the conclusion of a general election, such a request cannot be turned down either. Furthermore, a minority government would more than suffice to run things till the conclusion of a general election. We appreciate the difficult and bold decision that the President made on October 26.
What we are confronted with now, is an attempt to rule the country without holding any kind of election. Since a general election can no longer be held, we cannot implement any of the measures we had planned to take to prevent this country from becoming another Greece. The UNP government borrowed 20.7 billion US Dollars in foreign currency loans alone within a period of three and a half years, and we have no idea as to how much more they will borrow in the coming months. The UNP brought our economy to the brink of collapse through such foreign currency borrowings. All that money was borrowed for consumption. We borrowed money to develop the country and that development is visible. But the UNP borrowed money only for consumption. Even though some have expressed the view that it will be possible to minimize the damage done by the UNP because the President is no longer with them, we must realize that there is much that the UNP-TNA coalition can do without informing the President.
We should bear in mind that back in 2002, the then UNP government signed a cease-fire agreement with the LTTE without informing President Chandrika Kumaratunga. After the 26th October, we were able to reduce the pressure on the people by bringing down the price of fuel and some essential food items and restoring the distribution of school uniform material. We restored the fertilizer subsidy and reduced income taxes on agricultural incomes to encourage agricultural production. We were also able to take certain measures to address the concerns of young professionals in this country over the Sri Lanka- Singapore Free Trade Agreement entered into by the previous government. We suspended the excessive taxes imposed by the previous government. We also managed to prevent several local industries from closing down. Even though a general election will not be held, it must be said that the events that took place after the 26th of October have benefitted the public in other ways.
The most important thing that happened during this period was that the two thirds majority in Parliament that was available to the UNP to be used at will, is now no longer available to them. Therefore it is now possible to prevent the passage of the new constitution that has been drafted by the same individuals who turned this country into an ungovernable mess through the 19th Amendment. Furthermore it has now become possible to end the totalitarian system that prevailed in Parliament over the past four years, with partners of the government taking over the position of opposition leader and chief opposition whip and masquerading as the opposition while supporting the government. As a result of that dangerous perversion, the Constitutional Council which recommends candidates for appointment to high office, was made up of representatives of one political persuasion. Consequently all appointees to high office over the past four years belonged to the same group. The whole country is now suffering the consequences of that situation.
After the February 10 local government election, our aim was to have a general election held. Since I have no intention of remaining as Prime Minister without a general election being held, and in order to not hamper the President in any way, I will resign from the position of Prime Minister and make way for the President to form a new government. When I was sworn in as Prime Minister, on 26 October, a feeling of optimism swept through the country. The All Share Price Index which had declined after 2015, suddenly picked up on expectations of a change of government. The LMD-Nielsen Business Confidence Index recorded the sharpest increase after 2015 in November 2018. Despite the political turmoil in the country after 26 October, tourist arrivals had increased by 16% in November 2018 when compared with the same period in 2017. Those trends which took place despite the political instability in the country after 26 October are a clear indication of what the peoples hopes and aspirations are.
The change of government that the people expected has now had to be put off. But the people will definitely get the change they desire. No one can prevent that. The coming together of the Joint Opposition and the SLFP group that was in the government has now created a power block that commands around 54% of the vote base. To this will have to be added the votes of our allied political parties in the North and East and the hill country. What is now gathering against the enemies of the country is a country wide political force that no one can stop. Our main aim in the immediate future will be to hold the provincial council elections which have already been delayed by more than one year and three months. The main challenge facing us in the interval between now and the formation of a peoples government will be to minimize the damage that can be done by the destructive forces that are now seeking restoration to their former positions. There is no doubt at all that the people who stood by us since 2015, will continue to support us in the future as well. We will bring the forces opposed to the country down to their knees by organizing the people.
May the blessings of the Tripple Gem be upon you,
God bless you.

Kawulu Esa Paamula transcending time illustrating the philosophy of life
	
In a world where enlightenment is considered to be observed only in calmness and in solitary environments Lahiru Kithalagama time and again questions if it is so. Starting with the very same questioning within the foreword itself the writer takes you into the reality and day-to-day lives of people who found meaning to life within that struggle itself. 
Starting with the lines in the poem Tharaha Na Man Amme (Mom, Im Not Angry) writer embarks on his journey in to dimension of reality. How a single mother moves in to another relationship and this dilemma is viewed by a child from the view point of understanding the desires, loneliness mother is facing in her daily struggle through life. Child sees this from a higher level of perception going beyond the understanding of a child.
Narrator conveys that she has no grudges over the mother and understands her mothers needs as a woman, not in the perception of a child. This is one of the masterful techniques the writer uses throughout the collection. Understanding of all living, nonliving objects through different dimensions. 

In a world where technology has taken over the environment and the destruction is inbound towards the heart and soul of the narrator transcending in to the environment itself

Writer observes night and day in an opposite manner in the poem Raathriya Niwennata Kaliyen ( Before the Night Ends). Narrator observes love and desire at night hiding from the prying eyes. Starting lines itself is contradictory of what we perceive as day time. Day time is a time filled with darkness inside all that light and it is blinding for the narrator, where night is soothing for the soul. His love arrives at his door step with the dawn of a dusk and leaves with the first rays of sunshine. Symbols and metaphors used enhance the effect of the poem. Narrator views a lonely spider playing with the web as if it is a violin to soothe the heart of its lover. Just like the narrator himself playing music in the human landscape. Desires of love are woven with the sighs of the lovers and bathing in the moonlight they soothe their souls by passing weariness of life with the wind. Philosophy of letting go is a concept running throughout the poetry collection and the poem Raathriya Niwennata Kaliyen (Before the Night Ends) highlights this. Narrator and the lover are again separated with the dawn and for them it turns in to a night filled with work, loneliness the rush of life. This questions the reader as well; are we not the same Enjoying the best of times with our family at night and the day time filled with all the mundane of life. 
In a world where technology has taken over the environment and the destruction is inbound towards the heart and soul of the narrator transcending in to the environment itself Soundaryaka Weedanaa Ridum (Pain within artistic beauty), paints the sighs of the nature in a magical way. Most of the time it escapes our minds that nature might be tired of doing all the duties just like us. Writer brings in this view to power play through all living and non-living in nature. Bees been too tired of collecting honey and resting on flowers, trees shedding old leaves to give room for the new ones, wind bringing in soothing feeling in the summer resting for a while, rivers after making music and painting the landscape resting on the river bed, sea taking care of all those who play on the shore and how trees wait for the fruits to bloom are few of the symbols used by the writer to convey the deep philosophy of life.

Philosophy of letting go is a concept running throughout the poetry collection and the poem Raathriya Niwennata Kaliyen (Before the Night Ends) highlights this

It leaves the question on the readers mind, arent we all tired of life and dont we all need a bit of rest once in a while. With these questions in our mind writer shocks us with his next poem Galkaiye Goluwa, (Mute man from Galkatiya) a murder is brought face to face with the opening lines and the justification follows with the rest. Waves of shock pass through the reader as the poem proceeds.
How a mute guy took care of his family and even though unable to recite the sutra in thripitaka he tried his best to do merit. Always been there for his neighbours we see a man struggling through life with a resilient spirit. At the very end of the poem reader finds the reason why a mute guy who was caring person turned in to a murderer and the reason strikes like a bolt of lightning bringing the poem to its very end as well to its peak.

A father making a living out of selling chickpeas at a street corner dying with an accident at the same place is recalled by his child in the poem Kadala Karaththaya (Chickpeas Cart). Recalling the past where the narrators father took him along with the chickpeas cart to sell chickpeas so that their daily bread will be filled. Yet all their simple dreams are shattered over the passing of their father due to an accident. Writer uses a skillful technique of conveying this story to the reader in an undirected manner through the object of a chickpeas cart. This makes the poem even more closer to our hearts. This is one of the techniques used by the writer bringing in incidents through objects related to the narrator. 
Landslides occur due to structural displacement and weather. Yet the writer absorbs in a landslide as suffering and pain of the people working on tea estates crashing with the environment. Writer takes us through a story of loss and suffering of the people working in plantations. Uniqueness of the writer is in these viewpoints of a situation otherwise observed as a common day to day moment. Atthatama Wunee Mehema Wennathee (It Really Must Have Happened This Way), poem does justification for the writers storytelling skill which takes you in to another dimension of looking at the day to day struggle of people in a unique manner. 
Ou Mage Hitha Kalu Galak (Yes, My Heart is a stone), is where the narrator accepts the judgement passed by his girlfriend has been man made of a stone heart where no flowers bloom and no dreams arise. In a world where we never accept such a judgement passed by another narrator accepts fully that yes, his heart is a stone. He questions back that a soft heart would not be withstanding the rough weathers of life and a soft heart would be so flexible can such a heart be trusted to be standstill in time. He also questions that a heart rough as a stone is actually the byproduct of love long lost, a collection of sighs and tears. Heart of stone is smoothed by the tears of the one he loves; a heart of stone will be a standstill in time. 
When relationships end most of us tend to return the gifts and all the keepsakes, fearing these will recall the memories of the past. This is where the narrator contradicts us with the thoughts, we all fear to question. Even though the gifts are returned can memories be erased Arent we all prisoners of our own memories hidden beneath the depths of our hearts. Man Asai Andanna, As Piyagena Thaniyama (I Like to Cry on My Own, Eyes Closed) is where the writer brings in these questions to the surface. 
Lahiru Kithalagama continuous to torments us within his collection of poetry through deep understanding in to human emotions. His masterful techniques of bringing day to day incidents colored with the tender human emotions makes him a writer in his own making transcending time. Apith Partiyak Gamuda Amme (Mother Shall We Also Take a Party) is such a poem where the poverty of the people is brought in to canvas of poetry in a raw yet shocking manner, leaving the reader to questions the very essence of life. 
When the poor girl meets rich guy, concept is commonly used within poetry, writer contradicts this theme via the opposite concept been used. In the poem Iruru Katu Gahapu Jeewithe Heena Aragena Yanna (Take Away the Dreams of this Torn Up Life) is where the poor guy meets the socialized rich girl. Within this main incident writer highlights poverty, shame and the suffering it brings in the end. This is one of the techniques used by the writer, conveying several stories within one story. Layers of dimensions within one dimension. Softening your heart and bringing tears to the eyes of the reader Jool Thawamath Ambulai da Suddiye (Is the Wood apple still Sour), brings in the nostalgia of a love long lost recalled through a wood apple tree. Writer uses this masterful technique of using one symbol or a metaphor in to recalling past and to beautifully craft a story, plunging the reader in to a world of despair. 
Man Nikma Yanum Heen Amme (I will leave Heen Amma), contradicts the norms of the society. When love is found outside of a marriage usual reaction would be to hurt each other through verbal and physical abuse. Narrator contradicts by leaving his wife in grace, giving his blessing and with one question as to if all the years spent together was it just a mirage. 
Becoming a voice for the voiceless Lahiru Kithalagama pulls the strings of our heart and leaves us in a state of shock in to feeling different paradigms of life. Kawulu Asa Paamula has marked a millstone is Sri Lankan literature in transcending time illustrating the philosophy of life.

May finds little EU support for her nebulous and imprecise Brexit plans
	

British Prime Minister Theresa May travelled Thursday to Brussels to beg fellow EU leaders for concessions in her effort to seal a divorce deal splitting her nation from the European Union, but she won little to sway opinions among her rebellious supporters.
In a series of one-on-one meetings and a nearly hourlong grilling by her fellow EU leaders, May underlined the direness of her predicament; an exit deal that could leave Britain stuck partway out the door of the European Union has proved too politically toxic to pass muster at home. But some fellow leaders blasted May for what they said was the muddiness of her proposals, and it seemed possible the exchange could actually inflame the British discussion rather than calm it.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, said the British demands were nebulous and imprecise. In a declaration after their meeting, the 27 leaders said the deal was not open for renegotiation, and they directed all levels of their governments to prepare for all possible outcomes - including a chaotic British departure that could set off a European economic crisis.
Theres an impression perhaps in the U.K. that its for the EU to propose solutions, Juncker said. It is the U.K. that is leaving the E.U., and I would have thought it was up to the British government to tell us what they want.

Neutrality promotes preventive diplomacy
	
Since 1956 and the social revolution of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, Sri Lanka has played a leading role in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). After Mr. Banadaranaikes assassination in 1959, his widow Sirimavo Bandaranaike as prime minister continued Sri Lankas important role in NAM along with other legendary leaders like Yugoslavias President Josip Broz Tito, Indias Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Egypts President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Cubas Fidel Castro. Sri Lankas role was so valued that we were in 1976, given the opportunity of hosting NAMs annual conference with more than 75 leaders attending it. With the sweeping 1977 election victory of the United National Party (UNP) leader J.R. Jayewardene and his commitment to the globalized capitalist market economic system, NAM meant less to Sri Lanka. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, NAMs role also became less relevant because its main aim was to be neutral in the cold war between the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies on the one side and the Soviet Bloc with its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. In the modern world, with the marvels of information and communication technology bringing people closer, the global village concept has virtually gripped the whole world and NAM appears to have little or no place. Its role is largely being overplayed by countries like Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Iceland. 
It is in this context that we today mark the United Nations International Day of Neutrality with the world body in a statement saying neutrality is defined as the legal status arising from the abstention of a State from participation in a war between other States, the maintenance of an attitude of impartiality toward the belligerents, and the recognition by the belligerents of this abstention and impartiality. This is critically important for the UN to gain and maintain the confidence and cooperation of all to operate independently and effectively, especially in situations that are politically charged.
As Article 2 of the UN Charter obligates member States to settle their international disputes by peaceful means and to refrain from the threat or the use of force in their relations, the General Assembly reaffirmed those obligations in a resolution. It underlined that some States national policies of neutrality could contribute to the strengthening of international peace and security and play an important role in developing mutually beneficial relations among countries of the world.
Recognizing that such national policies of neutrality are aimed at promoting the use of preventive diplomacy, which is a core function of the UN and occupies a central place among the functions of the Secretary-General, the General Assembly decided to declare December 12 as the International Day of Neutrality. It has called on all countries to mark the day by holding events aimed at enhancing public awareness on the value of neutrality in international relations.
In the face of political tension and escalating crises, it is of great importance to uphold the principles of sovereignty and the sovereign equality of States, territorial integrity, self-determination and non-intervention in the internal affairs of any State and to defend, promote and encourage the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered, the UN says. 
Therefore, the policy of neutrality contributes to the strengthening of peace and security in relevant regions and at the global level and plays an important role in developing peaceful, friendly and mutually beneficial relations among the countries of the world. 
It is worth noting that the policy of neutrality  a key factor for providing conditions and building a platform for peaceful negotiations  is also closely interconnected with and based on the tools of preventive diplomacy, such as early warning and prevention of conflict, mediation, good offices, fact-finding missions, negotiation, the use of special envoys, informal consultations, peace-building and targeted development activities. Hence, preventive diplomacy is a core function of the United Nations and is central to the role of the UN Secretary-General, including the special political missions of the UN and the good offices of the Secretary-General in peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building, the world body adds.
In the 1960s, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike played a successful role in mediation during the war between India and China. But today with India and China vying for economic power and control of the vital Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka appears to be caught in a trap between the two Asian giants. Foreign policy experts need to properly advise our leaders on how to restore and positively use our status of neutrality and preventive diplomacy.

SC ruling has enshrined people's franchise: JVP
	
While rejecting the claim that the Supreme Court decision on dissolving parliament had prevented the election being held, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna said yesterday the Supreme Court verdict had without doubt enshrined the franchise of the people.
JVP propaganda secretary Vijitha Herath told a news conference that the SC ruling had strengthened the people's franchise.
Some people describe the SC ruling as having prevented an election. This is totally wrong. The Constitution clearly mentions a time frame for elections to be held. The president has no right to violate that time frame. The Court underlined the fact that no one can use his or her extreme powers to smother the people's rights," he said.
The MP said the SC decision was a result of the 19th Amendment and added that the statements made by some people claiming shortcomings in the 19A had been proved wrong.
SC decision proved that 19A was a correct and progressive amendment. No one can term the present crisis as a Constitutional crisis anymore. Some people tried to describe this political crisis as a Constitutional crisis, he said.
He said the political coup had done huge damage to the country and stressed the need to appoint a select commission in parliament. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Thambo Kumarakulasingam The Appa  I knew and admired
	
People come into your life for a reason, Some just pass through, some linger, and some leaves impressions that last. Appa falls into the last category.
I consider it my luck to have had an opportunity to be a part of his family. Appa was unique, I know it would have been really hard for him to accept the fact that me and my kids, had entered his sons life, but he did it with such grace and welcomed us as his own. Never said any thing bad about others and lived a life centred around principles he had set. His achievements were immense. Sports was his passion and the cupboard full of trophies than sit in the hall were bears testimony to his talents.
He was the man around the house, made it his duty to make sure everything around the house was done properly. We had very little to do as he took care of most things.
The Kumarakulasingam Trust, which he formed many years ago to help under privileged university students during the college years was his way of making a difference to those who needed help. This was a wonderful initiative which helped a large number of students focus on their studies without worrying about funding. The programme was mainly executed by him. 
His health was becoming weaker during the last few months but he had the will most times, to go on. Although he had a relatively trouble free life for the most part, the complications pulled him down at the end. Somehow he still chose to bear even when pain would make him miserable.
Whilst we miss him immensely I am glad he was relieved of the pain. But we who were left behind have not come to terms with it even three months hence. I guess it will never be the same. For Amma, there is a permanent void and KK will never be able to get used to it. I am sure Prabha and Naren have similar feelings. 
He was a person who left a lasting impression on others. What he did for me would last as fond memories, my whole life. There is a gaping hole of emptiness around the house as we hear you no more, we cannot reach out for advice when needed and that is really hard to fathom. Thank you Appa, for making our lives richer in every sense, and for the love your showered on us. Hope we will meet again in this long journey of sansara. We will miss you dearly until then.

Three inspiring human rights activists  win accolades
	

The Human Rights Office in its seventh year of salutation recognised three distinguished human rights activists who have rendered yeoman services to the cause. They were felicitated at a special awards ceremony held on December 9 at Good Shepherds Convent in Kandy
The Chief Guest of the occasion was Saliya Pieris, Presidents Counsel and Chairman of the Office of Missing Persons, while Rt. Rev. Dr. Vianney Fernando, Chairman of the Catholic National Commission for Justice, Peace and Human Development, graced the occasion as the Guest of Honour.
The first award was a tribute to the families of the disappeared, in memory of their long journey with the human rights office. The families of whose members had disappeared formed a group on October 27, 1991to mark the International Day of Missing Persons. Drawn from various parts of the country, there was no disparity among them and the group was bound as one family to protect their rights.

Since 2012, members of this group were able to go to the North to seek solace for their own brethren and to establish links to find the truth of the fate of these missing persons

This group took upon themselves the task of visiting army camps and tendering petitions to various authorities in a bid to trace their loved ones. With the commission appointed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike in 1995, they were given the opportunity to appear before the commission to provide information on the disappeared.
This group stood for what was right and dismissed compensations offered to them. They also rejected the temporary death certificates given to them. Their ultimate goal was to find what truly happened to their loved ones and to gain confirmation on the events that transpired leading to their disappearance.
In addition to this initiative, they found in Jayanthi Dandeniya, solace to rally around, where she was searching for her two brothers and the youth with whom she had registered for marriage. This group, that initially had only 60 members, became a stronghold and by 2004 was able to conduct meetings at the Catholic Media Centre.
It also succeeded in creating the publication Nadiya with the help of the Human Rights Office. It was able to support the efforts of the Bogambara-Dumbara Correctional Facility where its members took to teaching. During this timeframe, the group participated in almost all demonstrations which were a common front of searching for missing persons. This group has endured a long journey in the search for justice.
Since 2012, members of this group were able to go to the North to seek solace for their own brethren and to establish links to find the truth of the fate of these missing persons. Their search took on a powerful statement that disappearance is a criminal offence. Honouring their perseverance and struggle to seek justice, the first tribute of the evening was awarded to the group of families seeking their loved ones. The award was received by Ms. Sheela Gannoruwa.

Rev. Sister Mabel Rodrigo taught geography at Bauddha Maha Vidyalaya at Jakandula in Kurukuliya, who belonged to the order of Saint Paul. She was young and was known to always lend a patient hearing to the woes of young schoolgirls. She saw in herself the calling of God and in 1984 entered University of Saint Louis in the Philippines where she earned her PhD. From 1985,Sister Rodrigo was actively engaged in the activities of youth in the Philippines, following which she entered Saint Anthonys College as a trauma counsellor. In 2000, she was at Hindagala Saint Pauls Convent in Kandy and became a counsellor at Peradeniya Universitys Newman Society. During this period and under the guidance of Rev. Nandana Manatunge who was the SETIK Director and later at the Kandy Parish Media Centre, she became a trauma counsellor for those who were brought under police protection for multiple reasons.
In 2008, at the Kandy Human Rights Office, she engaged herself in the needs of those who were tortured and sexually assaulted. In addition, Sister Rodrigo engaged herself in the area of those who were unlawfully jailed and upon their return, saw that they were counselled. She was also engaged in the process of testimony therapy for those families that needed the courage to live with dignity among the community.
In 2011, Sister Rodrigo took upon the task of counselling those families whose loved ones had disappeared. Without any hesitation, she was able to bring together those of the South and the North who were in need of peace. She did not leave it at that, but continued to find ways and means to give the younger g eneration counselling.
Sister Rodrigo went a step further and went into the field of carbonic cultivation in the North among those whose loved ones had disappeared and advised them to cultivate and plant one tree in the name of the disappeared. In addition to this concept, she set about in counselling those families whose loved ones had faced the war and are no more. She offered them the mental ability to stand on their own. For commitment in the field of trauma counselling and her ability to continue in counselling in other fields, Sister Rodrigo was felicitated at the event.
Sampath Abeykoon founded the Matale Youth Sampath Circle at a crucial time when everything was at a standstill in terms of uplifting mental health. He carried forward with the slogan say no to war or peace means life serving as a promoter of peace to people in need.
Born in Matale in 1975, Sampath Abeykoon commenced his education at ChristChurchCollege, Matale and was engaged in the medical outfit of Saint Johns Ambulance Brigade where his prowess made him a consultant of their services.
By 2000, a post was offered to this young gentleman in Yukthiya and Ravaya and by 2007,Sampath came in contact with Sunanda Deshapriya and was in the field with him on media reviews because he served as a human rights activist. In 2007, Sampath involved himself with the website groundviews in order to secure the human rights of all.
His commitment to uphold democracy and for his untiring work with the voiceless people of Sri Lanka in defending and campaigning for their rights as a journalist and human rights activist, he was saluted by the Human Rights Office.
