Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today it seems that President had become the Finance Minister while the Finance Minister had become the President.

He told journalists at the Abhayaramaya temple that the finance minister was acting beyond his powers.

Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views in response to a question on the sale of lotteries at Rs.30 despite the President’s opposition.

“Such a thing would not have happened in my time,” he said.

Mr. Rajapaksa said the President was trying to evade his responsibilities all the time and added that a President could not do so.

“The President, as the head of the Government, cannot run away from his responsibilities when something wrong has been done by the Finance Minister or the Prime Minister,” he said.
