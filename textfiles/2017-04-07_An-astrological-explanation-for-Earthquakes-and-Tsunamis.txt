Mundane Astrology is an important branch of Astrological Science as it deals with the effect and influence of the Zodiac and planets upon the earth in general and the countries, cities and segments of world population in a wider sense.

 

Earthquakes – an interesting subject under Mundane Astrology 
The prediction of earthquakes in different parts of the world is one of the most interesting subjects that comes under Mundane Astrology.

 

On the heels of a Lunar or Solar eclipse
According to Mundane Astrology, earthquakes very often come close on the heels of a Lunar or a solar eclipse.  But there are several other factors that singly and in combination lead to earthquakes.

 

Tsunamis in December 2004 and March 2011 
The term, Tsunami was quite alien to the people of Sri Lanka until the country was hit by a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on December 26, 2004 which left tens of thousands of our countrymen dead and a greater number homeless.   


In more recent times, an earthquake of 8.08 magnitude on the Richter scale that struck the North-East coast of Japan on March 11, 2011 triggering 13-metre tidal waves left about 20,000 people dead. The effects of this great earthquake were felt around the world from Norway’s fjords to the Antarctica’s ice sheet.


Astrologers had predicted these devastating Tsunamis.  However, it was after the catastrophic events that the predictions made by astrologers in terms of the principles in Mundane Astrology had begun receiving media publicity.

 

Prediction by Astrologer Richard Noelle 
It was the British Astrologer Richard Noelle who took centre-stage in the recent discourse aimed at accounting for earthquakes and Tsunamis when he predicted the 2011 Tsunami shortly before the disaster during an interview with the ABC Radio.

 

Theory relating to Supermoon  
Noelle during this interview explained that the Moon will enter the maximum perigee on March 19, 2011 bringing it closer to the earth than it had been for the last 18 years and the effect of this perigee would be heightened by the Full Moon occurring at the same time. 


Noelle had predicted that such a close perigee - a Supermoon – a term coined by himself- would disturb the Earth’s tectonic integrity so much, it would trigger major earthquakes and even volcanic eruptions.


Some scientists say that the Moon being at its closet to the earth in its orbit and being the Full Moon would not affect the internal energy balance of the earth.


However, John Vidale, Seismologist at the University of Washington at Seattle has conceded dramatic ocean tides do trigger earthquakes.  Another American seismologist William Wilcock has said: “The effect of tides on seismic activity is greatest in subduction * zones such as the Pacific North East where the tectonic plate is sliding under another.


Astrologer Noelle in support of his theory and prediction has referred to a series of earthquakes in the past which has coincided with the occurrence of the Supermoon.

 

  Uranus unleashing a vast surge of energy
Accounting for 2011 Tsunami that hit Japan, some astrologers ascribe the event to Uranus transiting in the last degree of Pisces. In Mundane Astrology, Uranus is considered as one of the most evil planets supposed to unleash a vast surge of energy when he is about to enter the next sign.
Footnote: subduction means the action or the process of one part of the earth crust moving underneath another.
