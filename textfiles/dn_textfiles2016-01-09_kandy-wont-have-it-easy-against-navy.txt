Kandy won't have it easy against Navy

Absorbing rugby is in store for the rugby fans when the unbeaten defending Dialog League champions Kandy Sports Club takes a Navy Sports Club in their Dialog League inter Club rugby tournament match to be played at the Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy on Sunday, January 10th with the kick off at 4 pm.
Kandy Sports Club started off the season well scoring heavily against Sri Lanka Air Force, CH and FC, Police and Sri Lanka Army and at one time averaged nearly 50 points per match. But in their last two matches this has been not the same as in their matches against CR and FC and Havelocks Sports Club they won by small margins. Both matches were played in Colombo. Does this mean that Kandy Sports Club had reached peak too early or that the opposition were equally strong or was it complacency. This will be known after this game.
Kandy-Navy match has always been a thriller since the sailors turned around some six years ago wining both the League and Knock out titles. Last year Kandy came back into reckoning winning both the League and knock out titles. The Dialog League knock out finals for the Clifford Cup against Police Sports Club was a lop sided one as Kandy won 77-7.
Kandy has an old score to settle with Navy as they lost the final match of the League 11-12 but yet squeezed through to win the League title on bonus points. It would have been a different story had Navy scored a try. Kandy made many mistakes in this match including the spot kicking. They cannot afford to make mistakes of this nature in this game as it cold end up their unbeaten record for the season.
Kandy Sports Club are a strong force in their home territory at Nittawela where they reign supreme and they have lost only a handful of matches during the past two decades. Having a record like this and playing before their home crowd with plenty of ground support Kandy Sports Club should ramp home winners unless the sailors could utilise their torpedoes effectively in their firing line.
