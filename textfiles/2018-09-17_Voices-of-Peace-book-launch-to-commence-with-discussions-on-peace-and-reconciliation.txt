Weaving together the personal experiences and stories of combatants actively engaged on either side of Sri Lanka’s ethnic conflict, Sri Lankan researcher and author, Sarah Kabir will launch ‘Voices of Peace’ on Wednesday, 26 September 2018 at 5.30pm at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. 

Aimed at supporting lasting peace and advancing the difficult work of national reconciliation in a post-war Sri Lanka, Voices of Peace shares the stories of 10 former LTTE cadres and 10 Sri Lankan Military personnel who were each actively engaged in the conflict providing a cathartic platform for these unheard voices to share their stories and provide readers with an objective and compassionate window into the protracted conflict. 

In sharing these stories, the author hopes to encourage empathy, meaningful public discussion and the continuation of dialogue between individuals, communities, and the nation as a whole, in order to positively influence national policy on peace and reconciliation.
