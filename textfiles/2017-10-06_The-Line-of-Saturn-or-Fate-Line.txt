The Line of Saturn  or  Fate Line


	



 

There is no definite starting point for the line of Saturn which is often called the Fate line.

 

Location
It starts from many places, very often from the base of the hand and runs towards the Mount of Saturn. In certain cases, the line originates from the base of the palm and runs towards the Mount of Saturn after a series of breaks.

 


What the line signifies
The Fate line signifies the career of the subject. The line is considered a favourable marking on the hand, for it is said to bring luck to the subject depending on the degree of its strength.


This line is missing from many hands. But it does not mean that the subjects are unlucky.


It has been found that certain persons having no Fate line nevertheless have achieved success as businessmen and entrepreneurs by the dint of hard work.

 

Material success
In some cases, the Fate line originates from a point on the Life line and runs to the Mount of Saturn. Such subjects would achieve material success in life and also greatly benefit from the assistance extended by relatives. If the Fate line rises from the Mount Luna or Moon, the subject would gain wealth thanks to the financial assistance or guidance from a female, possibly mother.


The Fate line starting from the centre of the palm and running towards the Mount of Saturn signifies success in life by one’s own efforts. He is the architect of his own fortune.


When the line rises from the upper part of the hand, the best period of one’s life would begin at the latter stage of one’s life. If the line rises at the base of the left hand, but it rises at a higher point in the right hand, it indicates the original career plan of the subject has varied due to his laziness, or the influence of an outside source or a disappointment in love.


If the line is deep and distinct, the subject would possess capabilities the use of which would bring him great success.

 

Short line indicates period of good fortune
If the line is short, the good fortune would be restricted to the period of life it represents.


A thin Fate line indicates the presence of opportunities for success, but the subject should take the advantage of those opportunities to attain his full potential.


A broad and shallow Fate line is little better than having no line. If this is the only thin line in the hand, when the other lines are thick and deep, the subject would confront many obstacles in life at frequent intervals.


A chained Fate line would mean a career marked with hardships. But if the chaining is confined only to a part of the line, the hardships too would be confined to the period the chained part represents. Islands on the Fate line in certain cases indicate conjugal infidelity. An island on the Fate line of a woman with a chance line running from Mount of Luna to it would mean love for a married man.
An island at the start of the Fate line would mean some trouble relating to a parent which would affect the subject’s home life. It may also relate to prolonged delicate health or financial difficulties affecting parents.


Cross-bars cutting the Fate line represent impediments to the career. Both hands should be examined to ascertain whether the breaks are part of the natural plan as represented by the Fate line or whether the breaks point to circumstances such as ill health or results of wrong calculations made or wrong actions committed at different times in life.

 

Other peculiarities
In many cases, the Fate line is clearer and deeper on the left hand than on the right hand which signifies that many  troubles are self-made and we can alter our fate if we really want to.


Should the Fate line end at the Head line, the career of the person would meet a serious check or a radical change. A new line starting from the Head line would men a new career.


A deep Fate line stopping at the Head line signifies a misfortune causing a setback to the career or a deep disappointment in love. All lines cutting the Fate line cause setbacks to the subject at the ages that the lines cutting the line represent.
