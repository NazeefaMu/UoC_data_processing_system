Countrywide blackout: PM calls for report


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry to submit a report to him on the countrywide power failure that lasted for about four hours today.

Ministry Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda said the Prime Minister had wanted a report because this was the second countrywide blackout experienced during the last five months.

In September last year, the country experienced an island-wide blackout for more than three hours due to a technical fault at the Ceylon Electricity Board.

Dr. Batagoda said that two committees would be appointed to look into the matter and submit a report.  “An internal committee comprising CEB officials and an external committee with technical experts will be appointed to investigate the matter,” he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
