A Cargills Bank official revealed some of the Bank’s plans that will support changing customer needs. 
How would you rate your organisation’s contribution to the financial services industry? 
From its inception, Cargills Bank has been providing value propositions to all customer segments of the country. As a bank that is customer driven, we maintain a strong commitment towards empowering individuals and organisations towards the optimisation of their financial goals. 
We believe that our greatest contribution to the local industry is the delivery of our unique promise of ‘Banking on the Human Spirit’ - which takes customers beyond the standard concept of banking.

With all the digitalisation taking place today, customers are always looking for convenience, mobility and easy access. 
Cargills bank continuously strives to reach out to our customers to provide ever more convenient ways to utilise their banking services, encouraging customers to interact with the bank at their convenience and comfort, while allowing its customers to stay abreast with their finances.  To cater to this growing trend, we extended many customer touch points through Internet Banking, our website, e-statements and SMS alerts, a few initiatives of many more to come.
How would you describe the market competition and what strategies do you employ to differentiate? 
Cargills Bank is the newest entrant to the banking domain in Sri Lanka, which is very competitive and pro-growth. 
We differentiate ourselves by expanding our digital-ready infrastructure to reach out to customers. We believe that accessibility and improved reach, digitally and physically, is essential in maintaining our competitive position.
To which segment of the market does the High Return Saver cater to?
The High Return Saver is tailored to the mass segment. However we are also looking at it as an investment opportunity for our customers. 
What are the latest products introduced by the bank?
We recently rebranded the Smart Saver as “High Return Saver” and revised the interest tiers and balance slabs to offer attractive benefits to the account holder. Tailored to the mass segment, we consider it as an investment opportunity for our customers. 
This product has certain unique features which differentiate it from other savings accounts in the market. Firstly, we ensure the highest interest rate and also the lowest slabs of threshold. We offer 8.25 percent interest per annum for deposits above Rs. 250,000. 
This not only gives value for money to customers, but also gives added convenience since Cargills Bank joined with Lanka Pay to enable customers to make withdrawals from over 3,000 ATMs island wide.
