Final mechanism will benefit all stakeholders: Mangala tells UNHRC


	

Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, speaking today at the 32nd Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said that the mechanism that was finally set up to look into alleged war crimes would be one which had the confidence of all the stakeholders, especially the victims, with fair trial and due process guarantees.

“While dealing with the low-hanging fruit immediately, we have strategies and plans to deal with the more serious and controversial issue of setting up a judicial mechanism with international assistance. Sri Lanka is no stranger to international assistance and participation with many investigative and forensic experts having worked with us in the past,” he said and added “there are varying views on the nature, level and role of international participation. Divergent views are indicative of a healthy democracy and consultative process. Despite such divergent views, however, I can assure you that the mechanism that is finally set up will be one which has the confidence of the stakeholders, especially the victims, with fair trial and due process guarantees”

He said the Government was united and firm in its commitment to achieve reconciliation, development and ensure non-recurrence while some were waiting for us to fail in our journey of reconciliation.

“There are some who doubt our sincerity to achieve reconciliation, and also a few who want us to fail. For those of our friends who are genuinely concerned, and want Sri Lanka to succeed, every delayed second seems to appear as an eternity, and they fear that the Government has lost its way and the political will to succeed. Then there are others who are misinformed and misled and therefore are unbelievers or are unaware of the achievements so far. And of course there are those who pray that we won’t succeed,” he said in his statement.

The Government recognises that, in order for the transitional justice process to achieve the desired objectives, the necessary mechanisms should be properly sequenced, integrated and coordinated.

Minister Samaraweera rejected claims by some quarters that sequencing of mechanisms was a delaying tactic or means to omit the component of justice.

“Some had started raising alarm bells that sequencing of mechanisms was a delaying tactic or a means to omit the component of justice. This is incorrect. The Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms is already consulting experts and is working on obtaining the required training and capacity-building for the relevant mechanisms – investigating techniques, forensic expertise, prosecutorial strategies – so that when the designs are in place, following the consultation process, the required expertise for the mechanisms will also be in place,” he said.

He also said while consolidating many of the democratic changes achieved within the first 100 days, the government had begun taking action on all fronts, related to strengthening good governance and the rule of law; promoting and protecting human rights; fostering reconciliation; and achieving economic development; while also engaging and working closely with the international community in a constructive manner that benefits the people of Sri Lanka.
