Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested UNP MPs, currently in China as part of a parliamentary delegation, to cut short their visit and return to the country by April 1, sources from the Prime Minister’s office said yesterday.

UNP MPs Ranjan Ramanayake, Dr Kavinda Jayawardene, Dr Tusitha Wijemanne and Rohini Mumari Wijeratne are part of the delegation headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who were scheduled to return on April 3.

Sources said the reason for the request was to prepare for the no-confidence motion submitted against the Prime Minister. It is expected to be taken up for debate on April 4.

Meanwhile, some UNP seniors are to inform Mr. Wickremesinghe that they would focus on the no-confidence motion at the UNP Working Committee meeting on Thursday. (Yohan Perera)
