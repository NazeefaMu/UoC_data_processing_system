Janaka, senior scion of the Dambulla political clan distributed goodies bought with his decentralized budget funds among the needy in the area at a ceremony held at his residence the other day.

 


Former purohita Janaka, his son now a provincial purohita and a large group of local politicos were among those present at the ceremony. 


The ceremony was proceeding on a high note when suddenly a drone flew over them causing some excitement and agitation among the participants. 


Meanwhile, some volunteers who had risen to the occasion had managed to catch several ‘strangers’ and question them, but had failed to elicit any vital information from them.  However, in the commotion that ensued, those detained by the volunteers too had managed to disappear.
