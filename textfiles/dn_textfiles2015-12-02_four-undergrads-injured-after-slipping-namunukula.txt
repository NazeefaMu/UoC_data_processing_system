Four undergrads injured after slipping off Namunukula

Four members of a group of university students injured by slipping and falling off the Namunukula mountain range they were ascending, were admitted to the Badulla General Hospital on Monday night.
Badulla Police rescued them from a thorny thicket with the help of residents. Police said the students are residents of Ampara, Galle, Kurunegala and Wennappuwa.
They were among a student group belonging to the Sri Jayawardenapura, Uva Wellassa and Sabaragamuwa universities who had set out on the expedition on Monday night.
It is believed that they would have slipped and fallen after losing their way in the heavy misty conditions.
