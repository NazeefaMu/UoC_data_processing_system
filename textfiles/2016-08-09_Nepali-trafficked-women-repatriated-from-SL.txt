A total of 19 Nepali trafficked women have been repatriated from Sri Lanka with the joint efforts of the Nepalese and Sri Lankan authorities, The Himalayan Times reported today.

The 19 Nepali trafficked women were hiding 55 km west from the Sri Lankan capital Colombo and one of them, however, managed to flee.

“Our embassy in Colombo, in coordination with the Sri Lankan authorities, is trying to find if more trafficked Nepali girls are hiding there so that they can be repatriated,” said the Nepal Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson.

Earlier today, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had directed the foreign secretary to immediately rescue Nepalis stranded abroad, including in Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka.
