Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to give an opportunity to MPs to discuss with Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando the Bond Commission reports.

“There were reports that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. Owner Arjun Aloysius had given money to 118 MPs but that some 166 individuals had cashed cheques received from him. The debate on this matter is ongoing and we need to gather more information,” he said and asked the Speaker about the progress in getting all sections of the Bond Commission reports sent to Parliament.

“You have said you got pages C350-360 of the reports. However, we need to know what had happened to pages C1-349. Therefore, we request you to arrange for the MPs to talk to the presidential secretary and get this contentious matter clarified,” he said. (Yohan Perera)
