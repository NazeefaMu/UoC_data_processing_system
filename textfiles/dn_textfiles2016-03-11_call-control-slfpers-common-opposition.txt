Call to control SLFPers in Common Opposition

 
The direction the country is heading depends on the decision to be made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the SLFP members in the Common Opposition. He should control them and prevent them from supporting the gang of robbers in the common opposition, LSSP Leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said.
He said a new Constitution is now being discussed in Parliament where tough action will be taken against stubborn SLFP MPs.
Dr. Karunaratne said all traditional Sri Lankan Left leaders have become prisoners of racism.
He stressed the importance of strengthening Left politics and Leftist political parties.
