A 24-hour help desk has been established at the office of the Chief of Defence Staff where any information that the public believes could be helpful to the government to help crackdown on acts of sabotage or any action thought to endanger national security could be reported.

In a special press breifing held at the Department of Government Information today, its Director General Sudarshana Gunawardana said that although the government had taken the necessary steps to control the situation, the security forces have received information that some opportunists were getting ready to disrupt peace and unity in the country.

He requested the public to reach the help desk via mobile 0711261261 or via email helpdesk@dgi.gov.lk to receive assistance or to give details of any suspicious activity. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
