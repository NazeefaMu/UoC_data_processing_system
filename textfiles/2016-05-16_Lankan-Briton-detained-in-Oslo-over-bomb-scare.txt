A Briton and a Sri Lankan were arrested at the Rygge Airport near the Norwegian capital of Oslo, over a bomb scare in a Ryanair flight, the BBC reported today.

However, police said the scare was a misunderstanding.

The two men who were detained by police after their behaviour aroused suspicion were later released.

The situation was "back to normal", police said in a tweet. Ryanair said the passengers would also depart. No suspicious devices were found on the plane.

Reports said the men had been heard arguing loudly and the word "bomb" was overheard on the flight, which had been due to leave at 18:55 local time.

The evacuation in Norway came hours after Manchester's Old Trafford football stadium was cleared after a suspicious item was found.

It was later confirmed by British police that the item had been "accidentally" left by a private company after a training exercise.
