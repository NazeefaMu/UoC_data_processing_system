Arrangements have been made to send a branch (shoot) from Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura to the Sri Lankan Temple in Berlin, Germany on September 30 with the patronage of Sri Lankan Ambassador in Berlin Karunasena Hettiarchchi.
The Bo-sapling was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena by Ven. Iththepane Dhammalankara Thera, when the President participated in the Pinkama ceremony held at Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi premises in Anuradhapura last Friday.
A number of Maha Nayake Theras are to participate in the delegation to Berlin with the Bo-sapling and Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) Chairman Asela Iddawela will be in charge of this delegation. Pix courtesy GSMB Media unit
