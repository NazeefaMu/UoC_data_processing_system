This is the moment a cheetah was so taken aback by its prey turning the tables, that it simply put its tail between its legs and ran off - chased by what had been its lunchtime snack just moments before.
The cheetah was pursuing an animal which appears to be a wild dog or bat-eared fox in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve, but rather than finishing it off, the big cat  found itself being chased off by its prey half its size.
The photographs were taken by Jorge Alescano, 42, from Spain, who said: 'It was as if the dog just decided he didn't want to be dinner any more - it was amazing. We've got no idea why the cheetah reacted like this.
'It's a mystery to me because the dog would have been an easy meal for the cheetah if he had carried on with the pursuit.
'He dramatically stopped the chase and caused the cheetah to lose balance but what happened next was even more surprising.
'He then began to chase the cheetah away which was incredible to watch - it was a once in a life time opportunity.' Picture courtesy dailymail
