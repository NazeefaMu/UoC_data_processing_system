The two brothers aged 12 and 13 years are the sons of inaugural Foxhill Supercross champion rider Shane Gunawardena. Shane is the coach, manager and consultant to these two champions. Jaden and Aaron created history by being the youngest and only Sri Lankans to win this prestigious racing title. The duo attracted world attention with their victory and placed Sri Lanka on top of the Asian racing map.
Jaden and Aaron earned a 10-point lead to become champions at the three-stage championship worked off in Japan, Thailand and Taiwan. They outclassed riders from Japan, Thailand, India, Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Nepal to win the ACRR Championship.
The two riders have maintained a superb record so far in both local and international circuit and proved their potential to triumph against seasoned riders. 'Daily News' Sports interviewed the two star riders.
Q: What was your greatest inspiration to enter racing at a very tender age?
J&A: It was our father. The two of us are lucky to have a dad who is passionate with motorcycles and racing. We basically grew up with bikes and started riding at a very young age. In fact photographs show that we rode motorcycles before we rode bicycles. The first motorcycle given to me (Jaden) fitted with guide wheels for my second birthday. I (Aaron) remember using the motorcycle but cannot recall how old I was when I first rode.
Q: How do you explain your very first racing experience?
J&A: Jaden - I rode a PW 50cc in the under 10 event at the age of 6 and also rode a KTM 50cc in the under 13 and under 16 event the same day. I finished 4th in the under 10 event but crashed in the under 13 and under 16 events. Aaron - My first race was at 5+ on an extremely muddy track in Unawatuna. I tried my best to keep up with my elder brother and cousin Jacques, but cannot remember which place I finished.
Q: What is your favourite annual local event and why is it special?
J&A: We enjoyed our motocross riding Foxill, Gajaba, Gunners, Sigiriya and Nuwara Eliya events back then, but after we switched to road racing we guessed it would be the Katukurunda race, as it is one of the glamorous meets. But sadly we could not continue with our local races, as we needed to focus on the Asian rounds. The bikes that we ride for the Asian rounds are different to the ones that are raced out here. Having to practice on two different types of bikes might be a bit hard as we only have Sundays to practice. We hope that Sri Lanka would accommodate the same events that are run in Asian rounds here, as it would benefit us as well as riders lined up to go for the Asian rounds.
Q: Who are the toughest contenders to compete with?
J&A: Locally we would love to race with the riders who are champions as there is much to learn riding with faster riders. Internationally it is always a challenge and we are benefitted with our weight and probably our age too.
Q: How do you cope with the tension when competing with experienced and elderly riders?
J&A: We simply love it, as the faster they go, the faster we go. Our dad has always told us that we have an advantage with our weight, and he does not see why someone could be faster than us. During practice and qualifying we generally leave the paddock first, so it gives us a chance to ride with or behind the best riders and learn their lines.
Q: Tell us about your international racing career?
Jaden, Aaron and father Shane Gunawardena with the awards.
J&A: We have participated in nine Asian tours and one European tour. We have our eyes set on the Red Bull Rookies Cup in Spain. Jaden - I got an opportunity last year to participate in it, but was knocked out in the finals. Our dad has promised to take us to Spain during the August holidays if we do well in our mid-term exams, so we would be practicing on the same circuit the Red Bull Rookies Cup takes place in October this year. It seems that everyone who competes in the Red Bull Rookies Cup has had a pre-run on the circuit, so hopefully this time we'll have a chance.
Q: What made you the champions at Asia Cup Road Race?
J&A: We guess we had luck on our side, as the Japanese riders were the fastest during qualifying, but on race day both riders crashed out in the same event and left the doors open to the other Asian countries to clinch the gold in the first race. Jaden - I charged from the back of the grid and clinched first place and Aaron who finished in the front bunch had to go back about 9 positions after a penalty for overtaking on a yellow flag. The second race at the opening round was scary as I had a nasty crash and had to be air lifted out of the circuit unconscious and with fractures to my collar bone. The gold for Sri Lanka seemed impossible after I crashed, but Aaron did the honours in a photo-finish beating the Philippine rider by one thousandth of a second.
Q:How does the father-son combination bring you success?
J&A: I guess our dad would have to answer this as he puts us through a strenuous fitness program and spends most of his time setting our bikes up for our weekly ride. He is our greatest strength and his guidance led us to success.
Q: How do you explain the danger and thrill in racing?
J&A: We have crashed many times and broken a few bones but I know for a fact my mum hates racing, we do not express any dangers of racing and there has not been any need to do so. Every ride is a happy moment and I am sure our dad enjoys watching us too. He always tells us that the day we do not enjoy what we do, it is time to quit.
Q: What are your future ambitions?
J&A: When we were young we wanted to be astronauts and fighter pilots, but now our focus is on a World Championship. All we need is a circuit to practice and lots more young riders coming in, so hopefully the federation would help us.
Q: What are your other interests and talents apart from racing?
J&A: Basketball has been another passion and the two of us have captained our school team for the past 3-4 years, currently I captain the under 15 team and my brother Aaron captains the under 13 team.
Q: How do you strike a balance between studies and racing?
J&A: This is the hardest part we were okay with our racing, schools activities and studies until last year. Nine Asian tours and one European tour were too much for us. Although we had additional tuition to cover up the lost work, we could not catch up and maintain our positions in class.
Q: Any particular rider you admire the most?
J&A: Valentino Rossi.
