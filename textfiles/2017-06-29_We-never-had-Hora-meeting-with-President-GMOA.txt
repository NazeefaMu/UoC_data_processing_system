We never had ‘Hora meeting’ with President: GMOA


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today refuted the claims made by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne that President Maithripala Sirisena did not meet the GMOA officially and the meeting with them was informal.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they never had any informal or secret discussion with any party since past and would continue to do so even in future.

“Minister Senaratne should have at least understood to whom he had made these allegations.  The minister should not have insulted the President in such a manner. We had an open and official discussion with the President,” he said.

However, the minister yesterday said that the President had not met the GMOA officially and agreed to meet them unofficially. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
