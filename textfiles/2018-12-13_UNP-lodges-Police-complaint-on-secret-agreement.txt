UNP MPs M. Marikkar told a media briefing that one Kondadeniya was behind preparing this document.

He said Leader of Opposition R. Sampanthan had also expressed his willingness to give a statement to Police on the matter.

“I informed the Leader of Opposition about the complaint I lodged with the Police and Mr Sampanthan told me that he was also willing to give a statement to the Police,” Mr Marikkar said. (Yohan Perera)
