Half of Badulla District prone to landslide
	
More than half the area of the Badulla District was vulnerable to landslides, National Building and Research Organisation said following a recent survey.
66.91 percent of the land area in the Badulla District is endangered with landslides, the NBRO said.
Badulla Government Agent Nimal Abesiri told a meeting of the District Disaster Management Centre that 79.32sq.kilometres, which was 2.77 percent of the land area, had been identified as high risk area.
He said according to the survey 16.37 percent of the land was medium risk area, and 47.76 percent minimum risk area.
The GA said only an area of 942.92sq.kilometers, which constituted 32.95 percent of the total land area, was safe.
The GA said that the cartography project undertaken by the National Building and Research Organization was in a slow pace due to the delay of receiving relevant information from the divisional secretariats.
However, the Divisional Secretaries pointed out that the residents of the endangered areas were reluctant to provide required information in fear of being losing their traditional habitats.
The GA instructed the officials to launch a public awareness campaign to explain on the programme.(Palitha Ariyawansa)

No survivors after Tu-154 plane crashed
	
A Russian military plane crashed on Sunday in the Black Sea as it made its way to Syria with 91 people onboard, including musicians heading to celebrate the New Year with troops.
The Russian Defence ministry said there had been no survivors after the Tu-154 plane crashed shortly after taking off from the southern city of Adler, south of the Black Sea resort city of Sochi, at 5.40 am local time (0240 GMT).
At least one body was found among debris in the Black Sea.
The plane had been conducting a routine flight to Russia's Hmeimim airbase outside the coastal Syrian city of Latakia, the ministry said.
"Fragments of the Tu-154 plane of the Russian Defence ministry were found 1.5 kilometres from the Black Sea coast of the city of Sochi at a depth of 50 to 70 metres," the ministry said, adding that search and rescue groups had been dispatched earlier to locate the missing.
Among its 83 passengers were Russian servicemen as well as members of the Alexandrov Ensemble, the army's official musical group internationally known as the Red Army Choir, who were headed to Syria to participate in New Year celebrations at the airbase.
There were also eight crew members onboard, the ministry said. (Telegraph)

Police should give news under RTI, says Officer
	
The Police was under obligation to provide news to private media institutions, especially when the Right to Information (RTI) Act is in effect in the country, the National Police Commission (NPC) Secretary Ariyadasa Cooray said today.
The Police had earlier said that the Police news would not be sent daily to private media institutions through emails with effect from December 21.
The IGP was reported to have instructed that the daily updates be sent only to State media institutions.
The decision was taken after the uproar in the country resulting from IGPs telephone conversation during a recent meeting in Ratnapura. The news was telecast on a private media channel.
Police sources said the Police Chief had also instructed his officers not to invite private media representatives to any functions held at the Police Headquarters in the future.
Mr. Cooray said the commission will look into the matter if they received a complaint from such media institutions.
We are still unaware about such thing. However, the Police should be able to provide news especially when RTI is in place. We could discussed the matter and come to a decision following a meeting, he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Raviraj: Sumanthiran says will appeal against verdict
	
Jaffna District TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumathiran said yesterday that his political party was not satisfied with the verdict in the former Parliamentarian Nadaraja Kavirajs assassination case and would file an appeal against the verdict.
The judgment is indicative of the peoples distrust in the countrys Judiciary. It is in this scenario that we demand an international panel of judges to probe the alleged war crimes. A lawyer who watched the interests of the aggrieved party, I will file an appeal, he said.
Replying to a query from the media weather his opinion was based on his belief that the accused in the case themselves were responsible for the murder, he said he would not level a direct allegation against them, but it was sad to find that the government failed to bring the real culprits in the broad daylight crime to book and left them at large for a long time.
He said this situation was not acceptable to the TNA. (Romesh Madusanka)

SL Christmas carols service printed out wrong lyrics for Hail Mary prayer
	
A Christmas carols service in Sri Lanka mistakenly printed out the lyrics to gangster rapper Tupac's hit song 'Hail Mary' on thousands of its service programmes.
The unfortunate mix-up took place at the Catholic 2016 Joy to the World Festival, which was held at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.
Instead of reflecting on the traditional Catholic prayer's message of how 'blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus' - attendees were presented with lyrics reading: 'I ain't a killer but don't push me, revenge is like the sweetest joy, Next to gettin' p***y.'
Sri Lankan journalist Jithendra Antonio uploaded photographs of the carols program to his Twitter account, tagging Pope Francis and CNN.
The lyrics were printed on over 1,000 flyers for the event - which is heralded as one of the biggest carol services in the country, according to Pedestrian TV.
The event was billed by organisers as 'a fund-raiser for poverty alleviation projects jointly organised by the Archdiocese of Colombo and St. Joseph Vaz Trust.'
