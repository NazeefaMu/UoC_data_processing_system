Spokesman Prasad Kollambage said this matter was taken up with the Bribery Commission earlier and a complaint would now be made to the FCID.

Meanwhile, the GMOA has written to President Maithripala Sirisena to consider the request made by the Mahanaayaka Theras with regard to the SAITM issue.

It said it was awaiting the President’s decision on the SAITM issue. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
