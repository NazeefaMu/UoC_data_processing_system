Green with envy?


	



 

The constant media publicity that a young opposition Diyawanna politico from Rajarata is getting has irked his party colleagues.

 


They have found that this young politico figures in news stories in the print and electronic media practically every day. Very often a TV channel or a national newspaper would publicize a comment he makes on some topical national issue.


The colleagues have even complained to the party leadership that the young politico is going out of the way to hog the limelight.


A liquor bar owner, a one-time patron of his father, has come forward to bankroll the young politico’s political activity, they say.
