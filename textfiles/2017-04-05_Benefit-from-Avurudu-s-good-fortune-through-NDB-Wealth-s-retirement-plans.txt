With Avurudu again upon us, many have already started celebrating the age-old rituals that are a cornerstone of a good harvest season, helping usher in good fortune for the new year. One such tradition is ganu denu, the first financial transaction of the season.
Over the centuries, this ritual has seen a marked change. From its beginning when the woman of the house dropped a cloth-wrapped coin into a well, drawing a bucket of water in return, to today’s version, transacting at an auspicious time with an already well off business, to benefit from their good luck.  
So, at this crucial juncture, as well as being spiritually renewed and prepared, it’s time to take control of your personal finances and embark on a few key, first steps in securing your financial future. In fact, NDB Wealth’s expert wealth managers stand ready to deliver to you this worthwhile life change, advising you on the best financial planning options currently available to you. 
According to NDB Wealth, proper financial discipline and planning is particularly important today, with nine out of 10 people being concerned that their retirement nest egg will not last throughout retirement. Additionally, eight out of 10 are worried that their current savings regimen may never hold up, meaning that they will have to work past retirement age.
