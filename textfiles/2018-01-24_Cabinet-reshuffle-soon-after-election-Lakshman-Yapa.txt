Addressing the weekly news briefing of the SLFP at the party office, Minister Abeywardane said that the expected Cabinet reshuffle would be target oriented and it would address the current economic, social and political issues.

Asked to comment by the Daily Mirror on President Sirisena’s recent remarks at a political rally, which he would take over the economic and financial management of the country this year, Minister Abeywardane responded in the affirmative.

Answering to another query whether President Sirisena would change the portfolios of Finance and Planning and Industry in order to handle the economy, industry and exports to realise his mission, Minister Abeywardane said that it could be possible. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
