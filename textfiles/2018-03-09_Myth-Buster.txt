MYTH: Over the counter cough medicines are okay to use without a prescription.

BUSTED: “It’s not possible to purchase cough medications sans a prescription in Sri Lanka as it’s illegal. I strongly discourage it as certain people use cough medication to get sedated or get a high. Over the counter medicines could prove to be dangerous if you use them without being prescribed as they tend to have many side effects. I strongly discourage the practice of buying over the counter medication without a doctor’s prescription,” said Doctor Deepal Perera, Consultant Pediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo.
