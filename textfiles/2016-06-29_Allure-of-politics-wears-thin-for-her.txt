Allure of politics wears thin for her!


	



 

A dainty fair Diyawanna member has grown sick of politics, they say. This fair one who has gone out of the public eye for some time is said to be also unhappy over certain rumours that have gone viral. 

 


She has also publicly charged that a rival politico, whom she describes as the prime author of all her troubles has long been scheming to banish her from the political scene.


A very unpleasant situation she had to face when she was going round the flood-hit parts of her constituency in the recent past added to her woes. Some flood victims blamed her for forgetting them in their worst hour; some others shut their doors on her face, they say.


Disillusioned, the comely lady has vowed not to contest an election again, they say.
