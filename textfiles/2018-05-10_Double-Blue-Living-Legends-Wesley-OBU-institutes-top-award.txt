The Wesley College OBU in Colombo is taking steps to make this event a night to remember. This Prestigious gala awards ceremony will be held at the Wesley College hall. Most old boys of this school hold nostalgic memories of walking through its hallowed portals - thereby making it the perfect ambience to celebrate the contribution of distinguished recipients of the ‘Double Blue Living Legends’ award.
