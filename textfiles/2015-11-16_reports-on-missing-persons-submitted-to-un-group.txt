The Dead and Missing Persons Parents Front (DMPPF) yesterday handed over a report to the visiting members of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (WGEID) at the UN Compound in Colombo.
Ananda Jayamanne, the Chairman of the Front said the report which consisted details on more than 5,000 missing persons, was handed over to a special representative of the WGEID.
“WGEID representative accepted our detailed files on the missing persons. There are details that both the Army and the LTTE were responsible for some of the incidents of disappearances. The representative was quite surprised to see the amount of our detailed files and he assured that he would get back to us with the procedures of their future activities into our report,” he said.
Earlier, a group of DMPPF members on Saturday visited the UN compound to hand over the report but only Mr. Jayamanne was allowed to submit the report and no representative had been present to accept the report at that time.
The WGEID headed by its Vice President, Bernard Duhaime, arrived in the island last Monday (9) for a 10-day-visit to facilitate investigations into issues related to disappearances.
The mandate of the WGEID is to create a platform between the families of missing persons and the government to address and resolve the issues faced by them and to observe measures taken by governments to prevent future incidents of disappearances.
The WGEID will conclude its activities in Sri Lanka tomorrow (18) and will hold a news conference tomorrow at the UN compound. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
