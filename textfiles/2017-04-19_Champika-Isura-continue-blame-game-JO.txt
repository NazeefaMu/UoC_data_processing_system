Champika, Isura continue blame game: JO


	

The Joint Opposition (JO) today said Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka kept dragging in finding solutions to the Meethotamulla garbage issue by always disagreeing with each other and even today they are continuing the blame game.

MP Gamini Lokuge said they too attended some of the meetings held to discuss the issue but the meetings always ended without any outcome as the Chief Minister and the Minister couldn’t come to an agreement.

“What they did to Kolonnawa, will become the fate of Karadiyana, Kesbewa as well. Though the court has allowed the Waste Management Authority to dump only 350 Mt of garbage at Karadiyana, the garbage trucks had attempted to dump more and only had stopped following protests,” the MP said.
