The Government will change the name, “Port City” to “Financial City” to underline the fact that China would not be given outright ownership to the block of land, Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said today.

“The previous government had agreed to grant outright ownership of the Port City to China. This is against the law and we will not do it. We will introduce a new mechanism the modalities of which would be revealed at a future cabinet briefing,” he said.

The minister said a section of the port would be extended to Ja-ela adding that the government had already initiated several development projects.

He said the people would be able to enjoy the benefits of the decisions taken by the government by December.(Ajith Siriwardana)
