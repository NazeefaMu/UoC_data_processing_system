President Maithripala Sirisena today said that he has not decided whether to contest the next presidential elections or not but said he will continue to do politics as long as he was alive.

"I have not decided whether to contest the next presidential elections or not. Yet, I will continue to do politics as long as I am alive. I am a political animal. It is in my genes. I will do politics with or without positions," he told media heads at the President's House this morning.
