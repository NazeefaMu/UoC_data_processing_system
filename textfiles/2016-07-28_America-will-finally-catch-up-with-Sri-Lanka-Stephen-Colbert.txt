America will finally catch up with 1960 Sri Lanka: Stephen Colbert


	

Hillary Clinton could be the first female president and America will finally catch up with 1960 Sri Lanka, said “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert.

Stephen Colbert, on Tuesday’s post-DNC Convention show, celebrated Hillary Clinton’s breaking the penultimate glass ceiling to become the first woman to receive the nomination of a major political party.

Colbert noted that Clinton’s historic achievement marks the end of the line for runner-up Bernie Sanders.

“If you’re a supporter of Bernie, you should be proud,” he said. “So many of the things that you fought for are now in the Democratic Party platform — fifteen-dollar minimum wage, overturning Citizens United, claiming your Hacky Sack as a dependent. It’s all in there.”

“This means Hillary Clinton could be the first female president,” said Colbert. “And America will finally catch up with 1960 Sri Lanka.”
