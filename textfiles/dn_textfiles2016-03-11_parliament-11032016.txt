[Parliament]-11.03.2016

 
Bill will ensure 25 pc women representation
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday the government has presented a Bill to ensure the 25 percent women's representation in local government bodies to empower women in Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister made these remarks at a ceremony organised by the Women Parliamentarians Circle to celebrate International Women's Day held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
"We expect to have at least 25 percent of female members at Pradeshiya Sabha and Urban Council levels after this election. After the law is enacted, there should be a system to select women representation to the respective bodies. We can expect two types of women candidates in local government bodies once the law is enacted. One is from the typical political arena with a family political background or such a close association in politics. Other category comprises women from various social and professional sectors. However, we need both of these categories.
"There are lots of problems on violation against women and these problems should be directed to the Consultative Committee on Law and Order. With the task of the "Grama Rajaya" concept which is proposed to be implemented from next year, Women Parliamentarians Circle have a major role to play in that system," the Prime Minister said.
 
MR committing harakiri, Fonseka to offer razor
Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa commits harakiri if proved stealing even a dollar, he was ready to offer him a razor.
"The former President offered to commit harakiri if anyone proves he had stolen at least a single dollar. I am ready to give him the razor. The razor I am giving is a new and latest one," he said.
Field Marshal Fonseka was making his maiden speech in Parliament yesterday.
The former Army Commander said: "We now hear various complaints from the Rajapaksa family when the law is being implemented. His words are ironic. If they had engaged in wrongdoings, they must be prepared to face repercussions. The charges against Mahinda Rajapaksa and his foreign accounts should also be investigated.
"The allegations include giving money to the LTTE through RADA, misusing Rs. 90 million for his parents' tombs, misusing tsunami funds, the sil cloth case and the gold that went missing in the North, among many others."
He also stressed that the investigations on the controversial White Flag incident should definitely be carried forward.
He said the public, the international community and the people in the North and East have a right to know the truth behind this story.
Commenting on the Geneva resolution to investigate into the alleged human rights violations he said, "As the former Army Commander who commanded the war, I clearly state that these investigations should proceed transparently and in an internationally accepted manner. For that, we have to allow foreign observers and consultants to support in this regard. I commanded the war in accordance with all international humanitarian laws while protecting human rights. If there had been a few who breached those, they must be dealt under the law," Fonseka said.
Fonseka also urged the President and the Prime Minister to carry forward the investigations on the killings of Thajudeen, Prageeth Ekneligoda, Raviraj and Lasantha Wickrematunga in a proper manner.
"The same group was behind all these murders. Those who were holding power at that time were behind those incidents. Both Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa tried to accuse me for the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunga. Even now some CID investigations are progressing on the wrong path. I am not afraid of false accusations and I urge the President and the Prime Minister to carry forward these investigations without any interference and punish the culprits," he said.
He also requested the President, the Prime Minister and those in the legal field to expedite the investigations on corrupt politicians as 6.2 million people who voted to bring this government into power expected it from the government.
Minister Fonseka accused that the 2005 and 2010 Presidential Elections were totally corrupt. "In order to win 2005 Presidential Election Mahinda Rajapaksa paid USD 2 million to Prabhakaran to get the people in the North to boycott the elections. This money was handed over to Prabhakaran by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa. I state this with responsibility as I was privy to this information when once I met Basil Rajapaksa at the Presidential Secretariat. Basil said that a hill country politician was also there when this happened. According to the PTA the punishment for the offense of financing terrorists is the capital punishment. We are still not late to look into these incidents," he asserted.
"In the 2010 Presidential Elections, six counting centres were attacked. There had been no counting of votes in Kandy, Kurunegala, Ratnapura Gampaha, Anuradhapuara and Matale districts. The election results were manipulated and sent for the Elections Commissioner. The then Elections Commissioner got 'stressed' and nobody knows his whereabouts now. He is afraid to talk," Fonseka observed.
The minister also challenged MP Mahinda Rajapaksa to come to the chamber to listen to his speech, and added that he could take a point of order to counter challenge him. He said there were plans to cheat the 2015 elections too, but those did not work because there were foreign polls observers.
"If not he would have done the same, and plans had been made to arrest Common Candidate Mathripala Sirisena and a large number of his supports by deploying the Army," he said.
The former Army Commander also accused that the war tribunal process against him was completely flawed. "I was arrested to take revenge because I contested against him at the Presidential Elections. The lawyer who appeared for the plaintiff during the case against me was granted promotions and various other gifts. Recently, Basil Rajapaksa had accepted that they took political revenge from me. They took revenge from 35 senior army officers who supported me," he said.
Minister Fonseka said even though Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa tried to get the full credit of war victory, they were even unaware of the date the war actually ended. "When Mahinda Rajapaksa was making the victory speech in Parliament, the war was still going on and Prabhakaran was alive. The body of Prabhakaran was found later that day," he said.
"I had to leave the country in the last week of war due to an urgent matter, but I knew that the war would come to an end by that time. It was during that week, disgraceful acts such as the white flag incident happened. These tarnished the good image we had," he said.
Fonseka also said that if Uduwe Dhammaloka thera was arrested for keeping a wild elephant illegally, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa should also be arrested for the same offense. He said this illegal activity had the patronage of the then ruler of the country.
 
Thilanga orders immediate action on defunct Wi-Fi facility
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday ordered to immediately look into as how the Wi-Fi facility in the Parliament chamber was not functioning and why the digital screen that telecast live proceedings at the Jayanthipura car park had stopped.
The Deputy Speaker made this comment when Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake raised a point of order complaining that the Wi-Fi was not working.
"MPs have been given the Wi-Fi facility in the parliament chamber but that service was not functioning properly. I want to know whether it was a technical fault. A large sum of money is being spent on Parliament and it must ensure that we are provided with required facilities and services without interruption," he said.
UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana also complained that the digital screen at the Jayanthipura car park of the Parliament was not functioning.
The Deputy Speaker said that he would look into these matters and take remedial actions.
 
No media personnel abducted in white vans during MR's second term
Not a single abduction of media personnel deploying white vans had been brought to book during the second term of office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
It was noted in a document tabled by Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka in response to a question by UPFA Colombo District MP Udaya Gammanpila. The document was tabled by Minister Karunathilaka on behalf of Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake.
MP Gammanpila inquired if there were any conclusive evidence available to the effect that media personnel were abducted using white vans to which the document responded negatively.
 
Paddy production increased by 35 pc - Ravi
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told Parliament yesterday that the paddy production has increased by 35 percent after this government came into power.
"This is due to the brave decisions it made and also due to the incentives given to the farmers," he said.
The minister was participating in the debate on several orders and resolutions under the Excise Ordinance, Finance Act, Stamp Duty and Customs Ordinance.
"We expect an excess stock of paddy between 15 percent and 20 percent this year too.
"The tax income of the country is used for the benefit of the people. Our objective is to eliminate middlemen and give all the benefits to paddy farmers. The Opposition brings no confidence motions against me frequently. But, I ask where is the joint opposition and who is their leader? Certain media has reported false information that there is a shortage of fertiliser.
But now it is harvesting time. There is actually an excess of 25 percent of fertiliser stocks in the market which is above the limit required by the farmers. Although the previous government implemented a "Let us cultivate and build the nation" programme, most of the benefits were enjoyed by the middlemen who used to receive around 40 percent of the income from paddy leaving only a pittance for the farmers.
In order to drive a production economy, each farmer will get a Rs.25,000 as a fertiliser subsidy for the first time in the history.
"We have commenced a programme to halt imports by 2018 and increasing exports by developing local production. During the last seven months, the Customs income had increased by 13 percent and our target is to increase it by Rs. 985 billion this year. During the previous regime, the Excise revenue was only around Rs. 2,000 million per month. Now we, earn more than Rs. 9,000 million in certain months from Excise revenue.
 
Rice exporting dream, a reality now - Amunugama
Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said in Parliament yesterday that a dream of exporting rice to other countries has become a reality now.
The minister was participating in the debate on several orders and resolutions under the Excise Ordinance, Finance Act, Stamp Duty and Customs Ordinance.
"For the first time, there is a large stock of excess paddy and the development in the irrigation sector is also a reason for this achievement. Plans are afoot to include paddy cultivation under the commercial sector as well. We will take steps to give the right place for the farmer community in the society and a mechanism will be created for that. We will not leave any room for middlemen to get enriched and are always committed to protect farmers and consumers. A mechanism will be created to increase the compost fertilizer manufacture and there is a huge demand for it," Amunugama said.

CPC not earning profits as alleged - Weerakkody
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation is burdened with debts and still a litre of petrol is sold at a loss of Rs. 21 while one litre of diesel is sold with a profit of Rs 17, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
He said that even the Indian Oil Company (IOC) is not earning massive profits as the Opposition is attempting to point out.
Weerakkody insisted the Opposition not to portray a wrong picture that the CPC is earning massive profits.
He was responding to a special statement made by the Chief Opposition Whip, Anura Kumara Dissanayake under standing orders 23(2).
Minister Weerakkody said Rs. 138 is spent on refining a litre of petrol while Rs. 100 is spent for the same process. He said due to this reason the CPC is not earning profits.
Dissanayake pointed out that the IOC is earning a massive undue profit by selling fuel in Sri Lanka and suggested the government at least have to impose an extra tax and get that amount to the government if the government could not pass the benefit to the people.
 
Electricity provided to 150,000 poor families
The Good Governance Government has provided power to 150,000 poor families at government's cost of Rs. 40,000 each, Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
He said that the government has procured electricity to those families without charging a penny and added that the government spent Rs. 40,000 to provide electricity to each applicant.
The minister made these observations in Parliament yesterday taking part in the debate on several orders and resolutions under the Excise Ordinance, Finance Act, Stamp Duty and Customs Ordinance.

'Yoshitha undertook 27 foreign tours in 100 month Navy service'
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's son Yoshitha Rajapaksa had undertaken 27 foreign tours during his 100 month service in the Navy, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena said yesterday.
He made this observation in Parliament responding to a question by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa for oral answers.
He said that Yoshitha had visited the US, the Great Britain, Ukraine, Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Russia, Singapore and New Zealand.
When the minister was inquired could the government reveal the costs of those visits, Wijewardena said that he would look into the details of expenses and inform the House on a later date.
The minister said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had approved and recommended to the Navy Commander that Yoshitha could engage in those tours.
When asked to inform the House of the criteria adopted by the Defence Ministry in naming an officer for the Navy Units Combat Employment and Actions Management Course conducted by Ukraine National Defence University and of the qualifications met by Yoshitha as a Naval officer with enrollment number NRX 2431 to enter that course, the minister said the then Sri Lankan Ambassador in Ukraine informed the Defence Ministry in a letter dated July 8, 2009 to nominate a second lieutenant or a lieutenant for the course.
"The Navy Commander had recommended that Lieutenant Yoshitha Rajapaksa be sent for that course," the state minister said.
"After Yoshitha had completed that course, the Ukraine National Defence University offered him another three year course".
He said that the offer had been informed to the then Defence Secretary by the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Ukraine in a letter dated June 7, 2010. Lieutenant Rajapaksa enrolled in that course as he had been recommended by the Navy Commander.
Yoshitha Rajapaksa had been assigned to the President's Security Division on March 21, 2012.
"The then Sri Lankan Ambassador to Ukraine was one of Yoshitha's uncles. Another uncle was the Defence Secretary," MP Dr. Jayatissa said.
"One uncle sends invitation and another approves. How come this happened? Would not such actions demoralise the qualified officers in the services," the MP asked. The state minister said this could happen and said the MP should have asked that question either from the former President or the former Defence Secretary. When MP Jayatissa inquired if the ministry would hold an inquiry against Yoshitha, the state minister said that Yoshitha was currently in remand custody and added that even if Yoshitha would be set free by the Court, the Navy or the ministry could hold an internal investigation on him.
