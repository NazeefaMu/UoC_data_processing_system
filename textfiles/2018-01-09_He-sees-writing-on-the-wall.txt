A leading henchman of a former powerful political leader who has gone into a panic following a tip-off that he was to be arrested soon has begun delegating the functions and responsibilities of his position to his loyalists, they say.

 


He has also reportedly asked that he be relieved of his present position and that it be offered to the youngest son of the former political leader.


He is said to have amassed much wealth from the government contracts he had been executing over years. 


He is also frequenting various shrines these days praying for divine intervention for his deliverance, they say.
