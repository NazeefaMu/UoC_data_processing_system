Great explorer, doctor ends journey


	



 

The recent death of Ariyasena U. Gamage was a great loss for not only the medical profession, but also for people who are thinkers, philosophers and explorers.   


One outstanding feature about him was that he was never dogmatic about his views as a Western medicine doctor and was willing to explore other truths of the world. In a recent article penned by Science writer and journalist Nalaka Gunawardene for Sunday Ravaya he says that Dr. Gamage had even seen some positives in wearing ‘pirith nool’, a thread blessed by a black magician and often worn by patients. The doctor had said that the ‘pirith nool’ can help the patient because there were positive human thoughts and wishes to get well embedded in it.   

 


He even chose to do a study of alternative medicine for his PHD. For this purpose he travelled to countries like India, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia and China


 


He began his career in 1979 as Medical Officer Health (MoH) of Mawanella. He also served as Medical Director Kegalle and even lectured at Peradeniya University. However, later in his medical career, he opened a dispensary in Mawanella and served the public. It’s said that the late Dr. Gamage had used kind words when dealing with patients which many vouch had a soothing effect on patients who came for treatment.   


Though he was open to the ideas of others the doctor was also on a mission to squash myth and educate people. For this he used media tools like Youtube, television, newspaper and books. Some of the books that are popular with his readers are ‘Mata Aduma Dan Suwai’ (I’m now cured of my wheeze), Rajek Unath Ledek Unoth (What’s the use of being a doctor who’s sick) and Puthgalikai Rahasigathai (Private and confidential).   


He also wrote extensively on rebirth and invested time and energy on pursuing this subject. He was a critic of myths and often condemned the talk about the existence of pills which made females lose the ability to bear children. He also squashed several myths associated with the decease cancer. 

 


Dr. Gamage led a happy life which was full of accomplishments. He bid goodbye to this world on March 29. The funeral of the Dr. Gamage was held at his hometown in Mawanella on April 1. 


 

Research on alternative medicine 
Much if his time and energies went in to doing research on alternative medicine. Dr. Gamage affirmed that alternative medicine practised in Sri Lanka could be used for primary cures. He even chose to do a study of alternative medicine for his PHD. For this purpose he travelled to countries like India, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indonesia and China. Apart from ayurveda, he also explored the possibility available for curing patients using Sri Lanka’s very own native treating methods.   


Dr. Gamage also invested time on doing research on rebirth. He was a patient listener when stories were related to him on these lines. But the doctor was never hasty in forming his opinion on these subjects. He didn’t hesitate to question myth and never spoke about any such subject without thoroughly analysing its content.   


He also wrote extensively using print media and even regularly spoke on the subject ‘sex education’. He used media to open a column by the name ‘Wedek unath ledek unoth’ (What’s the use of being a doctor if you are sick). By this time he was diagnosed with cancer. (Hodgkin’s Lymphone). 

 

 
Saradiel Village 
Dr. Gamage created time for other activities. Being a doctor consumes most of the hours when a medical practitioner is awake. But he had time to travel and explore. One of his patients Aloysius Perera, a teacher, had once told him about how Uthuwankande Saradiel had hid in the balcony at his residence in Mawanella. This residence is now known as Galle Gedara. It’s said that hearing such stories had prompted Dr. Gamage to build ‘Saradiel Village’ in Uthuwana, Mawanella. He had later said that he had build this village to honour the country and the medical profession.   


An old boy of Richmond College Galle, Dr. Gamage married Dr. Manel Dissanayake, also a product of the same medical college he graduated from. They raised two daughters who also went on to become doctors themselves. According to media reports their offspring also chose doctors as their life partners.   


It’s somewhat perplexing for us laymen to fathom that doctors who prescribe medicine for us also fall ill. Dr. Gamage was said to have been in the best of health before being diagnosed with cancer. But the positive nature of this man didn’t allow him to succumb to depression despite the cancer within his body spreading rapidly and causing disruption within.   


Dr. Gamage led a happy life which was full of accomplishments. He bid goodbye to this world on March 29. The funeral of the late Dr. Gamage was held at his hometown in Mawanella on April 1. This candle in the medical profession that blew out, leaves a void for a person who explores, does research and analyses matters that are outside the medical syllabus but are important to people.  
His medical colleagues and close associates will vouch that Dr. Gamage was one of the best examples for a person who never removed his thinking cap.
