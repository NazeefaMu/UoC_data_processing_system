Is he being iced out?


	



 

The need had arisen for the country’s law enforcement chief the other day to hand over an important dossier to Number One.  This was soon after his getting a shelling from Number One for some cranky affair of his. 

 


The LE chief had asked Number One several times to give him an early audience, but had received no positive response. Meanwhile, a foreign trip he had to make had intervened.


So, he got a subordinate one to hand over the dossier to Number One minutes before his taking the flight to the foreign destination.


However, Number One had made no response to him regarding the dossier sent to him through the subordinate one either, they say.
