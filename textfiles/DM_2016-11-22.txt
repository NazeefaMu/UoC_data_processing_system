A high-end hotel coming up in an archaeological reserve
	

A high-end hotel is said to be coming up on an archaeological reserve in the Matale district.

The approval for the hotel project had been granted during the previous regime. However, no authority concerned appears to know as to who launched the project or approved it. Nevertheless, it has come to light that the construction work is making headway under the direction of a yahapalanaya politico.
Priceless artifacts of archaeological and historical value are being bulldozed into smithereens in the process of constructing the hotel, informed sources say.
Intelligence sleuths have now been asked to submit a report on the hotel project and the politicos involvement in it, they say.

The cabinet subcommittee appointed to advise the FCID will be disbanded as it has not met for a year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
"I have never got involved in the investigations, and the cabinet subcommittee which advises the FCID has not met for a year to decide on the investigations," said Mr Wickremesinghe, in response to opposition MPs who wanted to know who actually advised the FCID, as there was provision for a cabinet subcommittee headed by the Prime Minister to advise them on investigations.
Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella said that the subcommittee should be abolished if was inactive.

## Title: Fitch rates National Insurance Trust Fund AA-(lka)/Stable

Fitch rates National Insurance Trust Fund AA-(lka)/Stable
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned National Insurance Trust Fund Board (NITF) a National Insurer Financial Strength Rating (IFS) and National Long Term Rating of AA-(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
NITFs ratings reflect strong ties with the government of Sri Lanka (B+/Negative), a strong business profile as the only reinsurer in the country, high capitalisation and conservative investment policy, which are counterbalanced by its high dividend payouts that are likely to continue.
NITFs ratings reflect strong ties with the government as it is fully owned by the state and effectively functions as an arm of the state in the implementation of some policies, such as serving segments that are not covered by commercial insurers, and its role as the only reinsurer in the country. NITF was also the fourth-largest contributor to the governments consolidated fund in 2015. NITFs rating reflects its strong business profile, which is underpinned by its role as the only reinsurer in Sri Lanka and its established products, including Agrahara, which according to NITF is the largest health insurance scheme in the country covering all state-sector employees and their families, as well as management of the Strike, Riot, Civil Commotion and Terrorism fund, which is available to all insurers in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan insurance regulation requires all non-life operators to cede 30 percent of their reinsurance to NITF. Inward reinsurance premiums accounted for 22 percent of NITFs gross written premiums (GWP) in 2015. Fitch expects reinsurance to be a key growth area for NITF, in line with industry growth in a country where penetration of non-life insurance is low.
In 2015, NITFs new management obtained retrocession to cover its reinsurance portfolio and as a result, claims stemming from the May 2016 floods in Sri Lanka were manageable. Flood-related claims caused NITFs combined ratio to increase to 97 percent in 1H16 from 53 percent in 2015. NITF has since reinstated the retrocession cover for rest of 2016 after exhausting it for flood-related claims.
NITFs profitability is high as reflected in the pre-tax return on assets of 39 percent in 2015, mainly due to the low combined ratio of 53 percent compared with the industrys 99 percent. NITF benefits from a low expense ratio - 14 percent in 2015 compared with an industry average of 36 percent - a reflection of its product portfolio, which requires smaller operating scale compared to a typical insurer, because most of NITFs business is directed from the state.
NITFs capitalisation metrics are strong, although it is still not reporting its regulatory risk-based capital to the authorities. Shareholders equity/total assets and non-life net premiums written/shareholder equity were strong at 73 percent and 0.9x, respectively, at end-2015. However, Fitch is of the view that capitalisation could come under pressure if there is a significant increase in the already high dividend payouts to the government in the future.
NITFs reserving lacks sophistication, in Fitchs view. NITF is in the process of getting its reserves externally certified and NITF expects reserving to improve with the inclusion of incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves. According to management, NITFs liabilities are mainly short-tail in nature, and estimated to be less than one year. NITF is only permitted to invest funds in government securities and equity of hospital projects under the NITF Act. NITFs entire investment portfolio is currently invested in government securities.

'Govt. misled people by concealing actual amount for education'
	
The Joint Opposition yesterday said the government had concealed the actual amount of budget allocation for the education sector in the Budget 2017 and that they had misled the whole nation by doing so.
Addressing a media briefing, its MP Bandula Gunawardana said the government had curtailed the budgetary allocation for the education sector by Rs. 175 billion in the Appropriation Bill 2017 for the first time .
In the Main Estimates of Budget 2017, it has mentioned that Rs. 10,000 million has been allocated to develop 3,577 primary schools. In the same time, adding a technical note it was added that only Rs. 6,500 million was allocated for 2017 targeting 500 primary schools, Mr. Gunawardana said.
He said it had also mentioned in the Main Estimates of Budget 2017 that Rs. 15,000 million was allocated to develop 10,000 secondary schools and added that the government had deceived the people by adding a technical note to mention only Rs. 7,170 million was allocated for 2017 targeting 250 secondary schools.
He said the Finance Minister had deceived the Education Minister through this conceal; A huge amount of funds were allocated to education sector in the budget from its surface. But the government had attached technical notes in order to conceal the actual amount of funds allocated, he added.
He said when the Yahapalana Government was coming to power they had continuously stressed out to the people that they would allocate 6 per cent from the Gross National Product (GNP) to the education sector.
At present they have failed to keep up their promises. Rs. 800 billion should be allocated to match up with a 6 per cent from the GNP for the education sector according to their claims. There is not even a tax income in Sri Lanka which is compatible to that amount. It is impossible, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Lakmal fined for breaching ICC Code of Conduct
	
Sri Lankas Suranga Lakmal has been fined 50 per cent of his match fee for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during his sides match against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Monday, the ICC announced today.

The incident happened during the second over of the match when Lakmal dangerously threw the ball back at Zimbabwe opener Chamu Chibhabha at the strikers end when the batsman had stayed in his crease after playing a shot and was not attempting a run. The throw missed the batsman and went to the wicketkeeper, but such a reaction from the bowler was deemed as contrary to the spirit of the game.
Lakmal was found to have breached Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game.
In addition to the sanction imposed for his breach of Article 2.1.1, two demerit points have been added to Lakmals disciplinary record.

Pursuant to Article 7.6 of the Code, if Lakmal reaches four or more demerit points within a 24-month period, they will be converted into suspension points and he will be banned. Two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player.

Following the conclusion of the match, Lakmal admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Javagal Srinath of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees. So, there was no need for a hearing.

The charge was levelled by on-field umpires Michael Gough and Langton Rusere, third umpire Richard Illingworth and fourth umpire Jeremiah Matibiri.

Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

Lankan in US complains about being paid for zero work
	
A Sri Lanka-born New York university staffer has filed a complaint against his varsity for paying him nearly USD 100,000 a year for zero work after he felt sick of spending most of his time at work feeding birds and squirrels and watching cricket, the Indian Express reported on Monday.
Harendra Harold Sirisena joined City University of New York (CUNY) in 1995 after serving four years in the bursars office. His early years at City Tech College were highly productive and successful, the article said.
But in 2003, without any explanation, he was suddenly replaced by a young assistant and reduced to a menial biller. His sole assigned task  plugging names onto form letters  takes up an average 30 days a year, leaving him idle for 171 days, or 86 per cent of his time.
I long for the opportunity to earn my salary, Sirisena, who has a masters degree from Columbia University, said.
For the past 13 years, Sirisena has collected his full USD 96,000 paycheck, more than USD 1 million in all. But he has spent most of that time in isolated cubicles  listening to music, watching cricket or soccer games on his computer and doing math problems or feeding the birds and squirrels at a nearby park.
Sometimes Ive fallen asleep. It just happens, Sirisena, 72, was quoted as saying by the New York Post.
Sirisena says he has written many letters to City Tech officials begging to get work commensurate with his skills, education and experience, but to no avail. What a waste. I could have done so much. They dont care, Sirisena said.
Sirisena wants to expose the sham and agreed to come forward before the state inspector general, issuing a scathing report charging that CUNY mismanagement and lax oversight has resulted in waste, abuse and lavish spending.
Sirisenas lawyer, former state Attorney General Oliver Koppell who plans to file an age and ethnic-discrimination lawsuit against CUNY, calls his situation absurd.
Its a betrayal of the public trust, especially in light of the constant claim by university officials that the state is inadequately funding higher education, Koppell said.
Sirisenas issue is being explored by the university and at this point theres nothing the college can say, said Stephen Soiffer, special assistant to City Tech President Russell Hotzler.
A spokesman for CUNY Chancellor James Milliken said the grievance was referred to CUNYs human resources office.

Lankan jailed in Singapore for posing as Briton
	
A Sri Lankan national had posed as a Briton and produced a forged India passport to enter the departure gate-hold room for a departing flight to New Zealand, a Singaporean court heard.
According to Strait Times, the man and the Briton he was posing as - both unemployed - were each jailed 12 months for their respective offences on Tuesday.
Vigneshwararaja Kajanan, 20, admitted to deceiving a SATS customer service officer into believing that he was Mark John by producing a forged India passport and a Singapore Airlines (SIA) boarding pass bearing Marks name at the Terminal 3 departure gate-hold room on Sept 8. He also admitted to having the forged India passport.
Mark pleaded guilty to one count of intentionally aiding Vignesh to cheat by personation. The 45-year-old Briton had passed an SIA boarding pass for the Sri Lankan to deceive the SATS officer into allowing him to enter the gate hold room.
Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordon Li said that Vignesh wanted to migrate to New Zealand and sought the help of a man called Jogarajah. Jogarajah asked him for his particulars and copies of his photographs, and told him to apply for a Sri Lanka passport.
On Sept 2, Jogarajah handed Vignesh a forged India passport bearing the name of Mark John with Vignesh's photograph on it. He told him to use the passport to enter New Zealand.
Jogarajah also handed him an air ticket to depart for Singapore on Sept 4, and Vignesh flew to Singapore on that day. Three days later, Jogarajah instructed him to check in on Sept 8 for a flight to Colombo, scheduled to leave on Sept 9.
Vignesh complied and was issued a boarding pass at the airport. He was instructed to go to the men's toilet at Crowne Plaza Hotel at Terminal 3 to meet "Mark" to collect a boarding pass for a flight to Auckland, New Zealand.
He went to the toilet and met Mark who had placed a boarding pass in the sink. Vignesh picked up the SIA flight boarding pass and placed US$400 in the sink. Mark took the money and both left.
Vignesh immediately went to the immigration counter, using his Sri Lanka passport and the boarding pass for Colombo.
He later entered the gate-hold room for the Auckland flight after producing the forged India passport. He was then arrested by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers.
The court heard that Mark was in Cambodia in August when he received a call from Raj to fly to Singapore to hand over a boarding pass to a male subject. Mark agreed and Raj transferred US$200 to him via Western Union.
Mark was arrested at Harbour Front Terminal on Sept 9 when he tried to leave for Batam, Indonesia.
Vignesh and Mark could each have been jailed for up to five years and/or fined for cheating by personation. The Passports Act offence is punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 and/or a jail term of up to 10 years.

Minister Ganesan said it was a human right for people to be able to celebrate their late loved ones, but added that it was wrong to do it with a political motive.
He said the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) also celebrate Il Maha Viru Samaruwa in the South to commemorate their heroes.
They can do so as they are not a proscribed organisation anymore. But People in the North cannot use the name of the LTTE to commemorate their loved ones as it is a proscribed organisation, he said. (Ajith Sriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)

President has full confidence in the armed forces: Minister
	
Government Spokesman and Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday debunked the claims made by MP Dinesh Gunawardana that there was a possibility of the military launching a coup.
He told journalists that President Maithripala Sirisena, who as the Commander-in-Chief was fully confident of the three armed forces.
The minister said the MP had spoken of a imaginary conspiracy out of malice and ill feeling with the government. He said no reports of any conspiracy had been received by the intelligence units of the three armed forces and the police.
Politically and socially bankrupt politicians make this kind of irresponsible and antisocial statements hoping they can destabilize the country and incite communal clashes. They imagine they could grab power by damaging the Government's reconciliation and development process through such malicious and baseless propaganda. They should be aware that the unity government is on a sound footing with the blessings of the local and international community. Therefore, there is no room for a military conspiracy against the government. It is purely a figment of their imagination as they are uncertain of their political future, the minister said.
"These bankrupt politicians claim that disabled soldiers are disappointed about the clashes that took place during a protest recently. It is public knowledge that the clashes were staged by a few Bhikkus and joint opposition members even after knowing very well that President Sirisena had by then granted their demand for full pension benefits after retirement," he said.
While condemning any suggestion of a military conspiracy, the people in Sri Lanka and abroad would never condone such betrayal under any circumstances.
"In the local front, the government has taken action against those engaged in money laundering, embezzlement and other financial misappropriation under the Rajapaksa regime. The price of essential commodities including fuel and gas had been reduced. Salaries of armed forces and police, pensions of retired public servants, armed forces personnel and disabled soldiers have been increased. Therefore, it is the wishful thinking of these daydreaming politicians to suggest this conspiracy theory, the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Residents urged to evacuate after M7.4 quake in Japan
	
Residents of coastal areas in northeastern Japan are evacuating to higher ground following a powerful earthquake that hit Fukushima Prefecture on Tuesday morning.
The Japan Meteorological Agency says the magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture around 6 AM. It occurred at a depth of 25 kilometers.
The agency issued warnings for tsunami waves of up to 3 meters for Fukushima Prefecture and neighboring Miyagi Prefecture. Tsunami advisories have been issued for other prefectures along the Pacific Ocean.
A tsunami measuring 1.4 meters was observed at Sendai Port in Miyagi.
Municipal authorities in prefectures in the region issued evacuation orders or advisories to residents.
There have been a couple of reports of minor injuries.
The Tokyo Electric Power Company says it has restored a cooling system at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant that briefly stopped after the quake.
Firefighting officials in the city of Iwaki in Fukushima said a fire broke out at a petrochemical complex in the district of Nishikimachi, but was extinguished at around 6:40 AM.
The central government set up a task force at the Prime Minister's office to gather information about the quake.
The Tohoku Shinkansen bullet train services were suspended but later resumed. Operations of some other Shinkansen lines are still suspended or delayed. (Source: nhk.or.jp)

She has lost faith in political deities
	
It is a commonplace practice among the ordinary people in this country to seek the grace of a popular guardian deity whenever they find themselves in some difficulty. But the politicians and their family members would usually find a way out of any jam through the influence of a higher political authority. However, an exceptional case where the better half of a purohita had sought the grace of a popular guardian deity to secure the release of her husband remanded in connection with a fatal road accident has become the topic of an animated discourse in the public domain these days, they say.

When her purohita-husband was remanded, the good lady had made a vow to a popular deity with a prayer asking that her husband be released from remand custody without any delay. When her prayer was answered, the couple had visited the devalaya dedicated to this deity located in the Vanni area along with a large group of well- wishers with the usual offerings to pay the vow.

SL doctor who killed husband, appeals to stay in Australia
	
A Sri Lankan-born doctor who bludgeoned her husband to death with a mallet after years of abuse is appealing to the Immigration Minister to allow her to stay in Australia after serving her sentence.
Dr Chamari Liyanage is serving a four-year prison term in Greenough Regional Prison after being convicted of the manslaughter of fellow doctor Dinendra Athukorala at their home in the West Australian town of Geraldton in June 2014.
She was acquitted of the more serious charge of murder and has been eligible to apply for parole since June.
Her application for parole is due to be heard early next year but if granted, she is likely to be moved into immigration detention and could be deported because her visa was cancelled whilst behind bars.
In an appeal to Peter Dutton obtained by 7.30, Liyanage said she took full responsibility for what had happened and there was little to no chance of her reoffending.
"I would also like you to consider my personal circumstances leading to the offence," she wrote.
"I was a victim of long term abusive and violent relationship and I believe that my judgement had been affected and considerably impaired at the time."
Liyanage said she feared for her safety if deported to Sri Lanka.
"I am afraid and concern (sic) about safety of my family in Sri Lanka if I have to return home," she wrote.
"My presence, media publicity and stigma associated with this case will bring hostilities towards my family  I am worried that will jeopardise the lives of my family."

SL support for Palestine remains firm: Mangala
	
Sri Lanka has not changed or reversed its stand on Palestine and will uphold the policies maintained by former governments, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament today.
He said this in response to a question asked by MP Dinesh Gunawardane in the House on an earlier date.
Sri Lanka stands firm in its support to Palestine and will work in solidarity with that nation," the minister said adding that divisions among the members of the UNESCO executive board on a resolution which contained controversial and contentious elements led to Sri Lanka abstaining from voting when the resolution was taken up.
On October 13, 2016 seven nations including Algeria, Morocco. Oman, Lebanon, Egypt, Qatar and Sudan brought a resolution pertaining to Al-Askar Mosque, Al Halam, which contained controversial and contentious elements on which 58 members of the UNESCO executive board could reach a consensus. We were aware that in this question taken by Palestine there were concerns on the language used. The sites used in the resolution were referred to only by Arabic names. This caused divisions in the executive board. The Director General of UNESCO was of the opinion that Jerusalem is a city of major monastic religions -- Jewish, Christian and Islam. Denying Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions will undermine the integrity of the site. Sri Lankan people knew the destruction and pain caused by the conflict. Just as much as it strives to ensure such violence won't reccur in our country we want to give the world the same message," he said citing the reason for Sri Lanka abstaining from voting for the resolution.
The minister said he had already assured Palestine Prime Minister of Sri Lanka's firm support.
He said Sri Lanka would also maintain bilateral ties with Israel from which country Sri Lanka had sought technological assistance for sectors such as agriculture.
The minister also said a considerable number of Sri Lankans were working in Israel. (Yohan Perera)

Turning a bitter time into a pastime
	

Some Diyawanna backbenchers forced to be present in the House in view of the ongoing debate on the Budget 2017 have taken to playing cyber games to kill time.

These backbenchers  mostly newcomers  are said to be unhappy that they have been compelled to attend the debate on the Budget continuously for several days, and they have found cyber games a good pastime.
Party leaders have made it compulsory for the backbenchers to attend the sittings these days expecting them to familiarize themselves with the working of Parliament apart from ensuring a steady quorum in the House. But all indications are that these members are not interested in fulfilling either purpose, they say.
