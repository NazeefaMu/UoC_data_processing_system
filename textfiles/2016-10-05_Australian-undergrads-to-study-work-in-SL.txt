One hundred Australian undergraduate students will study and undertake work placements in Sri Lanka in 2017 through the Australian Government’s flagship New Colombo Plan Education Programme.

“Students from seven Australian universities will study a broad range of subjects including health, economics, engineering and management in Sri Lanka”, Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson said.

“These are exciting projects that demonstrate many opportunities for Australian students to deepen their academic and life experiences through study and work placements in Sri Lanka.

New Colombo Plan mobility students will return to Australia with new insights and understanding about Sri Lanka and new friendships that will last a lifetime,” High Commissioner Hutchesson said.

The New Colombo Plan is a signature initiative of the Australian Government to lift knowledge of the Indo-Pacific by supporting Australian undergraduate students to study and undertake internships in the region.
