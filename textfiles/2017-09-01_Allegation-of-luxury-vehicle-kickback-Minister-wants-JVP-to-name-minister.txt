Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday asked JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti to name the Minister accused of getting a luxury vehicle as inducement for awarding the contract to extend the southern expressway.

Mr. Handunnetti charged at a media conference the cost of the project had been overestimated because of commissions involved. He said there was the alleged involvement of inducement in terms of a luxury vehicle.

Mr. Kiriella said the cost increased because of extra viaducts that would be built to avoid floods.

“I ask Mr. Handunnetti to name the Minister using this vehicle,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
