Jayarathne. The President added, “I informed the Minister of Buddha Sasana that the presentation of these bills in parliament should be postponed, as we felt that we should obtain the advice and ideas of the Mahanayakes. We were concerned that a debate or any confrontation with the Sangha should be avoided and postponed the presentation of these bills indefinitely”
