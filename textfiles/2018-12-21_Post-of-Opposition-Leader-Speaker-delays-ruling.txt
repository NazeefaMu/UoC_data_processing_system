Post of Opposition Leader: Speaker delays ruling


	

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today announced in Parliament that he had decided to delay his ruling on the post of Opposition Leader because of fresh submissions made by some MPs.

The Speaker was supposed to give a ruling on this matter today.

“I have received written submission from some MPs calling for the appointment of a select committee to determine whether those who joined the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) can remain in Parliament as UPFA MPs and on the opposition leader’s post.

I have received a letter from UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera on this matter. TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran also sent me a letter earlier and made a fresh submission and therefore I will have to go through all these documents before making a ruling,” the Speaker said.
