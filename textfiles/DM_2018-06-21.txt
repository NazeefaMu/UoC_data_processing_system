A salute to Sri Lankas hospitality sector stakeholders
	
Finally, the countrys hospitality sector stakeholders have got it right! Better late than never. This week saw the gathering of about 200 State school principals at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo to listen to the countrys leading hoteliers about the job prospects the industry offers to Sri Lankas youth. The idea was to inspire the principals and make them envoys to convince the students who may not opt for tertiary education, that a job in Sri Lankas booming tourism and hospitality sector would offer wider and better prospects when compared to driving a three-wheeler. 
We praise the Tourist Hotel Association of Sri Lanka (THASL), Ministry of Education and the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo for taking the much-needed initiative. Instead of complaining that the hospitality industry lacks the required human capital, a genuine effort like this, which could realistically address the issue at least to a certain extent, needs to be commended. 
The principals and teachers of state schools, specially, out of Colombo and a few other key cities such as Kandy and Galle, could really play a major role in providing the required human capital for the countrys hospitality sector by making the students aware of the opportunities available in the industry. Also, they can help break the stigma that exists, specially within the Sri Lankan rural society, towards young females joining the hospitality trade. 
According to the countrys tourism minister, about 100,000 new workers will be required to staff the projected doubling of the star-class rooms in the tourism sector within the next three years. 
Although Sri Lanka is called a highly hospitable nation, most of the time, the services even at star-class hotels are not on par with some of the countries in the Asian regions such as Singapore, Thailand, Hong Kong, etc. But we believe that ingraining a service-oriented mindset to those who work in the hospitality sector can change this. Its a widely accepted phenomenon that it is easy to infuse an idea in someones head when he or she is young. That is why this initiative by tourism sector stakeholders makes even more sense. As they have recommended the authorities should look at introducing tourism into the local school curriculum as early as possible because several years down the line, tourism is set to be the highest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka. 
While acknowledging that paying attractive salaries to lure people to the hospitality sector is important, the industry stakeholders should also be mindful that money is not the only deciding factor for the millennials to join the trade. At the forum, THASL President Sanath Ukwatte mentioned that it was only the hospitality industry that distributed 10 per cent of its revenue (service charge) among the employees, which amounted to nearly Rs.25,000 to Rs.30,000 a month per person. 
But unlike the earlier generations, millennials tend not to work for one employer or in the same field for a longer period of time. Keeping millennials engaged requires flexibility and creativity from the part of the employers. They are keen to find out how their work impacts their workplace and are eager to contribute. They dont want to be treated as workers, who render their services for a salary, but as partners of a team that creates change and makes an impact. Hence the industry also needs to step up its game plan and find ways to retain the talent they attract. 
THASL and other tourism sector stakeholders should only consider this a first step in the right direction. They cannot wait for the government to do things for them. Tourism is a matured industry and they should find ways to address the issues that concern the industry. Hence we salute THASL and other tourism sector stakeholders for this initiative and expect more programmes of this nature in the future too.

## Title: Chandimal appeals against match referee's findings

Chandimal appeals against match referee's findings
	
Dinesh Chandimal has appealed against match referee Javagal Srinaths findings that saw him suspended for one Test after being found guilty of changing the condition of the ball in the second Test between West Indies and Sri Lanka at Gros Islet.
ICC Chief Executive David Richardson on Tuesday charged Sri Lanka captain Chandimal, coach Chandika Hathurusinghe and manager Asanka Gurusinha with a breach of Article 2.3.1, a Level 3 offence, which relates to conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game. While Chandimal has appealed, he could stand to miss both Tests against South Africa in July and further ODIs if found guilty.
On-field umpires Aleem Dar and Ian Gould, and third umpire Richard Kettleborough had charged Chandimal after play on Saturday for changing the condition of the ball in breach of clause 41.3 of the ICC Standard Test Match, ODI and T20I Playing Conditions.
The officials laid the charge after television footage from the final sessions play on Friday appeared to show the Sri Lanka captain taking substance out from his left pocket and putting them in his mouth, before applying the artificial substance to the ball which the umpires viewed as an attempt to change its condition.
Chandimal had pleaded not guilty to breaching Article 2.2.9 of the ICC Code of Conduct after which ICC match referee Srinath held a hearing following the conclusion of the St Lucia Test.
"After reviewing the footage of the incident, it is clear that Dinesh applied an artificial substance to the ball, namely saliva containing the residue of something he had in his mouth, an action which is prohibited under the ICC Code of Conduct," Srinath said in the release.
"The footage shows that upon receiving the ball, Dinesh took something from his pocket and put it into his mouth. After sucking or chewing whatever he put in his mouth for a few seconds, Dinesh then proceeded to spit on his finger and polish the ball with his saliva which would have contained the residue of the artificial substance that he had in his mouth, on two separate occasions.
"During the hearing, Dinesh admitted to putting something in his mouth but couldn't remember what it was, which I found unconvincing as a defence and the fact remains it was an artificial substance.
"In the pre-series briefing held on the back of the ICC Cricket Committee recommendations, both the sides were explicitly told that the match officials would be extra vigilant towards all aspects of fair play, including changing the condition of the ball and as such it is disappointing that this has happened."
According to ICC chief executive Dave Richardson, the cricket committee "viewed" ball tampering as "cheating" which went against the spirit of cricket. "Therefore, they (committee) were very strong that we need to increase the sanctions available for that type of conduct," Richardson told ESPNcricinfo. "So we are talking moving both ball tampering and personal abuse, foul language upto Level 3."
The coach and the manager have been charged for their involvement in the Sri Lanka cricket teams refusal to take to the field in St Lucia at the start of Saturdays play, which caused a two-hour delay in the start of play. This action is alleged to amount to a serious breach of the Laws of Cricket and to be contrary to the spirit of the game. (news18.com)

Compensation also for victims of 1988/89 violence: UNP
	
United National Party (UNP) MP Mujibur Rahman said today the Cabinet memorandum seeking compensation for war victims was not only for ex-LTTE combatants but also for those who were effected by the violence in the 1980s.
He told a news conference that the Cabinet proposal was prepared keeping in mind the recommendations of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC).
The LLRC proposed that justice be meted out to those who were affected by the war. Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D.M. Swaminathan submitted the Cabinet memo after considering the LLRC recommendations. Several persons including those of the joint opposition are attempting to create a public opinion that the government is all out to appease the LTTE. It is not the essence of this proposal. We have to focus on the human perspective and not so much on the political viewpoint,"the MP said.
Hence, dont be deceived by false rumours. Compensation will be paid to the family members of those who died in war and those who sacrificed their lives during the 1988/89 period as well, the MP added.(Sheain Fernandopulle)

Former regime was hostile towards India: Amaraweera
	
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today the country had to face various issues under the previous regime because of its hostile attitude towards India.
He told Parliament that India, which initially supported our country at the UNHRC in matters of human rights violations, later acted against us because of the then government's attitude.
"We made enemies with India. It was a serious mistake made by the previous government. India helped us during the war and at the UNHRC. But it acted against us later because of our policies. As a result, we had to face serious issues such as the ban on fish exports. During the debate on the 1990 Suwaseriya Foundation Bill, India supported us. It funded housing projects in the North and the South. It provided equipment for the Hambantota Hospital and constructed a school in Polonnaruwa. People are reaping the benefits of the Suwaseriya ambulance service donated by India despite various allegations made by the opposition and several others," the minister said.

GMOA tells Wijeyadasa: Issue gazette abolishing SAITM
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today requested Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to issue a gazette notification abolishing SAITM.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the gazette notification should be issued in keeping with the Universities Act.
We urge the minister to issue the gazette notification as assured in order to solve the nine-year long issue. The observations of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should be put forward to solve this issue in a more fruitful manner. The latest stance on SAITM to absorb its students to General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) should be followed by the recommendations of the SLMC. A timeframe should be introduced to end the absorbing of SAITM students to KDU. The additional training which is supposed to be given to these students should be followed by a study on it. The entry qualification should be decided with the observations of the SLMC. The minimum standards for medical education should be gazetted to avoid any confusion in future. Unlike other leaders, President Maithripala Sirisena has addressed this issue in a fair manner, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. won't extend term of office of any PC: Rajitha
	
The government has no intention of extending the term of office of the Northern Provincial Council or that of any other PC on the say so of a politician, Cabinet spokesman and Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said most probably elections to the six provincial councils would be held under the preferential voting system in October this year.
Commenting on NPC Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran's request to President Maithripala Sirisena to extend the term of office of the NPC with Mr. Wigneswaran as CM, the minister said the government had no intention of postponing the elections.
The government had no option but to allow the North-Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Councils to be administered by the Governors of respective provinces after their term of office expired last year because Parliament had not approved the delimitation report as required by the new electoral law. But the government will hold the elections to all six PCs together after the term of office of the Central, North-Western and Northern Provincial Councils expires in October," the minister said.
The government does not want to rule the country according to the wishes of individuals. If the party leaders failed to arrive at a compromise and approve the delimitation report, then elections will be held in October under the PR system, he said.
With the enactment of the Provincial Council Elections (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017, a new mixed voting system was introduced for provincial councils, where 50 per cent of the representatives would be elected by a simple majority system and another 50% would be selected according to the district level proportional representation method (the additional list). A number of party leaders are not agreement with these amendments.
However, if the PC polls are to be held under the old system, we must go back to Parliament and get the approval to hold PC polls under the old system with a two-thirds majority but it is quite obvious that it is not possible under the current political situation in the country, he stressed.

Hambantota Port security handled by SL Navy: Minister
	
Security in the Hambantota Port, the proposed industrial zone and other land areas coming under the purview of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) will be handled by the Sri Lanka Navy under the provisions of the Concession Agreement, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
The island adjoining the port will never be handed over to the Chinese as claimed by certain media institutions. A new breakwater will be constructed at the Hambantota Port to facilitate the security arrangements by the Sri Lanka Navy, he said.
He told a journalist at a news briefing held today the Concession Agreement inked between the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the Chinese on July 29 last year had no clause requiring to hand over the island to the Chinese company.
The 12-day delay to deposit the last tranche was not related to any issue connected with the island near the port. The two companies had to sort out a few minor issues pertaining to the land area that comes under HPDP. The artificial island will remain under the SLPA. I was dismayed as to how the media carried this incorrect information on the alleged delay to transfer the last tranche of US$584 million, the minister said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)

He surrendered to get a comfortable seat to the police station
	
A Police squad car was sent to raid a gambling den that was being operated in a village in the Western Province.
After being informed that the police were outside those inside the gambling den began to run helter skelter trying to escape the long arm of the law. All but one were trying to escape. One man however did not try to escape but ran as fast as he could to the police jeep that was parked outside and after opening the rear door he got in and took a seat on the rear seat of the vehicle. The only policeman in the vehicle at the time was the driver. The policeman looked back at the man who had taken a seat at the rear of the jeep and said to him, "All your friends are trying to escape from us so why did you give yourself up Is it because you are honest
Sir, the police station is far away from here. Last time when the police came to raid the place they took all of us to the police station in a jeep that was so crowded I was forced to stand all the way to the police station. So this time I thought of making it a little more comfortable for me to travel when we are arrested and taken away. The police driver could not contain his mirth.(Upendra Priyankara Jathungama)

Integrity Idol 2018 : Naming and faming workers who matter the most
	
Transparency International organises a competition during which those who have shown integrity and honesty at their work place will be picked so that the public can pick a winner via an SMS voting system


		Former Chairperson of TISL Mr. M.D.A. Harold officially launches the website for Integrity Idol 2018
		

The TISL is calling for nominations for Integrity Idol 2018 through a nationwide campaign
	
	This is about recognizing those who work with our community at different levels, assisting citizens
	
	Public nominations which were officially launched on June 12 will continue to remain open until July 31 this year

Integrity and honesty are key elements that work hand in hand in delivering a quality service in any respective, working atmosphere. In an endeavour to recognize and appreciate the integrity and honesty in the public sector, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) officially launched the Integrity Idol 2018 on June 12 (Tuesday) at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute.
The event aims at naming and faming public officers who are committed to their work with a keen sense of integrity and honesty. Accordingly, the TISL is calling for nominations for Integrity Idol 2018 through a nationwide campaign
spearheaded with the assistance of the media where citizens are invited to nominate public officials who maintain the features of integrity and honesty both in their personal and professional conduct. 
In its press statement, the TISL said that a concept initiated by Accountability Lab, an organisation which aims at producing a society of active citizens and responsible leaders around the world by empowering change-makers, the Integrity Idol campaign has already been successfully carried out in Nepal, Pakistan, South Africa and Nigeria amongst other countries. Hence, Integrity Idol aims to champion integrity by naming and faming bureaucrats as positive role models. In doing so it hopes to inspire the next generation of responsible leaders. 
Expressing his views at the event TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeysekere said that Integrity Idol 2018 is a unique award for Sri Lanka to recognize the integrity of public service. The key concept here is to name and fame public officers. We want to recognize those public officers who have shown integrity and honesty in sometimes very challenging and difficult conditions. This isnt about recognizing those who are just doing their normal jobs, but about recognizing those who have gone beyond their call of duty in displaying integrity and honesty in their work. This is about recognizing those who work with our community at different levels, assisting citizens in their day-to-day needs. Integrity in that sense can mean many different things to many different people and that is an excellent feature of this award. People may see the integrity of a teacher in a school, amongst a customs officer and so on Obeyesekere added.

How to send nominations
Nominations are encouraged by those who have shown features and characteristics of integrity in their day-to-day lives. Public nominations which were officially launched on June 12 will continue to remain open until July 31 this year. Nominations can be applied for by calling the Integrity Idol Team on 0711295295 / 0761173344 and requesting for a nomination pack to be sent by post. Also, a request could be made to send the nomination pack in ones preferred choice of language in either Sinhala, Tamil or English. Alternatively, individuals can also log on to www.integrityidol.lk and download the nomination form from the website, which also contains all details regarding the addresses to whom the complete nominations should be sent to. Nomination forms can also be collected from the TISL Head Office at 5/1 Elibank Road, Colombo 05 and the TISL Advocacy & Legal Aid Centres located in Matara and Vavuniya.

An eminent panel of five comprising retired Justice of the Supreme Court and former Chairman of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Justice Amir Ismail, retired Deputy Auditor General and winner and first recipient of TISLs National Integrity Award Lalith Ambanwala, retired Deputy Auditor General and former Chairperson of TISL M.D.A. Harold, award winning investigative journalist Thusitha Pitigala and social activist, Attorney at Law and Executive Director of Viluthu Maithreyi Rajasingam will be responsible for shortlisting five finalists for Integrity Idol 2018 once the nomination procedure closes on July 31. The panel will be supported by a group of volunteers who would verify and shortlist five final Integrity Idols for Sri Lanka.

Bibliographical videos
After the five finalists are selected, bibliographical videos will be made about the lives and careers of those five individuals, the challenges they have had to face in their work environments and how they overcame those challenges. These details will be broadcast by our media partner News First and also across social media channels amongst other platforms. The key element of Integrity Idol 2018 is that there will be a winner among the final five who will be selected through a public vote through a sms voting system. This is a measure taken to ensure that there is public engagement and public participation in the selection of the final winner. In that sense, there is a public mandate involved as well Obeyesekere said. 
While the final award ceremony is scheduled to be held in October this year, Obeyesekere went onto highlight that very often people hear negative news about the public service, which is sometimes warranted and at times unwarranted. The one fact that we all can agree upon is that there are also many positive examples of people working in the public service that is often unrecognised. The Integrity Idol 2018 gives an opportunity to say that we need to give credit where it is due and we need to make examples of those who do their jobs with integrity and honesty; so that they will also be an example for not only the current generation, but also to the future generations. So once again, I will encourage you to nominate individuals for the Integrity Idol 2018. We look forward to working closely with members of the media and members of the public in the coming few months he added.

Addressing the media, retired Deputy Auditor General and former Chairperson of TISL M.D. A. Harold appreciated the efforts of the TISL in its venture to appreciate the integrity displayed in the public sector. The Public sector must have a high level of integrity. This is what is expected of by the people of the country. Also, the public should understand and appreciate public service while public servants should in return maintain a high level of integrity in serving the public. Public officials are entrusted with a major responsibility and are accountable to the public in its use of public resources in an efficient, economical and effective manner to serve the people of the country. In this context, I view this as a good arrangement and good effort to appreciate the integrity of the public sector. Appreciation is very important since appreciation is what is lacking today. We must learn to appreciate the good work and efforts undertaken by anyone he concluded.

Lankan asylum seeker family's deportation appeal rejected
	
A Tamil asylum seeker family living in the small Queensland town of Biloela have had their appeal to stay in Australia rejected by the Federal Circuit Court.
Earlier in the year Nadesalingam, Priya and their two Australian-born daughters were pulled from a plane overnight, just minutes before they were due to be deported.
Border force officials had previously removed the family from their Queensland home and put them in a Melbourne detention centre.
Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Ben Hillier said that they were handcuffed and taken in separate vans to Melbourne Airport on Tuesday, flown to Perth and placed on a flight to Sri Lanka.
But a last-minute legal intervention resulted in them being removed from the plane before it took off.
It's understood the couple came to Australia separately by boat in 2012 and 2013, following Sri Lanka's civil war.
They settled in Biloela on a bridging visa. (sbs.com.au)

In the run-up to the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, the advertising fraternity of Sri Lanka came together for the 5th year in succession at this years Leo Burnett Cannes Predictions, where a preview of the best-in-class entries for the festival were showcased. Hosted by the International Advertising Association of Sri Lanka (the IAA) at the Bayleaf, the event was compered by Lalindra Nanayakara and Ikram Mohideen from Leo Burnett Sri Lanka with an opening address made by Arosha Perera, Leo Burnett Sri Lankas Chief Operating Officer. The event was attended by professionals from all areas of the marketing communications industry and was sponsored by MBC Radio, MTV, 7 Star Flour, Ceylinco VIP and Blue Star.
Cannes Lions is the worlds biggest annual awards show and festival for professionals in the creative communications industry and will be held for the 64th year this June, in Cannes, France. The predictions event is held globally by Leo Burnett offices across the world, and a reel of potential winners is curated at the agencys head office in Chicago by Mr. Mark Tuttsel- Executive Chairman, Leo Burnett Worldwide. This year, the local event screened the reel once again, and the advertising fraternity came together to learn more about the top 20 picks of Leo Burnett.

Episodes lead to Epic:
Epic never goes out of fashion. Look no further than blockbusters like Nikes Nothing Beats a Londoner or P&G Tides Its a Tide Ad, both strong contenders for Film Lions. Each brilliantly executed, they each also seamlessly stitched together small stories into narratives that made a seismic cultural impact.
Shot on 16mm film to capture the essence of the city, Nikes Nothing Beats a Londoner cast more than 250 real-life residents, including star athletes and celebs, for a whirlwind tour of the travails of sporty Londoners.
P&G Tide won the Super Bowl this year, with its self-referential collection of ads that all turned out, hilariously, for Tide. More than a dozen spots were crammed into four breaks that helped vault #TideAd to the highest-trending hashtag besides the game itself.
Human Storytelling:
The emotion of human storytelling and the timeless potency of meaningful moments captured on film is thriving across this years collection. Conversations between children and parents are the subject of two favorites: one presents a small slice of life, the other a more difficult dialogue.
Cadburys Mums Birthday stars a young girl who hopes to buy a bar of chocolate for her mother. At the corner store, shes only able to offer the assorted contents of her pockets as payment, but is treated to a warm act of kindness in return.
In The Talk from P&G, we see black parents through the ages having that painful discussion with their children about growing up in a country that doesnt treat everyone equally. Its a poignant film and a powerful message, made even more so by the fact the film refrains from showing any products.
Visual Spectacular:
Kaleidoscopic color, charm and wit coalesce into joyous communication, another theme from this years collection. Outstanding production, art direction and flawless execution are hallmarks of two favorites here, each dazzling visual metaphors.
In Audis Clowns, a troupe of merrymakers wreaks havoc on the road in various ways. Despite the hazards they throw at the drivers, the technology in their Audi vehicles deftly outmaneuver the antics, proving the brand is Clown proof.
In Welcome Home, the expansive sound of Apples HomePod speaker is brought to life through a spectacular performance by singer-songwriter and dancer FKA Twigs and impeccable direction by the inimitable Spike Jonze. Arriving home after a dreary day, she cues a song and the interior of her home becomes a variegated, shape-shifting wonderland. Remarkably, the film was shot using very few CGI effects, relying on sophisticated hydraulics that moved the set.
Topical & Tactical:
Agility has never been as critical to modern marketers, and this years collection of work demonstrates that brands are keeping pace by seizing real-time moments, tapping into culture and exploiting tactical opportunities like never before.
From Orange Telecoms Now or Never, which seizes upon World Cup fever and the national Egyptian teams long drought, to Burger King tapping our collective fear of clowns for its Scary Clown Night promotional effort, brands win when theyre moving at the speed of culture.
Two other favorites uniquely parlayed problems into advantages. KFC could be the first piece of crisis communications to win a coveted Lion thanks to its brilliantly crafted FCK response to having run out of chicken across the UK. Downtown Records exploited a technological hiccup with Facebook Live to create an ingeniously simple and hypnotic music video for indie band The Academic in Live Looper.
Spontaneity and Personalization:
The industrys pervasive push toward personalization manifests in a number of ways this year. From technology that empowers people (and their pets) to take the perfect picture, to a somber effort that puts the faces of real victims of the opioid crisis, were seeing more work that makes an impact through the spontaneous and the personal.
Snaptivitys Snaptivity App leveraged AI-enabled camera infrastructure placed in stadiums to deliver one-of-a-kind photos to fans, captured at key moments in soccer matches. In New Zealand, Pedigree stepped into the mobile accessories business with the Pedigree SelfieSTIX, a device intended to hold a dog snack in order to capture poochs attention for the perfect selfie.
The National Safety Councils Prescribed to Death featured 3D images of each of the 22 thousand people whove died from prescription overdoses in the U.S. intricately carved onto individual pills that were presented as a somber exhibition. The installation put a human face to an epidemic in a truly unforgettable way.
Finally, Skittles took personalization to new heights with its Super Bowl stunt, Exclusive The Rainbow. Three weeks before the Super Bowl, the brand announced it would be customizing  and then screening  its spot for just one person, Marcos Menendez. Everyone else could tune into a Facebook Live broadcast at halftime in which viewers could watch Marcos reaction, but not the actual ad, which nevertheless has become Skittles most talked-about in its history.
The local screening and Cannes Predictions Night, help professionals in Sri Lanka to learn more about trends and creativity that is shaping the advertising industry. The evening is part of an important tradition that brings together industry professionals and gives them the chance to discuss the latest creative work and marketing communications trends.

## Title: No one can win Presidential polls  without  MRs  blessings - Lakshman Yapa

No one can win Presidential polls  without  MRs  blessings - Lakshman Yapa
	
Front liner of the 16 SLFP rebel group, former State Resources Development Minister Lakshmana Yapa Abeywardana discussed the future of the SLFP, forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls and current politics etc with the Daily Mirror. He shared the following views:

We dont agree with US Envoys comments
	
	SLFPers with Govt. digging their own political grave
	
	Electing office bearers is not to hoodwink anyone

Q Cracks have already begun to appear among the members of the SLFP rebel group of 16 on many issues such as the next Presidential candidate they would support in 2019, their leader and with whom they stand in contemporary political scene. How do you see this situation
This is natural in politics in any country. It is understandable when politicians get pressure from voters at constituent, district and national level. However, no one must get over enthusiastic or desperate on how the SLFP gets its act together for the forthcoming PC, Presidential and Parliamentary polls as we are determined to arrive at the most prudent and timely political decision including the choosing of our Presidential candidate. What ever our decisions are, they must ensure the victory at all three major elections. What is important is that we must do the right thing at the right time. 
We all are in the same political wavelength and working together to form a UPFA government and contesting most probably under the betel leaf symbol. We are still the members of the UPFA. 

I must tell you that we have an immediate target to make Mahinda Prime Minister before the Presidential and Parliamentary polls to ensure our victory at the two big elections after toppling the UNP-led unity government.

Q Dont you think that you have to take a firm decision on your political future sooner than later and decide to whom you would support
We have already taken a decision to unite with all like-minded political parties and politicians to form a formidable front against the UNP led government. Joint opposition leader, Dinesh Gunawardana, National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila and Democratic Left Front leader Vasudeva Nanayakkara. 

Q The best bet for the joint opposition group which includes SLPP and SLFPs MR faction in the late 2019 Presidential poll is Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. But the US is determined to prevent it. Dont you think this is a major setback for your front
I presume, if US Ambassador Atul Keshap actually made these observations, they are his personal views. I dont think the foreign policy of the US government is based on personnel matters or individuals. But I must categorically say that we dont agree with his comments reported in the media. 
However, you may be aware that not only Gotabhayas but of many other senior politicians names have been quoted by the media as potential presidential candidates. Whatever said and done, the winner would be the person named and supported by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. No one will be able to win the Presidential poll without his blessings and approval. Therefore, our group will support and campaign for the victory of the Presidential candidate chosen by MR.
I must tell you that we have an immediate target to make MR Prime Minister before the Presidential and Parliamentary polls to ensure our victory at the two big elections after toppling the UNP led unity government. We have taken an inspiration from what Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has done in Malaysia at the age of 92 at the May General election. 

Q If not Gota, who would be the other potential candidates
We have so many contenders for this position. It could be Dinesh, Chamal or even Basil but the final choice is in the hands of MR. Some argue that Gota will not get the support of minority parties in the country which is a misconception. MR has been able to build a close rapport with Muslims and Tamils. Our recent discussions with TNA leader, R. Sampanthan have been very fruitful and constructive. 

We have already taken a decision to unite with all like-minded political parties and politicians to form a formidable front against the UNP led government.

Q It is quite obvious that you would not emerge victorious against UNP in any of these elections unless you unite the entire opposition which includes SLFP, SLPP and all other southern minority parties such as JVP, MEP, CPSL and NFF. How are you going to surmount this difficult task
True, but this is exactly what we are doing right now. We have made much headway in uniting all anti UNP and anti government forces under one roof. At the local government election, the SLPP was able draw 46% of votes. The anti-UNP camp is stronger now than it was in February this year. Therefore, obtaining over 50% of votes at any future election will not be a big task for us. 

QBasil has made it clear that he was not in favour of welcoming the SLFP rebel group to the SLPP. How do you see this
I dont think he made such comments on the entire group but only on a few members. But we are chums with having same political agenda and views. I dont think we must take his comments seriously and I have no hesitation whatsoever that we cannot work together to achieve our ultimate victory. 

Q President Maithripala Sirisena will be the SLFP Presidential candidate according to the party sources. The SLPPs candidate would most likely be Gotabhaya. Whom would you support
The SLPP leader Prof. G. L. Peiris is on records saying that the SLPP would not campaign for President Sirisena in 2019 Presidential polls. Politics and electing the Executive President are two different entities. If MR becomes Premier before 2020, making him the next President is not a difficult task. You can get a clue from Russian President Vladimir Putin and Malaysias leader Dr. Mahathir Mohamed.
President Sirisena has never said that he would contest the Presidential poll scheduled to be held in late 2019. I repeat that the absolute winner will be the one who gets the support and blessings from MR. 

We all are in the same political wavelength and working together to form a UPFA government and contesting most probably under the betel leaf symbol. We are still the members of UPFA.

Q There are differences between the SLFP rebel group of 16 and those who support the SLPP. Dont you think this is setback for you all
As long as we remain divided, yes, it is a set back to meet our goal. I assure you that we all, the SLFP, the UPFA, the SLPP and all other minority parties grouped in the JO will form a formidable common front to challenge the UNP at forthcoming polls. Dont forget the widely accepted saying that there are no permanent enemies or friends in politics. The best indicator to this adage is the recent peace agreement signed between the US and North Korea. In penning it, the sworn enemies for decades, the US and North Korean Presidents became friends.

Q The main reason for you to leave the Yahapalana Govt was the Central Bank bond scam. But you quit after remaining in the govt for more than three years, despite the fact that the fraud took place in February 2015. What do you have to say about this dereliction on your part
We joined the UNP-SLFP Yahapalana Government on the approval of the SLFP Central Committee and on the request of President Sirisena on a set policy. Unfortunately, we felt that the government was not taking the correct path that we expected. Therefore we became distressed, disappointed and dejected. We felt that if we were to remain in the government, we must attempt to direct the government in the right path by exposing its wrongdoings. Uncovering the Central Bank bond scam is one of them. We were also instrumental to introduce amendments to a range of budget proposals in 2015, 16 and 17 that we felt would further burden the masses. So we, the 16 members, quit when we realized that our task in the government was nearing its end.

No one will be able to win the Presidential poll without his blessings and approval. Therefore, our group will support and campaign for the victory of the Presidential candidate chosen by Mahinda Rajapaksa

Q I assume that your main concern right now is to take out the remaining 23 SLFPers from the Yahapalana Government to isolate the UNP. How is the progress in this endeavour
What I can only say is that if they are not ready to leave the government sooner than later, they would dig their own political grave. Their hesitation to leave the Yahapalana Government would affect them more, not the JO. 

Q The UNP has introduced new faces to the party. You all are going to face the forthcoming polls with same old faces and the voters dont see any reorganization or restructuring in the JO, SLPP or opposition group led by MR. Are you confident in your success with all these seasoned personnel
In early September, the SLFP will hold its annual convention and elect new office bearers to all key posts. We would do it in an extremely free and scientific way. Electing office bearers to the SLFP is not to hoodwink anyone. 

Q The opposition front led either by MR, Gota or even Maithripala will face the UNP with those who have been accused of financial crimes, frauds, money laundering, embezzling nepotism and murder. Some of them have been charged in courts of law and certain others have fled the country and evading arrest. Are you sure the people will vote for them blindly in the forthcoming polls
Not a single SLFP member has been found guilty for any of these politically-motivated charges. Besides, if found guilty, no member will be given nomination from the party at elections and people will not vote for them either.

## Title: Poson  Aloka Pooja at Situlpauwwa

Poson  Aloka Pooja at Situlpauwwa
	
The Annual Poson Illuminations of the historic Situlpauwwa Raja Maha Viharaya, situated inside the Yala National Park will be held from June 22 to 28. Situlpauwwa is one of the most ancient shrines in the South and dates back to the reign of King Kavantissa, who ruled over Ruhuna in the Second Century BC.
Though little is known, Situlpauwwa holds monuments of immense historical, archaeological, religious and scientific value. Legend has it that when king Kavantissa married Queen Viharamahadevi, their wedding was held here - an event that led to the construction of the Magul Maha Viharaya or the Great Wedding Monastery at this site.
History records that in ancient times Situlpauwwa was patronized by several Sri Lankan kings, including Gajaba, Vasabha, Dappula and Parakramabahu I. The shrine and its surroundings cover an area of over 100 acres. The place owes its name to the huge 400 feet tall rock on which two Buddhist Stupas (One large and the other small), a cave monastery and many other ancient structures are found.

Looking after the area today with great dedication is Venerable Pandit Mataramba Hemarathana Thera, who is the Chief Incumbent of the Situlpauwwa Raja Maha Viharaya.

These include the ruins of a 100-foot long Pohoya Ge (The monks meeting hall) and two statues of two Bodhisattvas (Buddha hood aspirants) and nearly 1,700 stone inscriptions, though only a few of the inscriptions are clearly seen today.
It is said that in ancient times, 12,000 Arahant Bhikkhus (Buddhist monks who attain the highest mental stage) lived in the many caves located in this area. One of the man-made marvels here is the stone umbrella, built during the reign of King Vasabha. Around 200 persons can easily find shelter from rain under this umbrella, which is about four square feet in extent.
Found on the way to Kuda (small) Situlpauwwa - the site of the smaller stupa - this stone structure is believed to have given shelter to Arahants. Another wonder found here is the pond that does not go dry even during a severe drought. It is located on a hillock, east of Magul Maha Viharaya. The archaeological authorities have undertaken a full research of Situlpauwwa that serves greater attention of scholars and historians.

History records that in ancient times Situlpauwwa was patronized by several Sri Lankan kings, including Gajaba, Vasabha, Dappula and Parakramabahu I.

The credit of rediscovering this shrine in 1918 - thousands of years after the jungle claimed it - goes to the Venerable Ratanajothi Gunaratana, the Chief Incumbent of the Yatagala Viharaya, Galle.
He braved mosquitoes and wild elephants to reach this site through the thick jungle at a time, when not only motor vehicles, tractors and other equipment but even humans were hardly available in that part of Sri Lanka. Only a few people, including two of the monks, assisted him in this arduous task in a remote corner on the island.

Looking after the area today with great dedication is Venerable Pandit Mataramba Hemarathana Thera, who is the Chief Incumbent of the Situlpauwwa Raja Maha Viharaya. The Incumbent at these Poson Pinkama, pride of place will be given to Seela, Bhavana, Bana Sermons, Dhamma discussion, Buddha Poojas, Bodhi Phoojas and other religious rituals.

On the Poson Full Moon Day there will be an all-night Pirith chanting to bring blessings to the country. As in the past, the Upali Group of Companies will do the illumination of Situlpauwwa from 22 to 28 June 2018. Mr Nimal Welgama, Managing Director Upali Group and Mr Dhammika Attygalle, the Vice President of the Situlpauwwa Dayaka Sabha will switch the lights on the Poson Poya day.
It is expected that as usual, over 10,000 devotees will observe Sil and an equal number will visit the Viharaya for the observance of religious rites.


Special plans for devotees
Necessary steps have been taken to provide special bus services from Tissa town to Situlpauwwa Raja Maha Viharaya for the duration of the Poson Pinkamas. The Southern Road Development Authority for convenience of the devotees has constructed the Kataragama to Situlpauwwa Road. Necessary steps have been taken to provide health, water and sanitary facilities to the pilgrims.
Various NGOs and voluntary Organizations have organized Dansalas and will provide alms to the devotees who will observe Sil.

Rumble in a Khaki Jungle
	
My two children suffering from Diarrhea are warded at the hospital. I have no money. My wife is blaming me and inquiring whether I am coming home I am now fed up with this job sir. 
This was what we overheard when we visited the Miscellaneous Complaints Section of a police station recently. The complainant was being made by a police Constable who was about 45 years. At the receiving end was the OIC of the Miscellaneous Complaints Section. Despite both his children warded in hospital he is unable to obtain leave. Added to that he hasnt money to obtain the required medicine for his children.

There is another group of Sub Inspectors numbering 2190 who have not received promotions
	
	A person who joins Sri Lanka Police as a constable at the age of 20 would reach the age of 40 years by the time he gets promoted to the post of Sergeant
	
	The former Minister of Law and Order Sagala Rathnayake submitted a Cabinet Paper to grant promotions to 3029 Sub Inspectors
	
On many occasions, doing our investigations, we brought to light the many injustices caused to the public by the Sri Lanka Police. Similar to the injustices caused by the police to the public, the law enforcement officers are subject to injustice and inconveniences during their tenure in office. But these injustices arent revealed to the society. Therefore this is an attempt to reveal the injustices caused to the police through this truthful investigation. 
Within the Sri Lanka Police posts from the position of the Police Security Assistant to the post of Inspector General of Police (IGP) are Police Security Assistant, Police Constable Driver, Police Constable, Police Sergeant, Senior Sergeant, Sub Inspector, Inspector, Chief Police Inspector, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Superintendent of Police, Senior Superintendent of Police, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police and the Inspector General of Police. 
Excluding the post of IGP, the authority which handles the appointments and disciplinary issues related to all other posts in accordance with the the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is the Police Commission. In terms of Special Gazette notification number 2016/6 dated 24th April 2017 the powers of the commission relating to certain subject matters of all police officers from Chief Inspector of Police downwards, excluding all OICs, have been vested with the IGP and Senior DIGs. This has been done by the National Police Commission itself for convenience sake. 

Though this promotion procedure is documented its application is confined to a piece of writing and not implemented in a practical manner

In general the Sri Lanka Police recruits persons as Police Constables and Sub Inspectors and a limited number as Assistant Superintendents of Police, but these intakes exclude the recruiting of Police Constable Drivers. The recruitment and promotion criteria of the Sri Lanka police department are mentioned in the official Web Site of Sri Lanka Police. According to the website the promotion from the position of Police Constable to that of Sergeant is done by considering whether the individual has completed eight years of active and satisfactory service. Though this promotion procedure is documented its application is confined to a piece of writing and not implemented in a practical manner. 
The Police Constable referred to in the introduction of this article had served the police in that capacity for well over twenty years, but has been denied of a promotion to the next grade. 
There is much frustration among the rank and file of those below the grade of ASP due to the delay in the granting of promotions. For example most of those who join as Constables are promoted as Sergeants only close to retirement. They have no opportunities to go beyond this grade owing to delays regarding promotions in the constable grade. A person who joins Sri Lanka Police as a constable at the age of 20 would reach the age of 40 years by the time he gets promoted to the post of Sergeant. Most of them retire as sergeants. It is very seldom that they are able to get to the position of Sub Inspector. If an opportunity is afforded to the Police Constables to reach the grade of ASP through merit, the efficiency of Police officers would be more, a senior police officer pointed out. He also said that the salaries of these police officers had now been increased. 
The issues bothering the Sub Inspectors are more severe than those serving in above grades. During the former Government the Sub Inspectors had been promoted to the grade of Inspector only after completing eight years of service. The last batch of promotions was in 2010. 

Cabinet Paper
The former Minister of Law and Order Sagala Rathnayake submitted a Cabinet Paper to grant promotions to 3029 Sub Inspectors who have completed more than eight years of service. This Cabinet Paper received the necessary approval. However two weeks ago steps were taken by the IGP to promote only 539 Sub Inspectors, among whom close to100 have already retired. There is another considerable number of Sub Inspectors expected to retire by the end of 2018. Despite these individuals holding the post of Sub Inspector over a long period this position had not been considered at the time promotions were made in the Department of Police. Everyone has been promoted with effect from 31st May 2016. 
There is another group of Sub Inspectors numbering 2190 who have not received promotions. A Sub Inspector speaking to this newspaper expressed these views.
I have been an SI for the past 13 years. In the STF promotions are granted duly. Those who joined Sri Lanka Police with me and later joined the STF are now IPs. We are still SIs. When they return to serve the Police after obtaining promotions they will be occupying senior positions. There are others who joined the Police much later, but they became members of the STF and obtained promotions. Were not saying that those in the STF shouldnt get promotions, but what we ask is to be treated the same and given early promotions like the others the Sub Inspector said. 
In the past the promotion procedure had been followed properly and many who joined as Sub Inspectors ended as Senior Superintendents of Police, Deputy Inspector General of Police or Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police. 
They said, We passed the Advanced Level Examination and obtained very good results. We ignored the opportunities available outside and joined as Sub Inspectors and even after serving for 11 years we continue to remain in the same post without being promoted. We are stagnating in the same post for a over long period and feel that we are being looked down upon. There are many graduates among the Sub Inspectors. They too receive the same treatment and have become frustrated. This situation demoralizes those aspiring to join the Sri Lanka Police. If the IGP isnt granting these promotions the Government should intervene and resolve this issue. 
Its the minor Police officer who is called to bear the brunt of all this. Even taking a rupee as a bribe is a crime. It is often highlighted when a minor police officers arm is extended in acceptance when Rs100 or 200 is offered as a bribe. But this type of naming and shaming hardly happens when higher ranked Police officers accept bribes amounting to several hundred thousand rupees. There have been occasions when the Law has not been enforced in instances involving the latter. 
It isnt only the mini Police officers who are faced with issues regarding promotions. Senior Superintendent of Police Palitha Siriwardene who is in charge of Kilinochchi Division being denied a promotion was an issue and a subject matter that drew the attention of the entire police department. 
Due to this news gaining momentum and the responses that were received, the predicament of the police officers and the level of the stress they are under became clear. The issue relating to Siriwardene has not seen an end. 
With several DIG posts in the Sri Lanka Police falling vacant and the absence of Senior Superintendents of Police, who had completed five years of service, a decision was taken to appoint acting DIGs. Accordingly a request was made by the Law and Order Ministry to the Police Commission to appoint acting DIGs. This request was made as the National Police Commission had been entrusted with the functions relating to appointments above the grade of ASP and also because it is the disciplinary authority. 
Following this the Ministry of Law and Order submitted the names of six Senior Superintendents of Police based on a seniority list to the National Police Commission in March this year. By this time one of these Senior Superintendents of police had retired. From among the other Senior Superintendents, appointing Siriwardene and Gamini Perera was opposed by the IGP. 
SSP Gamini Perera had functioned in the North as a Divisional Officer in charge. On receiving a similar assignment he had appealed to the Police Commission and got the transfer cancelled. 

IGP goes on a witch-hunt
SSP Siriwardene had been in charge of Kilinochchi Division. During a function held at the Kilinochchi District Secretariat, under the patronage of the IGP, the IGP had made a statement saying that Siriwardene would be transferred from Kilinochchi and not be assigned any duties. Siriwardene had then filed a case in the Supreme Court against the IGP stating that by making a public statement as above his fundamental rights have been infringed upon. The Supreme Court observed that decisions relating to police officials above the ASP grade are taken by the National Police Commission. 
Thereafter the IGP directed the CID to hold an inquiry concerning Siriwardene. Siriwardene was later freed of the charges against him. Siriwardene again complained to the Police Commission that the IGP was attempting to take revenge on him by instructing the Police Special Investigation Unit to conduct another investigation. 

Siriwardene was later freed of the charges against him. Siriwardene again complained to the Police Commission that the IGP was attempting to take revenge on him

However ignoring the IGPs objections the National Police Commission directed on 05th April 2018, that five Senior Superintendents of Police including Siriwardene and Perera be appointed as acting DIGs. The IGP refrained from issuing the notification of these appointments and he again requested that the appointments of Siriwardene and Perera be reconsidered. This was repeated on three occasions and finally the Police Commission appointed four others as DIGs excluding Siriwardene. 
The Police Commission, whose attention was directed towards the charges made against Siriwardene, found that there was insufficient material to prove the charges made against Siriwardene. The Police Commission then took steps to appoint Siriwardene also as an Acting DIG. Even at the time of writing the IGP hadnt issued the notice of this appointment. It is a serious matter if the IGP fails to act as per orders of an independent commission. 
The most recent episode is the issue regarding SP Priyadharshana Herath, who was interdicted well over an year ago on a direction by the IGP. Herath has not been served with a charge sheet. If Herath has done something wrong he should be subjected to the legal procedure. Herath, who has remained under interdiction for over an year and not received even half his pay, was reinstated immediately following an order issued by the Police Commission in February this year. This order was given effect only in May this year. But he could perform duties only for about 20 days. Reviewing an incident that had taken place eight years ago and despite an admonition being served on him, the IGP took steps last week to interdict him once again. 
These acts of discouragement have frustrated not only the ordinary police officers, but also those holding high ranks in the police. When these type of harassment and ill treatments continue those serving the Sri Lanka Police will suffer stress and other sorts of setbacks. This would in turn affect severely the maintenance of law and order in the island. Despite the shortcomings observed within the Sri Lanka Police the law enforcement officers have been able to live up to the standards required of them, except for a few individuals. Given that those having authority at the top in the Police having failed to live up to the expected standards and act diligently, no one knows the plight of the law enforcement officers in this country. 


A senior officer of the Police Commission said,According to the constitution we have the power to decide on all matters relating to all Police officers, excluding the IGP. If the IGP is disregarding our orders that amounts to an act of violating the constitution. SSP Palitha Siriwardene had been appointed as an Acting DIG by the National Police Commission. The IGP hasnt issued the relevant notice in this regard. With regard to the issue relating to Superintendent of Police Priyadharshana Herath, we have not approved his interdiction. If the IGP has interdicted him that means he has usurped a power by which act he has gone against the constitution.

Siyambalapitiya  is in for criticism over LNG tender
	

Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya drew a setback on Tuesday [19] as he failed to get the Cabinet nod to award the contract to a Chinese company for the execution of the proposed LNG power project in Kerawalapitiya. His office had decided to award the contract for GCL China for the execution of the project.
However, the tender procedure was shrouded in controversy as it has been offered to a higher traffic bidder which quoted 15.75 per unit regardless of local bidder Lakdanawi Ltd quoting only 14. 98.
Following the ministerial decision to proceed with the move earlier, objections were raised ostensibly to create public opinion against the tender being offered to this company. In one instance, the Movement for the Consumer Rights Protection moved court against the tender. 
In the wake of such build-up of protest against the Ministrys decision, it came up before the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Minister Siyambalapitiya submitted the proposal seeking approval to award the tender to this company to implement the project. He briefed the Cabinet that Lakdhanawi Ltd was disregarded because even engineers disputed how Lakdhanawi could implement the project of this magnitude at such a low cost. He said he decided to offer the tender to the foreign company after broad consultation with all concerned. 

Champika opposed to tender
Then, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka responded to the Minister. He said it would cause to loss of at least US $ 42 million to the state in 20 years if the tender were offered to the higher bidder.
He argued that the entire tender procedure was flawed. 

Mahinda Samarasinghe, Nimal Siripala comes to Siyambalapitiyas rescue
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, who joined the discussion on the tender, added a different dimension to the whole diatribe. He viewed that controversial issues should be debated, but not be capitalized to sling mud at any minister in the media for different ends. 
If there are issues, they have to be sorted out. But, the media should not be used to sling mud at the ministers in one-sided manner, he said. 
After him, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva locked horns with Minister Ranawaka. In this instance, he disputed Minister Ranawakas estimate of losses to the state over the selection of the higher bidder.
The price quoted by one bidder is inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT). Lakdhanawi made a bid excluding VAT involved. That is the reason for the price difference between the two, he noted. Minister Siyambalapitiya responded to Minister Siripala de Silva gleefully on this occasion. 
What Minister de Silva said is correct. Also, the price quoted by Lakdhanawi is 58% lower than the engineers estimate. Is it possible to execute the project at such a low cost he asked. On a previous occasion, he said, Lakdhanawi undertook a project for execution at US $ 225 million, but the amount shot up to US $ 296 million by the end.
Initially, they are used to make a lower bid. Towards the end of the project, they claim more for expenses. Finally the cost becomes higher and higher. Then, we are compelled to pay it because we cannot stop any project halfway, he said. 
President Maithripala Sirisena, who hitherto remained a mute observer, intervened finally and proposed the matter to be referred to a committee for scrutinizing with the inclusion of the relevant Ministers. 
Transactions in the power and energy sector are shrouded in mystery and controversy most of the time. 

Govt exempts private hospitals from VAT after doctors moved to transfer burden on patients
Next came up the proposal to exempt private hospitals from VAT. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera thanked Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne for taking initiatives in this regard. The government was compelled to remove VAT from hospital bills because medical practitioners transferred the burden on patients when charging from them for services offered. 

Rumblings within JO over 16-member group
Rumblings have been created within the Joint Opposition, particularly after the 16-member SLFP group made overtures to it for future politics. There is stiff resistance from some members of the Joint Opposition, particularly those close to Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) against placements being given to these SLFPers.
They believe that these SLFPers who joined the government and enjoyed perks defected from it only because of the build-up of public opinion against the ruling side. Therefore, SLPP believes it is unfair for by its members to give way for these SLFPers.
All in all, the Joint Opposition contemplates as to how it should accommodate these 16 MPs rather than creating fissures within it.
Some of these SLFP MPs have expressed their readiness to team up with the Joint Opposition. In fact, they have vowed not to participate in the reform drive launched by SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Let alone, there are others who wish to remain with the SLFP while doing politics with the Joint Opposition.


MR, Basil decisive figures in deciding next Candidate
There are certain differences of opinion on the presidential candidate to be nominated by the Joint Opposition. Members such as Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila are adamant that it should be none other than former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. There is a school of thought that it should be former Minister Basil Rajapaksa. Alongside, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara promotes MP Chamal Rajapaksa, the eldest of the Rajapaksa family as the candidate. However, it has become a lone voice. Finally, there are two main personalities who can decide on their candidate. First, it is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who acts as the leader of all in that camp. Along with him, Basil Rajapaksa who formed the SLPP has a great say in determining the next candidate. He holds power over a bulk of local authorities in the country. It means he has grassroots level political representatives across the length and breadth of this country. 
Also, he spearheads the SLPP. The next candidate will contest the polls under the SLPPs lotus bud symbol. Therefore, Basil Rajapaksa is also a decisive factor in this regard.

SL has a very strategic position  in the world -  French Senator
	

Nine years into the post-war era Sri Lanka is making slow and steady progress as a developing country. However, much needs to be done to uplift the lives of the people and bring in more hope and prosperity to poverty-stricken areas of the country. Among the many countries that have allied with Sri Lanka, France stands in a significant position. 
During a recent visit, French Senator and Vice Chair of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Armed Forces Committee of the French Senate Hlne Conway-Mouret held several discussions with the Chief of Staff, State Secretary of Defence and several other important people to secure ties and strengthen the relationship between the two countries. 
In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror, Ms Conway-Mouret expressed her views about the security situation in the country, the operations of French military and the relationship between Sri Lanka and France.

Sri Lanka has a very central and strategic position in the world.-With the rise of China and India, the Indian Ocean has become a very important shipping route
	
	In future, officers will be able to come to Paris for learning.
	
	The Navy controls and protects the coast and it is also where human and drug trafficking are done.
	

Sri Lanka fought a thirty-year ethnic conflict. How do you see its progress nine years into the post-war era
Sri Lanka has a very central and strategic position in the world. Therefore, with the rise of countries such as China and India, we see that the Indian Ocean has become a very important shipping route. Of course with this kind of business and commerce comes other issues such as trafficking and therefore it is important to keep peace within the region. There is also a need for diverse education. Europe sends a lot of tourists and tourism too could be developed in the country. It is good to work together because we see the rise of populist and nationalist movements. Today all democratic countries should come together to be able to protect the peace.

If you look at Europe there is a long period of peace, which has given prosperity to all European countries and at the end of the day it is attracting a lot of migrants

What role does the military play in strengthening national security
It is both internal and external security, which we need to focus on. The Navy controls and protects the coast and it is also where human and drug trafficking is done. Therefore the Navy needs to be strong to be able to stop and control these activities. Unfortunately for us we now have the Army involved in preventing terrorism. But we didnt have this situation five years ago. We have a strong Army, who is involved in peace-keeping missions abroad, which shows their level of competence because what they do in Mali is very important. They have a lot of expertise and are sharing the expertise in Africa to bring up the level of the Army so that they themselves can protect their own people in future without having to seek support from other countries.

Recently the military academy has launched the Smart Class to teach French to Army personnel in Sri Lanka. What are your comments
I think it is essential because Army personnel are called for their competencies. When they move to another country it is a different environment and they are under pressure.
So it is good to communicate with others especially if you are under tension and threat because you dont want to miss on the messages that you are getting. Therefore I think preparations done in advance are vital to enhancing their competencies with the language skills that allow them to communicate for their own security as well as sharing what they know with others. It is a good way to motivate the Army personnel as well.

France is pushing for what we call G5 where five countries in Western Africa including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger are pulling their resources together to move forward. We need people such as those in Sri Lanka to bring in their expertise in securing the convoys.

Other than in the Africa Continent, where else has the French military been deployed
We have a strong operation in Mali because we were afraid that it would turn into a terrorist State as terrorist groups have taken over the capital city. They are still in the North and the French troops are doing their best to get rid of them. There is a threat to other countries such as Cameroon and Niger as well.

What lessons could Sri Lanka learn from French military operations and strategies
There are more ships patrolling the Indian Ocean. We have discussed that in future, some officers would be able to come to Paris for three or six months so that they could learn and also bring in their expertise and share what they have learned. I believe in education because it is the most important thing in life; it keeps their financial autonomy and freedom in the future.

Cybercrime is becoming a threat to national security. How has France countered this threat
The French Parliament is looking into this and we have passed legislation to, first of all, make the operators liable because earlier we had said that anybody could do anything using these platforms. Then we saw that it was being used for criminal purposes. We have therefore changed our legislation and now they have to control what is being published and if they dont do that they are punished by law, either by having to pay a heavy fine or through imprisonment. We also need to train our people to be able to protect ourselves. There is awareness now especially in terms of Facebook. Indeed it can destabilize a country and could have an impact on an election. We had a lot of attacks during the French elections and the same in Britain with Brexit.

What lies ahead between Sri Lanka and France
I requested to meet with the Chief of Staff and State Secretary of Defence and I want to see how the relationship could be strengthened. We have the Alliance Francaise involved in very important projects. If peoples lives are secured with clean water, good health and education services they will keep them content. When people are happy, democracy is stable and then you could fight poverty and all kinds of crimes that come with it.

We have therefore changed our legislation and now they have to control what is being published

If you look at Europe there is a long period of peace, which has given prosperity to all European countries and at the end of the day it is attracting a lot of migrants.

SLC to contest ICC charge over inconsistent application of rules
	
An interesting legal battle is on the cards between the lawyers of Sri Lanka Cricket and International Cricket Council after the former reported to have decided to contest the ICC sanctions issued on Thursday, the Cricbuzz reported.
Following the drawn second Test match between Sri Lanka and West Indies in St. Lucia, ICC Match Referee Javagal Srinath found Sri Lanka skipper Dinesh Chandimal guilty of tampering with the ball. Minutes later, the ICC announced that CEO David Richardson had charged Chandimal, Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha and Team Manager Asanka Gurusinha of a more serious Level three offence which relates to conduct that is contrary to the Spirit of the game.
The Sri Lankans were charged for holding up play for two hours on the morning of day three after the umpires accused the Sri Lankan captain of ball tampering.
SLC officials were in discussion with the Sri Lankan side that is currently in Barbados and late Wednesday night made a decision to contest the charge. SLC sources said that the board will inform the decision to the ICC Thursday morning.
That means the ICC will have to appoint a Judicial Commissioner to hear the case and the trio of Chandimal, Hathurusingha and Gurusinha will not be suspended from the third and final day-night Test in Barbados.
A level three offence carries a penalty of a ban of two to four Test matches and if found guilty, the top brass of the Sri Lankan side will miss most part of the home series against South Africa next month.
Sri Lanka is believed to be contesting the charge on the grounds of the inconsistency of application of the rule and not following proper procedure. The charge against Chandimal was laid on the morning of day three and Sri Lankan believes that he should have been charged on day two. However, officials have 18 hours to charge a player. But Sri Lankan argues that the umpires didn't have any issues with the ball when they took it to their custody at stumps on day two.
Sri Lanka claims that they were informed about the charge ten minutes before play on day three although both teams had arrived at the venue more than two hours prior to the start of day's play.
Match Referee Srinath also has been accused of inconsistency. The tourists claim that when they were reluctant to take the field, Srinath had assured there would be no imposition of the five penalty runs sanction or a change of change the ball. However, when they took the field the umpires did completely the opposite holding up play again.
Sri Lanka are believed to have accused umpire Ian Gould of getting carried away after the ball-tampering fiasco in South Africa early this year that saw three Australian players getting suspended.
Sri Lankan also questions whether the five-run penalty rule was applied on all occasions in recent times when teams were accused of ball tampering.(Cricbuzz)

Still premature to comment: Rajitha
	
Cabinet spokesman and Health Minister, Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday it was still premature to comment on the US withdrawal from the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC), but it could have a positive outcome.
He told the weekly Cabinet news briefing that the US withdrawal from the UNHRC took place a few days ago and Sri Lanka must wait and see what the fallout would be.
He told Daily Mirror the situation would be different, as it was the US that took the initiative to bring a resolution on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC.
We can hope for a better international standing for Sri Lanka. But dont forget that the first resolution on alleged violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) by Sri Lanka was supported by the US. The Mahinda Rajapaksa government pledged to probe the alleged violation of the IHL in the resolution at the UNHRC in Geneva. Two other resolutions against Sri Lanka were passed after the MR government failed to fulfil the pledges given to the international community. Therefore, Sri Lanka is committed to abide by three UNHRC resolutions as we have signed all UN conventions on safeguarding human rights. (Sandun A. Jayaskera)

## Title: The rise of the janapriya, fall of the jana
## Section: News Features
## Date: 21 June 2018 12:04 am
The rise of the janapriya, fall of the jana
	

The seventies in Britain are remembered as the era of Edward Heath, the donkey jacket, and the Austin Allegro. It is also remembered by my friend Michael OLeary as the era of crappy, god-awful music, as can be inferred from those singles which won at the Eurovision Contest: Lulus Boom Bang-a-Bang in 1969, Danas All Kinds of Everything in 1970, and the Brotherhood of Mans Save Your Kisses For Me in 1976. This was the era of colour, of vivacity, but also of kitsch and of sober economic downturns. Sri Lanka faced economic and cultural downturns like this in that decade, and before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, we would unleash a new free market to change it. The seventies are naturally remembered today as a decade of stringent rationing. This applied even to the arts. (Vijaya Kumaratunga and Ravindra Randeniya, when they went to London over The God King, found they had to reckon with their countrys harsh, at times irrational foreign exchange restrictions). 

Hope, or the lack thereof, thus became the definitive factor of this period. Jana and janapriya, for one instant, soon began to cohabit, particularly in music. Clarence Wijewardena, H. D. Premaratne, and the Ummagga Jathakaya all conspired to give us Sikuruliya, which brought together Vijaya Kumaratunga and Joe Abeywickrama, two different faces from two different cinematic eras. The middle class, squeezed beyond endurance, fell down a few notches, so the populist peechan art they patronised reflected their own masscult, antiestablishment attitudes and concerns. Jothipala was their monarch, their hero. He had a voice and that voice fitted virtually every actor who lip-synced to it, from Joe to Vijaya. Amaradeva had tried to collaborate with him once before, towards the end of the sixties, but owing to their different worldviews and ways of working, the maestro had to retreat, annoyed. He tried his luck again in 1976, and he succeeded with the first of two hits which got them together, Kanden Kandata. Despite the primitiveness of the technology (Lester Peries, recounting his experience getting the recording done for the music from The God King in London, observed that we were 30 years behind them), despite the uneasiness of the paradox between these two cultural sensibilities, janapriya slowly began assimilating jana. 

A prosperous decade
All that changed with the election of J. R. Jayewardene and his administrations ushering in of a newer, more prosperous decade. As laid down in Yashorawaya and several other novels by the late Somaweera Senanayake, what the eighties did was give birth to a new middle class. This was the offspring of a more traditionalist generation, the sort which preferred Amaradeva to Clarence and Jothipala but which listened to both. This latter generation had worked as government bureaucrats. They were now idealising careers in the private sector for their children. They would have worked as customs officers and nurses, and were now nurturing dreams of their children becoming attorneys and doctors. It was a turbulent time, far removed from the fifties and sixties. Cultural fusion was not impossible to get at this point, and in this era, of advertising and instant noodles (Prima made its headway here), the popular effectively met the highbrow. Ajantha Ranasinghe had written for Jothipala before; now he would do the same for the pop voice of the eighties, Rookantha Goonethilake. Amaradeva had not worked with Clarence before; the latter would become the first person to both write and compose for the maestro, with Sasara Gewa Yana. The advertising industry also broke down distinctions between the serious and the popular: Neela Wickramasinghe sang for Vogue Jewellers, Indrani Perera sang for Link Kesha, while Clarence found himself composing jingles for Edna, Atlas, Keells, and Singer. 

The tragedy here is that we have no one to continue from where Amaradeva and his descendants left off

Improvement in technology
Another thing happened: the technology improved. The jana sensibility had thrived on what was available. Amaradeva and Victor Ratnayake were satisfied with what they had, and what they got. The janapriya sensibility, of Clarence and The Moonstones and the Three Sisters, on the other hand, depended on formal, technical, and technological innovations. Clarences rise thus coincided with the record label, through Sooriya. It was a trend that would follow well into the eighties, during which time Singlanka and Tharanga would revolutionise the cassette industry and emancipate established players like Sanath Nandasiri and T. M. Jayaratne and also new entrants, particularly from the janapriya culture, like Rookantha Goonethilake. From Rookantha we come to Athula Adikari and Bathiya and Santhush, exponents of the pre-internet popular culture, who found their niche in newly established, technology-driven production houses. 
With each era giving way to a glossier, glitzier innovation in the cultural sphere, however, something was bound to come about. That something, which in no way was the fault purely of these innovations, was the separation of the jana from the janapriya. They no longer met, in other words, and from the nineties onwards, the janapriya sensibility would thrive, would flourish, while the jana sensibility would stall. 
How did this happen There probably were more reasons than one. First and foremost, the prevalence of technology over literacy and the resultant fusion of technology and populist art forms. This was to be felt most vividly in the music industry, particularly through the rise of the cassette industry and production houses. With the shift from a literary sensibility to a sensibility conditioned by the profit motive, a shift necessitated by the new economy, there was a transformation in the way people, particularly young people, thought about art and culture. What this culture of technology over literacy thus privileged were the rhythms, the cadences, the ability to adjust your voice to the tone and pitch you wanted. What was lost in the richness of this technology was the richness of poetry. In this sense, Bathiya and Santhush, with their most frequently resorted to lyricists, Nilar M. Cassim and Wasantha Dukkgannarala, were the last icons from a bygone era, an era which fused words with melodies, poetry with motion. 
There were other reasons. The eighties oversaw a shift in the way we thought about our history, our heritage, our literature. While a comprehensive critique of this is hard to obtain, it is possible to ascertain that there came about a transformation, and not a positive one at that, in the teaching of history. Briefly put, history was stripped of its richness, its vivacity, and reduced to a series of dates to memorise. For all its ills, the changes effected on the national syllabus by the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government were not adverse like this. All it did was to replace history, its emphasis on memory, with social studies, especially through the textbooks drawn up by Neil Kuruppu. The idea of social studies was to enable students to learn about the history, geography, and society of their world: their village, their district, their country. Based on the Reggio Emilia approach, it did away with the dates-driven method of previous curricula and, for the first time, empowered students to draw up links between the culture and the arts, in particular literature. After the eighties though, this method was scrapped, and in its place, as we now see, came a horde of textbooks which teemed with error after error. Naturally enough, the jana sensibility was all but completely wiped out. This was to be expected, since in Neville Karunathilakes words, many schoolchildren are growing up without any knowledge of our culture, traditional values, and heritage. 
Thats not all. As opposed to the cultural monarchy we had in the sixties and seventies, from the eighties onwards we began to get used to the idea of a cultural democracy. This democracy thrived on three things: the opening up of art forms to everyone and anyone, the reduction in prices of musical instruments, and the proliferation of the janapriya sensibility among the youth. Schoolboy bands are on the rise. With each passing era, these schoolboys learnt to adulate and emulate a singer-hero. In this era, that hero is Sanuka Wickramasinghe. Sanuka, who can melodise as well as sing and write (he wrote Mayam Kalawe, performed by Nadeemal Perera), is something of a quirk: someone who, unlike the pop culture icons of yesteryear, has the ability to weave the highbrow and the populist together. I have written before on Sanuka, and I have observed how the image he has conjured, of the solitary, lonely, but fulfilled artiste, is miles away from the Boy Scout-ish charm and togetherness of Bathiya and Santhush. He embodies rebellion, yet with a welter of security. Hypocritical at one level, but enough for his fans to conclude, He is THE voice for OUR generation! 

With each era giving way to a glossier, glitzier innovation in the cultural sphere, however, something was bound to come about

However, it is a little too late to be optimistic. Sanuka is Sanuka. He is the line that continues the tradition of Neville Fernando, Clarence, Jothipala, Rookantha, Bathiya and Santhush, and Iraj. While he is different from these voices, his own voice is a continuation of a particular tradition: the tradition that appeals to youth. The tragedy here is that we have no one to continue from where Amaradeva and his descendants left off. As I wrote before, that has a lot to do with our cultural attitudes, and the attitudes of the youth, who are more attuned with a secular, almost culture-less, and technology-driven variant of music. It is this tendency, among the young, which keeps the janapriya sensibility alive. For the jana sensibility to come alive like this, however, those attitudes must change. Starting from the way we teach ourselves how to regard our own history, heritage, and literature, there must be a paradigm shift. Otherwise, the absence of a jana sensibility will continue to deprive us of variety in the arts. We have Sanuka, we have Nadeemal, we have Sajith, but without those who will take the baton from Amaradeva, from Victor, from Amarasiri Peiris, we will wade on clueless.

Wijeyadasa, Harees in battle of words
	
Public Enterprise Deputy Minister H M M Harees and Minister of Higher Education Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe were embroiled in an altercation in Parliament yesterday over a statement allegedly made by Minister Rajapakshe at the Oluvil University that lecturers were demanding sexual favours from students.
Deputy Minister Harees complained saying students and parents were troubled by the statement made by Minister Rajapakshe that lecturers had demanded sexual favours from students.
One student even brought a parent to see me and complain about what you said, the deputy minister said. He said people in the area had also got to know about what was said by the minister on this occasion.
Minister Rajapakshe, responding to this allegation, explained that he had only referred to one particular lecturer, whom he named during his speech.Are you asking me not to take any steps to prevent lecturers from taking advantage of students One cannot cover up what is taking place at the Oluvil University, he said. He said a female student had submitted an affidavit stating that she was threatened by a lecturer saying he will fail her if she fails to satisfy his physical desires.
He said there is a fear psychosis prevailing in this university that prevents the authorities from taking steps to stop such incidents taking place inside the university premises. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Will Yahapalanists stand in the cesspool or cesspit now
	
Take a deep breath. Let it go. Suppress all urges to laugh your guts out. Breathe in. Breathe out. Have a cup of chamomile tea. Think of the best joke youve heard so far. Think of Charlie Chaplin and other great comedians. Now read. 
The US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley announced that her country would withdraw from the UN Human Rights Commission (UNHRC). Calling the UNHRC a cesspool of political bias, Haley explained the decision thus: 
We take this step because our commitment does not allow us to remain a part of a hypocritical and self-serving organization that makes a mockery of human rights. 
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who appeared alongside Haley at a media conference held at the State Department said the noble vision of the body notwithstanding, the US needed to be honest. The honesty he encapsulated in the following observation: The Human Rights Council is a poor defender of human rights. 
It is reported that Haley and Pompeo explained that the decision came after, a long year of efforts to shame the council into reform and to remove member states that themselves commit abuses. 
Take the key words/terms used or implied here: hypocritical, self-serving, poor defender of human rights, dishonesty, shamelessness. Which country do these words/terms describe best if not the United States of America Cesspool indeed! They were spot on with that descriptive, only they used it on the UNHRC which, the world knows, was the USAs baby all along. Just like the UN, one might add, which is for all intents and purposes a creature of the USA. 
The UNHRC, ever since it was formed in 2006, and the UN in general have always treated with leniency the USA and the various war-mongering, rights-abusing blocs of countries it has led. Leniency by the way is a generous term. When the USA wanted to censure any particular country or regime, the UNHRC turned itself into a cheering squad. 

One thing is clear. Yahapalanaya is not the perfume it was thought to be. It stinks. All doubts about the source of the stench can now be laid to rest. Haley and Pompeo have give us the names and the addresses

The USA might not think of itself as the cesspit that it is, and indeed it might be so used to the stench that it has become oblivious to the bad odour. Well, it is more likely that they knew, but didnt believe that the world knew the stinking truth as well. 
Nevertheless it cant be that Washington suddenly discovered a foul-smelling cousin. It cant be that the likes of Haley and Pompeo woke up one fine morning and discovered that the UNHRC was bad. They must have known, especially since the resemblance between the USA and UNHRC was too close for anyone to see the two as anything but blood brothers, so to speak. What happened was that self-interest was not served one fine day. Stuff didnt go down the tube as smoothly as it had before. 
Put simply, the USA was rudely awakened and decided that the best way to counter punch was to throw at the newfound enemy the terminology that was core to Washington-speak. 
In fairness, though, theyve done their part in removing member states that commit abuses, simply by adhering to the dictum charity begins at home. It wont make the UNHRC fragrant, not by any stretch of the imagination, but its certainly a step in the right direction. 
We need not go into all that. We can laugh our guts out. 
Whats more important about this veritable cesspit calling the UN agency concerned a cesspool is where it leaves those who were practically swearing by both on things such as human rights, truth, peace, justice and reconciliation. Theres little that a cesspool can deliver except, well, a lot of gooey stuff that stinks. 
And yet, for purposes of political expediency there were many who ran to Washington as though the Messiah lived there. They ran to the UNHRC as though it was made of squeaky clean saints. Many worthies in this Yahapalana Government took policy and political cues from the US Embassy in Colombo, which actually facilitated the funding of the Yahapalana election campaign. 
So, will the Yahapalanists stand with the cesspit (USA) or the cesspool (UNHRC) now Will they take the cue from the US Embassy in Colombo and echo the words of Haley and Pompeo Will they take a deep breath, pite their lips play ostrich, and wait for the UN system to recover its sense of purpose (read Washington/Tel Aviv agenda) 
Let us not forget that the then Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera went as far as co-sponsoring on behalf of Sri Lanka a resolution on (read, against) Sri Lanka at the UNHRC. What does he have to say about a resolution spawned in a cesspool now, one must ask. The Yahapalanists can navel-gaze and lapse into mumblement as it often does. They can play ostrich. They can get the US Embassy to write a position paper. Thats if they have any shame. Shameless as they are, theres one thing they really cant wash their hands off from: the fact that they were dipped head-to-toe in the UNHRC by the USA. Thats a cesspool, according to Haley and Pompeo. The US Ambassador Atul Keshap is mandated to go with that description. 
One thing is clear. Yahapalanaya is not the perfume it was thought to be. It stinks. All doubts about the source of the stench can now be laid to rest. Haley and Pompeo have given us the names and the addresses. More importantly, we need to recognize that the US leaving the UNHRC cesspool doesnt exactly clear the air thats polluted by those who were born and bred in cesspools (or cesspits if you prefer the word). Perhaps theyll pack their bags and take the next flight to the USA. Perhaps not. If not, then theres a choice before us: do we hold our noses for ever or do we take these people to the cleaners
