 London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) won the prestigious award for ‘Best Global Exchange Group’ at the fifth annual Markets Choice Awards (MCAs) held in New York last month. 
Organised by Markets Media and Traders Magazine, the Markets Choice Awards recognise excellence among firms and individuals in financial markets. Four LSEG businesses were also recognised at the awards: LCH, MTS, MillenniumIT, and London Stock Exchange, for their role in helping the Group distinguish itself amongst its peers.
Today, LSEG is a leading developer and operator of high performance technology solutions, including trading, market surveillance and post trade systems. The Group carries out operations for over 40 organisations and exchanges, including the Group’s own markets with additional services including network connectivity, hosting and quality assurance testing.  The Group has a strong footprint in Sri Lanka, employing over 800 staff in highly skilled roles across multiple locations in Colombo and Malabe.
The MCAs aim to identify and recognise the best companies, individuals and innovation in financial markets, spanning institutional trading and investing including buy-side investors, traders and trading desks, sell-side execution desks, exchanges and platforms, traditional technology providers and emerging fintech firms. 
A thorough selection methodology is carried out in order to identify nominees and winners, and the MCA Advisory Board maintains its focus on the opinions of market participants.
