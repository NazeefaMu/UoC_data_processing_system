Disgraceful deal between MR and RW: JVP


	

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged today that the most disgraceful deal in the country was taking place between Ranil Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Rajapaksa.

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that Shiranthi Rajapaksa, who had been summoned to the FCID to record a statement over a financial misappropriation, went to the Speaker’s official residence to give the statement as a result of the agreement between Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Wickremesinghe.

“After investigations, Mrs. Rajapaksa should be arrested and produced in courts. Why is she not arrested even after four months? Mahinda Rajapaksa has phoned Mr. Wickremesinghe and prevented the arrest. These are the deals. The President, and the Prime Minister were also asked to mediate in Wimal Weerawansa’s passport case,” he said.

He said Mr. Wickremesinghe’s tactics had been to divide the SLFP just as former President J.R. Jayewardene acted to divide the SLFP, to resist the Opposition.

“Mr. Jayewardene used Anura Bandaranaike to create rifts in the SLFP. Today Mr. Wickremesinghe’s tactic is also to divide the SLFP.

“The Rajapaksa faction is working towards that direction on the instruction of Mr. Wickremesinghe. Basil Rajapaksa was hospitalised soon after his arrest following the agreement. After the Pada Yathra, no leader criticised Mr. Wickremesinghe, because this group is acting on the behest of Mr. Wickremesinghe,” he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said the main crisis in the country was the decrease of the State revenue just as in the case of the previous Government and added that the only solution to this Government had been the tax revenue.

“Today the tax revenue is 90% of the State revenue. There have been complications of the tax policy and it had been even more complicated due to the new VAT revision. We cannot find solutions to the economic crisis just by defeating the tax Act. It can be done only by defeating the economic policy of the Government,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
