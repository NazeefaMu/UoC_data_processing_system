Deputy Inspector General of Police Priyantha Jayakody has been appointed as the Police Media Spokesman, the Law & Order and Southern Development Ministry said today.

Ministry Secretary Jagath P Wijeweera said the vacant post had lead to the publication of misleading news stories in the recent past.

The Ministry had adopted a new policy when dealing with the media, the Secretary said. While the police is cleared to issue reports on certain subjects, the ministry will tend to national and international issues, policy decisions and controversial issues.

Meanwhile DIG Jayakody said the police will release news concerning arrests, drug busts, measures taken to eradicate crimes and anything to do with civil security and accidents.

“Selected policemen across the island will also be trained to research and compile news items, which will then be approved by the ministry before it is released,” he said     

DIG Jayakody is also the Director of the Criminal Records Division.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
