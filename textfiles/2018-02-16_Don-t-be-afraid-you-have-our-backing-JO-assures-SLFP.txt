The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday told the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) not to be afraid when making a decision to form its own government and assured them that they were there to support them once they make that call.

MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said that the JO MPs had decided at a meeting held last morning to offer its unconditional support to the SLFP in the event it broke away from the unity government it had formed with the United National Party (UNP).

The meeting was held under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his residence in Wijerama Mawatha in Colombo 7.

“We have been telling the SLFP from the beginning that we will support them if it exits from the government. At the meeting, we decided to support the SLFP to form a government without any condition. We would like to tell the SLFP not be afraid and that we will be right behind them,” he told Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
