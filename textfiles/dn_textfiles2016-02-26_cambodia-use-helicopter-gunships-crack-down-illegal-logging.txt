Cambodia to use helicopter gunships to crack down on illegal logging

 
CAMBODIA: Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Thursday said he had authorised the use of helicopter gunships to crack down on rampant illegal logging in an effort to curb deforestation.
Hun Sen recently appointed armed forces deputy commander-in-chief General Sao Sokha and the head of the military police to curb illegal logging and timber smuggling.
The trade, lubricated by violence and bribery of forestry officials and border guards, has eviscerated one quarter of the country's forests in a generation. Hun Sen has been in power in throughout that time, but conservationists say he has made little headway in reducing illegal logging despite trumpeting several crackdowns.
"We recognise that deforestation must be punished. I gave two helicopters to Sao Sokha," Hun Sen said Thursday.
"I have authorised them to fire rockets."
Hun Sen said his government had also confiscated nearly one million hectares (2.5 million acres) of land from private firms in an effort to stop illegal forest clearance.
He said the trade was being conducted under the noses of officials, asking: "The logs are so big, where are the eyes of police, military police, forestry administration and the ministry of environment? Or are you guys just the same as them?"
In the last few decades a surge in illegal logging has contributed to a sharp drop in Cambodia's forest cover, which fell from 73 percent in 1990 to 57 percent in 2010, according to the United Nations.
