The number of Indian vehicles imported to Sri Lanka had increased by 637 percent in 2015 compared to 2014 because of the 100-day-programme, the joint opposition said today.

MP Bandula Gunawardane said the drastic increase in Indian vehicles had clearly made an impact on Japanese vehicle importers.

“This is a measure taken by the government to please India for their contribution to topple the previous government. No other country has done something like this before,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
