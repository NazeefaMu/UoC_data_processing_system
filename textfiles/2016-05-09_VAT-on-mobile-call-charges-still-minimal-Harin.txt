The increase in the Value Added Tax (VAT) on mobile network charges is not a huge burden on the people when compared with other countries, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said today.

He told the BBC Sinhala Service that he would not attempt to justify the VAT increase but the Government was compelled to do so because of the current economic situation in the country.

“Sri Lanka has the lowest phone charge rates when compared with other countries. Even though VAT has been increased rates are still minimal. It is not a huge burden on the people,” he added.
