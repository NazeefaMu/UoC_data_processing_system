The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday said the proposed India-aided ambulance service should be operated under a domestic mechanism in order to preserve our rights.


GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge stated that an ambulance service, on a domestic mechanism, was effectively operated in the Northern Provincial Council based in the Kilinochchi Hospital.


“The Northern Provincial Council has successful launched an ambulance service based in the Kilinochchi Hospital with 106 ambulances. It is being operated with advanced technology, and the ambulances have quick access to the patient. The proposed India-aided ambulance service could also be implemented on a national mechanism alike the ambulance service in the Northern Provincial Council,” he said.


Dr. Haritha Aluthge mentioned that it was dangerous for the company to be given the authority to make purchases and recruit staff on its own through a cabinet paper.


GMOA Secretary Nalinda Herath said the government’s move to introduce a national salary structure was praiseworthy, and that it would help prevent the brain drain in the country. (Ajith Siriwardana)
