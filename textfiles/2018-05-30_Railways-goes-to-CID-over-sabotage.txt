He said sabotage activities such as damaging several train locomotives, compartments, signal cables and tablet instruments had been reported.

He said legal action would be taken against the workers under damaging the property of the Railways Department and misappropriation of public property.

“A special internal investigation will also be conducted by the Railways Department,” he said.

Several trains were running behind schedule due to damages.
