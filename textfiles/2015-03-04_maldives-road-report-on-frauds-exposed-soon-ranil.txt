	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament he would submit a report to the House on the alleged fraudulent matters pertaining to the assistance given by the Sri Lankan Government to the Maldives to construct a road in that country.
	 
	Mr. Wickremesinghe who responded to an oral question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in the House said a sum of Rs 1.07 Billion was the cost for the construction of the road while the contractor had been selected following the direct contact method without calling for tenders.
	Mr. Dissanayake who responded questioned as to how a contractor was selected without calling for tenders.
	The Prime Minister who responded said Maldives was considered a part of Sri Lanka and same practices may have been followed in both countries in this situation.
	Mr. Dissanayake alleged that metal had been transported to the Maldives violating the environment laws. Mr. Wickremasinghe who responded said transporting metal violating laws was nothing compared to the amount of money taken out of the country violating currency laws. However, he assured that a report would be submitted to the House on the matter soon. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
