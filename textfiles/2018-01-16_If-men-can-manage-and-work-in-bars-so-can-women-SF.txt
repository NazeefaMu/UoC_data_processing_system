Commenting on the government removing an age old ban on women working in bars, Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said at a time when women commandeered fighter jets, women were found competent to do whatever men did.

“If men can work and manage bars so can women,” he said.

Speaking to the media after a function in Gampaha, the minister said some 2,000 temples had been closed and 2,000 bars established during the Rajapaksa regime.

He said he agreed with the policy decisions of the government despite the criticism aimed at them. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
