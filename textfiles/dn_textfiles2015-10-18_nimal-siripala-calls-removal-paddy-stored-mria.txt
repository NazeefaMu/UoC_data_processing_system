Nimal Siripala calls for removal of paddy stored at MRIA

Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday that he would request from the relevant authorities in the government to take immediate action to remove the paddy stored at the the Mattala
Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA).
Minister de Silva speaking to the media after an inspection tour of the MRIA yesterday, said some of the sophisticated machines at the airport have been damaged by the dust and husk of paddy stored at
the MRIA.
Several cargo scanning machines have severely damaged. The damage cost would be high,the minister said, adding that he was not sure whether some of these expensive machines were beyond repair.
He said that the stores at the MRIA were meant for storing certain equipment needed by the airport and not for paddy storage. Pigeons had begun to flock around the airport and their dung has also caused some damage to it," he said.
He further said the MRIA would not get quarantine certificate if some sophisticated machines are affected by insects.
"We will develop this airport to international standards and a promotional campaign will be launched to attract more tourists. If the MRIA is functions in a proper manner,then there will be no need to depend on India for emergency landings of aircraft," he further said.
Usually flights landing at the Bandaranaike International Airport in Katunayake are diverted to Chennai if they cannot land at Katunayake, but, now those flights can land at the MRIA.
