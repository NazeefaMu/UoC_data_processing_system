Champs Kandy SC prove their worth

Reigning champions Kandy SC won the opening game against one- time kings of club rugby CH and FC at Nittawela on Sunday evening by a mammoth score. The winners wrapped up the game, they way it should be as a champion for another year, they also looked the better side in play, the opponents failed to finish the game. The home outfit managed to limit their guests to just one penalty that came in the fourth minute of play, which was goaled by Janith Chandimal
Putting hands together on the ball was a clear tactic by Kandy SC, it wasn't just one player, it was all getting involved - or just one type of ball handling, and also there were grubbers, chips, they looked to test CH and FC under high ball and turn them in defence , which reaped good rewards .
CH and FC never looked like scoring a try but, more significantly, Kandy SC never looked like leaking one. Their defence was solid throughout as they missed five tackles while the CH and FC missed 22. Even when Kandy SC went to their go-to weapon of a driving maul game they never looked tired, their defence was solid throughout. Kandy SC started with their good moves, with scrum half Roshan and fly half Fazil kept on feeding good ball to the backs with no end to all opening. Kandy's game plan, based on tough defence and good ball handling at every opportunity, frustrated CH and FC. This game which stayed as one sided until the final whistle and the winners have reason to be proud. Nineteen tries were scored in total, out of which five were goaled.
Kandy SC did well to survive a battering up front in the game, and there were positives in the performances of the back three and both centers. Fazil Marija in particular, you would think, with his versatility has played himself as a match winning captain.
Going into the game knowing they needed to win by a clean margin with bonus points Marija's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them as one of the most remarkable, and unbowed side. CH and FC were noticeably rattled in this game, but their power told in their game, a big hand should go to the young men who gave a good game of rugby and kept the club flag flying.
