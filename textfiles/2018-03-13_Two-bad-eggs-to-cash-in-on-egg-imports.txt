Two bad eggs to cash in on egg imports


	



 

Two purohitas are in a race to import a shipment of about 3 million eggs in a purported bid to head off a possible egg shortage during the upcoming Sinhala/Hindu New year. 

 


However, according to market sources the country’s current egg production exceeds the national requirement by one million and the two purohitas are out to collect a commission taking advantage of a perceived egg shortage. 


One of the purohitas involved is a veteran in the ‘commission game’ and the other is a newcomer to it, they say.
