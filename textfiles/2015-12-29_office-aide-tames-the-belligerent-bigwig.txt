Office aide tames the belligerent bigwig


	


As the battle over the key chairs of the gentlemen’s game grows in unprecedented intensity, certain interested parties have begun resorting to fisticuffs to vent their animosity, reports say. 
It is well known that quite recently a contender for the biggest chair had a nasty brush with a white collar high up of the controlling body at the Sports Ministry itself. However, it is little known that the incident was an extension from a previous one.
Earlier on the day of that spat, a former bigwig of the game set upon another and then a third party also joined the fray leading to an ugly scene in front of a key chair in the Ministry. When everyone was passively looking on, a young office aide (referred to as KKS) wielding a broom stick had walked up to the scene and confronted the former bigwig of the game, the most belligerent of the three and barked: “I say, stop fighting. If you don’t, I am going to give you a thundering slap… True, I am doing a minor job here. But I also studied in the school you did study. (He mentions the name of the school) Stop this fighting… Get out or be ready to face the worst.”
The former bigwig of the gentlemen’s game who realized that the KKS menacingly brandishing the broom stick meant business, beat a hasty retreat. And the other two also quietly faded from the scene, they say.
