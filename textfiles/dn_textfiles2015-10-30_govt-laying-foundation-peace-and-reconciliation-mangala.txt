Govt laying foundation for peace and reconciliation - Mangala

The government is now beginning to lay the foundation for peace and reconciliation through truth-seeking, accountability, reparations and non-recurrence, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Speaking at a ceremony held to mark the 25th anniversary of the expulsion of Muslims from the North, the minister said the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, the Resettlement Ministry and government agencies are taking steps to assist in this process.
Samaraweera said he also met the civil society, including representatives of the Muslim community, to discuss the consultations process necessary to design the mechanisms to implement this process.
"Muslims will be an integral part of the truth, justice, reparations and non-recurrence process. Muslims' grievances and concerns will be a part of the consultations, design and operationalisation of the domestic mechanisms; including the Commission for Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and Non-recurrence, the Judicial Mechanism, the Office of Missing Persons and the Office of Reparations. Together with the Ministries and government agencies, these mechanisms, will provide much needed relief to the daily struggle of the thousands of Muslims who remain in IDP camps, are struggling to return to their homes or are dealing with the losses of loved ones," he said.
The mechanisms will not only address the suffering and grievances of members of the Muslim community, they will also address the grievances and concerns of members of the Sinhala and Tamil communities and the concerns of other minority groups, he said.
"At this historic moment, let us not be afraid to engage in meaningful dialogue aimed at finding solutions to problems as opposed to pointing fingers, heaping blame and scoring political points at the expense of future generations. Let us design, define and create our future by our hopes and aspirations, and not be held back by the fears and prejudices of the past. Let us not be afraid to dream," the minister said.
"At this critical moment in Sri Lanka's history the lessons of the expulsion have much to teach us. Since Independence we have failed to establish a society where all citizens feel equal and free and, as a result, instead of peace, conflict has prevailed," he said.
"The end of the war presented a historic opportunity for all our communities and leaders to demonstrate true leadership by breaking away from the past and beginning the task of building a truly united Sri Lanka. Just as Muslims and Tamils lived together as brothers and sisters in the North for centuries; prior to Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka had many centuries of ethnic amity and peace," the minister said.
The TNA recently announced that it would be leading its own community in a process of introspection. The SLMC, welcoming this statement, indicated that it would do so as well. The National Government comprising of both the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party have committed themselves to guiding the entire country in this difficult process of dealing with the past," he said.
