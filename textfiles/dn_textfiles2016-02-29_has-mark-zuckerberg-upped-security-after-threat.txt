Has Mark Zuckerberg upped security after IS threat?

 
GERMANY: He is said to be so concerned about his own security that he now has no less than 16 people protecting him at his $7million Palo Alto, California home.
So it may not come as a surprise that Mark Zuckerberg, who was threatened by ISIS supporters earlier this week, wasn't taking his chances when he headed out for a casual jog while in Berlin.
Zuckerberg, pictured in one of his signature gray T-shirts while carrying his iPhone on Thursday, had at least five men surrounding him, in what appeared to be more than just a casual running club.
The Facebook CEO's show of strength in Berlin's Pariser Platz square comes just a day after supporters of ISIS threatened him and Twitter chief Jack Dorsey.
A new 25-minute video titled Flames Of The Supporters, found by Vocativ on Wednesday, features pictures of both entrepreneurs covered in bullet holes.
In it, the militants claim they control more than 10,000 Facebook accounts, 150 Facebook groups and 5,000 Twitter profiles - and warn they will retaliate to any attempt to drive them off the sites.
Text flashes up on the screen, which reads: 'To Mark and Jack, founders of Twitter and Facebook and to their Crusader government.
'You announce daily that you suspend many of our accounts.
'And to you we say: Is that all you can do? You are not in our league.'.
It continues with shots of their militants on Facebook and Twitter, hacking accounts and changing their profile pictures to ISIS propaganda.
'If you close one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased after we delete your sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true,' it warns in subtitles. Zuckerberg, who was later pictured in Berlin with his wife Priscilla, has reportedly bumped up his security detail back home in Palo Alto due to threats from unstable website users, according to Page Six.
The billionaire is in Germany for two days of talks as the country debates how to tackle online xenophobia and hate speech amid an influx of refugees in to the country.
Facebook agreed in December to abide by German laws on hate speech on their sites in Germany, responding to complaints by the government that they are too slow to take down xenophobic abuse posted online.
Like fellow tech visionary Steve Jobs, who always wore a black turtleneck and jeans, Zuckerberg famously wears the same outfit every day - barring special occasions - and he made no exception for the jog, donning his signature T-shirt.
He has previously said making clothing decisions every day is a 'frivolous' waste of his time.
The new father joked last month upon returning from a two-month paternity leave what he should wear, picturing his closet which was filled with nothing but identical T-shirts and hoodies.
'First day back after paternity leave. What should I wear?' he captioned the picture.
Her birth was, of course, announced on Facebook - and the couple vowed to give away 99 per cent of their fortune to charity in her honor. He also only took half of the paternity leave offered to Facebook employees. The company announced in November last year that new fathers working at Facebook will now be allowed to take four months of paid paternity leave.
