Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) founder S.Ramadoss on Saturday demanded that fishermen from Tamil Nadu should be allowed to take part in the festival in St. Anthony’s church in Katchatheevu in Sri Lanka on December 7.

In a statement, he said though the church was built by people belonging to Lanka, Katchatheevu was under the control of Tamil Nadu fishermen for a long time.

The agreement between the two countries on Katchatheevu clearly mentions that Ramanathapuram fishermen should be allowed to attend the St. Anthony church festival, he pointed out.

It had not been specified that they could attend only the festivals in March and not in other months, Ramadoss argued. The reasons cited by the centre for not allowing Tamil Nadu fishermen was not acceptable, he said and added it does not matter if the festival is big or small.

The islet had been transferred to Lanka without the consent of Tamil Nadu, he said and added that the state government had supported the Ramanathapuram fishermen’s demand for participation in the festival.(DC)
