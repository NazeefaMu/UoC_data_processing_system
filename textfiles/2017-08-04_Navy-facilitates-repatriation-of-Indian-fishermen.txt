The Sri Lanka Navy yesterday facilitated the repatriation of 77 Indian fishermen, who were released from Sri Lankan custody after detaining them for poaching within the island’s territorial waters.

It was reported that these fishermen were apprehended on separate occasions by the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard in the northern seas for illegally venturing into Sri Lankan waters and engaging in bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method.

The Sri Lanka Navy reported that the Indian fishermen were handed over to the Indian Coast Guard Ship Sarang yesterday, at the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) north of Kankasanthurai. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
