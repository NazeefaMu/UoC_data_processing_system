Cabinet agrees to withdraw 'liquor' Gazettes


	

Ministers today unanimously decided to withdraw the recent Gazette notification on extending business hours of liquor shops and allowing females to buy or sell liquor.

Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told the media this was done in the wake of the President’s decision to reinstate the ban.

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera revoked the ban on selling liquor to females and employing females in places where liquor was manufactured or sold.

In a separate Special Gazette Notification issued on January 11 the business hours of licensed establishments selling liquor was extended from 11.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.

However days after the move, the President said that he had instructed the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister to cancel the Gazette notification as soon as possible.
