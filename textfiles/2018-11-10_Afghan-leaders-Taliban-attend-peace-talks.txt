MOSCOW AFP Nov9, 2018- Moscow on Friday hosted international talks on Afghanistan aimed at kick-starting direct negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban militant group, both of whom sent delegations.   


Russia hopes “through joint efforts to open a new page in the history of Afghanistan,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said as the talks opened at a Moscow hotel on Friday morning.   


He said that the participation of both Afghan leaders and the Taliban was an “important contribution” aimed at creating “favourable conditions for the start of direct talks.” “I am counting on you holding a serious and constructive conversation that will justify the hopes of the Afghan people,” he said before the talks continued behind closed doors.  Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told AFP that the militant group was sending five representatives.   


They will not hold “any sort of negotiations” with the delegation of Kabul administration, he said.   “This conference is not about holding negotiations with any party whatsoever -- rather it is about finding a peaceful solution to the issue of Afghanistan,” he added.   This is the first time that a Taliban delegation is taking part in such high-level international meeting, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday.
