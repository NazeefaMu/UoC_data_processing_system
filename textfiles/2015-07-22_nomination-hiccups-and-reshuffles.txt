Nomination hiccups and reshuffles


	


On the eve of the closing of nominations for the coming general election, the new big Boss sent word to the Betel leaf secretarial one to see him immediately with the party’s National List. 
The secretarial one soon called on the new Big Boss and the latter after poring over the list asked him to delete two particular names. One name was that of a well-known ‘doctor’ who once headed several key diplomatic missions abroad. The other name was that of a former navy commander. The secretarial one protested, but the new Big Boss waved off his objections.
The rebel group members had reacted with anger to the news about the deletion of the two names from the National List and the leader of the imitation heritage party had in protest withdrawn the name of a leading attorney included in the List on his request.
Later the name of a former judiciary chief had been proposed to fill one of the vacant slots on the list, but that worthy had declined the honour, they say.
