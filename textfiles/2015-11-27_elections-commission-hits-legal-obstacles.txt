Elections Commission hits legal obstacles


	

The newly constituted Elections Commission has been hit a legal lacuna, with it being unable to determine its functions and roles, it is learnt.
The Constitutional Council, reintroduced under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, nominated three members to the Elections Commission establishing it for the first time in the country. Yet, the absence of legal provisions has become a problem in deciding on its roles and responsibilities.
However, it is learnt that the authorities of the Elections Commission are making arrangements in this respect. The Commission comprises three members.
Asked for a comment in this regard, People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) said legal provisions should be made available spelling out the scope of commissions established for the first time in the country.
Its Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said it was particularly relevant to the Election Commission. He said the Elections Department discharged election related duties in the past, and with the setting up of this commission, a separate legislation was needed to determine its scope in the present context.
“It is important to have separate legislations enacted by Parliament to govern the work of independent commissions set up for the first time,” he said.(Kelum Bandara)
