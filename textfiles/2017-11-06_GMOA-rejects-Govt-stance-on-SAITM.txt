GMOA rejects Govt. stance on SAITM


	

The GMOA executive committee today unanimously rejected the Government’s final decision on the SAITM issue, which was issued on October 29.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said they would not agree to any compromise and would continue their battle until SAITM was nationalized.

He said the GMOA would back the fast unto death carried by the parents of the medical faculty students.

Meanwhile, in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, the GMOA said the Government should clarify its decision even though it was described as positive.

It requested the President to appoint a technical committee to carry out the proposals.

Earlier last week GMOA Assistant Secretary Naveen De Soyza told Daily Mirror they welcomed the decision to abolish SAITM but however the 'not for profit institution' needed further clarification. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
