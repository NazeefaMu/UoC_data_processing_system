The proposed Rs.25,000 fine imposed on drivers for high speed and overtaking other vehicles from left side has been amended, following a decision taken by the committee appointed by the President, Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) Commissioner General A.H.K. Jagath Chandrasiri said yesterday.

While addressing the media yesterday at the DMT, the commissioner said that earlier a decision had been taken to impose a fine of Rs.25,000 for several offences including these two offences, but the fine for these offences would be amended.

Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, driving without a valid driving licence, employing those without a driving licence, entering a vehicle into a railway crossing irresponsibly and driving without valid insurance are the other traffic offenses categorized for this fine. There would be no change in the fine for these offences, according to the Commissioner.

The committee was appointed by the President Maithripala Sirisena comprising Finance Ministry secretary, Transport and Civil Aviation Secretary, Department of Motor Traffic Commissioner, Deputy Solicitor General from the Attorney Generals Department, Traffic Police DIG.

“After considering the comments received from the people and considering the defects and certain standard of the roads in the country the committee had decided to amend the fine for high speed,” he said.

“There was a spot fine of Rs.1000 or a fine of Rs.25,000 through a lawsuit for high speed earlier. Now the fine through the lawsuit has been divided into four categories, the Legal Officer of the DMT K.I.Yogachandra said.

According to him if a vehicle exceeding the maximum speed by 20 percent will be charged a spot fine of Rs.3000. If he did not pay the spot fine and found guilty by a court the fine would be in the range of Rs.3000 and Rs.5000. If the violation is between 20 and 30 percent of maximum speed the police can impose a spot fine of Rs.5000 or the court can impose a fine between Rs.5000 and Rs. 10,000. In case of 30 to 50 percent high speed the spot fine would be Rs.10,000 or a court can impose a fine between Rs.10,000 and Rs.15,000. For the 50 percent high speed Rs.15,000 would be the spot fine whereas the fine would be in the range of Rs15,000 and 25, 000 if it is imposed by the court..

Accordingly the committee had decided to remove the Rs.25,000 for overtaking a vehicle from the left side and imposed a spot fine of Rs.2000 and the offence was taken under the common offence of the 224 clause of the Motor traffic act, he said.

Mr. Yogachandra said the amended motor traffic bill had been referred to the parliament. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
