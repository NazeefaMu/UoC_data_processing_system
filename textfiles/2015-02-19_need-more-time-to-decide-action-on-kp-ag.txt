 Solicitor General (SG) Suhada Gamlath today informed the Appeal Court that the Attorney General’s Department needed more time to decide on the nature of action to be taken against former LTTE arms supplier Kumaran Pathmanathan alias KP.
He made this submission when a petition filed by the JVP seeking KP’s arrest was taken up for inquiry today.
The DSG requested Court for little more time to obtain more details from those cited as respondents including the Army Commander before deciding on the action that needed to be taken against KP.
The case was put off for February 26. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
