The government will go through a process of self criticism in order to determine where it went wrong and rectify whatever shortcomings, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

The Prime Minister made this remark after releasing a report on the government's achievements during the past two years.

Mr Wickremesinghe said the government has not been able to secure a 5.5 per cent economic growth it expected to achieve as a result of floods, drought, Kolonnawa incident and dengue during the year.

However he said changes brought about in the economy had endured an economic growth of 4.5 percent. " Country would have ended up with a 2.5 percent growth if not for economic reforms brought about by the government' he said.

He said any party from any part of the world was welcome to buy over a stake of the Trincomalee Port. “One should remember that the Trincomalee Port is going to play a major role in the region soon. The Indian Ocean is going to be a region which will have a vast growth and Trincomalee has to be a part of it" he said. At the same time he said Sri Lanka will have to work with India as the subcontinent will account for 40 of the growth of the Indian Ocean' the Prime Minister said.

Responding to the criticism that this government has failed to bring in infrastructure development as the previous regime did, the Prime Minister said this government does not intend to burden the people with more debt. "We don't want to dump money like the previous regime but will go on with developing after securing the economy" he said.

"The economy is central to every thing we have achieved. Without a strong economy we would not have been able to build houses, ensure that working people are getting decent wages. The progress report we put out today very clearly states that Sri Lanka is on the right track towards a better future ' he added. He said what the government did was bringing about s transformation.

" I was at the forefront of this transformation and had earned criticism for it especially from the media" he said.
Referring to the local government election he said the UNP will be contesting as an alliance with other allies. " Our party is ready for the elections " he said. (Yohan Perera)
