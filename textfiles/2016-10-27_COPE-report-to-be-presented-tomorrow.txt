After heated arguments which lasted for days, the members of the Parliamentary Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), yesterday, unanimously agreed on the wording of the report of the investigations it carried out -- which included the controversial bond issue.

A member of COPE, who did not wish to be named, said the report would be presented to Parliament by its chairman, Sunil Handunnetti on Friday, October 28, 2016.

The approval of the final report was delayed due to disagreementsa among the members over the bond issue; with the UNPers being accused of engaging in a cover up. This was repeatedly denied by the UNP members.

Earlier, it was expected that the members would come up with several conflicting reports because of the disagreements.

Sources said work on the translations of the report was going on till late -- keeping the parliamentary staff involved in it busy.
