They are keen to go it alone


	



 

Big guns of the Green party are said to be looking into the possibility of forming a government of their own following the expiration of the Green-Blue unity agreement come December. 

 


The Greens have already thrown a net on the JO to hook it en bloc or a section of it to make up the shortfall in the required majority in the council, they say.


However, a JO big shot based in the city and aspiring to Number Two status himself inspired by an astrological prediction, has reportedly expressed vehement opposition to the idea of propping up a Green party-led government. He is said to have told his colleagues: “There is no need for us to team up with the Green party. We ourselves are able to go solo!”


However, Green party bigwigs are holding on to the hope of forming their own government. Some of them have already begun telling all and sundry that they are set to go it alone if the proposed top team reshuffle in the offing is not carried out the way they want, political sources say.
