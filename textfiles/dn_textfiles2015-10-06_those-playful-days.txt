Those playful days

It was a one stretch of coconut land from Mount Lavinia up to the Moratuwa Bridge on either side of the main Galle Road. The oldest buildings were then Glaxo and Pfizer, the two white buildings, other than the temples and churches here and there and scattered huge villas and schools on both sides of the main road. One could see the extent of sea on one side and the Panadura river on the other side through a stretch of coconut trees.
This was the period ranging from 1950s to 1970s. Sri Lankan children had their own way of games which came down to them centuries back. Most games were Sinhala but the words of certain games had a touch of either Portuguese or English.
Children would put up their own doll houses or playhouses. Girls become the mother and boys become the fathers. They would also become doctors, farmers, grocery sellers, while the little girls line up with their dolls covering them for medicine or buy provisions to their houses. Mostly pebbles were used as money. The doctor pours coloured water into small bottles. Some little girls in their imaginative world, cook in their little clay pots, sand as rice and all sorts of leaves, pebbles, pieces of flower petals and serve rice on to a lid of tin which is treated as the plate.
They enjoy it rather than eating real food with nourishment served by the mom at home, because imaginative sand has filled their tummies. The boys pretend as if they are in paddy fields with cardboard hoe. They tie their cows made out of the coconut "piththa" pretending that they are gazing at the meadows. The playhouse is mostly made by the boys. That is an initial step taken into a happy wedlock.
Various Sri Lankan games include 'karapoththan bai bai' , lame time, hide and seek, hopscotch - plane type, eight squares and six square. 'Gas Maru, Pethi Thoru Inna gasak netho', for instance speaks of the children in 1950s when they were closer to the nature. These games train a child to have a balanced mind, physically fit and aiming at the correct target.
They sit around and place their palms on the surface. One would count "Athuru Mithuru", which maintains harmony among them. They make small playing articles with the coconut leaf, many structures, sewing machine, "runa" and they fold it such a way that it becomes a long reptile. By that the brain cells keep them cheerful.
Children draw five lines and calls the space, diya, goda, mada, kola and kiri. One child commands and the rest jump into one destination. If a child cannot jump, he is out. There was another game "Utchchi Utchchi - Thol, Thol" and then the commander ask: "will you do what I say", and the rest say "yes", Then the commander gives them an impossible task like bring something which is not in the vicinity. Whoever brings gets a point. By that they learn the nature and names of things. They have to run fast. That is a physical exercise. They played with marbles. Where are the marbles now?
"Rosy ruvath Lamayek" is where a girl sits in the middle and the king skips to take the princess. Here we go round the mulberry bush, also, "kage watte mal kadanne ada me bareta". These games improve their vocal codes, melody and stimulation.
Then with the Western touch, they swing the hula-hoop, they play "Categories". By this the children learn English language, words, pronunciation, beat etc. Then the game "I spy with my little eye" - by that they learn language and spellings, the game on - " the king in the palace has lost some honourable caps". By this children learn to speak, Then, "Here's the robbers passing by" - like the present tug-of-war two groups pull each other, that creates group leadership and fellowship. They play cards, seven tricks, "Old Woman" that too creates fellowship.
We, in our early teenage in the class room, we did not have laptops nor cell phones to play or enjoy.
Can you remember we playing with a five cent on a sheet of paper drawing six squares , like hopscotch on the foot, we use the second finger to pull the five cent on all squares (i.e."Athe Batta"). Also," girls, boys, fruits,names of flowers etc" on a sheet of paper where almost the whole class joins, (i.e."Genu Pirimi"). Certain times two get together and try to join dots to get a square, there were many more paper games, if it rains heavily we make paper boats and place in the drains. Do we now find that type of drains - no - floods or mud instead.
From the Western touch, our Sri Lankan children used to play games like - "Fairy Whispers", "Fairies and Goblins", children stretch the legs and sit as a circle, and each girl without trampling anybody runs on the space in between which is called "train". That was real balancing of body and brains. Children fall into two groups keeping their hands behind and a child tries to hide the pebble and the other group has to say who bears the pebble. Another famous game at that time was playing "Farmer in the Day". At times children in the classroom hide something and make the others search for it, when a person goes near they say" fire, fire" if they come away they say "water water". By these the children pick an immense vocabulary.
The children in their homes are now glued to their chairs or travel in the bus for tuition classes, dancing classes and elocution.
