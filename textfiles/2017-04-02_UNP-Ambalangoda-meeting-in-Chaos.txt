UNP Ambalangoda meeting in Chaos


	

A tensed situation arose at the UNP meeting held on Saturday (01) in Ambalangoda, when two senior Ministers who attended the meeting, failed to answer questions raised by the party members, party sources said.

At the meeting of UNP activists of Balapitiya, Ambalangoda, Karandeniya and Rathgama at which Ministers Vijira Abeywardena and P. Harrison participated, activities related to organising the party's May Day rally and future programmes were discussed.

After the Ministers addressed the meeting party members began to ask questions about the increase in rice price, unemployment and problems of several more matters.

However, when the Ministers attempted to leave the meeting without giving answers things started to get hot.

However, the Ministers had left the place amidst shouting, and members heckling at them, saying that they had to attend to some other important meetings.

Ambalangoda UNP Chief Organiser Bennet Paniyanduwa said this situation could have been avoided if the Ministers waited for some more time to listen to issues taken up by the members. (Hemantha De Silva)
