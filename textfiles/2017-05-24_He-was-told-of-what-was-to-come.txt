He was told of what was to come


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya had sent for a senior purohita for a discussion in connection with the much talked-about reshuffle round the corner.

 


During the one-on-one discussion with the purohita, Number One had not minced his words in telling the visitor that he was to be moved out of his current portfolio. However, Number One had not given any hint about an alternative portfolio to be offered to him, they say.


Although, the purohita had earlier told all and sundry that he would fire his salvos from a backbench in case he was removed from his present portfolio, he had observed a golden silence at this meeting.
