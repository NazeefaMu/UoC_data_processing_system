President: Govt. weak in communicating with the people


	

A major shortcoming of the present Government was that it did not have the ability to articulate to the people its good deeds, President Maithripala Sirisena said today.

“A major short coming of this government is that it does not have the ability to inform and educate people on the good things it has done and that particular shortcoming gives an advantage to the opponents and they often talk of what this Government had failed to do,” the President said at ceremony held to mark the 23rd death anniversary of late President Ranasinghe Premadasa this morning.

 “The Government should also communicate to the people about all the good work done by it like the way the late President Premadasa did,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
