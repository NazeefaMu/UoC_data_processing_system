Their unease over possible comeback of former boss


	


	Meanwhile, according to BIA sources, there is now growing unease among the airport employees on hearing of a piece of news that has caused them much concern: that the well-known first cousin, who was  presiding over aviation, has called on the former Madam in a bid to get back the precious job he lost.

They say that more than 90 per cent of the airport employees voted for the Compassionate One not because they liked the former Big Boss less but because they hated his first cousin more. Highly perturbed employees vow that they would not support the Maithripalanaya any longer if by any chance their former Chief was reinstated!
