Acid remark sees them disappear


	



 

A sanghika dana to more than 2,000 bhikkhus was offered at the President’s House recently to mark Number One’s second anniversary in office and also the birth anniversary of the Blue party’s founder-leader.

 


Number One himself took a hand in serving food to the monks seated in a long line and he suddenly looked back to find a number of political heavyweights following him obviously in a bid to get into the eye of the whirring video cameras instead of serving alms to the monks. 


A visibly annoyed Number One aimed a few verbal barbs at the politicos seeking the limelight neglecting their immediate duty which saw most of them disappear fast from the scene, they say.
