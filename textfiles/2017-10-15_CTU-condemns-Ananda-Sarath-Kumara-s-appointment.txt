The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) today condemned the appointment of North Central Provincial Councilor Ananda Sarath Kumara as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Organiser in Anamaduwa Electorate.

Speaking to Daily Mirror CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the Councilor was found guilty for forcing a female school teacher to kneel at her feet.

He said considering the incident then President Mahinda Rajapaksa prevent giving nomination to him and it cannot justify President Maithripala Sirisena’s action to reappoint the same.

“President Sirisena’s decision to reappoint Ananda is a major threat to the public service. The councilor kneels down a female school teacher and it was not a minor incident. We were surprised by president’s decision and urge him to revise it or we would have to take stern actions over the matter,” he said.

The female school teacher was kneeling down by the councilor on June 14, 2013 and he was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment suspends for seven years by the Puttalam High Courts on May 12, 2014.

He was also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.300,000 for the victim of the incident. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
