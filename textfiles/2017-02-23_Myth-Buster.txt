Myth: Sugar causes hyperactivity in children

Busted: “No, this is a myth. Hyperactivity in children can be precipitated by various things and a high sugar diet doesn’t cause it. Hyperactivity can be precipitated by caffeine and other artificial agents or chemicals like food colouring added to food items. On the contrary, if there is a lack of sugar in the body, they can have a problem. A lot of children become hypoglycemic, that is they lack sugar due to the heat, and their sugar drops during the night. When they wake up, they get confused and even convulsions can occur. High sugar as a disease can lead to diabetes but eating a lot of sugar won’t make children hyperactive.” Explained Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Pediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
