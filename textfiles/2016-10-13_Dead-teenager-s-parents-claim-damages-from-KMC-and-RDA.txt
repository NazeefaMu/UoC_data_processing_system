The parents of the 17-year-old schoolgirl, who died last year after falling into an unprotected drain at the Nittawela Junction on the Kandy-Katugastota Road, filed a civil law suit, in the Kaduwela District Court today, claiming damages from the Kandy Municipal Council (KMC) and the Road Development Authority (RDA).

They are claiming Rs.100 million each from the two institutions.

At the time of her death, the teenager Sahebdeen Mohamed Asra was studying for the GCE Advanced Level at the Badiudeen Mohamed Balika Vidyalaya in Kandy.

She is reported to have fallen into the open drain when trying to escape the water splashed by a speeding vehicle, while returning home in the pouring rain with two other girls after attending a tuition class. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
