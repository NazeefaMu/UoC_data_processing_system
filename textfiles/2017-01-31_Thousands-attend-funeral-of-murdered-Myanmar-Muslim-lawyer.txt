Thousands of mourners gathered on Monday to bury a top Muslim lawyer and adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi, who was gunned down outside Yangon airport in what the ruling party called a political assassination.   Ko Ni, a legal adviser to the National League for Democracy, was shot in the head on Sunday afternoon as he waited outside the airport while holding his grandson.   His killing, in a country where political murders are rare, sent shockwaves through both Myanmar’s already hard-pressed Muslim community and the ruling party.
