We often are at a doubt about being a millennial in today’s tech savvy world as finding a home service provider such as a plumber or an electrician takes ages and sometimes we end up with a regret of hiring someone after the job. QuickHelp.lk is the cupid to connect you with the perfectly suited service provider in a click of a button. 

QuickHelp.lk is breaking all trust barriers as the booking process is very transparent. This also gives you the flexibility in finding the most suited to your budgetary requirements while the hotline number is always open for clarifications.

QuickHelp.lk being a startup founded on the 21st of April 2017 also has a back end story to this idea generation which dates back to one Saturday afternoon in the month of January, where the founder Shahid Nazeer Admani went through the routine chaotic issue of finding a service professional. After being unable to connect to one, which he found to be an unaddressed issue faced by most of the households, primarily in Colombo, resulted to a change in the direction of the home service provider hunt.

QuickHelp.lk connects the customers with a diverse range of home professionals such as Painters, Electricians, Plumbers, Masons, Gardeners, Sofa and Carpet Cleaners, Air Conditioner service technicians as well as Tile Layers in a click of a button. After setting a strong foothold in the home services and repairs market, the broad vision of QuickHelp and Admani is to ease access in finding reliable professionals across all service sectors.

The passion and the experience embedded within the founder from the major role played in growing an online electronic store in the year 2014 surely laid the foundation of courage to set the setting stone to QuickHelp.lk. The educational background received by CIMA coupled with experience led to the realization of the possible use of bootstrapping in the intial stages of the company. But the fact that QuickHelp is self-funded as of now should not go unnoticed.

The booking process much easier by cooperating with the tight schedules of households. A booking could be placed by visiting the website www.quickhelp.lk or by calling 0766631070. 

The online booking system is the least complex as only 3 steps need to be followed where the initial choice of a service would lead to the final step which is to provide your details. The customer detail data is used effectively to connect the customer to the nearest home service provider which will make the job completion faster. The provider will quote the service charge upon inspection which promises the most fair exchange for the job. The service is currently available in Colombo 1-15, Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia, Nugegoda and Nawala.

QuickHelp has changed the direction of an unattended market by aligning the service to the customer needs in a creative solution, bringing a ray of hope for the millennial to uplift their standards bidding farewell to the complex avenue of booking a home service provider!
