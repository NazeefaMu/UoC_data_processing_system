Lankan girls qualify for quarters, but boys miss out

 
Sri Lanka U-14 boy’s tennis team performed well to beat Syria 3/0 in their ITF Junior Team Competition Asia/Oceania pre-qualifying tie played at the Gymkhana courts yesterday.
Even though the Lankan lads won today’s play-off tie they will not qualify for quarters. Sri Lanka is placed third while Kazakhstan and Kuwait who share the first and second places will advance to the quarters.
The Lankan boys’ team comprised Nenuka Jayathilakalage, Shen Silva and Nelaka Dissanayake.
The Lankan lasses maintained a superb record in the tournament and qualified for the quarters which will be held in Thailand from April 25.
They cleared their way to the quarters beating top seed Philippines 2/1 on Tuesday. Lankan girls finished on top of the standings with Philippines and Iran in second and third slots respectively.
The Lankan U-14 girls’ team included Anjalika Kurera, Anika Seneviratne and Savini Jayasuriya.
In yesterday’s boys’ tie, Nenuka Jayathilakalage won the first singles against Taym Al-Azmeh in easy straight sets 6/2, 6/2 and Ashen Silva took the second singles with a close battle with Pierre Djaroueh 6/1, 7/5.
Nenuka and Ashen had no trouble in beating their Syrian opponent pair Aous Hassoun Abou and Pierre Djaroueh in straight sets to seal a 3/1 victory for Sri Lanka.
Boy’s results:
Kazakhstan beat Kuwait 2/1, Iran beat Saudi Arabia 2/1, Oman beat Brunei 3/0, Kyrgyzstan beat Iraq 2/1, Sri Lanka beat Syria 3/0.
