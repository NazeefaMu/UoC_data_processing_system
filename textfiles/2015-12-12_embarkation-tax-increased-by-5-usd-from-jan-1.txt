The embarkation taxi levied on travellers departing Sri Lanka will be increased from 25 US Dollars to 30 US Dollars from January 1 next year in keeping with a Budget proposal, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) yesterday said.
“Accordingly, the previous levy which was around Rs. 3,250 will be increased to Rs. 4,500 with effect from January 1,” Civil Aviation Director General and CEO H. M. C. Nimalsiri said adding that 20 USD of the levy would be credited to the Treasury.
In the budget, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake proposed to increase the Embarkation tax which would be applied to both air and sea passengers.
The minister also proposed to increase the contribution to the Consolidated Fund from the Embarkation tax from the present one third to two thirds of the total collection through this levy.
The government expects to gross revenue of Rs. 2,000 million from the revised Embarkation tax.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
