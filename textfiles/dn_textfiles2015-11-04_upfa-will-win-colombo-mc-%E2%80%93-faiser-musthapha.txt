UPFA will win Colombo MC – Faiser Musthapha

The UPFA will win the Colombo Municipal Council at the forthcoming Local Government polls, under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiser Musthapha said.
Minister Musthapha made these observations after opening an entrance to a “Flat Housing Complex, Kamkarupura” at Grandpass.
He said some of the minorities kept distance from the UPFA during the past period. The minister said that the nationality, religion or the caste is irrelevant for a leader of a country.
"We all are Sri Lankans. We love the country. If we need to gain the true victory after the war, we should step forward with a national plan. People have a bad attitude over Provincial Council Institutions and representatives. We should work hard to change that,” Minister Musthapha said.
