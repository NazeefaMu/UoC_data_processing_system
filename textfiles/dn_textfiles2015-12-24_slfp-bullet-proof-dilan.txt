SLFP is bullet proof - Dilan

Attempts of some groups to shoot in the head and heart of Sri Lanka Freedom Party will become futile as the party is wearing bulletproof clothing, State Minister of Highways Dilan Perera said.
Perera said that certain elements in the UNP have undertaken the contract of destroying the SLFP. "Their dreams will never come to reality," he said.
Perera said that party supporters are aware of past calamities faced by the SLFP due to splits within the party.
"No one can destroy the party nor its unity," the state minister said.
He said that the SLFP Central Committee has already taken a decision to give nominations to the members of the Local Government bodies at the forthcoming Local Government election unless they are found guilty by a court of law.
