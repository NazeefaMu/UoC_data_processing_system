[PARLIAMENT - (13-01-2016)]

Constitution should represent ideas of all - Patali
The Constitution is not a part of the government, but it is a part of the State. The Constitution should represent the ideas of all in the country. This is how it becomes the basic law of the country, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations by joining the debate on the Resolution for the Appointment of the Constitutional Assembly. Minister Ranawaka said there are no traditional states in the world.
The nature of a state is changing according to the modern socio-economic strategies, he said.
"We have a challenge of enacting a new Constitution suitable for the new economic, technological, social, political and environmental conditions of the country," the minister said.
He said all the attempts of previous regimes to draft a Constitution had been refused and defeated by the people.
The time has come to enact a strong Constitution which will not lead to any conflict in the country.
A Constitution is not a Bill. It should be enacted with the agreement of all the people of the country, he said.
'Prime Minister heeds to other parties' opinions'
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe does not bulldoze the views and opinions of the other parties, said Skill Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe.
He made this observation yesterday joining the debate on the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly.
He said the SLFP is not subordinate to the UNP nor the UNP is subordinate to the SLFP in the government. "We work respecting the views of each other. The Prime Minister accepted our views on the new Constitution," Samarasinghe said.
He said democracy, rule of law and Parliamentary system have to be strengthened under the new Constitution.
"We haven't taken foreign views to formulate our new constitution," Samarasinghe said.
Constitution should protect dignity of all communities - Rajitha
A new Constitution is formulated to protect the dignity of all the communities in the country, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne.
He said Tamil people did not ask for economic development or anything else, but the due dignity.
The minister made these observations in Parliament yesterday joining the debate on the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly.
When the 1978 Constitution was presented, all the progressive parties, including the Sri Lanka Freedom Party stood against. "So did I as a doctor then," said Rajitha Senaratne.
"All leaders, including Sirimao Bandaranaike, Chandrika Bandaranaike, Mahinda Rajapaksa got together to abolish the executive presidency. But it was me who presented the proposal to abolish
the Executive Presidency at the Hambantota Convention," he said.
He said he had to support the 18th Amendment to the Constitution which he regretted. He said fear is created by some groups when a new Constitution is going to be formulated saying that a federal system is going to be introduced.
"But it was then Minister G L Peiris who went to the Institute of Federalism in Switzerland in 2000 to get instructions to formulate a Constitution. He went to South Africa for the same purpose with the Attorney General, Legal Draftsman and Jayampathi Wickramaratne. Then Attorney General, Justice Ministry Secretary, Jayampathi Wickramaratne were sent to Belgium," Minister Senaratne said.
"Instructions were taken from the Queen's University, Melborn University, Washinton DC University, Kenyan University. None of these countries had unitary features but federalism," he said
Minister Senaratne said even Dinesh Gunawardena and SLFP members were in the government. They did not stand against them as they do by now, he said.
"It was then President Mahinda Rajapaksa promised Indian Prime Minister Manamohan Singh and other ministers to grant 13 plus and a senate also," Senaratne said.
He said the APRC proposed to establish a Parliamentary system, merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces. He said it had proposals to give land powers and police powers and judiciary powers.
"We have to introduce a Constitution that would guarantee the dignity of the Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese," Senaratne said. "Racism is the most ferocious terrorist," he said.
'People gave mandate to bring new Constitution'
A new Constitution which was a long felt need of the people would be brought about using the mandate given at two elections, said Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa yesterday.
He made this observation joining the debate on the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly.
Minister Premadasa said those days even if some one fell sick, it was the Executive Presidency that everybody found fault with. He said it has become the only saviour by now.
"The joint Opposition said that the due process is not followed when the new Constitution is formulated. But I would like to ask if the previous government followed the due process when Justice Shirani Bandaranaike was removed from position of Chief Justice. Did they follow the due process when the 18th Amendment to the Constitution was presented," Minister Premadasa said. He said there are members who like the unitary status and Buddhism only in the united opposition.
"The joint opposition said the new Constitution is formulated on the instructions of the foreigners. "It's wrong. We were given the mandate by the people in Sri Lanka. We fulfil the pledges we gave them," Minister Premadasa said.
No hesitation to express SLFP opinions within government - Premajayantha
Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha told in Parliament yesterday that they don't hesitate to express SLFP opinions within the National Unity Government.
Joining the debate on the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly, Minister Premajayantha said People had given a mandate to the government only to abolish the Executive Presidency and change the electoral system of the country.
This is a consensual government formed to achieve the two urgent needs of the people. Some say that the present government is a joint government. There are differences in the economic, educational and foreign policies of the UNP and the SLFP, he said.
The minister said the SLFP has forwarded amendments to the resolution presented by the Prime Minister. He thanked the Prime Minister for accepting most of the amendments.
"No clear mandate was given to any party at the General Election to enact a new Constitution. None of the parties was able to form a government alone. That is why a consensual government was formed," he said.
According to Minister Premajayantha, the amendments to the resolution included the omitting of the word 'new' from the 'new Constitution' and omission of the preface to the motion.
Petitions against two Bills withdrawn
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said in Parliament that the petitions filed against the Penal Code (Amendment) Bills and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, had been withdrawn by the petitioners. The Deputy Speaker making Speaker's announcement yesterday said that the Supreme Cort communicated to Parliament that the petitioners have informed the court they would not proceed with the petitions as the Attorney General had informed the Supreme Court that the government would not pursue with those Bills.
Fair Constitution needed to solve national issue - Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan told in Parliament yesterday that a fair Constitution should be enacted to find solutions to the national issue of the country.
He said the resolution submitted by the Prime Minister stated that it is necessary to enact a new Constitution that, inter alia, abolishes the Executive Presidency, ensures a fair and representative electoral system which eliminates preferential voting, strengthens the democratic rights of citizens, provides a constitutional resolution of the national issue, promotes national reconciliation, establishes a political culture that respects the rule of law, guarantees the people's fundamental rights and freedom that assure human dignity and promotes responsible and accountable government.
He said people gave a clear mandate to fulfill the urgent needs of the country at the Presidential Election in January 2015. They believe that the Present and the Prime Minister can do this task.
There is no longer a demand for a separate state. There won't be a national issue within a united and undivided state, he said. The resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly to enact a new Constitution was a historic proposal made by the Prime Minister as it will be helpful to bring peace, prosperity and a bright future to the country, Sampanthan said.
The Opposition Leader urged all members to extend their support to make this endeavor a reality.

Dinesh points to Opposition clout
The Joint Opposition changed the government's attempt to pass the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly on the same day it was submitted, said opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena.
He made this observation yesterday joining the debate on the resolution for the appointment of the Constitutional Assembly. He said the 1978 Constitution was amended 19 times. "It was attempted to amend for the 20th time as well. We agreed to support to change the Executive Presidency as well as the electoral system. But the government is dilly dallying without holding the election," Gunawardena said. He said that the economy of the country is facing bankruptcy. He questioned if this was good governance.
"The JVP has forgotten as to what happened to Rohana Wijeweera who filed a case against the referendum," he said.
Additional hour for debate on Constitutional Assembly
The debate on the resolution to convert Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly was extended by an hour yesterday.
The debate which was to be ended at 1.30 pm was extended up to 2.30pm following a request made by the joint Opposition.
Opposition Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane requested for more time stating that ample time had not been allocated for the joint opposition.
"We have been given only 12 minutes to speak. This is like suppressing the opposition MPs," he said. Opposition Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa said depriving the time by the members of the joint Opposition is a kind of bulldozing the voice of the Opposition.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said more than 50 minutes out of the total of 75 minutes has been given to the UPFA.
Previous regimes misused Constitutional amendments - Anura Kumara
Previous regimes strengthened their powers to fulfill their personal desires by bringing amendments to the 1978 Constitution, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told in Parliament yesterday.
Joining the debate on the resolution for the Appointment of the Constitutional Council, he said the 1978 Constitution has been amended 19 times. Apart from the 17th and 19th Amendments, the other amendments were bought to strengthen the powers of respective governments by using the 2/3 majority of Parliament which they earned by offering ministerial portfolios or some other benefits, he said.
Dissanayake said none of these amendments were bought to ensure democratic rights and the freedom of the people. These amendments didn’t strengthen even Parliament, he said.
“The present Constitution of the country is a distorted one. We accept that the country needs to have a new Constitution. We have two suggestions on the procedure that should to enact a new Constitution," he said.
The whole process should be a Parliament centred process. All Parliamentarians should receive an equal opportunity to make their comments and suggestions without considering the status of the political parties that they belong to, he said.
The proposals made by the Prime Minister do not represent the ideas of all social groups. They were made to fulfill the needs of a group headed by the Prime Minister. Some words of the preface should be amended, he said.
The JVP Leader asked the government to prepare a Constitution and submit the draft to Parliament giving an opportunity for MPs to discuss it. The Constitution is the protector of the socio economic process of the country. It is necessary to change the socio economic body of the country prior to the
enactment of the Constitution, he said.
The socio economic issues of the people should not be neglected through the enactment of the Constitution because it is not the solution to solve all the problems face by the people, he said. The genuine needs of the people in the North and East are not federal, land powers or police powers or any other Constitutional solutions. What they need is to have better education or job opportunities for their children, good health and good price for their agricultural produce, Dissanayake said.
