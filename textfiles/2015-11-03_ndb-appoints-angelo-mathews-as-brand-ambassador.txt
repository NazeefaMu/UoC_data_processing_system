At National Development Bank (NDB) integrity and truthfulness even in the most challenging situations is important. NDB has the right attitude to diligently deliver what it promises while adding value that goes beyond what is expected. It is driven by a desire to reach beyond the norm. 
The bank believes in taking a futuristic approach and remains accountable and transparent in everything it does. NDB is willing to take ownership of its actions that affect its stakeholders and believe in building productive, long-term relationships based on sincerity with its clients and stakeholders.
In association to all these values, NDB embarked on a journey to provide greater meaning to the passionate and persistent service it provides to the nation by introducing a new slogan ‘Our Commitment, Your Success’. As a move to take this repositioning forward, NDB built a partnership with the Sri Lankan Cricket Captain Angelo Mathews with the perseverance of continuing the brand promise.
Angelo Mathews has been identified to take forth the new brand identity to NDB’s audience. He is an illustrative cricketing personality who can be easily linked up with the NDB brand values of integrity, excellence, creativity, accountability and sincerity.
Cricket appeals to every Sri Lankan and Mathews being the National 001 Cricket Captain since February 2013 has also been recognized as the youngest Test Cricket Captain in Sri Lanka and is certainly trusted and respected by all Sri Lankans for his qualities as a good team player and successful game finisher.
NDB believes that this new partnership will in return bring in an emotional connection towards the brand and build greater stature.
