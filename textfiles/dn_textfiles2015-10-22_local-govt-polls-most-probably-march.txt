Local govt polls most probably in March

Local government elections will most probably be held as scheduled next March as there is no reason to postpone the polls, Provincial Council and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He said the delimitation report was handed over to the President by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The minister said since there are some suggestions, he appointed a committee to look into these suggestions.
"The committee consisting of five members will decide whether there should be a new delimitation. If there will be such a delimitation, a new gazette notification will be issued to make the public aware. The five committee members will represent all parties in Parliament. However, the Local Government election will probably be held in March as scheduled," Musthapha said.
