A real Good Night for Mr Wodehouse

Good Night, Mr Wodehouse is a novel by Faith Sullivan about life in the small town of Harvester, Minnesota, in the first half of the 20th century. The book's heroine, Nell Stillman, is widowed and left penniless at 24. Subsequently, she secures a teaching job at the local school, loses two close friends when the Lusitania is torpedoed, falls in love with a widowed lawyer who goes into politics and dies before he and Nell can marry, receives a mysterious series of poison-pen letters, and dies with a copy of Jeeves in the Offing beside her. Meanwhile, Nell's only child, Hillyard ('Hilly'), is bullied at school, takes up long-distance running, enlists in the army when the First World War breaks out, becomes an ambulance driver in France, is decorated for gallantry, and returns home wounded and severely shell-shocked.
Wodehouse is not mentioned until the 24th of the book's 66 chapters, when Nell, intrigued by its title, takes Love Among the Chickens down from a shelf in the town's little library and finds Wodehouse "an entirely new experience, delicious, lighter than air." Wodehouse becomes Nell's solace and companion during her many struggles and disappointments. She follows Love Among the Chickens with Psmith in the City, Mike, A Gentleman of Leisure, The Prince and Betty, The Man Upstairs and Uneasy Money:
Nell gave herself up to the story, slipping unresisting into the antic perils of a young, moneyed lord of the realm, caught in a web of complexity only Wodehouse could design, a Wodehouse plot was a wonder, the solution to each knotty problem leading inevitably to another, knottier problem. And wasn't that always the way?
As well as reading Wodehouse's novels. Nell fantasises about meeting him (and Ethel) in person. After the episode of the Berlin broadcasts, Nell writes Wodehouse a letter of support and appreciation, mentioning that she now has 33 of his books. She is rewarded when Wodehouse replies, enclosing a signed first edition of Money in the Bank.
Nell's story is told well enough, and I enjoyed the Wodehouse passages, which rather reminded me of the 'My First Wodehouse Experience' articles published from time to time in Wooster Sauce. However, I did not find, as one reviewer did, that Good Night, Mr Wodehouse quite amounted to "a homage to the act of reading itself." And I noticed that some of the books in Nell's Wodehouse collection improbably had British rather than American titles (Something Fresh rather than Something New: A Gentleman of Leisure rather than The Intrusion of Jimmy).
I had never heard of Faith Sullivan, who has been "for forty years an ardent fan of P G Wodehouse," until I saw the reference to this book in the September Wooster Sauce, but she evidently has many loyal devotees. I wonder how many of them, hitherto unfamiliar with Wodehouse's work, will be encouraged to give it a try as a result of reading Good Night, Mr Wodehouse?
