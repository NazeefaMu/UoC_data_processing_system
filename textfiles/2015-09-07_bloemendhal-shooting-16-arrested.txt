Sixteen suspects have been arrested in connection with the Bloemendhal shooting which killed a man, a woman and injured 11 others, the CID said.
It said investigations had revealed that the shooting was the result of gang rivalry and had no political undertones.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said today two underworld gangsters who were part of the group campaigning for Minister Ravi Karunanayake were targeted by a group of rival gangsters.
Investigations had also revealed that an underworld kingpin known as Dematagoda Chaminda who was serving a prison term had masterminded the shooting.
Of the 16 suspects eight had been remanded on an earlier occasion while the other eight were being interrogated by the CID.
ASP Gunasekara said three armed men who had arrived in a car opened fire at the group of supporters.
The police recovered a T-56 assault rifle, a 9mm revolver and a 0.38mm pistol from their possession. One of the gangsters was arrested from Embilipitiya and another from Kollupitiya.
The CID is on the lookout for Army Sampath and Sanka who were among those campaigning for Mr. Karunanayake. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
