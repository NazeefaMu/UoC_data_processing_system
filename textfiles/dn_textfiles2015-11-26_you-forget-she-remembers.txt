Ragaya Nodutu Ruwa
You forget, she remembers!

Unbridled, unrestrained and uncontrolled lust is what leads men and women to commit crimes of passion and sexual violence. Even though the level of education in individuals is different, most in society have received at least the basic education. Yet, some manage to live without committing crimes of passion while others are unable to do so. The reason is 'empathy'. This is the power to recognize and understand the pain and suffering of others which we would not want to go through. Certain people are unable to empathize.
Often, there are groups of boys who taunt girls in buses. This is harassment. They are unable to empathize. Rape is committed due to the inability to relate to the pain and humiliation a woman goes through at the hands of a rapist. Child abuse is the inability to understand the fear and shame a child experiences. This is complete lack of empathy.

'Ragaya Nodutu Ruwa,' a workshop conducted by the English Department of the Sri Jayewardenepura University recently provided a platform for a discourse on Gender Based Violence and Sexuality.
Centre for Gender Studies Deputy Director Dr. Anusha Edirisinghe explained that Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) is the physical, mental and sexual harassment that one person may commit on another. This harassment has a psychological impact.
"SGBV is often associated with power. Therefore, there is a need to change attitudes with regard to patriarchy. Otherwise, the problem will persist. Today, there are many reports in the media and a lot of awareness. Now there are investigations," Dr. Edirisinghe said.
She added that SGBV must be regarded as a crime and must be reported. "We see this problem escalating. One reason is the use of digital technology. Youngsters need to be careful especially when using social media such as Facebook," she pointed out.
With regard to cyber space, digital technology and mobile phones figure prominently. Pornography through digital technology is a serious problem. With this temptation and carnal desires awaken.
When abuse occurs, the common excuse is that the girl was dressed immodestly. Here, one must realize that the girl's immodestly is not the problem. The problem lies with the carnal desire of the man. The girl's dress may not be in keeping with culture, but the problem is the motive of the man.
"In Sri Lanka, SGBV is not discussed in families. But I feel that from a very young age boys and girls should be educated on SGBV. Love and emotion should be taught from Montessori. In Western countries, children are taught about respecting others and securing rights. In Sri Lanka, these are not taught. Gender sensitive people should be created from Montessori," Dr. Edirisinghe said.
Dr. Dammika Ariyarathne, Senior Lecturer at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Consultant Medical Officer spoke about facing adversity and overcoming obstacles.
"Regardless of our paper qualifications and degrees, what is our goal in life? We need to understand what we are living for and the reason we have worked so hard. If we have no aims and direction, we would lose what we have accumulated over the years," said Dr. Ariyarathne.
Dr. Ariyarathne stressed that we can place value on our lives through self-control and honesty. Then we can achieve success in life.
"Most of you make mistakes during your youth. You will ruin your future if you do not place importance on your youth. You also need to give due recognition to your middle age. Don't forget this important stage in your life. My advice is to build a foundation for your middle age and old age during your youth. The way you live your old age is your responsibility. Your professors can advise you on this but you have to make the decision," Dr. Ariyarathne added.
"Life is about learning from mistakes. Do not wallow on your sad memories. You triumph in life through experience. Your future depends on how you live your present. The decisions you take now will influence your future. My life is successful because of the values I grew up with. If there is a girl or a boy who lives life aimlessly then that will be the future he or she will live out," Dr. Ariyarathne said.
Life flows in a zigzag pattern. One day you will be happy and the next day you may be in the doldrums. Failure and bad experience in life does not mean the end of life. Happiness will follow unhappiness. Resolve your issues in this manner. Develop your problem solving skills. Move on, she added.
Dr. Ariyarathene pointed out: "Fear has been found to be the leading cause of unhappiness in life. If you had an abortion, you may feel unworthy. Live your life in the present without complicating the entire issue. Life is the way we face every single moment."
