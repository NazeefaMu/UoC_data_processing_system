The other day, a well-known artiste in the country was quizzed by the Special Police Unit probing the abuse of public funds.

 


He wept while making his statement to the Police sleuths, they say.


A letter sent by this artiste to a son of a leading politician in the country has come into the hands of the investigators which they propose to use as documentary evidence of the former’s involvement in the alleged crime.  The artiste has in this letter expressed his ‘undying gratitude’ to the leading politician’s son for entrusting him (the artiste) with the task of organizing a certain key public function in the South, they say.
