Celebs who almost got away with living Double Lives

It's neither uncommon nor new for stars who promote squeaky-clean images to have sordid lives on the other side of the camera. It happened with the cast of The Brady Bunch and The Partridge Family. But it didn't end with the 1970s. Here are some celebrities who attempted to get away with leading double lives.
CORY MONTEITH: Cory Monteith seemed to have his whole life, and a very-bright acting career, ahead of him. He was one of the more well-known cast members on the hit show Glee, and he was beginning to get film work, earning a role in the Selena Gomez flick Monte Carlo and a starring role in the film Sisters & Brothers. Unfortunately, a life of drug abuse, beginning at the age of 12, cut that rather short. During his life, he had two stints in rehab as well, the last one initiated by an intervention held by his fellow cast members and Glee co-producer and co-creator Ryan Murphy. In reality, Monteith's life wasn't filled with much glee at all-tragically, he died of an overdose in July of 2013 at the young age of 31.
TIGER WOODS: One of the most successful professional golfers ever and one of the highest paid athletes worldwide, Tiger Woods had a beautiful wife and a family and endorsement deals that earned him more money than most of us will ever see in our lifetimes. All of that ended in November of 2009 with an alleged golf club to the head after his wife found out about his numerous extramarital affairs. In the days following, over a dozen women claimed to have had sex with Tiger. Since then, Tiger has apologized for his actions, to both his wife and his fans, and has embarked on something of a comeback.
R. KELLY: The soul singer R. Kelly gave us the uplifting and inspirational hit "I Believe I Can Fly," as well as the seductive "Bump N' Grind." But it seems he may have bumped and grinded against the wrong people a few too many times, because he had a little trouble keeping his hands off the young ladies (emphasis on young). While he may have been acquitted of having sex with and relieving himself on an underage girl, it's not his only instance of getting a little too-close to a minor. He was illegally married from August 13, 1994, until February 1995, to a then-teenaged Aaliyah. The marriage was annulled at her family's request. Allegations of sex with other underaged girls continue to follow R. Kelly.
ELIOT SPITZER: The former New York governor's political career was marred with controversy from some progressive and not-so progressive actions. To his favor, he attempted to allow undocumented workers to gain New York driver's licenses, and he proposed a bill that would have allowed same-sex couple to get married, both of which met with political disfavor at the time. To his detriment, he used of State Police as a surveillance force, earning the ire of his constituents. However, what ended his political career had nothing to do with his policies or proposals-it was his fondness for prostitutes, which cost him quite a bit of money over several years. He resigned in 2008 shortly after the news of the scandal broke. Things didn't end up all bad for the former governor though. He became a columnist for Slate, and he has had a few television shows as well.
KEANU REEVES: Not all double lives need to be a bad thing. Despite what we may think of his movies, and his band (yes, he has a band), Keanu Reeves is actually a really good person. He's known for giving his seat to strangers on the subway. More verifiably, he gave most of the money he earned on The Matrix sequels to the people working behind the scenes. He has even set up his own cancer charity and chose not to have his name attached to it. That's quite a secret to keep. Maybe he truly is the One.
SUZY FAVOR HAMILTON: This former Olympic middle distance runner competed in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 Summer Olympics, but never medalled. However, the Big Ten honored her by naming an award after her, the Big Ten Suzy Favor Female Athlete of the Year award. Unfortunately, the University of Wisconsin-Madison alumna lost that honor after her secret career as an escort was brought to light in December 2012 by The Smoking Gun. Beginning in 2011, she worked for several Las Vegas escort services under the alias "Kelly Lundy". Her name was not only stripped from the award, but she also lost endorsement deals with Nike and Disney. It didn't end all bad for her though. Like most celebrities and celebrity athletes, her illicit activities provided material for a forthcoming memoir.
