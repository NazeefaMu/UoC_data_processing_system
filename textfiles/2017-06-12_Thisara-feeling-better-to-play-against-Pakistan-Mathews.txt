Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews on Sunday said that Thisara Perera was feeling better after being hit on the head during practice session on Saturday.

However, Mathews said that that he was disappointed to lose a player like Kusal.

"We still haven't had a good look at the wicket. We'll probably decide later on or early morning tomorrow to give ourselves a chance to just see what the wicket looks like and then make a call," Mathews said when asked if Denanjaya de Silva would get an opportunity to play against Pakistan.

He said that his team is not thinking about the semifinal and their eyes are on the game against Pakistan at the moment.
