The United National Front (UNF) is currently engaged in a dialogue with a selected group of SLFP MPs for the purpose of forming a government, MP Nalin Bandara Jaymaha said today.

He told a media briefing that these discussions were being held in line with a decision taken by the UNF to secure the support of SLFP MPs with whom they could work in a future government.

“We decided on Thursday night that we will handpick SLFP MPs with whom we could work and our discussions are based with that objective in view,” the MP said.(Yohan Perera)
