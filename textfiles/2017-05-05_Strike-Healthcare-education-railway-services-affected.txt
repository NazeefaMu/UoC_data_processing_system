Healthcare, education and railway services countrywide came to standstill today because of the 24-hour strike launched by several trade unions against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing government doctors including ayurvedic doctors, dental and veterinary surgeons stopped work from 8.00 a.m. today to 8.00 a.m. tomorrow.

“About 160 trade unions joined in this battle to protest against SAITM, the trade agreements with foreign countries such as ETCA, the selling of the country's assets and the privatization of state institutions,” he said.

Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA had also requested its members to refrain from engaging in private practice during the strike and warned of more trade union action if the government did not provide them with a reasonable response on SAITM.

However, he said emergency treatment at all the hospitals was carried out uninterrupted.

Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin told Daily Mirror that about 50 to 60 per cent of teachers at State schools kept away by applying for sick leave.

“The strike action against SAITM was a success. Many teachers applied for sick leave and have kept away from school despite several threats,” he said.

Railway Guards Association Secretary P.M.P. Peiris said the strike launched by railway guards and drivers despite several threats was a success.

Meanwhile, a member of the Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers, Professor Lal Jayakody said students attached to sState medical faculties around the country kept away from attending lectures.

“Those students are really helpless amid several people claiming that they are politically motivated,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
