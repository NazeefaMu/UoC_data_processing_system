MYTH: You can stop giving your child antibiotics once his/her symptoms are gone  

BUSTED: “No this is not true. You have to continue with the antibiotics for the period prescribed by the doctor. Usually it is about five days or even longer. If you stop earlier than prescribed the bacteria might survive and re-emerge. It will proliferate and the infection might return. Furthermore, resistance organisms might come. Thus, it should not be stopped prematurely, the full course must be completed”  explained Dr. Kosala Karunaratne, Consultant Paediatrician, Lady Ridgeway Hospital,Colombo, ETU.
