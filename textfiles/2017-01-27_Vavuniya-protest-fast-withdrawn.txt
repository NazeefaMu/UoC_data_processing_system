The group of people, who launched a fast unto death in Vavuniya, demand the government to probe the disappearance of their family members, withdrew their protest fast on Thursday following the assurance given by State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene to look into their grievances.


The Minister said he would facilitate a meeting at Temple Trees on February 9 for the people who fasted with Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake.


“We will take action to find solutions to these people’s issues and to find out what has happened to their loved ones. We should look at their issues with sensitivity,” he said.
