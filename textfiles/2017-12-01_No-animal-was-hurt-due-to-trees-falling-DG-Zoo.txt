Director General of the Dehiwala Zoological Gardens Dhammika Malsinha said that no harm came to the “spider monkey” that had been in the cage at the time three big trees uprooted and one fell onto the cage occupied by it.

When Malsinghe was asked to elaborate on the amount of damage caused to the Zoo premises and to its occupants from falling trees replied that no animal kept at the Zoo was injured as a result of the inclement weather.

She said that the roof of the cage used to house the giraffes had been blown off due to strong winds that occurred on Wednesday (29) and workers had been deployed to clear the trees that had fallen at the site. (Text and pics by Reka Tharangani Fonseka)
