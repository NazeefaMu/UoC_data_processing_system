Over 5,500 MTs of paddy purchased from Matale

The paddy purchasing program in the Matale District for the current Yala season is progressing successfully.
This was discussed at the Matale district agriculture committee meeting at the District Secretariat's auditorium recently. The Paddy Marketing Board is operating five purchasing centres in the district.
They are located at Wilgamuwa, Nagolla, Pelvehera, Kandalama and Kanadana areas.
A total of 5,549 metric tons of paddy had been bought at a certified rate. Another 500 metric tons of paddy will be purchased from the Galewela and Dewahuwa areas. Each farmer can sell only 2,000 kilograms to the government.
As a result, large stocks of paddy are being kept in farm houses without a way to sell it.
Farmers request the government to increase the purchasing quantity to 5,000 kilograms.
