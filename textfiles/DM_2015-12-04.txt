Appointing Karuna as SLFP VP was a good move: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today said appointing former LTTE member Vinyagamurthi Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman as a minister and as a SLFP Vice President was the right decision.
 
He said instilling ethnic extremism in the minds of the people is a dangerous move.
The President made this point by stating that extremism is being inflicted in the minds of the people by certain forces that make false allegations against the government on the steps it had taken to release those who are held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and on the steps taken to de-proscribe diaspora organizations.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget in Parliament today, the President questioned as to how one could point his or her finger at the government when the previous government had released 12,000 detainees.
Please don't use communalism and extremism to win votes as such an act will end up with a crisis" he added. (Yohan Perera)

Arjuna to contest for SLC vice presidency
	
Minister of Ports and shipping Arjuna Ranathunga submitted nominations to contest as the vice president of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board at the next election to be held in January.
Minister Ranatunga said he got requests from around the country to contest for the presidency of the SLC but he decided to contest for the vice presidency as he was not eligible to contest for the presidency.
I have to be in the executive committee for two years to serve as the president. I could have gone to the Minister, president or the Prime Minister and get permission but that is not the way I follow. I will have to wait till I get eligible, he said.
Minister Ranatunga said he decided to contest the SLC election as he was concerned with school cricket and that he wanted to promote school cricket and get it into a different level.

Heated argument over sharia law in Parliament
	
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A. Sumanthiran was today verbally confronted by Muslim MPs in Parliament creating chaos the House when he asked whether stoning a person to death had been recommended by Islam's Shariya Law.
He said this when referring to the stoning to death of a Sri Lankan woman in Saudi Arabia.
Muslim MPs shouted at Mr Sumanthiran saying he has no right to talk about Shariya Law. The vociferous cross talk was led by UNP MP S.M. Marikar, Minister Rishard Bathiudeen and several others.
Mr. Sumanthiran shot back saying he has a right to refer to the teachings of any religion as long as he did not insult any religious discipline.
He recalled how Jesus Christ confronted the law of 'stoning a person to death' as stated in the New Testament.
Mr. Bathiudeen said all MPs represented in Parliament have made a collective effort to save the Sri Lankan girl from the death sentence. (Yohan Perera)

In its report on the police assault on the students of the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) during a protest in Ward Place in October, the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) today recommended that the police should compensate those who were injured.
The manner in which the police acted during the protest had demonstrated that they were riddled with several professional deficiencies, the report stated.
SLHRC had concluded that according to the Constitution, the police had violated the students fundamental rights.
It also recommended that Sasini Sandeepani who was shown in photographs as being beaten by a policeman should be paid a compensation of Rs.25,000 by the Police.
It said the other eight students who were hospitalized with injuries suffered during the attack should also be paid a compensation of Rs.15,000 each. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Those who shout now were silent during my regime: MR
	
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who spoke in Parliament for the first time since his election as an MP said yesterday that some who allege about wrongdoings during his regime remained silent then.
Some of them were even ministers in my Cabinet," he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa who responded to a statement by his successor Maithripala Sirisena that 12,000 LTTE members were released during the previous regime said they were released after ensuring they would not go back to war again.
But he said suspicions had arisen over this government's action to release former LTTE cadres. He said situation was same with regard to the deproscription of diaspora organizations.
Mr. Rajapaksa said his government had set the stage for reconciliation by developing infrastructure facilities in the North and East and recalled that the LLRC and the Pranagama Commissions were appointed by him.
He said fulfilling the demands made by the Tamil diaspora was not reconciliation and asked the government not to degrade the security forces.
Mr. Rajapaksa asked the government not to bring in laws to enable the setting up of special courts to try security forces personnel. (Yohan Perera)
The full speech made by Mr. Rajapaksa

Hon. Speaker,
In 2009, we militarily defeated the LTTE which had been officially named by the US Federal Bureau of investigation as the deadliest terrorist organisation in the world. Though we had defeated the military machine of the LTTE, their political and financial structures based in Western countries remain intact. Therefore, my government maintained constant vigilance to ensure that there was no resurgence of terrorism in Sri Lanka. There were about four attempts of varying severity by separatist terrorists to regroup in the North but due to our vigilance my government was able to nip all those attempts in the bud.
I see now that this vigilance no longer exists. My government rehabilitated and released over 11,000 LTTE cadres and retained in custody only those considered to be dangerous to the community. The present government has been hastily releasing hard core terrorists without regard to the nations security due to political pressure from certain interested quarters.
While dangerous LTTE detainees are being released, the Prevention of Terrorism Act is being used to imprison members of the military. The PTA was enacted to deal with terrorism, not to detain members of the armed forces. If any investigation is to be carried out into the conduct of military personnel, the government has a duty to deal with the issue under the laws applicable to the military or under the ordinary law of the country. That is a basic curtsy that we have to extend to members of the armed forces who sacrificed so much for the country. We have to be heedful of the self respect of our armed forces.
Officials of foreign organisations have been permitted unfettered access to Sri Lankas military installations such as the Naval base in Trincomalee. This has resulted in an immediate danger posed to members of the intelligence wing of the Navy reminiscent of the situation that arose after the Millennium city betrayal in 2002.
Hon Speaker,
We have to be mindful of the events which occurred on the so called Mahaviru day marked recently. The black flags and the posters on the Jaffna campus openly deified Prabhakaran and called for the establishment of Eelam. The provincial council of the Northern Province ordered that schools be closed and hartals and hunger strikes were organised in the North to bring pressure to bear on the government to release dangerous terrorists. A 17 year old youth jumped in front of a moving train and committed suicide. It is said that a letter was found in his possession demanding that LTTE prisoners be released forthwith. It is not possible to believe that a teenager would have resorted to this behaviour without instigation and elaborate planning by others. We must be mindful of where these incidents are leading the country.
Despite the danger signs that have been manifesting themselves, the government has taken the ill-advised move of removing the proscriptions on eight pro-LTTE organisations and 269 individuals. I have seen on the internet photographs of the Tamil Youth Organisation and the Canadian Tamil Congress both of which were recently de-proscribed, hoisting the Eelam flag and paying public homage to Prabhakaran. These are organisations which my government banned to safeguard Sri Lankas security but they have all been irresponsibly de-proscribed by the current administration.
Officials of foreign governments have visited our country and made demarches to Sri Lankas leadership about withdrawing the military from the Northern Province. Decisions with regard to the deployment of troops are matters that should solely be within the sovereign jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. I cannot approve of officials of foreign governments declaring that they will remain cautious and vigilant with regard to military matters in Sri Lanka.
The root cause of these problems is the ill-conceived foreign policy of the current administration which is based on bending over backwards to please certain foreign governments which are in turn influenced in their policy towards Sri Lanka by various Tamil Diaspora organisations which can deliver votes at elections in those countries.
Hon Speaker,
In October this year, the present government ill-advisedly accepted and co-sponsored a resolution against Sri Lanka which is based on a report which states that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Sri Lankas armed forces committed grave crimes during the last phase of the war against the LTTE. In terms of this resolution the government has agreed to establish a war crimes court to try Sri Lankan military personnel with the participation of foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators and to allow this mechanism to obtain funding from foreign countries. They have also agreed to reform the domestic law to bring it into line with the laws implemented by international war crimes tribunals. They have also undertaken to remove through an administrative process, members of the military suspected of having committed human rights abuses even if there is insufficient evidence to charge them in a court of law.
When the British prime minister met our President recently, the former made an offer of six million pounds to reform the military. I do not believe that foreign governments should be sponsoring the reform of Sri Lankas armed forces nor should any such reform be done due to pressure from overseas.
I have come to learn that the senior military officers who led the various Divisions during the final phase of the war are to be retired without being given the usual service extensions. When these officers retire, they lose the institutional backing and protection provided by the military. Sending these officers on retirement at a time when war crimes investigations are being spoken of is a clear case of deliberately abandoning these officers. It is my view that these officers should be granted service extensions by the government until the danger abates. 
The government has also agreed amend the Public Security Ordinance and to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with legislation acceptable to the foreign powers. I see this as a reckless dismantling of the countrys core security legislation.
Hon. Speaker,
The State owned Rakana Lanka Security Service built up a successful maritime security service in the Indian Ocean Region during my administration. More than twenty private security companies collaborated with Rakna Lanka in this enterprise in various capacities. Sri Lanka earned a considerable amount of foreign exchange through this endeavour and it continued to function under the present government until very recently. But now I find that the government has for political reasons embarked on a course of action aimed at completely destroying this successful maritime security service which functioned with the approval of the relevant UN bodies. 
Key individuals who provided political and military leadership to the war effort are now being hauled virtually on a daily basis before various police financial investigation units and commissions of inquiry probing allegations corruption and fraud. I believe this is being done to tarnish the image that these individuals built up in the country by providing leadership to the war effort. I know that the people are following these developments carefully.
I wish to call upon the government to not to place the nations security in jeopardy over petty political considerations and due to their antipathy towards me and the government I led. Thank you!
