Expecting a Baby Boy!

Michael Phelps and Nicole Johnson recently announced that they're expecting their first child!
"We found out 8 weeks ago we were expecting," Phelps captioned the above photo on Instagram. "Today we're over 12 weeks and it looks like we're having a boy!! #babymp #mp#lifeabouttochange #mpswim"
Obviously, Michael isn't playing coy like so many other expecting celebs. There's a lot of information in those two sentences:
Nicole is three months along; she's expecting a boy; and judging by the "mp" hashtags, we're guessing his name will be Michael. Phelps and Johnson got engaged back in February, but have yet to announce when they plan to wed.
At first, the engagement was dismissed as a PR stunt by many, as it came on the heels of Phelps' DUI scandal, which resulted in several sordid details about his private life being made public.
