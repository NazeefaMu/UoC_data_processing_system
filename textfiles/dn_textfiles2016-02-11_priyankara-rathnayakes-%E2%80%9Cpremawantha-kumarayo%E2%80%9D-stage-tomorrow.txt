Priyankara Rathnayake's “Premawantha Kumarayo” on stage tomorrow

“All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.”
As the world’s greatest dramatist William Shakespeare once said, this outstanding personality had played many roles in his theater of life. Priyankara Rathnayake extended his dominance on stage, television and cinema in the Sinhala and English artistic fields since 80s.
Rathnayake,a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Fine Arts,at Kelaniya University, teaches theatre; the only place which offers it as a separate subject, and leads ‘Academic Players’ of Drama and Theatre and Image Arts unit, University of Kelaniya which had won several awards over the years.
He, who is credited for introducing Sophocles to the local theatre, took a different route directing Aristophanes' Lysistrata on 2012.
Ratnayake’s effort to explain ancient western classics in the local theatre takes a new dimension as he stages Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream “Premawantha Kumarayo”  along with the award winning  ‘Academic Players’.

On a Midsummer’s night, four young lovers find themselves wrapped in the dream-like arms of an enchanted forest where sprites lurk and fairies rule. While a feuding Fairy King and Queen are at war, their paths are crossed by Bottom, Quince and their friends presenting a play within a play. Chief mischief-maker Puck is on-hand to ensure that the course of true love is anything but smooth, and games of fantasy, love and dreams ensue in Shakespeare’s most beguiling comedy.
Translated by Jayawathi Jayasinghe the world renowned Shakespeare’s comedy play will be performed as never before by the ‘Academic Players’on the 12th and 13th of February at Lionel Wendt.
