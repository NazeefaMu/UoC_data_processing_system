UPFA parliamentarian Duminda Silva said today he would continue the development work he had started in Kolonnawa despite the mud-slinging campaign against him.
He told media after his court appearance in the case where he is one of the accused in the Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
Mr. Silva said false allegations were levelled against him but he would not be distracted by such allegations.
“I believe people are with me,” he said.
Mr. Silva assured he would support the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
