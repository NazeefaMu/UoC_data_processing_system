A provincial political authority from the central hills recently got a tongue lashing from a female school principal when he made an amorous advance to her, they say.

 


The young lady had called on the political authority to seek his help regarding a personal problem and had angrily reacted when the politico held her hand and proceeded to make an improper proposal.
“Your conduct is despicable – very unbecoming of a person of your age!” the lady had said in a high voice as she walked out of the politico’s office. 


Several persons who were waiting to see the politico were witness to this scene, they say.
