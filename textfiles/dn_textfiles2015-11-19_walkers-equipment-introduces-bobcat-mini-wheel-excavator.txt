Walkers Equipment introduces 'Bobcat' mini wheel excavator

Walkers Equipment Limited was established just under a year ago and secured the local distributor rights for "Bobcat" branded hydraulic excavators in 2015
Walkers Equipment Limited, is a subsidiary of MTD Walkers, recently rebranded "Walkers CML". Bobcat carries a brand heritage since the year 1947 and is synonymous with rugged, tough, reliable and efficient compact construction machinery.

Chinthaka Perera, the Senior Marketing Manager of Walkers Equipment Limited for Bobcat stated that the strong brand equity of Bobcat together with the reputation and goodwill of the Walkers Equipment team led to the purchase of the first four units of Bobcat mini wheel excavators by K D E Ebert and Sons Holdings Pvt. Ltd.
K D Ebert and Sons Holdings, a leading C1 contractor in Sri Lanka (with over six decades of heritage), said the purchase of these units was also heavily influenced by the versatility and mobility of wheel excavators in construction, especially in the road and water sector.
