Army says it has only limited role in north
	
The Army has maintained that its involvement in the Northern Province is limited only to demining, construction works and infrastructure development in connection with the resettlement of people.
Responding to a questionnaire sent by The Hindu last month on the status of the Armys presence in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, it had said on Thursday: We have almost totally disengaged [ourselves] from non-military activities.
The Oakland Institute, a US-based policy think tank, had earlier reported the Army has expanded itself into non-military activities and is engaged in large-scale development, construction projects and business ventures.
On a question about the Armys plan to close down camps in the North, it said since the end of the humanitarian operation [thats how the Eelam War IV is called in the Armys parlance] in May 2009, the deployment of troops had been regularly reviewed based on threat assessment, national security concerns and strategic implications. 
Accordingly, troop deployment had been readjusted on several occasions. This is a continuous process and the number of troops and bases will be in accordance with the national security concerns.
Last month, a statement put up on the website of the Ministry of Defence stated that 59 camps in the Northern Province were closed down since May 2009. No camp was wound up this year. There were also media reports, quoting Major General Nandana Udawatte that the number of army camps came down from 152 to 93 [during 2009-2014].
The Army also denied reports that 75 per cent of its divisions are located in the North, but refused to give the exact figure. No army in the world would disclose actual numbers. It pointed out that even identification numbers of army formations, naval and air fleets in many countries are not disclosed.
It said the troop deployment adjustment and the release of private lands [taken over by the Army during the War] are continuous and ongoing processes. It confirmed that in the last five years, it has released 19,159 acres in the Province, including 6,258 acres in Palaly.
The Army described the Thalsevana holiday resort being run by it in Kankesanthurai of Jaffna as an R&R [rest and recreation] facility. It also said the resort was open to the public in a limited manner when rooms were vacant.
In late May, Chief Minister of the Province, C.V. Wigneswaran, told an international tele-press conference that President Maithripala Sirisena had made an offer to him to take over the resort and run it as a conference hall. State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene told The Hindu then that no decision had been taken as there were two views within the government on the issue.

Conviction of LTTE sympathisers set aside
	
The Madras High Court Bench on Friday set aside an illegal conviction and seven-year sentence imposed by a trial court on three people, alleged to be LTTE sympathisers, on charges of conspiring to smuggle acetone, glycerine, formaldehyde and dicyanamide to Sri Lanka for making explosive substances and indulging in unlawful activities in 2008.
Disposing of appeals filed by them, Justice S. Nagamuthu ordered retrial in the case since the Q branch police and the lower court had made grave mistakes in the trial that led to their conviction on March 4 this year. He pointed out that there were inconsistencies between charges framed against the accused and the charges under which they had been convicted. The judge said that he could not set aside the illegal conviction and let the appellants go scot-free for the errors of the prosecution and the trial court. (The Hindu)

I held his hand in admiration: MR supporter
	
The 35-year-old three wheeler driver, Hewa Narandeniyage Chaminda of Makandura Kalahagama, who was involved in the controversial Akuressa incident of grasping the hands of former President and Kurunegala UPFA candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa said he held his hand in admiration when he was moving towards the stage among the crowd but he couldnt get his hand back due to the pressure exerted by the crowd gathered around him.
Describing the incident to the media at the Matara UPFA main office he said,"I have been an SLFP supporter for the past 18 years. From my first vote I voted for the SLFP at every election. Even after his defeat I went to Medamulana and Carlton house to see him. I have on several occasions greeted him by holding his hands
"I had consumed some beer when I went to the Akuressa meeting. Mahinda Rajapaksa was proceeding to the meeting passing the spot where we were waiting. As usual I felt the urge to touch and hold his hand through the crowd. However, with a sudden surge of the people from behind it became much difficult for me to get my hand back which was squeezed among the crowd at the time. The rumours that I was trying to remove his gold rings were baseless. He didnt attempt to assault me. I regret this happening as I had a high regard for the savior of the country," he said.
Akuressa SLFP organizer Manoj Sirisena who arranged the media discussion said the UNP was exploiting the incident for political advantages trying to tarnish the image of the former president. He asked the people not to be misled by the false stories being spread by the UNP. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

Matale mass grave: JVP to appeal to higher court
	
With the Matale Magistrate observing that the Matale mass grave case could not be pursued further as a criminal case, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday said it would appeal against it in a higher court.
The JVP pursued legal action on the incident where human skeletal remains were found within the premises of the Matale hospital. The JVP believed the remains were those of its members killed during the 1988/89 insurrection.
The magistrate's observation that a criminal case could not be pursued was based on forensic analysis done in the US for radiocarbon dating, which confirmed that the skeletal remains dated back 50 years.
A report was obtained from Beta Analytics of Miami, Florida in the USA, for radiocarbon dating of the skeletal remains.
However JVP stalwart Sunil Watagala told Daily Mirror that his party would seek further legal action by appealing against the case in a higher court.
Several human skeletons were unearthed on November 26, 2012, during excavations within the Matale General Hospital premises. Up to February 12, 2013, about 155 human skeletons had been unearthed. (Kelum Bandara)

Ready to face Ravi over Litro Gas: Bandula
	
Former UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane today said he was ready to face Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in court if the minister sued him over charging the government of privatizing state owned Litro Gas Lanka Ltd.
Let him come to the courts. Also, he should have send a letter of demand to the media institution which exposed the governments attempt to privatize the gas company instead of sending one to me, he said. 
Mr. Gunawardane earlier charged the government had given approval to privatize Litro Gas Lanka Ltd by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shell Gas Lanka Ltd.
He said the government had signed the MoU to purchase gas at US$105 per tonne, contrary to international tender procedure.
However, refuting the claims, Minister Karunanayake yesterday said there was no attempt to privatize Litro Gas and said he would sue Mr. Gunawardane for making unfounded allegations. I will send a letter of demands to him, the minister said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Senaviratne appointed Sabaragamuva,Uva S/DIG
	
Senior DIG Ravi Senaviratne of CID had been appointed as the Senior DIG of Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces by the Public Law and Order Ministry Secretary with the approval of Elections Commissioner, the police said today.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said there were three vacant S/DIG posts in Sabaragamuwa, Uva and North Central Provinces and therefore, S/DIG Senaviratne was appointed as in charge of Sabaragamuwa and Uva.
Previously, the three provinces were administrated by the S/DIGs of other provinces. Since many election law violations and related complaints were reported in Ratnapura of, the department needed a separate S/DIG for the Sabaragamuwa province. Therefore, the ministry secretary made the appointment with the approval of elections commissioner, he said.
He said S/DIG Senaviratne served as the DIG of CID and the appointment had to be made after he was promoted as the S/DIG. There is no S/DIG post in the CID, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
