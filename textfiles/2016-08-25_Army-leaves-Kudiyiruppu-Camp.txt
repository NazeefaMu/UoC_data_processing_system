The Army has evacuated the Kudiyiruppu Camp which was in the hands of the army for the past 26 years.

The camp which belonged to the Vanni security headquarters contributed immensely to provide security to the Sinhala and Tamil people during the war.

Vavuniya District Secretary Rohana Pushpakumara said the army has taken steps to hand over the building where the camp had been set up to the Vavuniya district secretary.

This building which belonged to Vavuniya district secretary had been entrusted to the army 26 years ago to set up the camp.

This building used to be a Cultural Hall and no decision has been taken as to how it would be used.

A group of protesters from a Vavuniya Youth Organisation protested in front of the Kudiyiruppu Army Camp last week demanding the Government to immediately release their lands which were occupied for military requirements. (Romesh Madushanka)
