DPA, 12th JUNE, 2018- Just hours after concluding his historic talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, US President Donald Trump expressed optimism that denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula would happen “quickly” and that he and Kim would help “write a new chapter between our nations.”


“As history has proven, adversaries can indeed become friends,” Trump told reporters in Singapore on Tuesday after a day of meetings with Kim.


In an immediate gesture toward this, Trump said the US military would stop conducting war games aimed at North Korea. 


The drills, which the US routinely holds along with the militaries of South Korea and other countries, exacerbate tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, said Trump, who added that halting them also “will save a tremendous amount of money.”
