Before his arrest by the FCID, MP Wimal Weerawansa told reporters that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had wanted him and several others arrested.

“From what I heard before leaving for Switzerland he had instructed the authorities to arrest me and several others,” he told reporters adding that the allegations were a ruse to keep put him in prison.

“We won’t allow the government to turn Sri Lanka into a Chinese colony. I was framed because I refused to be silenced on matters that affect the country," Mr. Weerawansa said.

MP Prasanna Ranatunga said democracy was being violated by this government, which was selling national resources.

MPs Namal Rajapaksa, Bandula Gunawardena, Dullas Alahapperuma, C.B. Ratnayake and Mr. Weerawansa's family members were present outside the FCID.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
