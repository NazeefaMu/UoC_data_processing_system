The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) today wrote to President Maithripala Sirisena and said that its MPs would support the appointment of a United National Front (UNF) nominee as Prime Minister and a UNF headed government.

In a letter signed by 14 TNA MPs, the party said in the circumstances to ensure that an MP is able to command the confidence of Parliament as Prime Minister, the Illankai Thamil Arasu Kadchi will support the restoration of a Government headed by the UNF as it existed prior to 26th October.

“We will also support the appointment of a nominee of the UNF who in the opinion of Your Excellency is able to command the confidence of parliament as Prime Minister,” the party told the President.

It said the MP who was appointed as the Prime Minister on the October 26 has not been able to prove that he commands the confidence of Parliament though one month has lapsed since the said appointment and though Parliament has met several times during this period.

“The inability of the MP who was appointed as the Prime Minister, to prove that Parliament has confidence in him as Prime Minister and the votes of No Confidence passed against him pertaining to his claim to be the Prime Minister have created a controversy in the Country as to whether the country is without a Prime Minister, a Cabinet and a lawfully constituted Government for more than a month. We respectfully submit that this situation should not continue. The view of the majority of Parliamentarians on the issue of whether the said MP commands the Confidence of Parliament to be the Prime Minister has been negative and has been demonstrated beyond doubt,” it said.
