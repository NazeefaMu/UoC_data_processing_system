Bureaucrat stands up to bullying political authority


	



 

A certain purohita wanted to shift a branch office of a leading state-owned financial establishment functioning in a distant area in the country to a building in the same area belonging to one of his political supporters. This financial establishment comes under the purview of the Ministry that the political authority is in charge of. 

 


The purohita was only concerned about ensuring a source of lucrative income to his political henchman and there was no justification for the proposed shifting of the branch office.


The political authority ordered the chairman of the state-owned financial establishment to make arrangements to move the branch office in question to the proposed new premises.


The chairman found on inquiries made that carrying out the political authority’s order meant moving the branch office from the heart of the town where it was centrally located to a less accessible place several kilometers away. He also learnt from the branch manager that the proposed shifting could lead to a total collapse of the flourishing business of the branch office. Given the findings militating against the proposed relocating of the branch office, the chairman ignored the order by the political authority. He also informed the political authority of the dire consequences of the move proposed by him.


Nettled by the chairman’s reply, the political authority had told him: “You are working under me. You have to follow my orders. Relocate the branch office to the new premises I proposed without further delay.”


However, the chairman had replied: “You are a politician and I am the head of a state-owned establishment.  It’s my responsibility to safeguard the interests of the establishment which I am expected to run.  Therefore, come what may, I am not going to shift the branch office even an inch from where it is now.” 


The political authority had rung off after making the angry retort: “Hm! You will hear from me again.”
