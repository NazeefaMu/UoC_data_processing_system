AIA presents tuk tuk wisdom on bridging gap
	
		 		 
		 
			
Tuk Tuks, are a common feature in many of the 18 markets across Asia in which AIA, Asias life insurer, operates.
Often the bane of many a vehicle drivers, these whizzing wheelers are a sure relief to pedestrians looking for a fast way through the traffic.
While it is a typically Asia phenomenon, surely youd agree that Sri Lankan tuk tuks boast a unique characteristic. Thanks to them you know that who flies high, falls not low, only one sun shines for all and you should win without boasting, lose without excuse. Not to forget that life is not a game, (so) dont play it!
Famed for their cryptically profound slogans, these tuk tuks elicit a reaction from and leave a lasting impression on all of us. Be it a tribute to 2pac, solidarity with Bob Marley or a reminder that Che Guevara wants you to rebel.tuks tuks are a common slate for social messaging and instigation.
While the (often erroneously spelled) English slogans take on a more ideological and advisory stance, reminding you that too much of anything is good for nothing, Sinhala scripts, known as tuk tuk wadan tend to be a more crude and realistic commentary on some hard social facts. For example, hitapu kaelith na, athe sathe na, thaththa neththan mekath na! This articulates a common Sri Lankan phenomenon, that of young adults beings dependent on their parents, with no apparent financial security for the future.
Another common phrase is jeevithe mal, amma inna kal! Again, this highlights the prevalent problem of youth not thinking about let alone planning for their future, but instead being complacent with the provisions from their parents. Of course, if you read into the rhetoric a little deeper, you may see it as a wakeup call to realize that in fact, your parents wont be around forever and it will serve you well to start planning for your future. Yet another sardonic saying ko puthe yaluwo Ada salli ne amme, emphasizes that monetary security plays a pivotal social role.
While these quotes are often steeped in satire and cynicism, it does provide sound insights into social concerns and how much emphasis is placed on financial security. More importantly, it conveys the importance of bridging the gap, between what you have and what you will need, by pointing out the reality that life could lose its zest if youre not financially secure.
So the next time you see a scurrying tuk tuk darting across the road, have a good look and see what prudent messaging it may have. Who knows, you may just learn something new! And if you like to take it a step further and want to know more about financially securing the future for yourself and your family, then call us on 2310310, and wed behappy to help.

Click4Life has boosted customer value: Asian Alliance COO
	
		 		 
		 
			
Boosted by a high standard of customer service and retention, operational efficiency and technological innovation, Asian Alliance Life Insurance has been experiencing strong growth, far above the industry norm.
Rising up to the challenge of ensuring that high customer service standards are maintained and costs are managed prudently in this high-growth scenario, Asian Alliance Insurance has opted for further technological innovation that streamlines processes, enhances customer convenience and benefits all key stakeholders with the inclusion of its latest innovation  Click4Life.
In this interview, Asian Alliance Insurance  Life Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chula Hettiarachchi, elaborates on how technological innovation  at the point of interacting
with the customer, as well as in back-office processes 
have equipped the company to offer a superior service to its customers while simultaneously increasing
operational efficiency.
How has Asian Alliance Insurance performed financially in life insurance and how does this performance compare with that of the industry
The growth momentum of Asian Alliance in life insurance in the recent past has consistently exceeded that of the local life insurance industry. For instance, considering specifically the first half (1H) of the 2015 financial year, Asian Alliance performed exceptionally well.
Our Life Gross Written Premium (GWP) grew 31 percent year-on-year (YoY), while Life GWP growth of the industry was only 14 percent YoY in the same period  indicating that we are growing at double the industry average. We recorded significant improvements in both the top-line and the bottom-line. In addition to its obligations to clients and employees, Asian Alliance, as a publicly quoted company, has consistently met its obligations to its investors in providing a good return. In managing our fast-growing client portfolios, cost management has become a vital element  and we have addressed this through technological innovation.
The IT-based approach in all key areas of operations has ensured that costs have grown at a significantly lower rate in comparison with the growth in revenue. The expense ratio, which is an important indicator in this regard has been consistently on a downward trend and is below the industry average.
How has technological innovation directly benefited Asian Alliances life policyholders
We operate in the top market segment, catering to an elite customer base and our average customer value currently is Rs. 90,000  which is four times that of the industry. Thus the customers have high expectations and expect a very high service standard. We have met this need largely by offering greater customer convenience and value addition through technological innovation.
For the first time in the local insurance industry, our Click4Life application gave life policyholders direct access to conveniently fulfil many of their requirements through a PC/mobile app without manual intervention.
The services available via the app include convenient payment of premiums at any time, intimation of hospitalization claims, accessing personal information and changing policy details when required. This can also be used by policyholders to obtain a range of information on their policies  including the type of the policy, terms, payment mode, commencement date and benefits  and to request for various documents such as tax letters, surrender value certificates, embassy letters, premium summaries, payment history and bonus summaries.
A large number of our customers are already using this app and in the near future we will use it as a service rating mechanism as well, thus enabling us to monitor and further enhance customer satisfaction.
Similarly, our Click2Pay application, which has been provided to our Insurance Advisors for premium collections, enables customers to receive acknowledgement of their premium payments within a very short time period and thus increases transparency as well. From an operational viewpoint, this also enhances speed and accuracy while reducing the possibility of misappropriation etc. and is thus beneficial to the company.
Further, we were the countrys first to introduce self-service insurance kiosks, through which life policyholders can conveniently fulfil many needs.
What are the companys other innovations in back-office processes relating to life insurance and how have they enhanced operational efficiency
We have already introduced Optimal Character Recognition (OCR), which enables computers to directly capture hand-written data in various customer documents, thus eliminating the need for manual data entry and making the process of issuing a policy considerably faster and more accurate. This has enabled us to issue 50 percent of our life policies within a day.
Developing even further on this idea, we will shortly enable customers to fill out forms on tablet devices, enabling data to be directly captured and stored, thus further enhancing the speed and accuracy of the process.
We also have in place a computerized workflow system with live dashboard monitoring system that can monitor the status of each and every new application/proposal, revival, alteration or claim and enable staff to be monitored for higher performance and efficiency.
In addition to technological innovation, what other measures being taken to add value to life policyholders of Asian Alliance
We have launched a massive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) programme to reward our policyholders. For the first time in the countrys life insurance industry each-and-every policyholder will be rewarded under this initiative.
At present, in the local life insurance industry, the customer only has a relationship with his/her Insurance Advisor and if this person leaves the company etc. the policy will often lapse. Within the first three years, 80% of life policies in Sri Lanka lapse, which is a serious issue as these customers will not get their money back and they also do not have insurance cover. While Asian Alliance has a far superior record  with a retention rate of 80 percent in the first year in life insurance  our new CRM programme would further strengthen our relationship with our customers by putting seven departments in charge of interacting with different tiers of customers.
Asian Alliance Insurance PLC is held by Softlogic Capital PLC and is part of the Softlogic Group, which is recognized as one of Sri Lankas most diversified and fastest-growing conglomerates with interests in Healthcare, Retail, ICT, Leisure, Automobiles and Financial Services. Significant stakeholders in the company also include FMO and DEG that are rated AAA Development Financial Institutions from the Netherlands and Germany respectively.

Janashakthi hosts risk management seminar for hospitality industry
	
In a bid to share expertise and promote cross-cultural learning, Janashakthi General Insurance recently hosted Managing Your Risks Better, a seminar on risk management in the hotel industry. Several members of the hospitality industry attended the seminar held at Cinnamon Lakeside.
The seminar worked to give participants a holistic understanding of the risks involved in the hospitality industry, with several experts in varying fields giving informative talks on the topic. Sri Lanka is increasingly being promoted as a tourist destination. Not many people think of the risks involved in the tourist industry. Thats why we as a responsible insurer want to educate industry representatives of the risks, so that they can be prepared for any eventuality, Janashakthi General Insurance Limited Chief Executive Officer Jude Fernando said speaking at the event. Janashakthi General Insurance Limited General Manager Insurance Shani Ranasinghe opened proceedings, giving participants an introduction into the common misconceptions made when making an insurance claim by hoteliers.
Providing international perspective, McLarens Global Claims Services Singapore Regional Loss Adjuster Simon Stacey spoke about his experience during devastating floods in Northern and Central Thailand in 2011. In a wide-ranging and informative talk, Stacey provided insights on the role of a loss adjuster when evaluating a wide variety of claims  from stock to machinery and fixtures and fittings.
He also provided intensive information on making claims for business interruption, a topic of great relevance to those in the hospitality industry in the event of a natural catastrophe. In this way, participants learned the best way to prepare at the time of purchasing an insurance
policy and what steps needed to be taken to ensure a smooth claimspayment process.
Disaster Management Centre Sri Lanka Director Mitigation, Research and Development Anoja Senevirathne also spoke at the seminar on how to reduce risks and hazards associated with a natural disaster. Providing detailed statistics, Senevirathne explained that the fallout from a natural disaster event such as a
flood or tsunami would impact the private sector as well as the public sector causing more damage and huge losses.
In this sense, the private sector too had a part to play in minimizing its own exposure to risk, she said. As such, members of the hospitality industry should conduct detailed contingency management plans incorporating disaster risk reduction measures so that they could minimize their own losses. Transferring risk via purchasing an insurance policy should be done in a meaningful way particularly considering the spatial distribution of disaster risk,
she added.

Japan a sincere friend of SL: Abe
	
	Japan will act as a sincere friend of Sri Lanka during challenging times the latter may have to go through, Japanese Prime minister Shinz Abe said yesterday.
	The Japanse Prime Minister made this point when he met his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe prior to the 12th Science and Technology Summit in Kyoto last morning.
	Mr. Abe was confident that the bilateral ties between the two countries would further develop under the new Sri Lankan administration and that Sri Lanka would become a trade and economic hub in Asia in time to come.
	He recalled that the bilateral ties were originally developed after a speech made by late President J. R. Jayewardene made on Japan at San Francisco in 1952. He said the Japansese people will never forget this speech.
	Mr. Wickremesighe in his reply thanked his Japansese counterpart and said Japan will play a major role in building global relationship in the next decade. He appreciated the hand given by Japan in the fields of education and development of technology. He said government to government and private sector to private sector relationships should be developed between the two countries.
	Meanwhile, Mr. Wickremesinghe who addressed the science and technology summit said the current Sri Lankan government is committed to meet out justice to those who were distressed.
	Also he said Japan which had accepted that war is not a means of overcoming international crisis and become a global leader through the development of science and technology. Asia needs such leaders, he said.
	Stating that innovation should be a basis of development, the Prime Minister said many countries in South Asia had not been able to reap the benefit of such innovation. Mr. Wickremesinghe therefore stressed the need for a joint science and technological initiative between Japan and South Asia. (Dinith Chinthaka Karunaratne in Japan)

Vehicle import levies to be applied after Budget: Ravi
	
The import duty rates on vehicles, to be imposed in this years Budget, would be applied to all the vehicles that reach Sri Lankan shores after the budget was produced, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said today.
He said many people had criticized last year that they were not informed beforehand when the previous government imposed taxes on imported vehicles.
We decided to make this announcement as we were subjected to heavy criticism last year. We didnt ask anyone not to send any vehicles to Sri Lanka till the budget is presented, he said.
The government increased import duties on some categories of vehicles and the new rates were changed from the vehicles that arrived in the Sri Lanka ports after the budget date in early 2015 and the new rates were charged even though the vehicles were sent prior to the Budget. (Yohan Perera)

They always ask for money to let me talk to my brother. I gave Rs. 5,000 the previous day too. When I said I have no money today, they arrested me, he charged.
Meanwhile, dismissing the claim, a prison officer said the man was arrested because he had attempted to send a parcel of tobacco to one of the suspects in custody who was brought to court.
There are five cases against the suspect in custody. One person came outside and attempted to give him a parcel of tobacco when he was caught. He is now fabricating a story, Colombo Remand Prisons Jailor identified as Vajirasinghe said.
