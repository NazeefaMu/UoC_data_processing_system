Enhance your true beauty

Durdans Hospital, Sri Lanka's first Joint Commission International (JCI) approved hospital launched its ultra-modern cosmetic care centre "Enhance" at a special ceremony held recently. The facility was declared open by leading clinicians in the field. The ceremony was also graced by many dignitaries, members of the hospital's management team, special invitees and representatives of the media.
"At the skin care clinic dermatologists will identify the specific root causes for age old dermatological problems such as acne and pimples, stretch marks and open pores, and thereafter provide a permanent solution. High speed laser hair reduction procedures will also ensure no side effects, no pain and immediate recovery. Botox injections, skin boosters and PRP skin rejuvenation therapy will also be available to fight the effects of ageing," Consultant Maxillofacial surgeon Dr. T. Sabesan stated. For those who wish to take a step further, facial rejuvenation and facial contouring surgeries such as a face lift, facial implants, chin shaping (Genioplasty), lip shaping (Cheiloplasty), nose shaping (Rhinoplasty) and ear shaping (Otoplasty) can also be arranged.
Under the more complex cosmetic surgical category, "Enhance" will perform such procedures such as breast enhancement implants and breast reduction, liposuction, tummy tucks and many other plastic surgery procedures that help patients to reshape their body and regain confidence.
For many people how they look determines how they feel both physically and emotionally. The Enhance Clinic as the word suggests is all about enhancing how people look and feel. Our extensive portfolio of procedures coupled with world class standards that Durdans is accredited for will now ensure that patients do not need to spend a fortune on leaving the country to have these procedures performed. At "Enhance" we want our patients to feel as comfortable as they are in their home. The centre itself was therefore designed with an aesthetic ambiance that appeals to all the senses.
Director Medical Services, Dr Wimal Jayantha stated, "Durdans Hospital is pleased to introduce a Cosmetic Care Clinic, which is supported by skilled clinicians and guided by the highest international standards for health and safety of patients. A clean environment for procedures is maintained under the guidance of standards set through Joint Commission International (JCI), which Durdans has received the Gold Seal of Approval for Patient Safety and quality of care".
"Enhance" will be open for consultations from Monday to Saturday, and will also accommodate private consultations and specific requests for female doctors. Information on competitive pricing and customised packages is available via the Durdans Hotline 011 214 0000 and short code 1344 or at the hospital information desk.
