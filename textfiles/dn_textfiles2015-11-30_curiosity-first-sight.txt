Curiosity at First Sight!

Call her a workaholic. If you are Stephanie Siriwardhana, there is no idling around. The former Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Universe 2011 and Miss Asia Pacific World Sri Lanka 2013 is a Global Shaper of the World Economic Forum and the founder of the Stephanie Siriwardhana Foundation which aims to empower, inspire and educate women, youth and children.
"I have four or five tasks to juggle on an average day. Everything is planned ahead since I am not good at handling things at the last minute.
I would be lost without a planner. Each day is unique. I hate routine! It is fun to do different things," says the beauty whose heart lies in social activism.
Stephanie has a degree in Journalism, Communications and Political Science from the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada.
She had worked as the Senator of the Youth Parliament of Sri Lanka. She is also passionate about dancing, singing, art and kickboxing.
Q: How far has winning the Miss Sri Lanka crown taken you?
A: Winning the crown really helped me trampoline into the work I want to do. It creates a great platform where you can vocalize and really stand for things you are passionate about.
It also grants you access to places and people that might have been a little difficult to tap into to get work done. It has helped me a lot in terms of my foundation.
Q: Who is your fashion icon?
A: Hmmm, honestly I dress how I feel but if I had to choose I would say Victoria Beckham and Audrey Hepburn as they are both classy and strong women.
Q: What is your motto?
A: What is meant to be will be so live everyday to the fullest. And always be yourself! (Flashes a smile)
Q: If you could change one thing about yourself what would it be?
A: Honestly I guess I would like to be more patient. I'm very impatient and hate waiting for things to happen (LOL).
I'm someone who wants to execute ideas immediately and do so many things but sometimes I have a hard time pacing them out. So I guess that's what I'd change.
Q: What is the best holiday destination in Sri Lanka?
A: I think Sri Lanka has so many wonderful places which can give you any kind of atmosphere you want unlike many other countries where it's only one type. So I'd say it's hard to choose one!
Q: Are you a good cook? What is the tastiest dish you prepare?
A: Ohh, I LOVE to cook and I'd say I'm a self-proclaimed good cook. Ha ha ha! Well I think I make desserts best. I make a delicious Tiramisu. I've been promising a few people but still haven't found time to make it yet. Answering this question is probably going to get me into trouble. (LOL)
Q: Do you believe in love at first sight?
A: Well I'd say I definitely believe in 'Curiosity' at first sight because that's where it all starts. You see someone and find them intriguing and want to know more. That's where the journey begins and then only do I believe that love can blossom.
Q: Three tips you would give contestants vying for the Miss Sri Lanka crown.
A: Be yourself. Have fun. Use the opportunity to really make your dreams a reality as it's a great platform.
Q: What is your favourite song? Why do you like it?
A: That's a hard one but I guess I've always loved 'Ave Maria' (Bach's version).Lately I've been listening to 'The Lord's Prayer' a lot. These songs are magical.
They are both prayers ('The Hail Mary' and 'Our Father'). They take you to another realm completely where you can connect with a deeper spiritual energy.
Q: If you could be anyone else for a day who would you choose to be and why?
A: Gosh, that's a tough one. I can't pick one right now! (Laughs)
Q: What are you involved in right now?
A: My foundation is working on setting up the transitional shelter for sexually abused young girls which will be located in Kandy. I'm working on getting all the approvals so that we can start building by December! It's been a long journey to get here so I'm very excited that it's finally realising.
On a less serious note I've been singing quite a bit after playing Christine at 'Phantom' so that's definitely fun. And now it's event season so I'm hosting lots of events.
I was one of the 50 shapers worldwide to be selected and invited to the to the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos in January. There I met individuals like Andrea Bocelli, the Crown Prince and Princess of Norway (I even facilitated a session with the Crown Princess Mette Marit), Arianna Huffington, Will I Am of the 'Black Eyed Peas', the previous CEOs of Google and Yahoo including Bill Gates and many more fabulous people!
Q: What would your tomb stone read?
A: I'd say: Here lies Stephanie Siriwardhana beloved daughter, sister, wife and mother. Followed by something which talks about how I've touched and changed the lives of many and made them happy.
