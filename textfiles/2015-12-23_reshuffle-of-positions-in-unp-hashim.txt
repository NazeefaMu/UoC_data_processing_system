	A reshuffle of positions in the United National Party (UNP) and a change in the party's constitution is on the cards in January, General Secretary Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
	He told a media briefing that there might be a new general secretary as well.
	"I am not sure whether I will continue as general secretary," Mr. Hashim said responding to a question asked by a journalist on positions that were up for change.
	He said some positions would be amended where the powers were concerned while some others would be slashed.
	“Some positions will be slashed as they were created considering the party's position in the recent past" Mr. Hashim said adding that no decision had been made with regard to the deputy leader's post. (Yohan Perera)
