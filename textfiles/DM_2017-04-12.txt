Borussia Dortmund football team bus hit by explosions
	
Three explosions have hit a bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund football team to their home Champions League quarter-final match against Monaco.
In a news conference, the head of Dortmund police said it was a targeted attack on the team.
Player Marc Bartra underwent an operation after breaking a bone in his wrist. No other players were hurt.
The state prosecutor said a letter found near the scene was being examined as part of the investigation.
The match was postponed until 18:45 local time (16:45 GMT) on Wednesday.
Pictures from the scene showed the bus's windows broken and tyres burst in the blasts.
Dortmund police said that "three explosive charges had detonated" at Hoechsten outside the city at about 19:00 local time.
The first indications were that this was an "attack with serious explosives", they said.
Fans at the 80,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park were told to stay there until it was safe to leave.
The stadium was later evacuated safely and police thanked the fans for their co-operation.
"As many officers as possible" would be deployed for tomorrow's rescheduled game, they said.
Monaco fans were praised for their chants of support for Dortmund. Social media also carried offers from Dortmund residents to Monaco fans in need of a bed for the night on #bedforawayfans.
Borussia Dortmund said in a statement: "Shortly after the departure of the Borussia Dortmund team bus from the hotel to the stadium there was an incident. The bus has been damaged in two places."
Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke said: "The whole team is in a state of shock, you can't get pictures like that out of your head.
"I hope the team will be in a position to be able to compete tomorrow on the pitch. In a crisis situation like this, Borussia pulls together."
One of the Dortmund players, Mathias Ginter, was involved in the Germany-France match that was targeted in the terror attacks in Paris on 13 November, 2015. Another present in Paris, Andre Schurrle, was injured for the Monaco match.
FC Barcelona, Bartra's former club, tweeted: "All of our support to @MarcBartra, @BVB and their fans."
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also tweeted his support, wishing Bartra a quick recovery.
Fifa president Gianni Infantino said the football organising body condemned the incident and wished Bartra a "speedy recovery".
Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said he was "deeply disturbed by the explosions".
"The decision taken to postpone the UEFA Champions League match between Borussia Dortmund and AS Monaco was the correct one since we must always prioritise the safety and security of all fans, team officials and players," he said.
"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the representatives of the two clubs, the local authorities, and the supporters for their cooperation on the ground."
Dortmund are currently fourth in the German Bundesliga table.(BBC)

China worlds biggest executioner: Amnesty
	
BEIJING AFP April11, 2017- China executed more people last year than the rest of the world combined, Amnesty said Tuesday, defying a global decline with thousands of killings that have disproportionately targeted poor citizens. 
Even as executions have dropped by more than a third globally, Chinas death penalty rate is shockingly high although the full extent of the secretive practice is unknown, Amnesty International said. 
While President Xi Jinpings much-hyped corruption crackdown has seen many high-ranking figures sent to jail, their death sentences have often been commuted. 
Meanwhile ordinary people caught in the crosshairs of the law have not been so lucky, it said. 
Farmers were more frequently sentenced to death than any other group in China, Amnesty said in a report that sought to lift the veil on the workings of the system.

CMC to take legal action against three supermarkets
	
The Colombo Municipalitys Public Health Department yesterday raided supermarkets in the vicinity of Hyde Park and decided to take legal action against three leading supermarkets which were found to be storing food items under unhygienic conditions.
Due to the festive season, supermarkets usually stock a large number of food items disregarding safety regulations. There was no outdated food items detected during the raid though most of it was stored under unhygienic conditions, the Colombo Central Medical Officer of Health (MOH), Dr. Subash Mendis told the Daily Mirror.
He said many of the food items were tightly crammed into freezers though the usual procedure was to leave room for air circulation.
Freezers were found overloaded with food items and unsuitable for human consumption. We will take legal action against the three supermarkets. We will carry out sudden checks today as well, he said.
The surprise checks are being carried out during the festive season by the Medical Officers of Health and the Public Health Inspectors of the Health Department under the instructions of Colombo Municipalitys Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni with the objective of nabbing errant vendors and food items unsuitable for human consumption.

Dengue on a dangerous rise
	
The rising menace of Dengue and the plight of the IDH Dengue Management Unit
Witnessing a significant rise over the past couple of years, Dengue has become a rising menace in Sri Lanka with the eradication of mosquito breeding grounds appearing to be a losing battle under the current context. With over 30, 486 cases being reported over the past three months, Dengue has become a widespread epidemic with approximately over 41. 10 % cases being reported from the Western Province alone. Speaking to Daily Mirror, Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama explained the crisis Sri Lanka is facing with regard to Dengue fever; while explicating on the symptoms and precautionary methods the public could employ in the event someone contracts the disease. He highlighted the plight of the Dengue Management Unit of IDH,which is currently run by a shortlisted and overburdened nursing staff. He also pointed out the immediate need to absorb more nursing staff to the hospital complex. 
Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama 
The rising trend
During the dry period of February and March, the number of mosquito breeding grounds is minimal due to less water collection in the environment, said Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama. He pointed out that during the monsoon season, a high number of patients were being admitted to IDH.
Based on statistics available, a gradual increase has been evident since the last couple of years in the number of Dengue patients reported countrywide. We simply cant imagine to what extent this situation would increase by May and June. We had more than 25,000 cases on Dengue fever reported with more than fifty deaths. 
Generally, there are four types of Dengue viruses identified. Throughout the last five years, Sri Lanka has been affected mostly by Dengue virus serotype 1. To make matters worse, this trend has been gradually replaced by Dengue virus serotype 2 since mid-last year.
Compared to last year, the number of cases reported this year has increased twofold. This year, the Colombo District had about ten thousand cases and more than sixty per cent of them were admitted to IDH. The involved number of Dengue patients daily for treatment at the Infectious Diseases Hospital is nearly 200 while the number of admissions is around 80 -100 daily, Dr. Wijewickrama said. 


"We simply cant imagine to what extent this situation would increase by May and June. We had more than 25,000 cases reported on Dengue fever with more than fifty deaths"

He said despite experiencing a drought in February, Sri Lanka also experienced several episodes of rain. This is one possible trend that has given rise to the increased number of Dengue cases over the past couple of months. Moreover, he noted that the mosquito eradication programmes run throughout the country should be continued without failure. Adding that the public should also play a proactive role in eradicating Dengue breeding grounds, he said it was crucial to ensure garbage disposal was done in an intelligent manner. 
The symptoms of Dengue are mainly fever, severe head and body aches. A patient may experience loss of appetite, nausea, sore throat and mild loose motion. These symptoms observed in an individual could lead to the possible suspicion that the patient is diagnosed with Dengue. A physical test is important to ascertain if a patient is diagnosed with Dengue fever or not. Secondly, Dengue patients should not be administered any pill except Paracetamol in case they experience fever, bodyaches and pains. Pills such as Diclofenac, Ibuprofen and Mefenamic acid should not be given to a Dengue patient under any circumstances. If a patient is suffering from fever, we strongly recommend that they do a full blood count at the end of three days, and if the report is positive, the patient should seek immediate medical advice. In case the first blood count report is normal, a second full blood count should be taken the following day regardless of whether the patient is experiencing fever or not. Such patients need to take ample rest while ensuring that the aforementioned drugs are not consumed. Most people suffering from Dengue fever are unable to eat due to the illness. However, it is vital that fluid intakes are given to patients to keep them hydrated. King coconut water, orange and lime juice, cunji, soup and Jeevani are generally recommended for this purpose. Also, it should be noted that apple juice is not going to have any special effect on the patient. Liquids like king coconut are comparatively a lot more cost effective and efficacious on the patient than apple juice. The common complications of Dengue fever may include plasma leakage and bleeding. If the bleeding is significant, it could eventually lead to the damage of vital organs in the body, he added. 
Plight of IDH Dengue Management Unit 
According to Dr. Wijewickrama, Kolonnawa and Dehiwela were hotspots with the highest number for Dengue patients and Dengue breeding grounds reported during 2009, 2010 and 2011. It is in this backdrop that it was decided to initiate a separate Dengue Management Unit within the hospital. The unit was initially established with sixteen beds for each patient and as the number of patients grew, the number of beds increased to twenty. 
When we started getting more admissions for Dengue fever, we were compelled to put the patients in other wards as well. Finally, we decided to admit only the serious cases into special ward and patients who were not critical were sent to other wards. Also, a new ward built by the Army was recently added to the hospital complex to treat residential Dengue patients. It accommodates about twenty five beds. Unlike in the past, we now get too many critical cases and are compelled to accommodate two patients in each bed in the Dengue Management Unit due to lack of beds. Therefore, we currently face a serious shortage in the number of beds available for patients in addition to being short staffed, he said. 


We are facing a serious problem due to the lack of sufficient nursing staff. The hospital is therefore facing a big crisis.The Health Ministry fails to take note of these problems. Lack of nursing staff is not a problem that is confined to this hospital only. However, considering the number of patients admitted to the hospital daily, our hospital is in dire need of more nursing staff. There is a group of nearly thousand nurses waiting for new appointments from the ministry. According to the ministry, these appointments were scheduled to be given on April 9. But, the ministry has taken lenient measures and have agreed to let them officially join duty after the New Year.
The nurses who are already employed here have been working very hard despite being overburdened. We have been trying to convince the Health Ministry about getting these new appointees to officially join our hospital before the New Year, Dr. Wijewickrama added.
In a final note, Dr. Wijewickrama noted that he expected the ministry would change its perspective on this matter and provide a favourable solution to address crisis faced by the hospital and its staff.

G-7 reject British call for sanctions against Russia
	
By Jill Lawless and Colleen Barry 
The Washington Post, 11.04.2017 - LUCCA, Italy  The Group of Seven industrialized nations on Tuesday urged Russia to pressurise the Syrian government to end the six-year civil war, but rejected a British call to impose new sanctions on Moscow over its support of President Bashara al Assad. 
Foreign ministers from the seven countries said Moscow must change its attitude to Assad if there is to be hope of ending the brutal conflict that has destabilized the Middle East, driven millions to escape Syria and further frayed relations between the West and Russia. 
The G-7 blames Assads military for a deadly chemical attack last week that killed more than 80 people. Ministers meeting in the walled Tuscan city of Lucca strongly supported U.S. missile strikes that targeted a Syrian air base believed to have been used to launch the attack. But they were divided about how to deal with Syria, and Moscow. 
Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano, who hosted the G-7 gathering, said there is no consensus for further new sanctions. Instead of sanctions, the meetings final communique called for an investigation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to determine who was responsible for the war crime.

Government might delay 2020 polls as well: SLPP
	
SLPP member and National Local Government Federation (NLGF) Chairman Udeni Athukorala said today that the Unity Government might delay the General Election, that is to be held in 2020.
He said as the Unity Government seems it does not honour the public opinion and keep delaying the local government elections.
UPFA General Secretary, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera recently said the election would be held before the end of the year and repeatedly says it for the last two years, but nothing seemed to have materialised. Against this backdrop, the 2020 General Election will also be delayed similar to the LG polls, he said.
The NLGF Chairman condemned Minister Amaraweeras statement and said he (the minister) was brought to the fore by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but he hurls insults at him.
He said the Ministers in the Unity Government scared to face the elections and intended to fulfil the needs of certain foreign countries by selling Sri Lanka's assets and gaining unlawful profits.
Mr. Athukorala further said that SLPP May Day rally would be held at the Galle Face Green, and for the first time in the history, they will fill the area and expressed doubts whether the ground would be sufficient enough to accommodate their supporters.
3,500 buses will come to Colombo from each electorate. Though the Government does not hold elections, by this May Day we will topple the government with the energy and support from our SLPP supporters, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Ravi Jayewardene: Life will certainly be poorer
	

There have been many tributes paid to Ravi in the media, which may make mine seem superfluous, but I cannot fail to pay tribute to one, whom I have known for most my life and whose qualities of head and heart, were rarer than one in a million.
Ravi was a unique person, who never made use of any of the privileges that could have been his, as the son of the highest in the land.
He was an exemplary example as to how children of rulers should conduct themselves. I recall the many times I have seen him walking to his destination from Ward Place-the official cars were never used by him.
Just as he inherited his sense of humour and wit from his father, he inherited his simplicity from his mother. Once, as I came out of the gates of Braemar, his parental home in my car, I spotted him walking and stopped to ask if he needed to be dropped somewhere.
He laughed and asked me Are you following me or am I following you
That was Ravi.


Another incident I recall was when during those halcyon days of my youth, Ravis mother and I were making milk wine. It was the first time for both of us; Ravi came into the room and teased us saying, Both of you smell like a tavern!
He had an innate sense of responsibility to our country at a time when attacks from terrorists were building up with carnage at his height particularly in remote border areas and villages, with innocent children and villagers suffering death, loss and devastation, which led him to establish the STF [Special Task Force],they were a trained, skilled and disciplined group with the capacity to counteract these attacks.
This was his brainchild and it was good to see that this was really appreciated even now, when the STF took over and conducted his funeral. 
He was a true Buddhist, who practised his faith and lived it through thought, word and deed. Although born with a silver spoon, his mother was an heiress and an only child, he felt immensely for the suffering of humanity, organised medical supplies to be sent to areas which were badly hit by the ongoing conflict and his sincerity and simplicity endeared him to one and all.


"Just as he inherited his sense of humour and wit from his father, he inherited his simplicity from his mother. Once, as I came out of the gates of Braemar, his parental home in my car, I spotted him walking and stopped to ask if he needed to be dropped somewhere."

Ravi was a man, who always stood firmly by his principles. He was a man of honour, of integrity and was very angry with some who were close to his father, but who he felt had brought disrepute to his father by their acts of corruption. He didnt mince his words about them and his disgust at their behaviour.
One cannot write about Ravi without mentioning Penny, who gave him the happiest years of his adult life, they were devoted to each other, always together, sharing each others interests, and supporting each other in all their endeavours.
Wherever they were, Ravi would look at her and say You are still the prettiest and the best.
A great compliment after so many years together!
During his last and fatal illness, the late President had sent for Ravi and Penny and told them to always stay close to Ranil and to be there for him through good times and bad.
Ravi kept his word to his father and honoured this promise to the end, he was one who gave Ranil his utmost loyalty and sincere advice but was one of the few, who never asked for anything in return.


I recall that we were all together at Ranils 5th Lane home the night before he was sworn in as the Prime Minister after the Parliamentary Elections of 2015. Ranil told those responsible for the arrangements for the swearing in, the next morning, that he wanted Ravi to sit in the front row. To my surprise, the next morning, I found Ravi and Penny in seats upstairs near me. This again is typical of Ravi. He never sought glory, the trappings or the grandeur of basking in the reflected glory of his fathers position.
Ravi was a modern warrior, of great compassion, who always had time for the downtrodden.
He and his mother were the late President Jayewardenes greatest assets, never projecting themselves, always a few steps behind.
There are few people like that around, which is why he will be missed, much more than words can ever tell. Life will certainly be poorer without the presence of such a man.
Here was a man, when comes such another

SAITM ready to cooperate with Govt. proposals
	
The South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) said yesterday it was willing to cooperate with the Government in formalising a just and expeditious solution for its MBBS students subject to court proceedings.
SAITM Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando said they would abide by the laws of the country and extend their fullest support to the Sri Lankan Government.
He said SAITM had decided to complement the higher education sector of Sri Lanka by providing opportunities to qualified students line with the regulations of the University Grants Commission and the Ministry of Higher Education and that SAITM would also extend its fullest support to the Government's efforts in maintaining quality standards in medical education in Sri Lanka.
The statement said Dr. Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) is well equipped with state of the art technology and consisted of all relevant units needed for undergraduate medical training.
It said the SAITM medical graduates were trained by a highly qualified panel of academics consisting of 19 professors and more than 70 senior lecturers who have served in the State medical universities and hospitals.
Health Ministry on Friday decided to bring the NFTH under the purview of the Health Ministry and to conduct a mandatory examination under the joint supervision of the SLMC and the University Grants Commission (UGC) prior to providing SAITMs medical graduates provisional registration. The Health Ministry will also gazette the minimum standards required for medical education in Sri Lanka.
The Higher Education Ministry announced that SAITM graduates would be given a further period of clinical training in Surgery, Medicine, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Psychiatry, Paediatrics for one month each in Homagama and Avissawella Hospitals.

The Government appears to have admitted to the fact that SAITM's MBBS graduates were not equipped with the proper skills to treat patients and as such that they should undergo more training, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday.
It is evident that these students did not have the proper skills to treat patients because the health ministry has decided to provide them with more clinical practice and acknowledged that SAITM has failed to maintain the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) for this reason was bringing it under the purview of the Health Ministry, GMOA Secretary Naveen de Zoyza said. said.

Shortage of antiviral medication in hospitals: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said there was a shortage of Tamiflu antiviral medication in hospitals which is used for the treatment of the Influenza virus, widely spreading in the country.
While condemning the statement made by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne that the GMOA has attempted to topple the government, GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath told a media briefing that the Minister was trying to deviate the attention of the people on several issues at the ministry by making such statements.
Influenza virus has been highly spread throughout the country and many of the innocent patients were suffering from it. But unfortunately the Health Ministry has failed to provide them with enough medicine, he said.
He said they have never intended to topple any government earlier and would never do so even in the future through several steps they have taken to safeguard the health sector.
He said that there was nothing to feel surprised at the behaviour of the Health Minister towards the GMOA since it was evident that the government had approved the opinion of the GMOA on the SAITM issue in the Education Ministrys decisions about it last Friday.
We have never supported to topple any government or never worked partial to bring any government to power. Our members have empowered our leadership to safeguard their rights. We would not let any damage cause to health sector no matter what the government is, he said.
He also denied the remark made by the Health Minister that the GMOA has threatened the acting Director General of Health Services (DGHS) during a discussion held between the GMOA and him. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SL players not capable enough to play in IPL: Murali
	
Muttiah Muralitharan believes that talented cricketers do exist in Sri Lanka, but they need to polish their skills a lot more to play in the IPL. Unlike previous seasons, the number of cricketers from Indias neighbouring nation, plying their trade in the cash rich league, is far from impressive.
Are you saying we dont have the talent back home One of the greatest spinners of all time,Muralitharan said At the moment, Sri Lanka does not have capable players to play in the IPL. Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England, there are a lot of good players there. The tournament can have 32 international players, our guys dont fit into it, the Sunrisers Hyderabad bowling coach opined.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the diminutive former off break specialist said that team owners dont look at Sri Lankan players the same way as before. Muralitharan suggested that his compatriots need to get a lot more experience under their belt before they can be picked up by IPL teams.
Actually, we are lacking a little bit. We had great players but they all retired. Until the new guys establish themselves, IPL wont pick them because you have to pick the best 4 players. There are other more experienced players available, why should they pick inexperienced Sri Lankan players
The 45-year-old looked back on the progress of the game, since he made his debut for the national side way back in 1992. Muralitharan believes that the T20 format has played a crucial role in the development of cricket.
T20 cricket around the world is helping cricket reach out to more younger people. That is more important because those days, Test and ODIS was watched by older people. Now there are more younger fans, its good that the IPL started this in 2007. The payments help the players to live their life, he stated.
Muralitharan, who picked up over 3000 wickets in total during his stellar career, reckons that cricket has changed a lot over the last decade. But he refused to make comparisons suggesting that it would be unfair.
Cricket is so much different now than in the 90s. In ODIs, 220 was a winning score, today even at 350 you cant be sure. Batsmans mentality has changed but you cant compare generations. Maybe in another 10 years, it will change more, he said.
Last week Cricket South Africa (CSA) started the application process for those who wish to partake in the T20 Global Destination League. But the Sri Lankan believes that without Indian players, the success of such leagues would be minimal.
Whatever said and done, if Indian players are not going to play in those tournaments, its not going to be a big hit. Because, everyone wants Indian players, if theyre not allowed to play there, it wont have a big impact like the IPL, he said.
Under the tutelage of Muralitharan, Afghani spin sensation, Rashid Khan has taken the IPL by storm. He picked up 3 wickets in his last outing against Gujarat Lions and is the current holder of the purple cap.
We chose him because weve seen him play international cricket. Hes been bowling well to good players, hes different from other leg spinners because hes a bit quicker than the others. In IPL, the bowler knows what to do, all we can do is give confidence, Muralitharan signed off.(SportsKeeda)

Work on walking paths a normal renovation: CMC
	
The removal of the walking path of the Vihara Maha Devi Park situated in the heart of Colombo was only a periodical renovation, the Municipality said yesterday rejecting reports that attempts were being made to remove the path altogether.
Municipalitys Commissioner V.K. Anura said there was nothing strange in renovating the walking path which is worn out.
We repair buildings which need improvements. Other properties including roads are also being renovated on a regular basis. The renovation of the walking path at the Vihara Maha Devi Park is also such a renovation, the Commissioner told Daily Mirror.
He said the renovation of the path, which was constructed three years ago, is being carried out from the funds belonging to the Municipality and assured no special contract had been granted to carry out the project.
The park was given a face lift with jogging tracks and walking paths installed for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) held in Colombo in 2013. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
