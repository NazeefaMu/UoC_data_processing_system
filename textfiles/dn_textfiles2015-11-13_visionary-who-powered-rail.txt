The visionary who powered the rail

Engineer B. D. Rampala’s 115th birth anniversary falls on November 14. Institution of Engineers holds the Annual Rampala Memorial Lecture on this day. Electrification of Ceylon Railways was a visionary idea of Rampala.
Late D. J. Wimalasurendra introduced the benefits of harnessing the Hydro Electric Power to the country from rivers Mahaweli, Kehelgamu and Maskeliya, by his presentation to the Engineering Association of Sri Lanka in 1918. In his paper, Wimalasurendra explained the ascending of the railway to Pattipola and descending again to Bandarawela (Badulla was not connected in 1918) quoting similar accounts at:
(1) Butte – Anaconda Railway in Montana United States – first electrification introduced in a freight railway.
Engineer B.D. Rampala
(2) Genoa Line in Italian State Railways; gradient 3.5 percent, trailing load of 260 tons, at 24.43 MPH and a descending speed of 30 MPH (motors acting as generators thus providing regenerative braking). Capacity availability being trebled by electrification - quoting Alfred Thomas Dover’s book on ‘Electric Traction’ 1912.
(3) Midi railways of France; Meter Gauge track, 34 miles in length, gradients of 22 in 1000 (almost 1 in 45 and 17 in 1000 1 in 59) between Ille – Ville Franche.
(4) Norfolk and Norton Railway in West Virginia. Gains in Electric traction against Steam:
I. Decreased outlay from speed and longer trains with improved turnaround. II. Comparative decrease in maintenance. III. Greater train mileage and Ton mileage (capacity increase). IV. Riddance of pollution inside tunnels. V. By virtue of employment of regenerative control, increased down grade speed and savings on brake show renewals.
Electrification system
However, the British who administered the country did not like investing on hydro electric power and continued with the diesel generation. In 1929, Wimalasurendra retired from the government service on reaching the age of 55 and became a Member of the State Council in 1931. Finally on October 30, 1950, Laxapana Power Station was opened, but his railway electrification proposal was yet to be executed.
Since 1977, feasibility studies for electrifying the suburban network had been undertaken six times. Offers were invited by a press notification appearing in Ceylon Daily News of February 12, 1977, for electrification of Kalutara South, Negombo and Veyangoda corridor a total of 134-mile project on a turn-key basis, with offers to include terms of credit for financing. The project was to be operational by 1982, and involved design and specification study, electrification of fixed installations, establishment of repair and maintenance shops for rolling stock, and the closing date was March 15, 1977.
Based on above, the feasibility study by SOFRERAIL of France covered three sections of the network: 1. Veyangoda – Colombo, 2. Colombo – Kalutara South and 3. Ragama – Negombo. With the change of government in July 1977, this project was shelved.
The second study in 1981 was carried out by Pacific Consultants International of Japan for Designs and Specifications from Polgahawela to Colombo, and two other sections as in the former study. It was a detailed study and included all features associated with the project. The electrification system considered was the 25 KV 50HZ system with three sub stations to be directly fed from 132 KV grid. The total track length was 146 Kms. The estimated cost of the project in 1981 was Rs 5,673 million.
The third study was by JARTS in 1987. A study on development of a standard cost effective electrification system for Sri Lanka Railways.
The study undertaken by SOFRERAIL and INTER-G in 1991 was known as the COKANEPOL Project. This acronym was formed by the use of first syllables of the destinations: Colombo, Kalutara, Negombo and Polgahawela.
Japan Transport Consultants Association undertook a study in November 1990 on the same sub-urban route. It provided a detailed account on cost factor involvements, population and traffic forecasts, financial evaluation and a project justification. It was the fifth study. However, the government’s priorities were focused elsewhere.
Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka, (IESL)
The last study was undertaken by a team of consultants from the Institute of Engineers Sri Lanka, (IESL) in 1998. It was a case of ramification and ratification of the previous studies with approval and disapproval of the previous studies. Vast advantages, Financial and economic viability of electrification were accepted by this team.
However, in the absence of a political will and the government nod, all these studies were shelved. Technical specifications, tender documentation already in hand will be of use in the future.
Electrification of Railways involves a lot of Civil Engineering works in the form of:
• Clearances over bridges and tunnels (16’-6”or 5030mm from rail level), track lowering, bridge raising, partial reconstruction, total reconstruction, station roof redesigning,
• Overhead line catenaries equipment, mast installation, pantograph installation.
• For Brick Arch or Dressed Stone arch bridges the method used is to replace the centre of the arch by a shallower spanned precast concrete arch. Inside tunnels, the tracks are generally lowered along with the approaches; and pockets are grooved in the roof. Grout sealing is performed from top of the tunnel. Drainage problems caused by track lowering also need attention.
Indigenous manufacture of requirements substantially reduces the cost of electrification. Some of which that could be manufactured locally are steel sections for overhead equipment that could be rolled and galvanized, catenary and contact wires, all other non-ferrous fittings, and solid core insulators in local porcelain factories. Indian assistance could be sought for mechanical parts, electrical equipment for locomotives, pantographs, switch gear, tap changers, silicon diodes etc.
Training programmes could also be arranged in India on erection of OH equipment, masts, simple catenary, compound catenary, pantographs, portal structures, working on rail mounted trestles to transfer contact wires and so on, all that which leads to cost reduction.
