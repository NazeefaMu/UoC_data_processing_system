Attempts to finalize ETCA without President’s knowledge


	

The joint opposition today claimed that an attempt was being made by the Government to finalise the proposed Indo-Lanka Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) without President Maithripala Sirisena’s knowledge.

Former MP G.L. Peiris told a media briefing that some ministers had stated that ETCA would be finalized before October by whatever means despite overwhelming opposition to the agreement.

He said if the agreement was signed the consequences might be very serious and Sri Lankan courts would not be in a position to hear any cases filed against the contents of the trade pact the agreement was with a foreign country.

"If even the parliamentarians don’t have a clear idea about the ETCA, the people are undoubtedly unaware of what their country is going to agree to with neighbouring India," he said.

“Therefore, it is certain that the people and the politicians will have problems and points that cannot be agreed to in the agreement. But, we will be helpless if the ETCA is finalised behind our backs."

Former Minister Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena speaking at the media briefing called for a referendum to seek public approval for the ETCA.

The JO warned the government that 25 US Congress members had informed US Secretary of State, John Kerry to stop aid to Sri Lanka if the Sri Lankan Government of Sri Lanka does not seem to have begun the implementation of the UN resolution as promised. (Piyumi Fonseka)
