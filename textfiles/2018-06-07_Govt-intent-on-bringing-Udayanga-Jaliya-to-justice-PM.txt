Govt. intent on bringing Udayanga, Jaliya to justice: PM


	

The government has stepped up its efforts to bring former diplomats Jaliya Wickramasuriya and Udayanga Weeratunga to justice, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday.

PM Wickremesinghe said this in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in this regard in the House last morning.

Mr. Wickremesinghe said Jaliya Wickramasuriya had been charged with misusing US dollars 300,000 by claiming that the money was spent to purchase a new building to be used as the Sri Lankan Embassy in the US.

He said the Financial Crimes Investigation Department (FCID) had taken over the case and notice was issued for him to appear in court.

“A warrant has been issued seeking his arrest as he had failed to report to court as per the notice issued,” the Prime Minister said, adding that subsequently search warrants were obtained to check the assets, including the bank accounts, of Wickramasuriya.

He said Udayanga Weeratunga has been charged with committing a fraud with regard to the purchase of MIG aircraft from Ukraine.

He was thought to be hiding in the U.A.E at present. The government is working closely with the U.A.E government to bring him to face justice in Sri Lanka after a warrant was issued for his arrest.

The Prime Minister said notices have been issued to prevent Weeratunga's lands in Dompe from being sold until the case against him is over. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
