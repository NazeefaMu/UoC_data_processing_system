Armenian PM resigns after  anti-government protests
	

REUTERS, 23rd APRIL, 2018- Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan said he was resigning on Monday to help maintain civic peace following almost two weeks of mass street protests that have plunged the impoverished ex-Soviet republic into political crisis.
Sarksyan, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had served as Armenias president for a decade until this month and had faced accusations of clinging to power when parliament elected him as prime minister last week.
Under a revised constitution, the prime minister now holds most power in the tiny southern Caucasus nation, while the presidency has become largely ceremonial.
Pressure on the 63-year-old to quit had increased sharply on Monday when unarmed soldiers in the capital Yerevan joined the anti-government protests which first began on April 13.
Though peaceful, the tumult has threatened to destabilize Armenia, a key Russian ally in a volatile region riven by its decades-long low-level conflict with Azerbaijan. Moscow, which has two military bases in Armenia, was closely watching events.
I got it wrong, Sarksyan said in a statement issued by his office.
In the current situation there are several solutions, but I wont choose any of them. Its not my style. I am quitting the countrys leadership and the post of prime minister of Armenia.

CCD to go ahead and remove illegal structures despite ministers phone calls
	
The Coast Conservation Department (CCD) Director General Prabath Chandrakeerthi today told the Daily Mirror that Minister Faizer Musthapha had urged him not to go ahead with the decision to remove the illegal structures in Mirissa.
But Mr. Chandrakeerthi said the Department would remove the identified illegal structures by May 1.
"I received a call from the minister who wanted me not to go ahead. I informed him the CCD did not come under his ministry and that he could not make such a request," he said.
Mr. Chandrakeerthi said he had told the minister to submit his request in writing.
He said the minister wanted the authorities to first instruct the people and then lodge police complaints before removing the illegal structures.
Mr. Chandrakeerthi said the CCD had followed the legal provisions by informing of the rights of the occupants of the structures. The illegal dwellers have however not exercised the rights compelling the removal.
Some 17 unauthorized constructions were identified along the Mirissa beach by the Coast Conservation Department.
The minister on Sunday expressed opposition to the CCD decision to remove the unauthorized constructions saying the decision could hamper the livelihood of small entrepreneurs.
He had met the hoteliers in Mirissa on Friday and held discussions with regard to the situation that occured after the incident which Dutch tourists were sexually and physically assaulted in the area.
Many tourists both local and international detailed a culture of sexual harassment and abuse for years in the area.
A social media user said, "This is not the first time that the authorities have been notified about the surf bar - I did this myself three years ago. No action was taken. Not only the surf bar, there are at least three more establishments on that strip without licences and run by political thugs." (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Cost-reflective fuel pricing formula yet to be finalised
	
The cost-reflective pricing formula for petroleum has not been finalised yet and presenting it to the Cabinet will be delayed until next week since the key personnel in the Finance Ministry are attending the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Spring Sessions in Washington DC.
Unfortunately, for the past week, the ministers and higher officials from the Finance Ministry and Treasury were out of the country for official purposes. So, I think the formula has not been finalised. It would take another week, Finance Ministry Information Director M. Ali Hassan said. He added that the Treasury is currently preparing the formula with the assistance of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
When attempts were made to contact Petroleum Resource Development Ministry Secretary Upali Marasinghe for further information, his Personal Assistant said that all queries regarding the pricing formula should be directed to the Treasury. However, he has been quoted as saying that CPC is losing Rs.266 million a week due to the lack of a cost-reflective pricing mechanism, since its competitor Lanka IOC PLC has increased the petroleum prices due to the rising prices of crude oil in the world market, which has resulted in more consumers pumping fuel from CPC establishments at subsidised rates.
Last month, Petroleum Resource Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga expressed his opposition to the implementation of a pricing formula, stating that if the people get the benefit of low fuel prices, running CPC at a loss is justifiable.
He said that the time to implement a pricing formula has not yet arisen but that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe must take a policy decision for the government.
As part of a US $ 1.5 billion loan for the balance of payments support, the government promised to implement cost-reflective pricing formulae for fuel and electricity.
However, the earlier target set for December 2016 was missed after the initiative languished in uncertainty and the IMF then revised the targets to March and September 2018, respectively.
Analysts are speculating that the government does not have the political space to raise the petroleum prices in the run-up to the election season next year, especially given the fact that cutting the fuel prices was a pledge the current government made to come into power.
Sri Lanka has not revised its fuel prices since January 2015. However, the IMF has now made Sri Lankas continued eligibility for a US $ 1.5 billion reform package dependent on the Cabinet passing a cost-reflective pricing mechanism for petroleum before this June. Not implementing the two formulae could place extreme stress on Sri Lankas finances, raising the possibility of a debt shock, in the run-up to a peak in Sri Lankas debt repayment cycle.

Doctors attached to all Government Hospitals in the Eastern Province warned that they will launch a strike after Thursday (26) unless their demands were met.
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said their members, deployed for work in the East, would resort to a work stoppage due to the failure on the part of the authorities concerned to make their overtime payments.
Addressing a press conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama had instructed officials to pay the arrears before the Sinhala-Hindu New Year and to pay the increase in overtime payments by this May.
However, he said the medical officers in the Eastern Province had not received the arrears in overtime payments so far, adding that he had been informed that it had also become an issue to pay the increase in overtime payments in the coming month due to the negligence of the officials.
Furthermore, the Eastern Province Branch Collaboration had informed the GMOA that there were vacancies in key administration positions at several hospitals in the Eastern Province, thus creating even more problems.
As such the Eastern Province Branch Collaboration had informed the GMOA that it would resort to a work stoppage in the entire Eastern Province if the authorities failed to resolve these issues by April 26. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Inter-country adoption racket: SL adoptees to sue Dutch Govt.
	
Sri Lankan adoptees in the Netherlands are to hold the Dutch government liable for knowing about the adoption racket during the latter part of the 20th century but not taking action against it at that time.
Sanne Cohen, a Sri Lankan adoptee, who is to petition the Dutch Court, told Daily Mirror that her lawsuit was not about prosecuting wrongdoers, but to seek financial assistance in searching for biological families.
Searching is very difficult. We have to rely on root searchers who worked with the adoption agencies, but they are not reliable. Sometimes they find acting mothers instead of the biological mother, she said.
Her counsel, Martin de Witte, a personal injury lawyer, said that the petition requested court to hear witnesses. He said that adoptees wanted the government to be held to account for the immense damages they have suffered as a result of not knowing their biological families, and to pay the costs of DNA tests in the Netherlands and Sri Lanka, as a form of compensation.
The government has to protect the rights of children, which includes verifying where they come from. The government should have regulated adoption. They should have allowed it only when it was absolutely certain that the children were given away freely, he said.
He added the petition was based on Dutch laws, International Treaties, and human rights. So far, around 25 persons have extended support to the petition.
Another Sri Lankan adoptee, Dilani Butink said she was also considering the available possibilities of suing the Dutch government, in a separate lawsuit.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror, Prof. Dr. Rene Hoksbergen, Emeritus Professor on adoption at the Utrecht University, who has raised the issue of irregularities in inter-country adoption publicly since 1979, said that both the Dutch government and Sri Lankan government should be held responsible for the irregularities.
Last year, Health Minister, Rajitha Senaratne admitted in a Dutch television documentary that there had been baby farms during the 1980s. He promised to launch an investigation and set up a DNA bank.
According to the Ministry of Justice and Security of The Netherlands since 1970, 3,418 children have been adopted to the Netherlands from Sri Lanka. (By Amra Ismail)

Johann Peries encounters high altitude and heavy snowfall on the first leg of his mission to scale M
	
Johann at Everest Base Camp
Eager to make his country proud, the brave son of Sri Lanka, Johann Peries has commenced his second attempt to scale Mount Everest. In the latest update on his exciting journey as he is cheered on by fellow Sri Lankans, he is making steady progress, surmounting challenges of high altitude and extreme cold. There has been an overwhelming response to the Climb Everest with Johann campaign, which invites Sri Lankans to sponsor each step that Johann takes on the mountain for Rs.100 to participate in this exhilarating climb to the summit. An Everest expedition requires a large financial commitment and every step sponsored goes towards financing the expedition. Johann has dedicated this expedition to all Sri Lankans. The legendary mountain lures climbers of various nationalities to explore it and affords some of the most testing physical challenges on this earth.
In the latest news from the snow-clad Himalayas, Johann left Sri Lanka on 4th April for Kathmandu, where he spent a couple of days meeting up with and preparing with his team for the climb. After ensuring the necessary equipment was in place, the heavier equipment was sent by air onto Lukla where it will be transported by yaks to Everest Base Camp.
Initially he flew from Kathmandu into Lukla, 2,860m, one of the most challenging airports in the world. On 7th April, Johann commenced the arduous climb. The first stop for the night was Phakding before commencing a steep climb the next day to Namche Bazaar at 3,440m.
The ascent to Namche Bazaar was followed by a two-day stop consisting of a tough acclimatization climb, a rest and a recovery day. Acclimatization climbs are performed by climbing up to a higher altitude, staying there briefly, and then returning to a lower altitude to sleep. With altitude, the air becomes thinner - the saturation of oxygen declines and the body has to produce more red blood cells to manage the thinner air. This will be true for the rest of the climb.
Thereafter, Johann proceeded to Tengboche, 3,860m, where he visited the famous Tengboche monastery and temple. Here, he received a formal blessing for the remainder of the journey. Onwards to Pengboche, 3,895m, for another night, he encountered significant snowfall and extreme cold.
From Pengboche, he pressed on to Pheriche, at 4,371m. Here, they had another rest and acclimatization day to recover. After 4,000m, the effects of altitude are more significant, with climbers often experiencing various signs of altitude sickness including headaches and nausea.
After Pheriche, Johann proceeded to Lobuche to climb the famous Lobuche Peak. This is a particularly difficult acclimatization climb, up to an altitude of 6,119m. He is presently on that climb, a three-day climb during which communication is cut off. Climbing Mount Everest is an accomplishment that bestows a rare distinction - not only on the climber but also on the country he hails from.
Having been in training since December 2016, Johann is technically equipped to undertake this expedition. He is no stranger to this act of courage. Johann Peries and Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala were the first Sri Lankans to attempt to summit the peak of 8,848m above sea level in April 2016. Although Jayanthi became the first Sri Lankan to scale the summit of Mt Everest, Johann managed to reach a height of 8,400m, a mere 448m short of reaching the summit, before technical difficulties forced him to descend.

The Police officers investigating the CCTV camera footage on the Mirissa assault, spotted to their amazement a big-wig Cabinet politico from the Blue Party leaving the sand-filled premises of the Surf Bar, half an hour before the incident took place.

They werent amazed however, to find the same politico up in arms against the Coastal Conservation Department which ordered all illegal entities in Mirissa be removed by May 1. The CCD took this decision to ensure safety in the area after thousands of victims used the social media to vent their anger at what had taken place over the years, following media attention to the attack on the Dutch Tourists.
Many tourists and locals detailed the horrid experiences at the Bar in question and Mirissa in general. Beach bums were allowed to harass us, was the cry from all quarters, going back a few years.
Does the Politico have a business interest or any other interest at the sordid terrain. Surely crying against doing what is lawful cant be all that innocent in Paradise land!!!!hmmm

While stating that the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) is against the proposal of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to remove the executive presidency, General Secretary of the PHU Upul Wijesekara said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was behind the JVPs proposal.
Addressing a news conference, he said premier Wickremesinghe anticipated centralizing executive powers unto his purview by making use of the abolishment of the executive presidency.
It is obvious that the Prime Minister is acting according to the agendas of the foreign countries. Premier Wickremesinghe is now bit struggling to act upon the foreign countries as he lacks the executive powers. Once the executive presidency is removed PM would be eagerly waiting to run the country in accordance with the whims and fancies of the foreign countries, Mr. Wijesekara said.
He said political experts should be consulted in this regard and should see whether it would be worthwhile to the country.
Meanwhile, deputy leader of the PHU Madumadawa Aravinda said there is a visible confrontation in the JVP due to what transpired after the No-Confidence brought against Premier Wickremesinghe.
Although the JVP came to a unanimous decision that they would vote against the PM, some members were not that much in favour of the decision. Consequently, one group of the JVP is with K. D. Lal Kantha whereas another group is with the JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Madumadawa said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara today said that necessary action is already in place to bring in wanted, high profile individuals like Udayanga Weeratunga and Arjuna Mahendran back to the country, who have found refuge in foreign countries.
The minister said the International Police is assisting the local law enforcement bodies to bring these suspects to the country and have so far issued Red Warrants upon the latters requests.
He confirmed that Udayanga Weeratunga had been arrested in Dubai, and an initial process is underway to bring him back with the consent of the UAE authorities.
We have made a request to the UAE authorities to extradite him for investigation purposes. Also we are discussing with the Interpol and Singaporean authorities to find and apprehend Arjuna Mahendran."
The Minister addressing a special media briefing said, though there is a considerable delay in the police probes in the corruption cases of the previous regime, action would be taken to expedite the legal process under his guidance.
The Minister said that he has a responsibility to work in line with the vision of the Yahapalana government, when bringing the culprits of the large scale financial crimes to book and expedite the legal process.
The police are continuously conducting their investigations on these crimes, but we admit there is a considerable delay in bringing the culprits before the law, when it concerns special probing bodies like the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division.
A number of files relating to completed investigations await legal action at the Attorney General's Department, which should be expedited through a special legal system.
We know there is a slow progress in the judicial system when finalizing these cases and that is why the present government intends to introduce a special judicial system to expedite these particular large-scale financial frauds, the Minister said.
Meanwhile, IGP Pujith Jayasundara said although Udayanga Weeratunga was arrested in Dubai, he should be brought back to the country to conduct relevant investigations, including recording statements from him.
However, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said that it has been easier to negotiate with the Singaporean authorities than the Dubai officials, as the former co-ordinate with the Interpol. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Polls this year if approved by Parliament: EC
	
Elections Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said today if Parliament approves the delimitation report on Provincial Councils within a month, then his office would be in a position to hold elections to six provincial councils this year.
He said if all the chips fall into place, the elections for the North-Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provinces could be held before the end of this year.
Mr. Deshappriya told a media conference the term of office of North-Western, Central and Northern Provincial Councils would in September and as such holding the elections to the six PCs before December 15 would not be a problem for the EC.
It is a great impediment for democracy and the yahapalana concept if conducting of elections to the PCs continues to be postponed. It is the responsibility of all those concerned to agitate and build up public opinion to hold the elections on time. I believe Parliament will clear the remaining roadblocks with the assistance of all political parties, he said. "If Parliament fails to pass the delimitation report, the Prime Minister has the power to appoint a review committee to go through the delimitation report and make recommendations. Based on the recommendation that the future PC polls should be conducted on a 50% on the first past the post system and 50% on the proportional representative system, a new delimitation report has to be prepared in a short period of time and pass it. Failed all these attempts, the last resort is to abolish the new electoral system through a Parliamentary Act and hold the PC polls under the old system.".
Mr. Deshapriya said if the government resorted to any of these measures and paved the way for to hold polls for the six PCs, the EC was ready to call nominations by October 2 and hold the elections before the December GCE O/L examination. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Addressing a news briefing, he said the government needs to pay back the funds of the Treasury bonds and bills before the date of termination and that they were short of funds to do so.
It is with responsibility that I say the Central Bank doesnt possess sufficient funds to pay back the Treasury bonds and bills before the deadline expires. It has already suspended the release of funds for this purpose, MP Gunawardana charged.

The Ernest Poruthota story
	
I dont really know who or what I am  agnostic or atheist  but I do know that the secular and the divine can and do coexist, even with the involvement of the clergy, and that the clergy, especially of today, do try to bring the two together in every possible way. Nevertheless, I am not a big fan of the robe and the cassock, regardless of whatever religious sect and denomination, because of various reasons I wont delve into here. That is why I am heartened at those who choose to go beyond their vocation while remaining in it, and that by propagating that most divine of all secular activities, the moving image, or the cinema. Ernest Poruthota, who turns 87 this August, has in that sense been an unusual priest.
Some people deserve more than a sketchy recounting of their biographies. Father Poruthota, Ive come to realise, is one of them. So here goes, and so help me God.
He was born Raymond Ernest Alexander Poruthota in the village of Marawila in the Puttalam District. His father had taught at the time at the Government Teachers College in Maggona before being transferred, as part of a disciplinary procedure, to Marawila. His son studied at the Marawila Boys School, and later at St Xaviers College, and he was not quite 12 when his parents, both staunch Catholics, decided that his vocation lay in the Church. So they packed me off to the Borella Seminary, he chortles silently. I asked him whether he agreed with their choice of career for him, and he readily says Yes I did! Not that he cut himself off from the secular world: I was always enthralled by the arts.

The year was 1942. He had joined the Seminary and was witnessing the horrors of the War as it unfolded in Colombo, along with the protests and the calls made for independence everywhere. Apparently he and his colleagues had been taken on compulsory walks around what is now Independence Avenue
The year was 1942. He had joined the Seminary and was witnessing the horrors of the War as it unfolded in Colombo, along with the protests and the calls made for independence everywhere. Apparently he and his colleagues had been taken on compulsory walks around what is now Independence Avenue, and what was back then Torrington Square. In 1948, having gone on one such walk, young Poruthota came across the unveiling of the National Flag at the official handing over of our independence. I was so awed by the grandeur and the sense of majesty of the whole event, more than the cultural significance of it all. What appealed to me were the decorations, the colours, the liveliness among all those who were gathered there. When we returned to Borella, I set about replicating those decorations using crepe paper. This was, he informed me, on account of the artist struggling to get out of him at that point: I just couldnt stop it.
Those who know the man and those who have heard of him would contend that he forayed intensely into the cinema. They are correct. On the other hand, Ive always wondered how it was that a man of the cloth, with all the restrictions that religious institutions usually place on their members, was allowed to indulge in such a plebeian and secular art form. I asked this from the man himself, and he was ready to explain. Films were, of course, forbidden at the Seminary. By an irony of fate however, the Church did sanction us going into the theatres, provided that what we watched were Christian big budget religious epics.
I put to him that given the preponderance of such epics in the American cinema, he and his colleagues would have imbibed DeMille, Wyler, and a horde of other such filmmakers. He agrees. We revelled in such films as The Song of Bernadette, Quo Vadis, The Ten Commandments, and of course Ben Hur. In later years, he would of course graduate to other directors, although his love for religious themes never evaded him. That probably explains his love for Bergman, Dreyer, and Bresson, three of the most spiritual artistes the cinema ever bred.
His contribution to our cinema in later years, one can hardly deny, was immense. He called for an indigenous cinema. He wrote. He critiqued. He had his champions and he had his critics. Some argued that a man of the Church should not engage with the secular world. In the end, however, he was vindicated. Not only was a book of his, Chitrapati Gana (An Aesthetic Evaluation of the Cinema), published in 1965 and read widely, his campaign for a national film awards ceremony overseen by the Catholic Church was affirmed when he was appointed as the first National Director of the OCIC (which later morphed into SIGNIS).
What of his other achievements He was a founding member of the Film Critics and Journalists Association of Sri Lanka, formed in 1968. Before he became its National Director, he was also the founder of the Sri Lanka Branch of the OCIC. There probably are a great many other such laurels he can claim, but I leave the task of explicating on them to the ardent fan and meticulous biographer.
I am more interested in his views on the arts. I ask him as to whether he agrees with the thesis (forwarded by critics like Harold Bloom and, closer to home, my friend Dhanuka Bandara) that a work should be judged in terms of its inherent aesthetic merit, and not content. He disagrees. First and foremost, a play, a film, or even a book must spiritually elevate its rasikaya. In fact that is the main criterion we have at SIGNIS. I put to him here that even secular works of art, authored by atheists and humanists, have merit which can hardly be attributed to spirituality. Being the mild-tempered man he is, he agrees, with a caveat: If a work is not religiously inclined, it must at least have a human element.

The last time I checked on Father Poruthota, he was Parish Priest at the Lunawa Church in Moratuwa. This was in 2014. Hes still there. Retired in all but name, and battling on the way as best he can
From here I move on to a theme that has arguably engaged him the most over the years: censorship. Given his lifelong and austere stand on the matter, I am not surprised by his views, which even brought him into conflict with the Church. The man clearly practices what he preaches, as seen in how he went to watch films as a seminarian: We were neither allowed nor forbidden to watch films. I went to see them unsure of whether they were allowed for a would-be priest. This was true especially in the 1960s, when we had many European directors revolutionising the cinema as we knew it then thanks to the so-called New Wave. Morals and conventions of any sort were being defied and that became more or less the norm. Clearly, they were hardly congruent with what the Church deemed as good films. Nevertheless, I saw them. And how!
The last time I checked on Father Poruthota, he was Parish Priest at the Lunawa Church in Moratuwa. This was in 2014. Hes still there. Retired in all but name, and battling on the way as best he can. I remember a tribute to him penned by Professor Anton Meemana in which the latter observed that while several parishioners, aware of his penchant for flouting convention, welcoming him with the graffiti Viplawakaraya Apata Epa (We do not need the revolutionary). If this is true (and I think it is), its an enduring testament to the mans character that he has not let scenes and episodes like that ruffle his calm demeanour. 87 years, you must admit, is not an easy age to reconcile yourself to, and this gentle giant, beloved by followers of his faith as well as agnostics like myself, has taught us that censorship, be it in the name of the State or the Church, cannot thrive where the arts flourish, if at all because the arts, as I mentioned before, happen to be the most divine of all secular activities. It takes us closer to God, Father Poruthota would have said. Being an agnostic, I would nevertheless have agreed. Heartily.

The Green Bereted Superheroes
	
Growing up as a war-child of the unfortunate generation that experienced a 30 year long conflict throughout our childhood and early youth, the STF for me was always the green bereted men, riding motorbikes with rifles slung over their shoulders. Watching the evening news, which was a daily must in any household throughout these dark years, the image of the STF that was drawn in our minds was of those who could do what others failed to.
35 years since its inception, the countrys elite para-military unit of the Sri Lanka Police, the Special Task Force - commonly known by its acronym STF  has grown to perhaps the most specialized and versatile outfits of the island nation. Commemorating this remarkable milestone is a compilation of photographs in a form of a coffee table book titled Special Task Force 1983  2018: Celebrating 35 Years of Service to our Motherland.
The STF was thebrainchild of Captain Ravi Jayawardene, the intelligent and progressive former first son of Sri Lanka, and proudly bears its ensign and motto of Victory Assured. It was primarily formed to counter terrorist activities, which were not only growing in frequency in the early 1980s, but were also becoming widespread and taking the form of guerilla tactics. A highly skilled specialized unit was the need of the hour. From this initiation until present, the book chronologically documents the growth of the STF in photographs.
The black and white, and the sepia images record the Early Years to the initial Eelamconflict; the primary trainings by the British ex-SAS officers on military field craft, counter-terrorism search, handling explosives and first aid. Interesting is the blend of action images together with official group photos and pictures of the soldiers in-between operations. The camps located in the Eastern part of Sri Lanka, which was the stronghold of the STF, come to life together with photographs of post-terrorist acts, explosions, seized weapons and vehicles. Key moments in the history of STF such as the extension of the Eastern Command Centre to the South to clear the LTTE infiltration into the Yala Wildlife Sanctuary as well as relegation of the STF at the arrival of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) are documented in images.
During the second Eelamconflict,the STF continued to safeguard the East, even training during the ceasefire with the aim of bettering themselves in the path to indelibility. An image that made one curious was of a foreign gymnastic team with the soldiers, which turned out to be an innovative twist to training by the late SSP Upali Sahabandu who brought this team of gymnasts to train the STF in enhancing their responsive capacities, which is pivotal in combat operations.
The pictures do not only speak of the victories. They also document the hardships these gallant soldiers underwent, of the many nights spent without a shelter above, of the strenuous days in the jungle with the bare minimum. A photograph bears witness to the unit undergoing training by the Veddas to survive in the forest. Turn to page 145 and one comes across an image of a row of pumpkins cut in half, very commonplace at first glance, but look closer and you find that inside it are arms and explosives; one of the many ingenious ways adopted by the terrorists to smuggle arms and explosives from the North and East to the South of Sri Lanka.
Beyond the Eelamconflict operations, the photographs bear witness to the growth of the STF, to an elite unit handling VVIP security, controlling hostage and riot situations as well as seizing narcotics. With the regaining of peace, the unit has sharpened its skills and even boasts of the first Para Jumper in the 150 years history of the Sri Lanka Police.
Such and more are the photographs, some perhaps obtained from personal ownership, that weave the collage of the proud 35 year long history of the STF. The book ends appropriately with Robert Laurence Binyons Ode of Rememberance : Lest We Forget, a tribute to the heroes who had made the ultimate sacrifice during the three-decade long conflict, and profile photos of each one of them;
They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn;
At the going down of the sun, and in the morning,
We will remember them.

## Title: The 16 SLFPers vow to expose frauds in Govt.

The 16 SLFPers vow to expose frauds in Govt.
	
Former Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today the 16 former SLFP ministers, state and deputy ministers who quit the yahapalana government would soon expose the frauds and misdeeds of the members of the government.
When asked why they were now going public with these allegations, he said they were earlier bound by collective Cabinet responsibility and the concept of decency and therefore were not in a position to expose the wrongdoings of the SLFP and UNP members in the Cabinet.
The MP said the SLFP Central Committee was expected to meet last night at the official residence of President Maithripala Sirisena and approve their stance on this matter.
When asked why these 16 SLFPers voted for the no-confidence motion having been members of this government for more than two years, he said it was the SLFP that made every effort to highlight the Central Bank bond scam.
It was the UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera who first complained to the Bribery Commission about the bond scam. Then we were instrumental in urging the President to appoint a 11-member parliamentary committee to probe the scandal. The no-confidence motion was based on the recommendations of that committee, the MP said.
He said the meeting between the President and three members of the group of 16 SLFP MPs in London was a success, the MP said the discussions were focused on the future of the SLFP and that of the 16 former SLFP ministers, state and deputy ministers.
He told a media conference the three SLFPers had informed the President that they would sit as an independent group in Parliament from May 8 when it is re-convened.
The 16 of us will sit in Parliament as an independent SLFP group under the President. Despite speculation by certain media groups, none of us would join the UNP or the SLPP. But I hope a number of UNP members will join us on the 8th, the MP said.
He said the sole objective of the SLFP rebel group was to topple the yahapalana government before 2020 or form a SLFP government after the 2020 general election. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The transfer rendered her homeless
	

A story that has gone viral in political circles says that a certain governing one was compelled to vacate her official residence unexpectedly in the night before the day she was due to proceed to another province on transfer.

A close a kinsman of the governing one is said to have been behind the predicament caused to the latter.
The governing one had got a jolt when her successor along with his family regiment had suddenly turned up at her official residence in the night and pressed her to move out immediately for they had come prepared to move in.
An exasperated governing one had quit the residence saying, Okay, I am leaving to spend the rest of the night in the street if need be, but am not removing any of my personal effects.
The governing one later had to suffer insult added to injury when she found the outgoing colleague at the new station was still staying pat in the official residence. So, the poor one is said to be occupying the official residence of the chief purohita of the province until her official residence is vacated, they say.

UNODC launches Global Judicial Integrity Network
	
After two years of planning, seven regional preparatory meetings and consultations with some 4,000 judges, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) launched its Global Judicial Integrity Network this week in the presence of Chief Justices, senior judges and judicial professionals from around the world. The two-day launch gave over 350 attendants the opportunity to discuss key topics with peers from other Member States, and to present recommendations on strengthening judicial integrity at the global level. 
The network is a platform for judges to share good practices and lessons learned, to support each other and to join forces in developing new tools and guidelines for strengthening integrity and preventing corruption in the judicial system. As such, it will also provide access to a large online database featuring thousands of resources, good practices and other judicial documents for immediate reference.
Participants were greeted by a video message by Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, saying: This network brings together lead institutions responsible for upholding the rule of law, and as such for attaining peace and justice. Her welcome remarks were echoed in UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotovs message, who added: Judges need the opportunity to share experiences, exchange good practices and support each other. The network will continue to serve as a resource for addressing new and emerging challenges, such as those posed by social media and other technological developments.
Chief and senior justices from Austria, Brazil, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria and the United States addressed the opening session, declaring their support for the network. Chief Justice Walter Samuel Nkanu Onnoghen of Nigeria stressed that the network could not have come at a better time, adding: It is time to develop global measures and mechanisms for the attainment and sustenance of the prescribed integrity. Accepted global standards and measures have persuasive force. They empower national champions of judicial integrity, providing ready tools and weapons.
Justice Elisabeth Lovrek, Vice-President of Austrias Supreme Court, which co-hosted with the Supreme Judicial Council of Qatar a social event at the beautiful Palace of Justice in Vienna, found the platforms very launching in Vienna to be a positive indicator: The network will strengthen judicial cooperation among courts and tribunals from different legal and cultural traditions. In an increasingly globalised world, this is more important than ever.

The network is a platform for judges to share good practices and lessons learned, to support each other and to join forces in developing new tools and guidelines for strengthening integrity and preventing corruption in the judicial system
In addition to the representation from numerous judiciaries from around the world, there was strong support and participation from global institutions and judicial associations. The first plenary session on the networks specific role in promoting judicial integrity was addressed by Diego Garca-Sayn, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Christophe Rgnard, President of the International Association of Judges, and Judge Rudolf Mellinghoff, President of the Federal Court of Finance of Germany and Member of the Judicial Integrity Group, which is the group of judges that initiated the dialogue on corruption in the justice system in 2000 and developed the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct.
This first gathering of the network spent the better part of two days discussing and seeking solutions for some of the key challenges confronting judiciaries today; this included undue political interference by the executive and legislature into judicial appointments and decisions, reducing budgets in the face of exploding caseloads and corruption in the justice sector and diminishing public confidence. Substantive thematic breakout sessions covered an array of measures to help judiciaries tackle those challenges, such as developing codes of conduct, establishing functioning disciplinary bodies and proceedings, balancing accountability and independence, assessing integrity in the justice system, introducing financial disclosure rules for judges, educating judges on the use of social media, enhancing transparency and the impact of digitalization on judicial integrity, judicial appointments and judicial training.
Speaking at the closing session, David Maraga, Chief Justice of Kenya, commented: This launch gives us an opportunity to keep reflecting on our performance because it means a lot to our various countries. The buck stops with us, especially those of us who are in leadership.
The participants endorsed, by acclamation, the Terms of Reference of the Global Judicial Integrity Network, which outline its mission statement, objectives, participation and organisation of work. The terms also specify the role of the Secretariat (carried out by UNODC) and that of the Advisory Board, which will help identify priority challenges and emerging topics in judicial integrity and assist judiciaries in addressing those challenges as they arise. The first members of the board, elected by the Secretariat based on their active engagement in advancing judicial integrity, are:
Adrian Saunders: President-elect of the Caribbean Court of Justice, Chairman of the Caribbean Association of Judicial Officers
Duro Sessa: President of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Croatia, President of the Consultative Council of European Judges
Masood Bin Muhammad Al-Ameri: Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Council, Qatar
Maria Theresa Moura: Minister of the Superior Court of Justice in Brazil, Director-General of the Brazilian National Magistrates School
Zainun Ali: Judge of the Federal Court, Malaysia
KashimZannah: Chief Judge, High Court of Borno State, Nigeria
Nihal Jayawickrama: Coordinator of the Judicial Integrity Group
Jose Igreja Matos: Judge, Court of Appeal, Porto, Portugal, President of the European Association of Judges, and Vice President of the International Association of Judges.
Lynne Leitch: Justice, Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Representative of the Commonwealth Magistrates and Judges Association, Chair of the Associations Gender Section
Diego Garcia-Sayan: UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers
The conference concluded with the adoption, by acclamation, of the declaration on judicial integrity and the invitation by Masoud Mohamed Alameri, Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Council of Qatar, to hold the networks next conference in Qatar. Addressing the participants, Chief Justice Alameri stressed: We should remember that our efforts are of historic value to us, as it will be the first purely judicial project connecting and bringing together the worlds judicial authorities under the auspices of the United Nations.
The meeting was closed by Dimitri Vlassis, Chief of the UNODC Crime and Corruption Branch, who congratulated participants on the fruitful and constructive spirit of the discussions, commenting: The Global Judicial Integrity Network is an initiative of paramount importance in strengthening judicial integrity and preventing corruption in the justice system. This meeting has given consideration to numerous crucial issues and has shown the need to come together and help one another in addressing them. It will be an honour to work with you all as we continue to encourage other judiciaries and stakeholders to join us on this important journey.

The UNP politburo will meet today at Temple Trees to discuss the methodology to be followed when electing the main officer bearers and the names of those to be selected to these posts, a politburo member told Daily Mirror.
It was reported that there was a suggestion during the previous meeting that the three key posts General Secretary, National Organizer and the Chairman should be decided through a ballot. However other sources said there was another proposal that the general secretary and other posts should be appointed in the usual way and the party leader should also have a say in it.
The working committee and the politburo will meet on Thursday to take the final decisions on re-organising the party. (Yohan Perera)

UNP shouldnt move  far from its policies in implementing reforms - Dr. Harsha de Silva
	
Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva speaks about the proposed reforms of the United National Party (UNP) and the current status of politics in the country.
The excerpts:- 
Q :After the electoral defeat at the local government elections, you were talking about far reaching political reforms to the party. How do you specify the kinds of reforms you seek
I think the UNPers plus the moderates who decide at an election wish to see major changes in the party. At the end of day, it is the choice they make, that matters. We do not see people coming forward in politics. Unfortunately, that is the reality today because people do not want to be abused like this. Today, be it in the regular media or social media, people are attacked on baseless grounds. Why would people want to leave their comfortable lives in their fields and come forward, only to be abused finally What is the point 
In that sense, we do not have the people with calibre, coming forward. Therefore, we have to choose among the people we have. I think, among the different political parties, the UNP has a fair number of decent, educated, professional people. They are a lot that can make a difference to this nation. 
Q :Are you trying to say that people look to non-traditional politicians
Yes. There are technocrats in the UNP. If you look at party-wise, that is true. 

I think the UNPers plus the moderates who decide at an election wish to see major changes in the party. At the end of day, it is the choice they make, that matters. We do not see people coming forward in politics
Q :What do you think of the kind of responsibilities given to such technocrats
Unfortunately, I do not see that those types of people have been given responsibilities. If you compare the UNP with the other parties such as SLPP and SLFP, you can clearly see we have a good crop of these people.
They are not tainted by accusations of murder, robberies, or any other criminal acts. They had been successful in society even before coming to politics. They have come to politics with a lot of experience. That is what matters. In a company even, you must be successful in projects you do. You must be able to understand problems and find solutions.
If you look at the Cabinets in the United States, China, Singapore or Canada, there are people who are technocrats and professionals. 
Q :Are you trying to say that the present lot of office bearers in the UNP should be replaced with technocrats and professionals
In the world, there is a move towards non-traditional politicians. In Sri Lanka, if you look at the movement currently being created to promote former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is part of that. What is the message 
It is not just happening only in Sri Lanka. It is happening in France and elsewhere in the world. Why are people moving towards non-traditional politicians They are sick of traditional politicians. What are they doing They are a self-serving bunch of people. We have to appeal to the middle of society. It does not matter to the hardcore party men. It is the middle class that will decide based on their expectations.
In the UNP also, what people expect is a more dynamic, modern and younger set-up. Our policies are solid. We are for an inclusive society where every person is equal, and has equal rights. We stand for social-market economy.
These are the fundamental principles that the UNP stands for. 
Q :Does it mean that there is no need for a departure from the fundamental policies your party followed during the last three years
I do not think our policies were implemented on the ground in the proper sense. 

People who manipulate the Buddhas teachings for political gains are not real Buddhists. Ours is a non-violent religion. We wish well for every living being
Q :You followed certain policies like the reform agenda and all. Do you think that the UNP should stick to that line further
We need to fine-tune some of the policies. Some of the policies have been misunderstood and ill-implemented. I do not think we have been able to implement on the ground the real social market economic policies. That is due to the conflict within the coalition in understanding what we need to do. Perhaps, some of the reforms may need to be implemented much more slowly than the pace the government attempted to do during the last three years. That does not mean we must not do the reforms. 
For the very first time in the history of this country, I am undertaking an analysis of pension of 1.4 million people. It has never been done. We are sitting on a time bomb. Pension reforms are one thing that is absolutely essential. People are scared to talk about it. We have to create a national pension scheme. We need to understand the liabilities of unfunded pension. We will never be able to give pension to government servants in the way we do now. People will not talk about for political expediency. The core UNP ideology is that we must create a social market economy. We have not been able to implement that properly. What you currently see is a mismatch. In the party, the policies are solid. I do not think we need to move too far from them. People are looking for changes in the persons. 
Q :The UNP advocated power sharing as a means to solve the ethnic conflict. What do you think about this policy
We should never be ashamed of who we are. I am proud to be a Sinhalese. I am proud to be a Buddhist. A Tamil following Hinduism should feel the same. A Muslim person following Islam should be proud of his identity. As a nation, we should have the space to be proud of to our ethnic and religious identities. There is a perception though, that the UNP has been giving step-motherly treatment to the Sinhala Buddhist community. This perception is a manifestation of a well-planned, calculated effort by our political opponents to malign us in the eyes of the majority community. Our policy of not responding to such critics has really damaged our real thinking. 
Q :Once your partys former Chairman Malik Samarawickrama said the UNP stood for secularism. What is your view
The JR Jayewardene Constitution gave the foremost place to Buddhism. The Constitution of a country is bigger than the Constitution of a party. It is our leader who made that constitution. There is no need to wear away from that position. The UNP consists of all ethnicities and religions. We are not a racist party. We do not support hatred among regions. For me, every religion and ethnicity is the same. That is what the Buddha said. He never said, Kill in the name of Buddhism. People who manipulate the Buddhas teachings for political gains are not real Buddhists. Ours is a non-violent religion. We wish well for every living being. 
Q :Already, some party stalwarts such as Kabir Hashim and Malik Samarawickrama have stepped down. Who should succeed them in your view
The party and its Working Committee are considering many names. Hopefully, we will have a new set of office bearers who will help moderate people think that the UNP has right people and right policies. 

The Constitution of a country is bigger than the Constitution of a party. It is our leader who made that constitution. There is no need to wear away from that position. The UNP consists of all ethnicities and religions. We are not a racist party. We do not support hatred among regions
Q :When you say a new set of office bearers, does it include the party leader
The current thinking is that the office bearers should be changed. I do not think the posts of leader, deputy leader and assistant leader are to be changed. I do not know. I am not in the 12-member group working on reforms. 
Q :You have been excluded from this group. Do you feel being sidelined
Well, that was done by a secret ballot. I have no comment on that. Some people have been elected. It is a good committee. I am sure that committee will take into consideration the views of both the groups of MPs. I believe they will be independent enough to propose a good set of names. I have confidence in the committee. 
Q ;As far as the next Presidential Election is concerned, who should be the UNP candidate
Will there be a presidential election 
Q :Yes, as per the Constitution....
We came to office to abolish presidency. 
Q :But still, there is no document in hand... isnt it
We will cross that river when we get there. In my mind, we came to abolish the executive presidency. That is what we promised to do. I hear everyone is in favour of doing it.

Van strikes pedestrians in Toronto, 10 killed
	
A rented van plowed down a crowded Toronto sidewalk Monday, killing 10 people and injuring 15 before the driver fled and was quickly arrested in a confrontation with police, Canadian authorities said.
Toronto Police Chief Mark Suanders said the incident appeared to have been deliberate. Saunders made the comment at a news conference Monday night hours after the van killed 10 people and left 15 more hospitalized. The driver had fled but was surrounded by police and detained.
"The incident definitely looked deliberate," Saunders said.
Saunders identified the man detained after the incident as Alek Minassian, 25, a resident of the Toronto suburb of Richmond Hill.
Authorities released few details in the case, saying the investigation was still underway, with witnesses being interviewed and surveillance video being examined.
"I can assure the public all our available resources have been brought in to investigate this tragic situation," Toronto Police Services Deputy Chief Peter Yuen said earlier. (Chicago Tribune)

We will try to  get control of SLFP  -Dayasiri-
	
Former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara, in an interview with Daily mirror , spells as to how the No Confidence Motion [NCM] got defeated in Parliament. He shared the following:-
Q :The President once said the NCM against PM Ranil Wickremesinghe was mooted by the Joint Opposition [JO], a section of SLFP and a faction of the UNP. He tried to absolve himself of any responsibility. What happened actually
Actually, the idea to bring such a motion originated primarily from the UNP itself. A UNP team that included members like Minister Palitha Range Bandara vowed to move such a motion. He said there were 27 persons who were supportive of it. It is true that a section of our SLFP insisted on joining hands with the opposition. After the local government polls, I, along with MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna, made a concept paper. We stressed the point that we could no longer run a government with Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister.
Secondly, we said we would agree to appoint anyone from the UNP other than him as the PM. Thirdly, we proposed to appoint Nimal Siripala de Silva as the PM. But, the Presidents hands were legally tightened. He could not remove the current Premier as a result. Ranil Wickremesinghe asserted that he wished to remain the PM further amidst all these developments. We, all the 41 members, took the position that Mr. Wickremesinghe should step down. We communicated our stand to the PM. Against this backdrop only, the JO moved this NCM. The JVP also agreed to this motion. The JVP, in fact, asked for the inclusion of certain points. In that sense, there were three parties that backed the motion in its initial stages. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera remained privy to all the negotiations. However, Minister Duminda Dissanayake had a different view right from the beginning. 
The SLFP, as a party, wanted the NCM to succeed. I do not agree if anybody says that only a section of the party wanted it. The President remained neutral because he did not want to violate the Constitution by removing the PM in his own. 
Q :Your colleague referred to Ministers Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake as tale bearers who leaked confidential information to the PM. You said Minister Amaraweera was privy to all the talks. Do you also see him as a tale bearer
I do not accuse him of being a tale-bearer. However, Duminda Dissanayake took a common line with the UNP. Though he is the SLFP General Secretary, he worked in the interests of the UNP. That is why we were unable to revive the SLFP at grassroots level. He did not campaign actively for the local government elections in the Anuradhapura District. Yet, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera stood with us right from the beginning. I am thankful to him. He had a change of mind at the last moment only regarding the no confidence motion. 
We, all the 41 members, took the position that Mr. Wickremesinghe should step down. We communicated our stand to the PM. Against this backdrop only, the JO moved this NCM. The JVP also agreed to this motion. The JVP, in fact, asked for the inclusion of certain points. In that sense, there were three parties that backed the motion in its initial stages
Q :Only 16 members, including you, voted for the motion whereas 21 members were absent. Why did the President as the party leader fail to reconcile differences in the party
The President did not get involved in this directly. He wanted to remove the PM, though. He realized that there were two factions. He wanted the party to take a common stand. There were three factions in fact. There was one group wanting to join the UNP straight away, and another to Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). Let alone, there was the third group wanting to build the SLFP. I always asked the President not to leave the room for the party to be split into three groups in this way.

Right from the beginning, we realized that five or six of our MPs would not vote for the motion. Albeit them, we had the initial support of 18 MPs from the UNP. We had separate talks with all of them. We undertook this mission well realizing that six SLFPers including Duminda Dissanayake would not support us for sure.
Otherwise, all the others including Minister Amaraweera had taken a decision to support the motion. Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe and Gamini Vijith Wijayamuni Zoysa did not attend the last meeting. 
The President was compelled finally to make sure that the SLFP would at least be absent. That is because some of our members planned to vote along with the UNP. 

Q :Finally, the SLFP government group is now divided into two. Where will this trend end up
It will lead to a dozen of the SLFPers in the government teaming up the UNP. 
Q :Can you name them
I do not want to name them individually. But, there is a group definitely wanting to join the UNP. They have been offered the UNP organizer posts. There is another group of SLFPers who will join us at the next stage. We will not become an appendage to the JO, though. We asked the President to offer us the General Secretary post of the SLFP and the Secretary post of the SLFP-led UPFA. Then only, we can revive the party at village level. There is no future for the party as long as it remains as the cats paw of the UNP. It became obvious at the local government elections. We got some votes. That has also dwindled at the moment. If these two posts are continuously held by those serving in the government, the party will be ruined forever. 

Right from the beginning, we realized that five or six of our MPs would not vote for the motion. Albeit them, we had the initial support of 18 MPs from the UNP. We had separate talks with all of them
Q :What was the Presidents response to your request
The President was clear in his stance that there should be a change. It is important for us to know how he will bring about that change. A majority of the SLFP Central Committee holds the view that the party should leave the unity government. Otherwise, the SLFP will end up as a branch of the UNP. The SLFP Central Committee is meant to protect the party. It is not meant to be a mere appendage of the UNP.
Q :After sitting in the opposition, what is your next plan
We will collaborate with the JO in the struggles against the government. It does not mean that we will become party to the JO. We maintain our SLFP identity. On common issues, we will cooperate fully and add strength to the JO. We are like brothers. Those serving in the JO are members of the UPFA. No one has taken the membership of the SLPP. 
Q :What is your plan for the next Presidential Election
We have to work for a common candidate acceptable to all the communities. He should be a charismatic leader. He should have a vision for the country. He should be able to win over the minorities. It is difficult to forge ahead without the support of the minorities. He should present a work plan to address the issue confronting the minorities. We have to resurrect the future President from the grip of extremist forces. 
Any future leader cannot forge ahead without addressing the problems of the people in the North. We defeated the LTTE militarily. Now the struggle is to defeat it ideologically. 
Q :Have you identified that candidate
There are different names being mooted. We can discuss it later. 
Q :Finally, the UNPers who wanted to support the NCM backtracked at the last moment. Why did it happen
We told them to do so. We asked them not to risk their political future. Initially, we thought only six SLFPers would stand in solidarity with the UNP. Finally, we knew that a lot more would work against the motion. As such, we were in for a failed mission. So, we asked them not to be a part of such a failed political project. These rebel UNP MPs willrise again.

The President was clear in his stance that there should be a change. It is important for us to know how he will bring about that change. A majority of the SLFP Central Committee holds the view that the party should leave the unity government. Otherwise, the SLFP will end up as a branch of the UNP. The SLFP Central Committee is meant to protect the party. It is not meant to be a mere appendage of the UNP
Q :Do you believe whether this NCM was a mistake in strategic terms
We were on a sound footing as far the vote of the motion was concerned. If not for the betrayal by those who were absent during the voting, the result would have been different. The SLFP lost a golden opportunity due to this betrayal.

What MR got right and this Govt. could not!
	
Reading the Sunday newspapers, I stumbled upon two stories. One was about resettlement experts making a hue and cry that the third phase of Central Expressway would cause mass displacement. From a peoples point of view, we are heading for disaster, one complains. According to the statistics cited, 6,432 people from 1,742 families would be affected. There are 624 people living in the road corridor; 2,098 agricultural landowners; and 25 entrepreneurs.
The second is a report that the US Congress has allocated US$ 35 million for Sri Lanka for FY 2018, subjective to extensive conditions. Conditions, as the Sunday Times reported, goes as further as, returning military occupied private lands in former conflict zones to their rightful owners, setting up a credible office to investigate the plight of missing persons and publishing the lists of persons who surrendered to the Security Forces after the end of civil war in May 2009.
The substantial reduction of the presence of the armed forces in former conflict zones and implementing a plan for restructuring and reducing the size of armed forces to adopt a peacetime role that contributes to post-conflict reconciliation and regional security, are among other conditions

The substantial reduction of the presence of the armed forces in former conflict zones and implementing a plan for restructuring and reducing the size of armed forces to adopt a peacetime role that contributes to post-conflict reconciliation and regional security, are among other conditions
These two stories are in no way interrelated, but they are also microscopic of two contexts which, in our historical experience had a causal effect. There are, of course, two ways to interpret it. The self-righteous one would say that the governments disregard for the grievances of people such as those evicted by the highway project is a pointer to its overall callousness, which might have warranted such a self righteous scrutiny by America. The other less politically correct, but more grounded to truth one is that it was this cacophony of endless disagreements over every development project that had held back this country for decades and effectively, this low economic attainment compels it to subject itself to every self-indignation. Also, there is hardly any conclusive evidence that suggest aid extensively tied to human rights and good governance had ever performed better than others, and created growth. In fact, the countries that truly benefitted from the American largess were developmental dictatorships of East Asia, and Chile. They succeeded in part because either Chiang Kai-shek or Pinochet could easily kick out the squatters to build roads, industrial parks and modern cities. Those leaders may not have been globally acclaimed, perhaps with the exception of Lee Kuan Yew, a milder one, and lately Deng Xiaoping. But, at the end of their rule, they all left their countries infinitely better than what they were when they first assumed power. 
There is no correlation between economic growth and democracy, and more often than not, an overdose of competing interests and electoral short-termism have made it harder for countries to achieve growth. That is where the leaders come in. They should navigate across those differences to achieve the long term interest of the country and its people. As historical examples have shown, in regime modernization means matters much less than the end. Short term pain could also be in the overall long term interests of democracy as well. Because, though economic growth, and democracy are not inter-related, democracy cannot be sustained in the absence of prosperity. 

There is hardly any conclusive evidence that suggest aid extensively tied to human rights and good governance had ever performed better than others, and created growth
Sri Lanka has a sense of urgency to uplift its people. And our habit of arguing over every development project, till the cows come home and project cost hit through the roof has not helped. Political instability and economic inertia at present would make things worse. That is where, to give the devil its due, the previous regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa should be applauded. That is probably the only period in recent history where there were a manifest sense of urgency and tangible outcome of economic modernization on the ground. Sri Lankans want that pro-activeness and political cohesion in the countrys economic development. They could very well vote the Rajapaksas to power in the next election, but that would cause many other problems and probably roll back whatever the democratic gains achieved so far. 
To leapfrog economically, poor countries do not necessarily need dictators, even pro-growth ones. But, they have to have strong institutions that are capable of effectively addressing grievances of people who are affected by development work, and also preventing a microscopic minority of public from disrupting the countrys progress. Sometimes, there may not be a foolproof solution to short term pain and physical and psychological displacement that development, free trade and labour reforms are bound to cause. There, the leaders have to look into the matters in a utilitarian perspective, i.e. the greater good for the greatest number of people, even at the expense of a minority.
Ex-President Rajapaksa got that one right. Unfortunately, this government is neither here, nor there.

Will cries for justice be heard in TOXIC GAS TRAGEDY   
	
Industrial accident in Horana
Scribbles of Lal Pushpakumaras toddler were seen on the unplastered walls of his half-built two-storey house. The residence was being arranged for Pushpakumaras funeral at the time we visited. His wife Chandrika Damayanthi (39) is still struggling to come to terms with the shocking news. Pushpakumara (41), a carpenter by profession, was one of the five people who lost their lives in the toxic gas tragedy in Bellapitiya, Horana on
April 19.
Nobody from the factory came to help them. Villagers including my husband stepped in to rescue the two workers who were in trouble. I lost my husband. My four kids lost their beloved father, Chandrika lamented.
Pushpakumara and Chandrika were passing S & C Latex Limited on Kalawellawa Road, Bellapitiya, Horana around 1.20 pm on April 19 when they spotted two women screaming for help from passersby. By then, two workers attached to the latex factory had fallen into a chemical effluent treatment plant which contained liquid Ammonia (NH3), and suspected Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and Methane (CH4). Pushpakumara, who stopped his motorcycle, rushed to the scene to help those who were in trouble.
Chandrika was watching in anxiety from outside the latex factory when she heard about the death of her husband. People screamed that my husband who tried to rescue the workers also fell into the tank after being overcome by gas fumes. I couldnt believe it. He went to help others. He didnt even know anyone in the factory, Chandrika told the .

She is now bringing up four children alone. Chandrika fears that the latex factory, which was temporarily suspended by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) following the multiple deaths, would be allowed to escape unscathed, and would reopen soon.
On the day of the accident, the factory had commenced operating after New Year holidays. W. Ariyapala (40), a worker had been fixing a valve in chemical effluent treatment plant when he fell in after being overcome by the toxic gas. Later, the factorys Lab Assistant twenty-three-year-old Waruna Chandrasekara, who had tried to rescue Ariyapala, also perished.
Within minutes four villagers descended into the tank to rescue others. Of the four, only one individual named Janaka Dinesh (26) managed to survive, while the three others Pushpakumara, Dileepa Kasun Lokupathirage (34) and Priyantha Kumara (43) had to breathe their last, despite channeling their time and energies to save a human life. More than 10 others were admitted to the Horana hospital after being overcome by toxic fumes.
Janaka Dinesh is a mechanic in a service centre located next to the latex factory. He recounted his experience during the toxic gas mishap.
The liquid in the tank was only knee-deep. I descended down the tank using a ladder and pulled one person out, but he died later. Along with me, there was another person (Lal Pushpakumara) who was trying to rescue workers. Suddenly, he too fell into the tank. His fall into the tank resulted in more fumes. In a wink of an eye, the surrounding turned blue. I remember taking a deep breath and trying to climb up the ladder. When I regained consciousness, I was in hospital, Janaka reminisced.
The deaths have brought the working conditions in factories across the country under the spotlight. However, this accident is not the first of its kind to happen at the S & C latex factory. But, the factory either ignored or was allowed to circumvent many of the safety procedures.
Safety concerns
The late Chandrasekaras grieving mother Renuka Damayanthi said that a female worker had fallen into the same chemical effluent tank several months ago. Chandrasekara had been able to save that womans life.
Following this accident, his parents had pleaded him to resign from the job due to safety concerns.
Both his parents are managers at private banks. Renuka said that at first she didnt want Chandrasekara to work at this local factory since they didnt have any financial difficulties. Chandrasekara, who was so passionate about Chemistry, had anyway continued working at the factory despite objections by his parents.
I looked after my son like the apple of my eye. I always taught him to show loyalty and be honest with his place of employment. He was so helpful to others. But, nobody from the factory even made a call following his death. So far, nobody from the factory has come to the funeral, she said. She demanded that such factories must establish safety measures which can be put to use during an emergency to prevent any unfortunate deaths of workers.
Not only Chandrasekaras mother Renuka and Lals wife Chandrika, but also relatives of the other three people are still grieving. Brother, son, husband or father  all losses are significant.

The fates of Dileepa Kasun Lokupathirages and Priyantha Kumaras are similar to that of Pushpakumara; all of them who invited trouble into their lives because they went to help others.


Request to cancel license
Meanwhile, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya made a visit to Lokupathirages funereal house and met his family members on April 20. While leaving the funeral house, he told the , that he had requested the CEA to close down the rubber factory and cancel its license.
The license of the relevant latex factory was once revoked by the CEA. However, the factory officials later managed to get the license re-validated. I informed the Chairman of Central Environmental Authority Chandrarathna Pallegama. He was not aware of this incident until I told him. I made a request to cancel the license, he said.
Immediately after this incident, the CEA took action to suspend the Environmental Protection License (EPL) of the S & C Latex Limited. Further, the Manager, identified as Ratnasiri Edirisinghe from Boralesgamuwa and the 42-year-old Senior Laboratory Controller from Dikhenapura were arrested and remanded till April 25, by the Horana Magistrate. They had been charged of negligence and the failure to take adequate safety precautions. Meanwhile, the Department of Labour had told the media that it had launched an investigation into the incident.
Tension prevailed outside the factory when the family members of deceased came to know about the accident. Kith and kin of the deceased staged a protest near the factory raising slogans against the management and Government demanding stringent action be taken against the errant latex factory which had failed to follow the safety measures.
According to the villagers, S & C Latex factory has not been following precautionary measures. It is mandatory that the management should provide workers with face masks while cleaning chemical tanks. Five innocent people died due to their negligence. The Government should take serious action against the management, demanded villagers.
The Bellapitiya area comes under the purview of Madurawala Pradeshiya Sabha (PS). These claims by the villagers were supported by Chairman of Madurawala PS, Pushpajith Samarawickrama.
As an industry, employee safety is the top priority of all operators. Many operators take steps exceeding what is required to ensure they are providing a safe working environment. This particular factory has a history of such wrongdoings, he told the .
In 2009, protests had been carried out by villagers led by PS Chairman Samarawickrama against the factory for releasing chemical waste into adjourning streams. As regulated in the Environmental Protection License, releasing of waste water into streams that provide water to paddy fields is illegal. A large number of paddy fields have been destroyed due to the chemical waste released from the latex factory. Drinking water in wells in Bellapitiya area had also been contaminated. Fish and a cow have died after drinking water from these contaminated streams.
Following the demonstrations, CEA on January 16, 2009 sent officials to inspect the operations of the factory under the guidance of the then Director General Pasan Gunasena.

Violation of rules and regulations
The field report compiled by the CEA officials had revealed that the operations of the factory were violating rules and regulations of the EPL. Therefore, on January 28, 2009, the CEA suspended the EPL 00065(R2)F of S & C Latex Limited.
However, the factory owner Sarath Wijerathne, who is a former Major of the Sri Lanka Army, submitted an appeal to the Secretary of Ministry of Environment and got the cancellation of the license removed. On the day the accident took place he has been at the factory. Villagers said they had seen him escaping using his vehicle without even looking into what had happened. Wijerathne was asked to be present at the police station to record a statement. But, he has not yet reported to the police.
Villagers, who protested against this factory, were threatened by Wijerathne. As he was a former Major of the Sri Lanka Army, people later dispersed, PS Chairman Samarawickrama said.
Subsequently, Wijerathne filed a case at Horana District Court in 2009 against Madurawala PS Chairman and five officials at the CEA. He held the six respondents responsible for causing a loss of Rs. 108 million to the factory during its closure. The case is still being heard. Another case was filed by Wijerathne against journalists who had covered the public protests and the written content, which he claims was against his factory. However, villagers claimed that despite nine years had lapsed, chemical waste is still released into streams on rainy days. PS Chairman Samarawickrama raised a question as to on which basis the CEA had decided to give back the EPL to the factory which had failed to rectify its faults.
He also alleged that the owner of the factory had close connections with Environment Ministry bigwigs and that is how he got his factorys license re-validated eventually.
Meanwhile, Senior Environmental Lawyer Jagath Gunawardane, speaking to the said that the unfortunate deaths of five people were repercussions of wrong decisions taken by the former officials of the Ministry of Environment in re-validating the EPL of the latex factory.
A former Secretary of the Environment Ministry had turned an administrative decision into a technical decision although he is technically not qualified to do so. In addition, it is an accepted principle in law that no fresh evidence can be submitted to an appeal. It has to go by the evidence that was available at the time of the initial decision. However in this particular case, a legal officer from the ministry had made a site inspection to the factory, said, Gunawardane.

He underscored that the legal officer is not the competent officer to handle the technical inspections and provide a report. Therefore, this is again a substantially wrong action on the part of the ministry at the time, he stated.
These kind of wrong decisions, based on incorrect activities and premises, make the authorities like the CEA to be tied down and unable to perform their duties. Although the relevant officials are no longer working at the ministry, these unfortunate deaths are repercussions of wrong decisions taken by them, he said. A team from the Government Analysts Department visited the factory last Saturday (April 21). Speaking to the , Government Analyst A.Welianga said a special laboratory analysis will be carried out by the department based on the liquid and air samples collected from the factory premises.
We are supposed to do a proper analysis. Until the analysis is completed, we cannot comment on the incident. Within the next two weeks, the analysis will be completed and the report will be handed over to the police, he said.
Meanwhile, another villager named Pushpakumara, a disabled soldier of the Sri Lanka Army, narrated another story regarding the land on which the S & C Latex Limited is located. Pushpakumara is residing in Ranawiru Gammanaya, Gowinna, six kilometers from the latex factory.

	Villagers claimed that despite nine years had lapsed, chemical waste is still released into streams on rainy days
	This land where the S & C latex factory stands is the property which was officially and originally passed by the Sri Lanka Army to build Ranawiru Gammanaya

Ranawiru Gammanaya
This land where the S & C latex factory stands is the property which was officially and originally passed by the Sri Lanka Army to build Ranawiru Gammanaya. The latex factory was supposed to be built on a bare land in Gowinna. That land in Gowinna is in a rocky area and obtaining water and electricity for the land was very difficult. Sarath Wijerathne, who was serving the Army by that time, somehow acquired this land for his factory. Ranawiru Gammanaya was later built on that difficult area in Gowinna. We had to face many difficulties in building a road to our houses. Those in the scheme are still having an issue with water. I think Wijerathne has had to suffer as a result of Dittadhamma Vedaniya Karmaya for what he had done to all disabled war heroes, he said.
However, when inquired by the Madurawala PS Chairman, regarding this claim of the land, he said he was not aware of it.

World Day for Safety and Health at Work is to fall this Saturday (April 28). It is high time for government institutions and non-government organizations established for occupational safety and health to focus on the loopholes in their procedures, United Federation of Labour President Linus Jayathilake, said. He said the purview of the Department of Labour does not cover the small scale factories, fishermen and farmers even though they also contribute to the national production.
Ammonia, the colourless gas, which has a very distinct pungent odour, is used in industrial practice to preserve latex because ammonia prevents the growth of bacteria in latex. The rubber industry is a unique example of complex exposure of human beings to chemicals. This exposure is even considered as carcinogenic for humans by the World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer.
In this S & C latex factory in Horana, the worker W. Ariyapala was apparently not wearing approved breathing apparatus when working inside the ammonia tank. Since Lab Assistant Chandrasekara also fell into the chemical effluent tank, it poses a serious question on the irresponsible manner in which operations had been carried out within the factory. Studies conducted in developed countries, have shown an increased risk of leukemia, lymphomas, and cancers of the bladder, lung, larynx, stomach, liver, and skin among rubber industry workers. It is alarming to know that the other workers of the same latex factory and labourers working in such unsafe rubber factories across the country are exposed to a high health risk, said Jayathilake.


He said that employers should conduct health check-ups for workers, twice a year.
He noted that a rescue act should only be performed by trained personnel using appropriate equipment and with the support of other rescuers. Only properly maintained and calibrated equipment should be used for these types of practices.
Only certified workers wearing approved breathing apparatus should be allowed to enter a confined space. Whether using approved breathing apparatus or when a worker has to enter a confined space, the person responsible for the workplace shall ensure that any person entering or remaining in that confined space is wearing approved breathing apparatus with a suitable safety harness connected to a lifeline. The person using the breathing apparatus should have received appropriate training in the use of that particular type of equipment, he said.
He said that it is the responsibility of the employer to make all workers familiarise with the emergency procedures and make them aware of the characteristics and hazards of the hazardous gases likely to be present in the operations.
In this particular case, it is found that none of these measures had been adhered. Workers were not informed and responsible authorities at the factory had not taken any precautionary and emergency methods. If they had been in the scene and informed the villagers who came to help about the risk of being exposed to the gas, at least these unfortunate deaths of three villagers could have been prevented, Jayathilake added.

## Title: Will death  penalty for  child rape be a  deterrent

Will death  penalty for  child rape be a  deterrent  
	
Stung by world-wide condemnation for its callous indifference towards the rape and murder of an 8-year-old Kashmiri Muslim tribal girl by middle rung government officials, the Indian Prime Minister last week got an ordinance passed to enable courts to give death sentences on persons convicted of raping girls under the age of 12.
The anger of the middle-class, which demonstrated across India, was doused by the Prime Ministers dramatic action.
But experts say a closer examination of the issues involved would reveal that the ordinance was either a knee-jerk reaction of a rattled government or a balm of temporary effectiveness meant to end a political crisis in a pre-election year.
It was not a well-thought-out action plan to effectively curb rape, which has become a social problem. Veteran journalist and editor of ThePrint, Shekhar Gupta described the ordinance as lollipop politics to stop a baby from crying. Others picked holes in the measure which could make the ordinance difficult to implement.
Lawyers have also pointed out that the measure was not even new. A stringent law allowing death penalty for rape has been in existence since 2013.
In the wake of a countrywide outcry which followed the gang rape in Delhi in 2012 (the Nirbhaya case), the Manmohan Singh Government got Parliament to pass the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 introducing the death penalty for the non-homicide offence of rape under IPC Sections 376E (for repeat offenders) and under 376A (for rape that reduces the victim to persistent vegetative state).
Modis dramatic action immediately on return from CHOGM in London, has more to do with the fact that he and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are to face parliamentary elections in May 2019.
In that context, the BJP Government could ill-afford to be accused of being silent, evasive or supportive of the despicable actions of its party men, political supporters or government employees.

Modis dramatic action immediately on return from CHOGM in London, has more to do with the fact that he and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are to face parliamentary elections in May 2019
The rape and murder of 8-year-old Asifa Bano in Kathua was committed by a retired government officer and a serving police officer and the perpetrators were openly supported by BJP-affiliated organisations. They held demonstrations demanding a central government investigation because Jammu and Kashmir Police were allegedly pandering to the Muslim majority in the State by wantonly naming Hindus as the accused.
However, in other parts of India, the governments inaction and insensitive actions of its supporters led to a rash of demonstrations across India which became international news drawing stinging comments from prestigious Western newspapers. IMF Chief Christine Lagarde had twice called upon Modi to do more for women.
The Ordinance
Under the latest ordinance, new fast-track courts are to be set up to deal with rape. Special forensic kits to deal with rape cases will be given to all police stations and hospitals.
The minimum punishment in case of rape of women has been increased from seven years rigorous imprisonment (RI) to 10 years, extendable to life imprisonment. In case of rape of a girl under 16 years, the minimum punishment has been increased from 10 to 20 years, extendable to imprisonment for rest of life, which means jail term till the convicts natural life.
The punishment for gang rape of a girl below 16 years will invariably be imprisonment for the rest of the life of the convict. But the punchline was that the death sentence was permissible for rape of girls under 12.
Stringent punishment for rape of a girl under 12 years has been provided with the minimum jail term being 20 years which may go up to life in prison or death sentence.
The ordinance also provides for speedy investigation and trial. The time limit for investigation of all cases of rape is two months. A six-month time period for the disposal of appeals in rape cases has also been prescribed. There will be no provision for anticipatory bail for a person accused of rape or gang rape of a girl under 16 years.
Telling Statistics
According to the Indian National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), in 2016, of the 64,138 child rape cases before the courts under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 1,869 cases (or less than three per cent) had ended in conviction.
In 34,650 out of 36,657 cases (94%), the offender was known to the victim. He was either a close family member, neighbour or an acquaintance. Therefore, social workers believe that many or most cases of rape are hushed up for the sake of family image or honour. And distressingly, the victims will not complain even to the family, if the offender were a close relation.
Indian Supreme Court Counsel Vrinda Grover even goes to the extent of saying that if death sentence were the punishment and the offender was a relation or a close friend, fewer victims would complain, the consequences being severe.

The rape and murder of 8-year-old Asifa Bano in Kathua was committed by a retired government officer and a serving police officer and the perpetrators were openly supported by BJP-affiliated organisations
Broader Perspective Needed
Given this reality, experts point to the need for a wider debate before any amendment of the criminal law is carried out to award death penalty for cases of child rape. They believe that the root of the problem lies in social mores, conditions and the highly inadequate legal and investigative system rather than the leniency of the law or the absence of death sentence.
The system is sluggish. The POCSO Act provides for trials to be completed within a year. But at the end of 2016, 89 per cent of the cases were pending. Given the time-consuming legal process and poor conviction rate, death penalty will mean little to the vast majority of the victims, Grover says.
She also points out that stringent time limits are already there. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 states that in all cases of rape, trial shall, as far as possible, be completed within a period of two months and that investigation in relation to rape of a child may be completed within three months.
Grover argues that tweaking the laws to make them more severe would not help if investigation techniques continue to be old-fashioned and shoddy and judges were incompetent.
Judges are not trained to handle cases of child sexual assault and gender-based violence, she points out. Mumbai-based human rights lawyer, Persis Sidhva adds that prosecutors do not know how to conduct rape cases and that even high-profile cases take too long to conclude.
Additionally, proposing fast-track courts does not help when the number of judges remains the same or if the prosecutors are not capable of handling such cases, she says.
The minimum punishment in case of rape of women has been increased from seven years rigorous imprisonment (RI) to 10 years, extendable to life imprisonment. In case of rape of a girl under 16 years, the minimum punishment has been increased from 10 to 20 years, extendable to imprisonment for rest of life, which means jail term till the convicts natural life.
Verma Commission
Following the rape and murder of a young lab assistant in a bus in New Delhi in 2012, a committee set up under former Supreme Court Chief Justice J.S. Vermato suggested measures to curb the heinous crime.
Significantly, the Verma panel did not recommend death penalty. It categorically stated that there is considerable evidence that the deterrent effect of death penalty on serious crimes is actually a myth. It also said death penalty would be a regressive step in the field of sentencing and reformation.
Statistics support Vermas contentions. The Working Group on Human Rights reported that the murder rate in India had declined consistently over the last 20 years despite a slowdown in execution of death sentences since 1980.
The Clio-The Hindu study found the murder rate fallen from 4.3 in 1995 to 3.3 in 2013, even though the conviction rate was low.
According to NCRB, 1,303 capital punishment verdicts were handed down in India between 2004 and 2013. But only three convicts were executed during this period.

## Title: Will this Cabinet reshuffle be on a scientific basis

Will this Cabinet reshuffle be on a scientific basis
	
Another Cabinet reshuffle is the talking point these days. Health Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said on Sunday that there would be a Cabinet reshuffle before May 1 with the portfolios assigned in a scientific manner. 
This is not the governments first Cabinet reshuffle and also not the first time that Dr. Senaratne assured the country on behalf of the government that the portfolios would be assigned in a scientific manner. It was during the 2015 presidential election campaign that the leaders of the incumbent government promised to appoint a 30-member Cabinet on a scientific basis. 
But the new government never kept that promise -- it neither maintained the limit of Cabinet ministers to 30 nor were they assigned on a scientific basis. We now have a 47-member Cabinet including the President and the Prime Minister, 24 State ministers and 24 deputy ministers 
The proposed Cabinet reshuffle if carried out would be the fourth of its kind since the Yahapalana or Unity Government assumed office. The first reshuffle was carried out on May 22 last year after the startling revelations about the nexus between politicians and those implicated in the Central Bank bond scam. The Finance portfolio was assigned to Managala Samaraweera and Ravi Karunanayake appointed Foreign Affairs Minister making this a major change in that Cabinet reshuffle. 
In the aftermath of the humiliating defeat suffered by the two main constituents of the government -- the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) -- at the February 10 local government elections this year, a Cabinet reshuffle was carried out with the main among them being the assigning the Law and Order portfolio to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, he held the post only for a few days till it was assigned to Ranjith Madduma Bandara. 
Then again President Maithripala Sirisena appointed four acting ministers on April 12 this year in place of the six ministers along with nine state and deputy ministers and the deputy speaker who resigned after voting in favour of the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister. 
Government leaders have never defined the term scientific Cabinet. However, one can gather from their criticism against the former regime for appointing ministers in a haphazard manner that the term means related subjects coming under one ministry. However, it was under this government that the Central Bank was removed from the Finance Ministry, Highways and Higher Education portfolios were placed under one minister, two lotteries boards were assigned to the Foreign Affairs Ministry and interestingly, a Buddhist was appointed as the deputy minister in charge of Muslim Cultural Affairs. This shows not only that they have not been serious about their pledge to the people, but also that they were prepared to insult the intellect of the people.
It was this government that limited the number of ministers of a single party government to 30 under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution while introducing provisions to the same Amendment to form National Governments under which that limit can be removed. Thus the present so-called National Government has 47 Cabinet ministers. And there is no sign of the government reducing the number of ministers from 47 at this weeks proposed reshuffle. How can a Cabinet be scientific when the number of its members varies - from 30 to 47-
National Governments are meant to be formed when the nation is faced with national crises such as wars and foreign invasions and not because of the inability of political parties with reduced mandate to form the government. Offering of ministerial portfolios by one party to another party to form the government is nothing but a political bribe. Nevertheless it has been legalised under the 19th Amendment.
The main problem with the government is that it does not have a scientific programme for economic development. It must first prepare such a programme and then assign the functions (portfolios) accordingly.
