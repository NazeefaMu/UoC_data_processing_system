Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today issued arrest warrants on Indika Karunajeewa and Iresha Silva again over the two cases conducted under money laundering Charges against Namal Rajapaksa and five others over alleged purchasing of Hello Corp shares.

The FCID told court today that the statements recorded from the suspects and other extracts pertaining to the two cases were sent to the Attorney General for his opinion.

Namal Rajapaksa and five others, Sudarshana Bandara, Nithya Senani, Sujani Bogollagama, were accused over alleged two transactions worth Rs. 45 million, which were discovered during the main inquiry conducted against them into the alleged purchasing Rs. 100million worth shares of a company called Hello Corp.

The two transactions were found by the prosecution as offences that fell under the Money Laundering Act.

Earlier, the prosecution had filed two separate cases against the suspects over the two suspicious Rs. 15 million and Rs. 30 million transactions.

According to the FCID, the suspect Namal Rajapaksa had dealt with a company called 'Boston Capital' and given Rs. 15 million by himself and another Rs. 30 million through one Indika Karunajeewa to the chairman of that company, Mr. Rohan Abey Iriyagolla, in order to conceal the origin of the alleged ill gotten funds.

The prosecution alleged that according to the statements from the chairman of the Boston Company, the given money was paid to Gowers Corporation and NR Consultancy Companies again, which are headed by Namal Rajapaksa, under the disguise of payments for the services obtained by the Boston Company.
