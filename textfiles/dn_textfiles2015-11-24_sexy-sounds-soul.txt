Sexy Sounds of the Soul

There aren’t a lot of new bands in Sri Lanka that make you go ‘wow’ – but The Soul is one. It’s not just me, I’ve been taking friends with me as guinea pigs to their gigs and every time so far, I’ve heard them go ‘wow’.
Although The Soul is best loved for their covers of reggae classics (a la Bob Marley’s repertoire), if you’re at a gig that’s more than an hour long they’ll show you a variety of genres, including a handful of killer originals. Cover music is a popular thing locally – its how a lot of bands get paid, by doing covers at bars – but one of the things that sets this band apart, is the vocals. Some of the covers actually sound like originals. Dave Roberts, lead vocalist of The Soul, has a voice that’s silky smooth. He varies enunciation to make it interesting – suddenly a vaguely Carnatic lilt of a note, or a baritone drop that commands your attention. One of those voices that you would instantly recognize if you heard it on the radio. The guy can sing the phonebook, and it would still sound beautiful.
Then there’s Dave’s right-hand-man, Khazim Miskin on the guitar. Khazim is a wizard at the instrument, keeping pace with Dave’s vocal meanderings, sometimes deciding the pace himself, shifting suddenly and effortlessly from a consistent reggae beat to a complicated, emotive series of chords. You can tell he has a special relationship with his guitar. All the while you’ll see him smiling coolly, sometimes eyes closed, in a calm, zen-like state. The band has also got Pradeep John and Nisal Jayasinghe on guitar, Nisala Perera on drums and Uvindu Perera on bass – all following up closely, never missing a beat, buffeting the performance with a solid groove.
What is different about them is that they have excellent chemistry, and that is in fact, what makes some of the greatest bands (another local band that comes to mind with good chemistry is Thriloka). The band members know and love each other so well, that communicating through their voices and instruments with each other seems a seamless process, much to the delight of onlookers.
The band is only about a year old - we were told by Pradeep. But they seem to have shot to relative fame in the past few months, with gigs at Qbaa and The Long Bar among other popular hangouts.
I’ve so far managed to stalk them to a handful of gigs, and I’ve noticed that their songs seem to change at every performance – the songs aren’t treated as pieces with fixed chords and fixed ranges, but as organic, free-moving compositions, which can be played around with every time. The performances have a fluid nature and can change depending on the mood of the drummer or the vocalist or the guitarist, which makes it exciting to watch and listen, especially at the end of the song when it dwindles to an impromptu jam with a bit of jazz-scat.
One of my favourite covers are Bob Marley’s Jammin’ – it’s one of the first songs I’ve watched them perform, and it is an excellent exploitation of Dave’s vocals and stage presence – he is soulful with his reggae – and even as someone who appreciates Marley I can honestly admit I liked it better than the original. Bill Withers’ The Two Of Us and Gnarls Barkley’s Crazy are two other brilliant covers re-made to sound fresh and new. What’s Up With All The Time and Alive are the fore-runners of The Soul originals. The first is a poetic reflection on time and the human struggle to survive it, featuring a killer reggae beat, clever lyrics and some interesting echo-effects on vocals.
‘Alive’ is more alternative rock, with a hauntingly evocative chorus, coupled with a series of catchy, unforgettable guitar chords. They have only a handful of originals so far, and they hope to bring out an album soon at the beginning of next year.
The band members themselves are so humble and relaxed and easy to approach. At a promotional gig at Majestic City once, they even took up a cover of a popular Sinhala song for a fan in the audience. I think the fact that they don’t seem to yet be fully aware of just how talented they really are, makes them all the more endearing.
You can look for the band on Soundcloud, but the recordings are not the same as the live performances, so I suggest you stay tuned on Facebook.com/SoulBandSL for updates on their gigs. It’s an exciting time for Sri Lankan music, when there’s fresh new talent like The Soul making little waves. Here’s hoping they’re paving the way for kindred spirits.
