England beat Sri Lanka by 42 runs in the third Test in Colombo on Monday to claim their first overseas whitewash in a three-match series in 55 years. Spinners Jack Leach and Moeen Ali took four wickets each to help bowl out Sri Lanka, who were chasing a daunting 327 for victory, for 284 in the final session on day four.
