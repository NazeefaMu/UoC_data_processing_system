Warped sense of humour ‘can be early sign of dementia’

* What is dementia?
Dementia is a loose term used to describe different degenerative disorders that trigger a gradual loss of brain function - thinking, remembering and reasoning.
*Is it the same as Alzheimer's?
Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, accounting for around 62 per cent of all diagnosed cases.
* Who gets it?
In most people, symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. An estimated 850,000 people in the UK have dementia, with the number set to rise to more than a million by 2025.
* Is there a cure?
The disease is progressive and currently incurable, though there are treatments to reduce the symptoms. In the end it robs the sufferer of the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.
* What causes it?
The causes are still not completely understood. Scientists believe genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors all play a role.
Scientists find that patients with frontotemporal dementia had begun laughing at tragic events in the news or in their personal lives years before they were diagnosed
The development of a warped sense of humour could be an early sign of dementia, scientists have found.
The families of patients with frontotemporal dementia revealed with hindsight, they had noticed that loved ones had developed a darker sense of humour years before the disease had been diagnosed.
Many said their relatives had begun laughing at tragic events in the news or in their personal lives, such as one who was amused when his wife scalded herself.
Experts from University College London, who questioned the friends and family of 48 patients, said more research was now needed to understand how and when changes in humour could act as a red flag for dementia.
Frontotemporal is one of the rarer forms of dementia, but one of the more common causes of the disease for those under 65. It affects the area of the brain that controls personality and behaviour.
As opposed to Alzheimer's, which causes difficulty with memory, patients can instead lose their inhibition, become more impulsive and struggle with social situations.
Dr Camilla Clark and her team asked the friends or relatives of patients to rate their loved one's liking for different kinds of comedy - slapstick comedy such as Mr Bean, satirical comedy such as Yes, Minister or absurdist comedy such as Monty Python - as well as any examples of inappropriate humour over the last 15 years - well before any diagnoses.
Nearly all of the respondents said, with hindsight, that they had noticed a shift in the nine years before the dementia had been diagnosed.
This included laughing at events others would not find funny such as a badly parked car or a barking dog.
Third of people born in 2015 'will develop dementia'
Dr Clark said: "As sense of humour defines us and is used to build relationships with those around us, changes in what we find funny has impacts far beyond picking a new favourite TV show.
"We've highlighted the need to shift the emphasis from dementia being solely about memory loss. "These findings have implications for diagnosis - not only should personality and behaviour changes ring alarm bells, but clinicians themselves need to be more aware of these symptoms as an early sign of dementia."
Dr Simon Ridley, from Alzheimer's Research UK, which partly funded the study, said anyone concerned about changes in their behaviour should speak to their GP.
"While memory loss is often the first thing that springs to mind when we hear the word dementia, this study highlights the importance of looking at the myriad different symptoms that impact on daily life and relationships," he said. "A deeper understanding of the full range of dementia symptoms will increase our ability to make a timely and accurate diagnosis."
The study is published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.
