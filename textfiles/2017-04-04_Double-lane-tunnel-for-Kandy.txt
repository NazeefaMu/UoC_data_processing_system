The Cabinet has today approved a proposal by Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella to construct a 5.5 kilometre long double-lane tunnel in Kandy with financial assistance from South Korea’s Economic Development Cooperation Fund.

It will consist of two interchange points and help to reduce traffic congestion.

“With the construction of the tunnel, traffic congestion will ease in the Kandy City and nearby areas. It is to be constructed according to international standards and have safe parking and exit-entry facilities,” ministry sources said. (Kelum Bandara)
