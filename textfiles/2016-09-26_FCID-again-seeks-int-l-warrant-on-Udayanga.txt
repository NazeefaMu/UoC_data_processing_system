FCID again seeks int’l warrant on Udayanga


	



The FCID for the second time requested Court to issue a warrant through Interpol for the arrest of former Sri Lankan ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga in connection with the inquiry being conducted into the huge financial loss caused to the Government in the purchase of Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft in 2006.

In a report submitted to Court, the Foreign Ministry had informed that according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Weeratunga was not residing at the given address in Ukraine and as such the summons was not handed over to him.

On an earlier occasion, the Fort Magistrate dismissed the FCID's request to issue an international warrant on Mr. Weeratunga.

The Fort Magistrate noticed him to appear in court and directed that the summons be forwarded through the Foreign Ministry to his address in Ukraine.

FCID Chief Inspector Francis Nihal told court that Mr. Weerathunga was absconding so as to avoid being interrogated on this controversial deal.

He said the former ambassador had not returned his diplomatic passport to the Foreign Ministry but was known to have been travelling about illegally on a forged passport.

The Inspector said Mr. Weeratunga was recently seen in a photograph taken with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and it was evident that he was disregarding court orders.

Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne fixed September 30 to decide on the issuance of international warrant on Udayanga Weerathunga. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
