Hybrid Court not politically feasible: PM


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that a hybrid court was not politically feasible and as such a feasible alternative should be found.

He said this at the opening of the National Law Week organized by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka in Colombo this morning.

“Setting up a hybrid court is not politically feasible because such a move would need a referendum. Against this back drop, how can we fulfil the expectations of the international community? Let’s get together and think of a feasible alternative for such a court,” he said and requested the judicial experts to help this Government to find a viable alternative. (Yohan Perera)
