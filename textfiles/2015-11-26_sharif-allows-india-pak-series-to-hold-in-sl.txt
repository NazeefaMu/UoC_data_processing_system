Sharif allows India-Pak series to hold in SL


	

Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday gave green signal to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for series against India in Sri Lanka next month, Dunya News reported.
The permission letter forwarded by the PM House has been received by PCB Chief Shehryar Khan.
India and Pakistan were scheduled to play two Tests, five one-dayers and two Twenty20 internationals in December and January.
Pakistan have been playing their home series in the United Arab Emirates because of security fears at home, but India was unwilling to send its team to the UAE.
Later, Sri Lanka emerged as a likely solution after crisis talks at the weekend between PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) counterpart Shashank Manohar in Dubai failed to end the stalemate.
The meeting was organized by Giles Clarke, who heads the ICC Pakistan task force.
Both cricket boards had signed a memorandum of understanding last year to play at least six series from 2015 to 2023, with Pakistan hosting the first one in December. But all series were subject to clearance from their respective governments.
The BCCI was willing to talk about compensating the PCB in case it agreed to play the series in India, but Pakistan rejected the proposal, saying India should honor its commitment.
Pakistan also said India had not made any request about sharing revenue.
India and Pakistan have not played a full series since 2007. New Delhi halted all cricket matches with Pakistan following the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, although they did play a limited-overs series in 2012.
Last month, hardline Hindu activists sabotaged talks between India and Pakistan cricket officials in Mumbai.
