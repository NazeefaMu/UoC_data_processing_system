National government a gimmick: UPFA allies


	

United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara today criticized the National Unity Government Concept and said it was a political gimmick by the United National Party (UNP) to make the UPFA powerless.  
Flanked by Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena and Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Leader Udaya Gammanpila, Mr. Nanayakakara told a news conference in Colombo that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe aspires to continue functioning in his post for a longer period by introducing such a concept.
“In the guise of a people-friendly government, the UNP wants to retain power because the present Cabinet was not appointed by the people’s franchise. The UNP only wants to make the main opposition SLFP helpless,” he said.
       
Mr. Nanayakkara said a UNP strategist Shiral Lakthilake had delivered a speech at a workshop held for Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs and this was absurd. He said the current political dominion had overpowered the rule of law.
Meanwhile, commenting on their move to field former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as UPFA prime ministerial candidate, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said they were not attempting to create a rift within the SLFP.
“Though the SLFP is the main constituent of the UPFA, we must work together. We hope whatever the issues the SLFP may have will be resolved soon. We are simply attempting to lay the groundwork for the victory of the UPFA,” he said.
Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila said the new government was paving the way for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to become the main opposition as a goodwill gesture by making the UPFA helpless.(Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
