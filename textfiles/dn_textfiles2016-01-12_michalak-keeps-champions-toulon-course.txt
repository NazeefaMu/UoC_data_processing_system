Michalak keeps champions Toulon on course

PARIS, SUNDAY: Frederic Michalak scored a penalty four minutes from time to keep champions Toulon in the hunt for the European Champions Cup knock-out rounds on Sunday.
The France international came off the bench to give Toulon a 12-9 victory over dogged Bath, who deserved more from a game they lit up with some ambitious and at times scintillating running rugby.
George Ford kicked two drop goals for the visitors but they came up short and a second straight Pool 5 defeat leaves them with little chance of making the last eight.
"I'm not sure the best team won," admitted Toulon manager Bernard Laporte.
"We played a great team but what is sure is that we had more try-scoring chances."
He added: "Bath based their game on territory but the result is that their competition is over and we're still on course."
Toulon are now just two points behind group leaders Wasps, who must still come to the south of France. The first half was far more entertaining than the scoreline suggested after Eric Escande scored a pair of penalties in response to Ford knocking over one and adding a drop goal in what had been an enjoyable match.
Ford knocked over another drop goal early in the second period as an adventurous Bath side frequently attacked from deep.
Toulon started to get their own running game into gear and Escande levelled matters for a third time.
But after resisting a long period of Bath pressure, during which time Ford narrowly knocked another drop goal wide, Toulon steam-rollered up the other end and won the decisive penalty.
Stirring fightback
Ulster produced a stirring second half fightback to keep Irish interest alive in the European Champions Cup as they won 24-23 at Oyonnax.
Paddy Jackson kicked a penalty three minutes from time to complete a remarkable turnaround after Ulster went into the break trailing 23-0.
That kick kept alive their hopes of reaching the knock-out stages as they closed the gap to Pool 1 leaders Saracens to six points. With Munster eliminated on Saturday after a 27-7 defeat at Stade Francais, who played the entire second half with 14 men but still dominated, Ulster were the only Irish province still able to progress to the quarter-finals -- Leinster were eliminated a month ago when losing to Toulon.
But it looked bleak for the Irish when Ulster turned around at the break in France with a large deficit.
Oyonnax, who had already been eliminated themselves having lost all their previous matches, played without fear and scored a try through Jeremie Maurouard after just seven minutes.
Nicky Robinson kicked the conversion and three penalties before Uwanakaro Tawalo picked up a loose pass from deep inside his own 22 and broke clear to score a second try, also converted, on the stroke of half-time.
But Ulster showed great heart in the second period, in which they almost never let the hosts out of their own half. Rory Scholes got them on the board just three minutes in before tries from Craig Gilroy and Kyle McCall, all converted by Jackson, made it a two-point game with 12 minutes left. Oyonnax, playing in their first ever European Champions Cup campaign, couldn't hold out and Jackson had the final word. Ulster probably still need to get a result away to Saracens in their final match in order to make the last eight, though. On Saturday, Stade produced a stunning display to rout Munster with young flanker Sekou Macalou particularly impressive.
The French champions are just four points behind Pool 4 leaders Leicester, who have yet to play in Paris.
Racing 92 virtually assured their knock-out stage passage with a bonus point 34-10 victory over Glasgow that took the Parisians seven points clear of Northampton in Pool 3. On Friday, Clermont beat Bordeaux-Begles 28-10 to take over top spot in Pool 2 from Ospreys.
This weekend's matches had all originally been postponed following the Paris terror attacks last November that left 130 people dead. AFP
