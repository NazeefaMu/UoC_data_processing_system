This character is a member of a well-known political family in Gampaha. He had never contested an election to enter the Diyawanna council though his other siblings had done so from different political parties. However, in the recent past he contested an election of a different type and lost. 

 


By the way, this worthy had to cool his heels in the State lodge for a few days thanks to certain doings of his during the previous regime. 


Come whatever government into power, our man is so clever he would warm his way into the graces of the powers that be. He has already hooked some powerful persons of yahapalanaya as well, they say.


The other day, he got down several state of the art printing machines at a huge cost. He had purchased these costly printing machines in anticipation of being the awarded of a lucrative printing contract from a State-owned corporate body which brings windfalls to the people for a small investment!


This contract is now being handled by a sister of a former purohita hailing from a distinguished family in Wayamba. A yahapalanaya purohita from Wayamba too had helped this lady to get this contract, they say.


The sibling’s sudden bouncing back from his brief bad patch is the talk of the town these days.
