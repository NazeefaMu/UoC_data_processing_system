Paris, (Daily MAil), 02.03.2017 -  The Parisan home of French presidential candidate Francois Fillon was raided by police today – as he prepared to make a campaign speech 450 miles away.  


Mr Fillon faces prison over a burgeoning fake jobs scandal involving his British-born 
wife Penelope.  


The couple, both 62, have been summoned before a judge where they face being indicted for a range of charges including embezzlement, which is punishable by up to ten years in prison.  


Judicial police working to the examining magistrates today entered Mr Fillon’s Paris flat and ‘gathered evidence’ connected to the case, according to an investigating source.Mr Fillon was meanwhile in the southern city of Nimes, preparing to speak at an election meeting tonight.  


Both the Fillons are expect to be charged on March 15th – just five weeks before France goes to the polls to chose its next head of state.
