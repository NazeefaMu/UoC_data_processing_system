In the aftermath of the police attack on students of the Higher National Diploma in Accounting (HNDA), the Higher Education and Highways Ministry yesterday disputed police claims that no official was present at the time to meet any of the protesters.
Ministry Additional Secretary C. Jayasinghe told Daily Mirror he was present at the Ministry discussing with the relevant authorities on addressing the concerns of students attending this study course at Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technology.
He said the minister had even requested a meeting with the directors of the various branches of the institute.
“On the day of this incident, there was a request for a meeting with students. We agreed to allow five students to come and handover their petition. We sent the message to the students near the gate. But, in the meantime, the clash had started. Students may have acted provocatively,” Mr. Jayasinghe said.
However, he said a Cabinet memorandum would be submitted requesting that the HNDA be granted degree status.
