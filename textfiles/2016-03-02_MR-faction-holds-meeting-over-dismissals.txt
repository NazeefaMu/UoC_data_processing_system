Several Joint Opposition MPs and Provincial Councillors of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) held a special meeting with ex-president and Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa at his public coordinating office in Battaramulla last night.


MPs Rohitha Abeygunawardane and Gamini Lokuge and several other party representatives were among those who took part in the meeting.


After the meeting, MP Lokuge told the media that they had discussions on the current political situation in the country and about a solution to removing several SLFP organisers.
“There should be place to go to, if party continues to remove members from their organising posts. That’s what we discussed. There will be a new party, a front or an alliance led by Mr. Rajapaksa,” Lokuge  said.


However, MP Abeygunawardane said they would lead the country forward remaining in the SLFP.
