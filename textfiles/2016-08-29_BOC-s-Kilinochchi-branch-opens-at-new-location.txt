The Bank of Ceylon has been in the forefront as a financial partner to people in the Northern Province as early as in 1945 empowering them in every possible way through all times. Its Kilinochchi branch was established in 1973 and operates as an “A” Grade Branch that is upgraded to provide state- of-the-art comfort and atmosphere to its customers. 
Located in the key economic hub of the Kilinochchi town it caters to every segment ranging from individuals to 
business entities.

The new premises includes a SmartZone that would enable regular banking transactions 24 x 7 with ATM and Cash Deposit Machines (CDMs) that updates accounts in real time.  Addressing the social need of making available sophisticated and secure digital channels for banking BOC upgraded its online banking facility along with its newest feature “SmartGen” where the traditional passbook has been replaced through emails and SMS alerts also enabling the customer to walk into any BOC branch without producing identification to transact as the customer image has been stored in the centralized system at the time of opening 
the account.
