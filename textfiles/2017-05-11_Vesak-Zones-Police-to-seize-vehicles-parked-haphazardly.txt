Vehicles parked in a haphazard manner blocking routes to commuters and other motorists near Vesak Zones will be seized, the police said today.  

The vehicles will be taken to the nearest police station and owners will have to bear the cost of the relocation when claiming the vehicles.    

Police said haphazard parking was strictly prohibited along the road from Polduwa Junction to Parliament, the road towards Kimbulawala and roads around the Apegama premises in Battaramulla where the Diyawanna Vesak Zone was situated.
