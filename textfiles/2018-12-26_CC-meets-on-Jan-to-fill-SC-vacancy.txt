CC meets on Jan.8 to fill SC vacancy


	

The Constitutional Council will meet on January 8 to consider another nominee by President Maithripala Sirisena as a Supreme Court judge.

There will be another vacancy in the Supreme Court after the retirement of Justice Eva Wanasundara on January 5 bringing the number of vacancies to three.

The Constitutional Council has to endorse the nominees by the President before being appointed and it is already at loggerheads over the filling of two previous vacancies after the President refused to appoint the nominees endorsed by the Constitutional Council. (Kelum Bandara)
