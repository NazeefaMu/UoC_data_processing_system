In the last week’s article, we gave a list of planetary combinations that produce remarkably favourable effects on the native.


More such favourable combinations are given below:
If either the Lagna or the Moon is Vargottama (being identical in both Rashi and Navamsa positions) at birth and the Vargottama Lagna or the Moon is aspected by four or more planets, the native would be a multi-millionaire. He would have a magnetic personality.

If Saturn is posited in Aquarius, Sun in Aries, and Moon in Taurus and one of these signs happen to be the Lagna, the native would be a multi-millionaire commanding a position of authority.

If born when Mars is exalted in Capricorn Lagna and Sun posited in the 12th House of Sagittarius, the native would have an imposing magnetic personality.

If born when Mars is exalted in Capricorn, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus who are not combust (not in intimate conjunction with Sun), are together in the 5th House and Saturn in the 9th House, the native would be a great scholar who would rise to a position of a head of an institute of higher education or Post-graduate studies.

If all planets are posited in the four signs, Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn with one of them being the Lagna, the native would be a multi-millionaire commanding much authority.

If born with all planets posited one each in the Rashis, the native would be a great learned person enjoying marital happiness married to a beautiful actress or a dancing belle.

Saturn and Moon in Sagittarius, Jupiter in Aries, and Venus and Rahu in the 10th House would produce a great powerful political figure of indomitable courage if he survives the Jamma Shani Erashtaka at birth.

If born with Mars in the 4th of Scorpio or Aries, Jupiter in Leo, Venus in Virgo and Saturn in Gemini, the native would be a highly respected leader of the people.


Saturn and Moon in Virgo, Jupiter in Leo, Rahu in Aquarius, and Mars in Capricorn at birth would produce an ideal ruler of a country.

Native would be the manager or head of a large factory or an industrial plant if Venus, Jupiter, Sun and Mars are posited in Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces respectively.

If born with Moon in Taurus, Sun in the 4th, Jupiter in the 7th, and Saturn in the 10th House, the native would wield much political power.

Saturn in the Capricorn Lagna, Moon in the 3rd, Mars in the 6th, Mercury in the 9th, and Jupiter in the 12th House would produce a popular leader of worldwide fame.

If born with either Venus or Mercury exalted in the Lagna, Jupiter and Moon posited in Sagittarius, Mars in Capricorn in Moon’s Hora, the native would be an outstanding person commanding much authority in the country.

If born with Moon in Pisces, Mars, Saturn and Sun are in Capricorn, Aquarius and Aries respectively, the native would become powerful like a king.

Jupiter at birth in Cancer Lagna, Sun in Aries, the 10th House, Moon, Mercury, and Venus in the 11th House, would produce a righteous leader with a magnetic personality.

If Rahu is posited in Gemini and Mars in Leo at birth, the native would inherit his father’s wealth and high position.

A person born with planets in Lagna, and in the 7th, 5th, and 9th Houses, would be the ruler of his clan or community.

If born with benefics in the four quadrants and malefics in the 6th and12th Houses, the native would gain fame, high recognition, and political power.

A person born with Saturn and Moon in Sagittarius, Moon in Sagittarius, Jupiter in Aries, and Venus and Rahu in the 10th House, the native would attain a position equal in status to that of a king.
