PCoI allows legal representation to Perpetual Treasuries and CB


	

The Presidential Committee of Inquiry (PCoI) appointed to investigate the Central Bank bond Issue yesterday permitted the Perpetual Treasuries and Central Bank Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri legal representation.

The hearing was suspended for five minutes to discuss this matter when the two lawyers requested permission to represent the Company and Mr. Samarasiri.

Thus President's Counsel Nihal Fernando will represent Perpetual Treasuries while Attorney-at-law Harsha Fernando will represent the Deputy Governor.

Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, who appeared for the Attorney General, said both Perpetual Treasuries and Mr. Samarasiri were within their rights to obtain legal representation.

Mr. Samarasiri was the Chairman of the committee appointed to evaluate the tenders for the sale of bonds at that time. (Manopriya Gunasekara and Ranjan Katugampola)
