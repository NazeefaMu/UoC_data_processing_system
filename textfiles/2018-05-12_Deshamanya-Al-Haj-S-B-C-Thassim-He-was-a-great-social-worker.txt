Haji Thassim is no more. He passed away in Toronto, Canada on April 17th. He is the son of late Mr. Saifudeen Basheer Chunchi and Mrs. Endran Chunchi. He was the brother of late Kalaboosana Al-Haj. S.B.C. Halaldeen and Mrs. Davi Nona (Daisy) and Mrs. Janeer Miskin. He was the maternal uncle of Al-Haj Dr. B.A. Hussainmiya of Brunai. Father of late Sheriwn Sama, Thaslim, Thazmir, Thaznir, Mumtaz and Fareena.   


He was a banker and was employed at Saudi American Bank, for nearly 30 years. He was a prominent social worker and he founded the national council of Y.M.M.A. (INC) Maligawatte and Maligawatte Janaza Welfare Association (INC) and today Ft’s stands for his credit.   


As a social worker, he never lost his temper and associated with everyone. Even in the family circles everyone liked him. He was very helpful to everybody. He used to visit me every year during fasting. He was neatly dressed and a soft spoken individual.  


Haji Thassim was very sincere and lovable person within the family and outside. He helped many underprivileged school children in their education. He donated a wedding reception hall to Maligawatte Y.M.M.A. This enabled the less affluent people to hold their wedding receptions. His death is an unbearable loss to all who associated closely with him.   


Tanaza was held in Toronto, Canada. I saw his remains on Facebook. I was unbalanced. I wrote this appreciation about him with a heavy heart. His children are still shocked and are grieving. Allah please grand him Jinnathul firdouse. My family and I will remember you everyday.
