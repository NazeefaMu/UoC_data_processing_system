The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) will be conducting a range of training programmes around the country to educate investors on the use of mobile trading applications. The series of educational events, which will be conducted free-of-charge, will demonstrate how investors could obtain the full benefits of mobile trading. Trainings in Sinhala, Tamil and English mediums will be conducted in Colombo, Kandy, Ratnapura, Matara, Anuradhapura, Negombo, Kurunegala and Jaffna.


The popularity of smartphones is rapidly increasing and with that, tech-savvy investors around the world have taken to mobile trading as a way to conveniently trade stocks using their smartphones. This is reflected in the growth of mobile applications as a whole. 


This opportunity is offered to both foreign and local investors investing in the CSE, who have the ability to experience the benefits and ease of mobile trading with CSE-partnered mobile trading applications. These applications, which are provided by broker firms and developed by third party application developers, offer investors the ability to trade securities listed on the CSE on-the-go, from just about any smart mobile device. 
Commenting on the initiative, CSE Head of Market Development Niroshan Wijesundere said, “With the usage of smartphones growing worldwide, where devices are increasingly utilized to access online services and information, it is only just that we offer investors the convenience of trading from their mobiles. These trainings are an important first-step in embracing mobile trading and in learning how to use the applications effectively.” 
Why use your mobile to trade? 
Trade on-the-go! 
A common problem for investors has been gaining access to sources through which orders can be placed in real-time. In other words, the lack of the opportunity to trade live, from wherever they are located. Mobile trading offers investors the ease of trading on-the-go, from where ever they may be. 
Timing is everything!
Given the active and sometimes volatile nature of the current market, an opportunity could be lost or capitalized on in a matter of seconds. Getting the timing right in terms of when to buy or sell a stock could therefore be as crucial as deciding what shares to buy. Mobile trading offers value to investors who rely on quick buy and sell decisions and those who find it difficult to constantly be in touch with their broker to place trades. 
Comprehensive features
The applications offer a range of features that include daily market summaries, portfolio management, buy and sell options, ability to track and view the history of orders, ability to analyse gains and losses in real-time and breaking corporate news alerts. 
Safe and secure 
The applications are developed by experienced and leading professional developers who are committed to creating and maintaining secure trading facilities for mobiles. The same security protocols adopted by web-based portals and other e-commerce applications are used for mobile trading. 
Convenient and easy to use 
This facility requires a web-enabled smartphone and a stockbroker trading account. Further information with relation to the applications and their providers could be obtained by contacting the relevant stockbroker.
