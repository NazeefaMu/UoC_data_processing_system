Global food supply engineered to end life, not nourish it


	

The Health Ranger and Natural News.com Editor Mike Adams says, after having analyzed more than 1,000 foods, super foods, vitamins, junk foods and popular beverages for heavy metals and other substances at the Natural News Forensic Food Labs, he has arrived at a conclusion so alarming and urgent that it could only be stated bluntly.  

He says that based on what he has found via atomic spectroscopy analysis of all the dietary substances, people are consuming on a daily basis, that the battle for humanity is nearly lost. The food supply appears to be intentionally designed to end human life rather than nourish it. This applies to almost all countries including Sri Lanka.   

According to him, life-destroying toxins are intentionally engineered into the food supply. His lab has uncovered scientific proof that substances are intentionally formulated into dietary products to drive consumers insane while causing widespread infertility, organ damage and a loss of any ability to engage in rational, conscious thinking. These toxic substances are being found across the entire food supply including in conventional foods, organic foods, “natural” products and dietary supplements.  

The Natural News Editor says this goes far beyond the mere contamination of foods with heavy metals -- a subject which is grave by itself. Rather, this is about the intentional formulation of toxic substances into products consumed by the people on a regular basis.  

The result is what we see unfolding around us now; mass insanity, incredible escalation of criminality among political operatives, clinical insanity among an increasing number of mainstream media writers and reporters, widespread infertility in young couples, skyrocketing rates of kidney failure and dialysis patients, plus a near total loss of rational thinking among the voting people. Is this not the reality in Sri Lanka also?  

The effects are devastating to human civilization -- the collapse of a capable workforce, the rise of the people dependent on government for survival, the collapse of free democracies due to the cognitive retardation of the voting people, an exploding prison population and the rise of for-profit corporate prison systems and even the near complete collapse of any ability of the news-consuming public to parse and comprehend even the most basic information such as national debt figures.  

Mr. Adams says the long-term effects of this widespread food poisoning phenomenon will be the  downfall of modern human civilization for numerous reasons ranging from economic non-sustainability to environmental destruction and the global rise of political violence as we are seeing now.  

As more and more lab results have been documented at the Natural News Forensic Food Lab, it has become increasingly apparent to him that humanity cannot survive the mass engineered poisoning of the food supply.  

“You are, of course, being expertly distracted from all this with tabloid celebrity news, staged political drama and of course the all-time favourite distraction of every crumbling empire -- violent sports,” he says.  

He says what he has published so far just barely scratches the surface of what we are finding. Here’s an overview of some of the incredibly shocking findings he has now documented:  

The now-infamous “yoga mat chemical” used by Subway in their breads is also widely used across the fast-food industry. 
	There is no logical reason why chemicals like azodicarbonamide need to be added to recipes of fast food breads and buns. The chemical serves no necessary functional or nutritive purpose. It seems to exists solely for the purpose of delivering the chemical to hundreds of millions of consumers by blending it into popular fast foods.  
	A popular dietary herb designed to improve brain performance actually contains high levels of lead in most products tested. These were sourced from China. Lead is a toxic heavy metal that damages brain function. Mr. Adams says it was shocking to him to discover that “brain herbs” contain so much lead that they contribute to brain damage. 
According to parliamentarian and Presidential advisor, Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, Manning Market vendors have decided to reject vegetables or fruits for which the controversial glyphosate weeedicide was used. The government earlier banned the usage of glyphosate. Apparently under pressure from powerful transnational companies, the ban was recently relaxed. Therefore we believe that the consumers and the people comprised the most powerful force if we decide to act as responsible citizens and refuse to buy food items for which potentially toxic chemicals have been used.
