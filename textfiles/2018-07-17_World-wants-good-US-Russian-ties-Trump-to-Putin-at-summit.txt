US President Donald Trump began his much-anticipated meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Helsinki on Monday by emphasizing the importance of salvaging US-Russian relations.


“I really think the world wants us to get along,” Trump said in his opening comments while seated next to Putin in the Finnish Presidential Palace, explaining that relations between the powers had been at a nadir.


“Getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,” Trump said. He expressed intentions to also discuss nuclear issues and China during his talks with the Russian leader.


Trump congratulated Putin for Russia’s hosting of the football World Cup, which finished the previous day. “I’d like to congratulate you on a really great World Cup, one of the best ever, and also on your team doing so well,” Trump said. “I watched quite a bit of it.”


The Russian team reached the World Cup quarter-finals, the farthest it advanced in the tournament in the country’s post-Soviet history.  Putin said he and Trump have maintained close relations by phone, and noted the opportunity to meet personally to discuss bilateral relations and “various painful points in the world.” 



 

Rights protest shines light on Chechnya

DPA, 16th JULY, 2018 - Rights activists used the wall of Finland’s presidential palace in Helsinki to project messages condemning the persecution of LGBT people in Chechnya.


The US-based Human Rights Campaign demanded Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump take action against the abuse of sexual minorities in the Muslim-majority region of southern Russia.


“Trump and Putin: Stop the crimes against humanity in Chechnya,” was splashed late Sunday on the palace where the US and Russian delegations had gathered along with the international media ahead of Putin and Trump’s summit on Monday.


Other messages displayed included: “Bring the perpetrators to justice” and “Silence is deadly.”
