Donald Trump stumps the American Dream

On Monday, aboard the USS Yorktown, Mr. Trump said: "We need a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States while we figure out what the hell is going on." Philadelphia Mayor, Michael Nutter has blasted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, branding him "an a hole" and accused Trump of taking "a page from the playbook of Hitler". "It engenders a level of fear mongering that we have not seen literally since the 1930s and 1940s." Paul Ryan, the republican leader of the US House of Representatives also responding said, "Freedom of religion is a fundamental constitutional principle...This is not conservatism what was proposed yesterday, is not what this party stands for and more importantly it's not what this country stands for".
Harriet Lamb writing in the Independent before the UK Parliament debated and thereafter authorized bombing ISIL said, "Air strikes on Isis-held territory, from thousands of feet up, without the capacity to inform perceptions on the ground are dangerous and will backfire. Airstrikes will further traumatise an already broken population. Seeing family members and friends killed by a faceless enemy, to whom ISIS are free to give whichever 'face' suits them, will no doubt result in more foot soldiers in ISIS battle against the west. Airstrikes will create more refugees, pressing into fragile neighbouring states in a region that already cannot cope. Instead of military action in a vacuum, we need a long-term strategy, one that recognises and addresses the reasons why ISIS has support in the first place, both in Iraq and Syria, and at home in our own backyard.
Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign stopover. 
"Over three thousand Tunisians are estimated to have travelled to Syria to fight alongside Islamist militants. Through our work in Tunisia we now know that young people in the poor suburbs of Tunis who participated in the Arab Spring because they believed in the possibility of a better life, today feel cheated by the political elites and ignored by the state. We know that this sense of disillusionment and resentment amongst young Tunisians has made them easy targets for violent extremist groups, and that the sense of belonging and purpose and power offered by these groups has caused young Tunisians to travel to Syria in their thousands."
Read together it represents the serious challenges facing the world today in terms of conflicts, bigotry, misery to millions and use or misuse of religion for a variety of reasons. It's said in a world still fighting poverty, natural disasters and the disintegration of some states we knew such as Libya.
At this point I wish to introduce words of wisdom found in a publication titled, "Encounters With the Word: Essay To Honor Aloysius Pieris, S.J".
Vision of "ecumenism"
Sri Lankan Methodist theologian S. Wesley Ariarajah plea to apply the concept and vision of "ecumenism" not only to the search for unity of the churches, but to the wider movements that try to bring humankind together and in which all Christians should play an active role. Would we see mission simply as a message that we bring to, or activities we do in the world, or mission as participation with God and all others in bringing healing and wholeness, justice and peace, and reconciliation and renewal in the world?
Suffering can humanize the world
Spanish-born liberation theologian Jon Sobrino, S.J. Based on his 30 years of experiences in El Salvador, develops four points: 1) Mercy-justice (to save the poor from death); 2) Prophecy and word (to save them from indignity); 3) To give a name (to save them from inexistence); and 4) The characteristics of the option (dialectics, partiality, insertion, humility). He concludes with a more radical idea: What can the poor do for society? The salvation brought by the poor is humanization: a call to be human, civilization and solidarity. The fact that their suffering can humanize the world is truly a supreme paradox.
Collaboration to reverse global injustice
The late Father Tissa Balasuriya, O.M.I calls forth Christians to help develop a global ethic based on the core values of religions and points to the need for inter-religious collaboration to reverse global injustice.
Love of one's enemies
Social scientist François Houtart reflects on the love of one's enemies, implies efforts to bring them to this change of heart. In the same way, reconciliation as a manifestation of love of enemy is not limited to the individual sphere, but should bring about a restructuring of social relationships and lasting social change. In short, the love of and compassion for enemies create a "social environment that enables the recapture of humanity".
World faiths as resources for peace education
In a world full of violence, in which religions are often part of the problem of violence, Ursula King's article "Seeds of Peace: World Faiths as Resources for Peace Education" looks for ways to make religions into resources for peace-making, and to develop an education for peace from a religious and spiritual perspective.
Taking these calls further Paul F. KNITTER in a publication titled, "Toward a Liberation Theology of Religions" looks at the need for dialogue between Theologians of Liberation and Religions. He says, Economic, political, and especially nuclear liberation is too big a job for any one nation, or culture, or religion. In fact, if liberation theology is to take root in Asia, and not just in Latin America, it has no choice but to open itself to dialogue with Eastern religions. As Sri Lankan Aloysius Pieris reminds his Latin colleagues: The irruption of the Third World [with its demands for liberation] is also the irruption of the non-Christian world. The vast majorities of God´s poor perceive their ultimate concern and symbolize their struggle for liberation in the idiom of non-Christians.
Suicide bombers was a Sri Lankans phenomenon early on introduced by the LTTE. Its commonplace in many trouble spots including as we saw Paris recently.
A reflection of extreme radicalization and replication of methods of terror unknown previously. Neither politics nor the UN has been able to quieten, quell and extinguish many of the fires based on class, caste, ethnicity, religion and strategic needs of some states. Injustices faced by people on the other hand are sometimes fuelled by the money, politics and power.
In all of these situations religions working together has the power and potential to bring peace and justice in so many ways, some of which is highlighted in the earlier sections. Hence, the central thesis in this piece today is a call for an "ecumenism" of religions to come together to address the multitude of challenges facing us today. I do not believe the collective power of religions has been adequately harnessed to bring peace and change in so many situations of violence and misery. Each of the sub titles describing in brief the writings of experts resonate with the need for us to embrace the issues at hand and use multi-faiths as a framework bring a measure of sanity to a greatly troubled world.
