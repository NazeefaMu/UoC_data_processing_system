The magisterial inquiry into the Avant Garde’s floating armoury was today terminated by Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris after the CID informed Court that it would not proceed with the case under the instructions of the Attorney-General.
Filing a further report in Court, the CID moved Court that case proceedings pertaining to the Avant Garde’s floating armoury maintained at the Galle port be terminated.
The CID informed Court that in accordance with the Attorney General's advice and the facts revealed during the investigations there was no need to extend the travel ban on Avant Guard Maritime Service (Pvt.) Ltd Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi.
Thus the Additional Magistrate lifted the travel ban imposed on Mr. Senadhipathi and directed that the Controller of Immigration and Emigration be informed accordingly.
Court had earlier restrained Mr. Senadhipathi from leaving the country because of the ongoing investigations into the floating armoury maintained at the Galle Port.(Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
