Nine cases filed against former Chairman of Development Lotteries Board, Sarana Gunawardena on charges of misappropriating state funds when obtaining vehicles on rent for the National Lotteries Board, while being the Chairman, were fixed for trial for December 6, by the Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Attygalle today.

The Magistrate fixed the trial following the amendments made by the Bribery Commission on two cases.

The prosecution sought the court to fix the trials of all cases in December since several officials who conducted the inquiry are currently abroad.

The suspect was accused with 30 counts for all nine cases under section 70, "Corruption", of the Bribery Act. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
