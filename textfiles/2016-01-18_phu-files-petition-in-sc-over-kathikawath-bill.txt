PHU files petition in SC over Kathikawath Bill


	

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the Theravadi Bhikkhu Kathikawath Bill, which was tabled in Parliament to take action against Buddhist monks who break ‘Vinaya’ rules.
PHU General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila said in their petition that a referendum should be held if the Government was to introduce the Bill, which was created by laymen to regulate Buddhist clergy.
Addressing a news conference, he said only the Buddha could make rules on the Sangha and the Mahanayaka Theras could take action on any monk who had misbehaved.
“If a monk was disrobed, then the civil law could be applied on them. We are against empowering Mahanayaka Theras with Police powers,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
