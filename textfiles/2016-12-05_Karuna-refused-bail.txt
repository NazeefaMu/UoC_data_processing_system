Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today refused to grant bail to former Minister Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan, alias Karuna Amman who is in remand custody till December 7 for misusing a state vehicle.

The Magistrate made this decision when the bail application filed by Counsel Kanchana Rathwatte, on behalf of the suspect through a motion, was taken up in court today.

However, the magistrate also stated that bail conditions would be re-considered on December 7.

Muralitharan was arrested by the FCID for allegedly receiving a bulletproof vehicle from the Presidential Secretariat in 2010 after being elected to parliament.

According to the FCID, he had not returned this vehicle though he had lost his seat at the general election in August last year. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
