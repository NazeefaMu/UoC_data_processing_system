The private sectors in Sri Lanka and Iran should cooperate closely for the implementation of joint projects following the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions on Tehran, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.

According to the Financial Tribune, Mr. Wickremesinghe has said positive developments have taken place in Sri Lanka’s economy. 

“The private sector has become very active here, and we are seeking to set up meetings with Iran’s private sector,” he told Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in Colombo on Thursday. 

The prime minister said Sri Lanka is keen to enhance trade ties with the Islamic Republic in various areas. 

“The bygone era of sanctions was a difficult time. We believe the remaining issues should be resolved and the conditions should be facilitated so that businesses from both countries can easily work together,” he said.
