CBK, Ranil meet at Temple Trees


	

A meeting took place between former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees yesterday.

Journalists who had arrived to cover the UNP Politburo meeting last evening were able to witness Ms. Kumaratunga entering Temple Trees just as the meeting was about to end.

The meeting between the two came in the backdrop of certain statements critical of Ms. Kumaratunga said to have been made by President Sirisena 48 hours before.

Journalists present were unable to make any headway with regard to what the meeting was about with MP Nalin Bandara being non-committal. “I don’t know anything about a meeting between the Prime Minister and the former President,” he said.

All indications are that following countless meetings between members of both the UNP and SLFP and the prime minister a decision has been made to give the alliance entered into between the two main political parties another go by enlisting the help of SLFPers willing to support the prime minister.
