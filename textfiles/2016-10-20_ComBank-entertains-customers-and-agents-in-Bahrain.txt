High profile Sri Lankan expatriates living and working in Bahrain and business partners were hosted by the Commercial Bank of Ceylon to an evening of entertainment and dinner recently in Manama, the capital of the monarchy. 
The event at the Diplomat Radisson Blu Hotel was organised to promote the Bank’s remittance services and to thank business partners and customers for their support. 
Popular comedic entertainer and political satirist Wilson Gunaratne of ‘Charitha Hathak’ fame was flown to Bahrain by the Bank to entertain the audience. Commercial Bank’s Assistant General Manager Personal Banking III Delakshan Hettiarachchi led a team of staff from Colombo to represent the Bank. Bahrain has a small but affluent group of 15,000 to 20,000 Sri Lankans mostly working in skilled and white collar jobs. Commercial Bank has five agents offering its remittance services to this community.
