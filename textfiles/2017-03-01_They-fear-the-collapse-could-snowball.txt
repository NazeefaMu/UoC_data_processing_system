The threat held out by the pro-JO members of the Western PC to go independent has sent the council’s political high-ups into a panic mode, they say.

 


A flurry of talks with party front-liners and yahapalanaya high authorities had immediately ensued with the aim of bringing about a settlement. And according to the latest reports, those concerned have decided to prevent the possible collapse of the council administration even if the price they had to pay was sacking the two provincial purohitas whom the pro-JO members have been gunning for.


High political authorities fear that the fall of the Western PC administration could have a snowball effect given the clear signs of the delicately balanced Southern council following suit, they say.
