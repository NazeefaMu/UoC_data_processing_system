TUNIS AFP Dec25, 2016- Tunisia’s security forces called on the government on Sunday to take “exceptional measures” to combat the return of jihadists fighting for extremist groups abroad.   
Tunisia has seen a wave of jihadist attacks since its 2011 revolution, including on foreign tourists, and the United Nations estimates that more than 5,000 Tunisians are fighting for extremist outfits, mainly in Iraq and Syria.   


 “The return of terrorists from hotbeds of unrest is worrying and could lead to the Somalisation of the country,” said a statement from the internal security forces’ national union, referring to the Al-Qaeda-linked Shabaab group in Somalia.

  
The warning came a day after the authorities said they had arrested three people including the nephew of Anis Amri, a Tunisian suspected of carrying out a deadly truck attack on a Berlin Christmas market this week.
