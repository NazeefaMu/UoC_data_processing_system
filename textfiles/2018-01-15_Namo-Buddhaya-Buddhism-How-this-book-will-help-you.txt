Namo Buddhaya!   “Buddhism” How this book will help you


	



The book, ‘Buddhism’ translated and compiled by most Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera with much compassion, lays out the basics of what Buddhism really means. This book helps us understand the key features and principles of Buddhism and how it works, providing a useful guide to anyone who would like to follow the noble path.  


Let us take the chapter on the four noble truths. The four noble truths are universal truths that were discovered and preached by the Supreme Buddha on the contemplation of the world: the truth of suffering, the origin of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path which leads to the end of suffering. These four factors are the core of Buddhism. Almost all sermons delivered by the Buddha are aimed at realising them. As a truth, it is something that never changes, regardless of 
external influences.
 Another central part of Buddhism is the principle of Kamma, which is clearly explained in the book. In short, Kamma is the result of whatever we think, do or speak intentionally. Whether it be good/bad actions that we make, Kamma, will always follow us ‘as the cart always follows the bull that pulls it’ and give results accordingly. Since Kamma is an outcome of our actions done intentionally, if we carry out unwholesome or bad deeds, we will only have bad Kamma. If we perform wholesome, good deeds, we will have good Kamma and also will lead to eradicate defilements, that is the ultimate happiness of Nibbana.   

 


"Let this book help you all understand and apply the qualities of Buddhism to your lives, and help in finding true liberation from this samsara. Let us all practise the Supreme Buddha’s teachings "



Here, in this book, are only the main and basic principles of Buddhism. The teaching as a whole delves far deeper into the mind than most of us can comprehend. However, understanding the anchors to Buddhism is the only way of developing one’s mind to realising the rest of it. We must train our minds to understand the unalterable truth of this world, for if we do not, we will forever be ensnared in this cycle of birth and death. Therefore, let this book help you all understand and apply the qualities of Buddhism to your lives, and help in finding true liberation from this samsara. Let us all practise the Supreme Buddha’s teachings diligently in order to acknowledge the four noble truths and attain true happiness!
