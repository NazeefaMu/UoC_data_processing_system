A group of disabled war veterans today demanded the government fulfill its promise of providing their pensions. The protesters marched from the Colombo Fort Railway Station towards the Finance Ministry. The initial protest, held on July 26, was called off following an assurance by Minister Duminda Dissanayake that their issues would be resolved within three months.
