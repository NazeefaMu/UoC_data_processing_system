Chinese media tells India to cool its missile fever
	
the state-owned Global Times warned that China would not stick rigidly to rules set out by the United Nations if the West and India do not do so either (GeoNews) 

(Geo News), January 05, 2017 -Chinas state-owned media has warned New Delhi against its continued lust for long-range nuclear missiles, hinting that Beijing would help Pakistan achieve similar capabilities if the West continues to be indifferent to the India-Pakistan nuclear race.
In an editorial published Tuesday in its Chinese as well as its English edition, the state-owned Global Times warned that China would not stick rigidly to rules set out by the United Nations if the West and India do not do so either. 
If the Western countries accept India as a nuclear country and are indifferent to the nuclear race between India and Pakistan, China will not stand out and stick rigidly to those nuclear rules as necessary. At this time, Pakistan should have those privileges in nuclear development that India has, said the newspaper, which is owned by Chinas official state-run Peoples Daily newspaper.  The editorial said China was sincere in developing friendly ties with India, but that the country would not sit still if India goes too far. 
New Delhi understands that it does little good to itself if the Sino-Indian relations are ruined by any geopolitical tricks... If the UN Security Council has no objection over this, let it be. The range of Pakistans nuclear missiles will also see an increase. If the world can adapt to these, China should too, it said.

Citi-CCC empower Urubokke micro-scale businessmen
	

Under the Citi-CCC rural economic empowerment programme, Hatton National Bank (HNB) provided loan facilities to a group of micro-scale businessmen in the Urubokke area of the Matara district to commence new businesses as well as for expansion of existing businesses.
A total of 37 entrepreneurs, who were earlier trained by the Citi-CCC rural economic empowerment programme on identifying commercially viable business and preparation of business plans for commencing new businesses or expansion of existing businesses as well as on ways and means of sourcing finances from the formal financial sector, were awarded loans by the HNB Urubokke branch, which is set up as a Gemi Pubuduwa branch to cater to the micro-scale entrepreneurs.
Among them, there were 17 female entrepreneurs, who are engaged in micro-scale food processing, running tea and spice nurseries and grocery shops in their locality. Male entrepreneurs are mainly engaged in tea and cinnamon cultivation and collection of tea leaves and cinnamon quills.
Citibank Sri Lanka Citi Country Officer Ravin Basnayake, Citibank Sri Lanka Head of Corporate Affairs Shanaka Waduge, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) Senior Assistant Secretary General Chandra D. Vithanage and HNB Assistant General Manager SME and Development Finance Jude Fernando took part in the event, representing their respective organisations.
Urubokke is the nearest town for the remote villages on the Southern Sri Lanka namely Beralapanathara, Morawaka, Waralla, Bengamuwa, Gomawila coming under the Pasgoda DS Division of the Matara district. The majority of the villagers are engaged in smallholder tea cultivation and cinnamon cultivation. Further, many of them are engaged in businesses such as micro-scale food processing, running tea and spice nurseries, running grocery shops and collection of tea leaves and cinnamon quill.
As the rural entrepreneurs in these areas needed assistance to improve commercial viability of their businesses, the Citi-CCC rural economic empowerment programme had chosen Beralapanathara and other nearby villages in order to strengthen their livelihoods through providing the necessary business and technical training, business development services and facilitating access to finance through linking them with the formal banking sector so that they can increase their disposable income.
Vithanage in his opening remarks highlighted that providing microfinance is nothing new as there are over 25 commercial banks and many microfinance institutes offering loans. However, this Citi-CCC rural economic empowerment programme offers much more than microfinance by focusing on providing an integrated package of services including providing capacity development, technical know-how, business development services and exposure to best practices business management in order to make their chosen business commercially viable, which will help them to access financial services from formal baking system. 
Speaking at the event, Fernando mentioned that HNB has been supporting the rural entrepreneurs through the Gemi Pubuduwa programme for nearly two decades and is privileged to partner with the Citi-CCC rural economic empowerment programme, which was funded by Citibank and implemented by the CCC.
On behalf of HNB, which is a private commercial bank helping the rural up and coming entrepreneurs in all parts of the country, he requested all beneficiaries of this programme to better use the financial facility offered on this day to help grow themselves and the economy. 
Basnayake stated that the corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes of Citibank globally are aimed at nurturing rural micro-scale businesses so that they could grow and contribute to the national economy of the respective countries. In line with Citi Banks global programmes, it was decided to implement this programme for economic empowerment of rural entrepreneurs, who have no adequate access to finance and technology, in a few remote villages of Sri Lanka.
Citi Bank is happy with the progress achieved so far in collaboration with the CCC and HNB, which have been very reliable project partners. He requested the beneficiaries to make use of the assistance provided through the programme to successfully conduct their business and uplift their living status while positively contributing towards the improvement of the local economy.

Custom raids increase govt. revenue in 2016
	
Smuggled conch shells on display following a raid
During the customs raids in the year 2016, customs officers of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) managed to seize several illegal imports smuggled into the country such as foreign currency, gold, jewellery, cigarettes, gems and narcotics.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror BIA Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said that the Sri Lanka Customs at BIA had been able to conduct a large number of raids during the year 2016, in comparison to the previous years. Basnayake also noted that the Customs treats all passengers equally, with the exception of the President.
During the raids, 30 incidents had been reported on foreign currency, 28 cases on gold and jewellery, 24 cases relating to cigarettes, 14 reports falling under offences relating to bio-diversity, four cases on narcotics, 8 cases relating to gem stones and 3 cases on medicinal drugs.
From the raids on foreign currency alone, the BIA Customs officers had been able to earn the government a revenue of Rs. 330 million.
A large stock of gemstones raided last year
There were 28 cases reported on gold and jewellery smuggling through which the government received an additional income of about Rs.15 million.
However when compared with the previous years, a slight decrease has been reported in the attempts to smuggle gold and jewellery out of the country. In contrast, countries like India and Singapore increased attempts of smuggling gold were reported.
Following a series of customs detections it was disclosed that smugglers had changed their method of exporting gold and jewellery into other countries. Incidents have been reported where smugglers had opted to move goods via sea routes instead of transporting goods by plane. Customs had also reported several incidents on gold smuggling in the northern region of Sri Lanka and from India, during the last year.
A stock of jewellery seized by officers
		24 incidents of illegal cigarette imports had been reported and the largest detections were made during the latter part of the year. The total value of cigarettes seized was an estimated Rs. 21 million.
According to our sources the reason behind the increase in illegal imports of cigarettes was the increase in demand following the VAT increment last year. Most of the illegal cigarette imports were from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha and China. The most amount of cigarettes imported during the end of last year was from China. The demand was attributed to the high quality of their cigarettes. It was noted that cigarettes could be imported at a very low price, however the resultant income when introduced to the Sri Lankan Market would eventually be very high. Due to this reason Customs had taken steps to impose huge fines for Chinese cigarette imports, with the intention of discouraging such efforts. Officials believe that the increase in the Chinese population in Sri Lanka, would have contributed to the increase in illegal cigarette imports, with a view to catering to the requirement of the Chinese people in the country.
Replicas of antiques were also seized during raids
		The Customs Bio-diversity, Cultural and National Heritage Protection Branch had conducted 14 raids at the BIA departure lounge. Endemic species legally protected in Sri Lanka; species of fauna and flora, were seized while attempting to be smuggled out of the country.
Eight gemstone raids had been done by the Customs during the past year and more than Rs.10 million was earned by the government as a result.
During the past year the BIA customs had also seized narcotics such as Cocaine, Heroin and Kerala Ganja on five occasions.
Uncut gemstones
		Two female citizens of Venezuela and Bolivia were arrested with 1,240 grams and 2,615 grams of cocaine respectively, in their possession, on two occasions. Most of the stocks of Kerala Ganja arrives in the island via sea routes while Sri Lanka has now become the distribution hub for Kerala Ganja. Small amounts of Kerala Ganja are transported by airlines.
There have been numerous inquiries from public as to the fate of narcotics seized by the Customs. As such, Sri Lanka Customs should adopt transparency mechanisms on this issue. However, it should also be noted that the Customs generally hands over any narcotic consignment to the Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) within 24 hours after the raid. At this point, the total responsibility with regard to the consignment is with the PNB.
On three occasions during the past year, the customs had seized common medicinal drugs freely available in the country, being illegally imported to Sri Lanka.

Htota port deal: no delay, hope to finalise within Jan.- Malik
	
Rejecting reports that there was a delay in signing agreements with the China Merchant Port Holdings over the Hambantota port, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said yesterday that they hoped to finalise and sign agreements in January.
He said the government has never said that it would enter into agreement with the Chinese Company to handover 80 per cent of the joint firm of the port on January 7. Minister Samarawickrama said it was the Southern Development Programme which would be launched on January 7.
There are three agreements to be signed to finalise the deal. The Cabinet approval was given only to the framework. We have yet to sign the joint venture agreement with the company, the lease agreement with the Ports authority and then the concession agreement between the company and the government. There is a lengthy process and discussions and we need to make sure that we get the full benefit out of these agreements, he told a news conference jointly held with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry.
Minister Samarawickrama also said there was no truth in reports that the agreements have been postponed due to the objection of President Maithripala Sirisena. He said the President had not opposed to the agreement and instructed to come in to an agreement which has full benefit to the country. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

I have no confidence in the CTF: Wijeyadasa
	
Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said today said he had no confidence in the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) appointed by the Prime Minister.
He said the CTF, which recommended the inclusion of at least one international judge on every bench set up to hear allegations of war crimes and the violation of human rights that had taken place during the final stages of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka.
The minister said some of the members of the CTF Committee were representatives of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO).
No one is complaining about the independence of the judiciary anymore. We have reconciliation and peace processes in place. This report, at this juncture, is totally unwarranted. Therefore, we dont have to follow these recommendations by the CTF, he told the Daily Mirror.
The minister said no one could force us to have foreign judges or make us do things for the sake of reconciliation and impartiality. If forcing continues, Sinhalese and Muslims will also be compelled to ask for justice for the crimes committed by the LTTE. They will ask for probes on terror attacks on the Dalada Maligawa, Sri Maha Bodhiya, Aranthalawa, Kattankudy and so on, he said.
He said even the UN could not force the government to include foreign judges, as it was against the UN charter to force or to pressure member states, be it large or small, powerful or weak. Having foreign judges in local tribunals is also a violation of the Constitution.
The minister said this situation was the result of the agreement signed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa with former UN Chief Ban Ki-moon.
The CTF presented its final report to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the Chairperson of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) on Tuesday at the Presidential Secretariat.
It was set up by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 26 last year to obtain public views, particularly those of affected communities across the country, on the reconciliation mechanisms proposed by the Government and incorporated in the Resolution on Sri Lanka at the UN Human Rights Council.

Kashmir an integral part of Pakistan: Sharif
	
Claiming that Kashmir was an integral part of Pakistan, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday needled India yet again by praising slain Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani as a vibrant and charismatic leader. 
Addressing the inaugural ceremony of a two-day international parliamentary seminar on Kashmir here, Mr. Sharif also praised the spirit and determination of the Kashmiri people for their struggle for the right to self-determination. 
Our hearts beat and sink with our Kashmiri brethren, Radio Pakistan quoted Mr. Sharif as saying. 
The world needs to tell India that enough is enough with regard to its policy towards Kashmir, he said, while asserting that Kashmir is an integral part of Pakistan. He claimed the martyrdom of vibrant and charismatic Kashmiri leader Burhan Wani has given a new turn to the Kashmiri movement. 
The Pakistan premier regretted the Indian aggression against Kashmiri people in the wake of protests triggered by the killing of Wani by security forces on July 8. 
Mr. Sharif said supporting the Kashmiri struggle for their right to self-determination was the faith of every Pakistani.
ISLAMABAD, (The Hindu), January 05.01.2017 - 
He said Pakistan would continue to extend moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their indigenous struggle and continue to shake the conscience of the international community for their rights.

A story is circulating in Kataragama about a devotee who had used a twenty rupee note to light his cigarette.
According to the Kataragama sales agent of Wijeya Newspapers Ltd., K. M Ariyasena, he had seen a person who had (after lunching on January 3rd at a nearby restaurant) come to his stall and bought a cigarette. He had then taken out a twenty rupee note from his pocket and lit it from a gas cooker nearby and then used it to light his cigarette. Then he had thrown away the burnt note.
Afterwards, he had driven away in a modern vehicle.
Many had observed this scene and been outraged. They had disparaged his action. They said, when so many beggars around the place stretch out their hands for a few rupees and only gett a two-rupee coin or a five-rupee coin, others light their cigarettes with twenty rupee notes.

A JVP-affiliated trade union attached to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) had demonstrated against the plan to hand over a 80 per cent stake of the Hambantota Port to a Chinese company to operate.
The Ceylon Ports General Employees Union (CPGEU) had staged their demonstration opposite the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) in Colombo, urging the government to reverse the decision taken in this regard.It requested the government not to hand over the ownership of the Hambantota Port to China Merchants Holdings (International) Co. Ltd in an agreement.
CPGEU Deputy General Secretary G. Niroshan said his union would stage yet another protest on Monday wearing black arm bands.We raised black flags throughout the Colombo Port. These protests were also held at the ports in Hambantota, Galle and Trincomalee. Our main objective is to force the government to cancel the agreement and to retain ownership of the Hambantota Port, he said. The government is attempting to hand over 15,000 hectares of land to Chinese companies which would virtually turn Hambantota into a Chinese colony. We will not allow these kinds of things to take place at any cost.
Because of the pressure exerted on it by the people, the government took a step back and postponed the signing of the agreement which was scheduled to take place today (7). It is indeed a victory for the people. However, we warn the government that we will continue with our protest until it abandons its plans to sign the agreement giving over control of the Hambantota Port to the Chinese, he added.

According to New Indian Express, 10 fishermen from Jegathapattinam fishing base in Pudukkottai who had set out in two boats were apprehended and remanded on Wednesday.
The Chief Minister said the latest incident of fishermen from Tamil Nadu being apprehended by Sri Lankan Navy has come at a time when the fishing community in Tamil Nadu was hopeful of a permanent solution following the ministerial meeting in Colombo on Monday.
A firm, clear, unequivocal and unambiguous message should be sent out by the Government of India to the Sri Lankan side to ensure that these trends are reversed and thereby clearly signalling that the Government of India is firmly committed to protect the livelihood of the poor and innocent fishermen from Tamil Nadu who are engaged in their traditional occupation and fishing in their traditional waters, Panneerselvam said in his letter to Narendra Modi on Thursday.

Super-Minister  Not a new  concept
	

Every government sans DS, SWRD and Chandrikas, had a de facto Super Minister in them. What Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attempts is only to legitimize the position. Would this understanding be a therapy for the near-anarchic, twin control state of affairs, that reigns today

During the reign of George I, the German King who ruled England in 1721, and did not speak Englishan appointment of a minister who knew both the languages as interpreter to cabinet became crucial. The term interpreter was too coarse to address a cabinet minister, hence it was agreed that Sir Robert Walpole, the minister [who was proficient in German] be assigned with the task , and to name him the Prime-Minister, introducing a new title to global Parliamentary democracy. Over the years gradually the monarchs powers were vested in the Prime Minister, making the king only a figurehead with PM wielding power in a cabinet of ministers. It is quite natural for the Maithri faction of SLFPers to raise concerns over the proposed Development [special provisions] Bill, fearing the idea as a smart manipulation by astute Wickremasinghe to weaken Executive Presidency through a transfer of powers to a Super-man. Further it could be seen as a remedy to obstacles in constitutional amendments. 
The Bill is not to help create a Super Minister as claimed by the opposition; Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama speaking to media said on Friday. He added, the Bill is not to create a Super Minister and the Government opposes creating such a post. We are trying to introduce an agency where the ministries will also be allied to provide the necessary facilities. According to JO sources a section of this bill says that cases cannot be filed against the officials appointed to these agencies. 
The governments move to create the post of Super Minister with omnipotent-like powers could even undermine the authority of President Maithripala Sirisena, the joint opposition said. This post will be vested with legal immunity, as per draft bill; therefore, if something goes wrong or the Super Minister makes an errant judgment, then no one will be able to take legal action against him.

DS Senanayake 1947-1952 and son Dudley in his two short-lived governments of 1952 and 1953, they did not groom a second-in-command or develop favourites. SWRD Bandaranaike followed in 1956 C P de Silva undisputedly occupied the number two slot, both in the SLFP and in the government, but did not enjoy any special powers. 
However, in 1960, Sirimavo being a new-comer to politics obviously needed a trustworthy lieutenant  the ideal person she could not find within the party hierarchy; hence she was compelled to turn to the family. The Prime Minster Sirimavo engaged the services of her own brother Dr. Mackie Rattwatte as her Confidential Secretary and husbands cousins son, young advocate Felix Dias Banaranaike in to her cabinet and entrusted the Finance portfolio. The 29 year old brilliant lawyer remained the invincible Super-Minister during both the terms, 1960-64 and again from 1970-1977, wielding power and creating autocratic tendencies that led to the downfall of Sirimavo in 1977.
Sirimavos cabinet was more organized and less faction-ridden than SWRDs, but the chain of command of leadership within it was affected by the prominence enjoyed by Felix Dias, who had no parliamentary experience. Sirimavos reliance on Felix stemmed from personal reasonsimportance attached to kinship and the fact that he was the only debater of the first rank in the cabinet. The senior members like C P de Silva and Maithripala Senanayake with long record of parliamentary and cabinet experience were offended by the power and influence of Felix. So long as he won the confidence of the PM there was little that they could do to assert their own authority within. In addition to Minister of Finance, he also held the important portfolio of Deputy Minister to Sirimavos Defence and External Affairs. Like JRJ in presenting his 1962 budget he proposed a cut in rice subsidy. However opposition from sections within the government led to his resignation as Finance Minister. 

JR Jayewardene
J.R. Jayewardene, the undisputed number two and the only contender for leadership demanded the creation of a special ministry called State for him with no specifically assigned tasks but with powers to interact/interfere with any ministry. Dudley Senanyake in 1965-1970, focused on agriculture sect, leaving the rest of the administration in the hands of JRJ the Super minister. Unlike in other two Super-ministers, JRJ enjoyed the luxury of having a close relationship with the head of the state only for a short time. Junius Richard, the orator stunned the world at San Franciscos Japanese Peace Treaty in September 1951, according to world headlines; 

the young minister from Ceylon was mobbed by well-wishers who insisted on shaking hands. The voice of free Asia, eloquent, melancholy and strong with the lilt of an Oxford accent, dominated the conference todayNew York Times: Sep 6 1951. 

But his loyalty to his leader and sincerity was questionable. JRs association with Esmond Wickremesinghe made the PM suspicious of his second in command. Dudley thought they were conspiring against him to take over the leadership. JRs own position within government and his once friendly position with Dudley Senanayake sharply deteriorated. This even led to a cabinet reshuffle in 1968. The PM took away the responsibilities of JR in Broadcasting without even discusing the matter with him and created a separate ministry to deal with the subject. The Super-minister status of JRJ lasted only three and a half years, whereas in the case of Felix and Basil they enjoyed it during the full terms of respective governments. 
Basil Rajapaksa, the Super-Minister
Basil Rajapaksas extraordinary ministry did not make an issue with most of the critics of Super Ministry bill. Under the Rajapaksa regime Basil being the Economic development Minister acted as a super-minister interfering with every ministry. He was able to take decisive conclusions regarding the economy. All those who feel for the well-being of the UNP-SLFP unity government and the proponents of yahapalanaya must oppose the Super Ministry bill. If the leaders of it are allowed to indulge in self-aggrandizement, like Rajapaksa regime it will become extremely unpopular and collapse. It will definitely be the kiss of death for the alliance. If the powers of the President are going to be betrayed with the appointment of a super-minister, it will create a serious situation. An important responsibility of the Treasury to decide as to which investor should be given tax holidays and which investor should not would come under the Super-minister as per clauses already incorporated in the bill, means it obviously will exceed the authority exercised by Basil in the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. 
The only positive factor in it is the official introduction of the position, Super-minister; perhaps whoever it is, could match the record set by Sir Robert Walpole three centuries ago and Sri Lanka can reserve a folio in Guinness Book of Records!

Turkey questions US coalition presence at Incirlik Air Base
	

(RT.COM) 05.01.2017- Top Turkish officials have questioned the use of Incirlik Air Base by the US-led coalition, citing a confidence crisis with Washington and inadequate support for Turkeys ground forces in Syria. 
The US-led coalition does little to provide aerial support to Turkish troops deployed in Syria as part of the Operation Euphrates Shield, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told state-run Anadolu news agency on Wednesday. 
What purpose are you serving if you do not provide aerial support against Daesh [Islamic State] in the most sensitive operation for us he added. 
In his Wednesday statement, Cavusoglu also accused Washington of aiding Kurdish militias  considered terrorists by Ankara  and preferring terrorist organizations over its ally [Turkey]. 
His remarks were echoed by Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik, who said that the lack of US air support for Turkeys operation in al-Bab raises questions about the American presence at Incirlik.
