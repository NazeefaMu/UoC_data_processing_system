[Buddhist Spectrum]
From Religion to Dhamma

There are many stories in Rasavahini written in the Polonnaruwa era to the effect that Buddhists living in Sri Lanka in the olden days who were following in the path of nibbana were in the habit of conducting all night dhamma sermons. One of the main reasons as to why the dhamma has spread throughout the world at present is that the vipassana meditation techniques preserved by the bhikkus of Thailand and Burma from generation to generation were passed on to the lay yogis and yoginis. As a result laymen were convinced that they can attain nibbana in this very life. It is pleasing and encouraging to note that the traditional system of conducting long sermons is reestablished in Sri Lanka once again and more and more people engage in vipassana meditation. As a result there is a possibility of Sri Lanka becoming a dhmmadeepa once again.
The picture here is of the sermon on Satipatthana sutta delivered by Venerable Udadumbara Kashyapa, the chief Kammattanacharya of Mahava Ihalagama Gallewa Vihara Aranya Senasana, on 5th September 2015 at Mihilaka Medura at BMICH. This sermon will be telecasted on 27th September 2015 through the Buddhist Channel at 9.00 pm.
This is the second sermon of this series and the organizers wish to continue this in the future as well. It would be most appropriate to support this endeavor since it is in line with the constitutional provision that the state shall give Buddhism the foremost place.
