TNA MP Shanthi Skandarajah today requested the government to allow those in the Northern Province to commemorate their war heroes by visiting the cemeteries in which they were buried.

Ms Skandarajah who was speaking during the committee stage debate in Parliament today said residents in the Province should be allowed to visit cemeteries and commemorate their war heroes.

She also stressed the need to restore cemeteries in which the war heroes were buried.

She went on to say that proper programmes should be launched to help women who were widowed by the war.

"These women should be empowered to start self employment schemes and not be obliged t work for others,” she said. (By Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
