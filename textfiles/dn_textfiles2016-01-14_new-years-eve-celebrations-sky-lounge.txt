New Year's Eve celebrations at Sky Lounge

Ushering the New Year in sophistication and glamour, The Kingsbury Sky Lounge was the venue for the most exclusive party in town. Set against the back drop of a brilliantly lit Galle Face green, Colombo city harbour and the vast Indian Ocean the venue came alive to the sounds of DJ Wendell.
The atmosphere was electric as revelers indulged in unlimited premium beverages, cocktails, oysters, delectable canapés, succulent roasts, sushi and much more.
As the countdown ended at midnight, there was no better place in the city to enjoy the spectacular fireworks light up the sky.
The party gathered momentum and continued to rock until the early hours ending with a scrimptions breakfast buffet to usher in the New Year in style.
