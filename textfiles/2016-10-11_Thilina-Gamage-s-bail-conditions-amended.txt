Former Colombo Additional Magistrate Thilina Gamage's bail condition directing him to report to the CID once a week was today amended by the Colombo High Court.

He has now been directed to report to the CID on the last Sunday of every month.

Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyathilaka made the new direction after considering the motion filed by Mr. Gamage requesting that his bail condition be amended.

He was released on bail after being produced in Court on charges of raring an elephant in contravention of the Public Property and Fauna and Flora Acts. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
