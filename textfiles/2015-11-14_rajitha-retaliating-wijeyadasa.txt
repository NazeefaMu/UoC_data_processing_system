Rajitha retaliating: Wijeyadasa


	

Buddhasasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe claimed Minister Rajitha Senaratne was accusing him falsely that he was protecting Avant Garde, as an act of revenge as the latter lost his parliamentary seat in 1994 as a result of a case filed by him in the Appeal Court.
Minister Rajapakshe said he never appeared on behalf of Avant Garde but he only spoke of the appropriateness of the Attorney General’s decisions.
"Rajitha Senaratne is always blaming other ministers when speaking as the cabinet spokesman and the President had advised him on such matters. He was appointed as a national list member in 1994 by the present Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Then he was a consultant to the Health Advisory Committee. During this period he continued to supply dental medicine and equipment to the army," he said.
The Minister also said he filed a case against corruptions committed during this period. He was found guilty and expelled from the parliament membership.
He said a cabinet spokesman should be intelligent and speak decently. (Diana Udayangani)
