Prez has power to disclose names of the 118: Gammanpila


	

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said today there was no legal barrier to disclose the names of the 118 individuals who had obtained funds from Arjuna Aloyisus and pointed out that President Maithripala Sirisena had the power to order their release.  

He claimed there was political pressure that prevented the names being released.

“A Presidential Commission does not possess the authority to give orders to the President. It makes recommendations. Hence, the President has the power to release the full report of the Presidential Commission on the controversial bond scam,” the MP said.   

“We can’t fathom as to why President's Secretary Austin Fernando sought the Attorney General’s opinion on releasing the full report when the President has the power on that,” Gammanpila added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
