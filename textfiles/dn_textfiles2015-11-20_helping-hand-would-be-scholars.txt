A helping hand for would-be scholars

Twenties is a prime period in one’s life. So it is for the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation (SLAFF) that celebrates its 23rd anniversary of scholarship award ceremony. About 137 new students will be eligible for the scholarship in 2015. The ceremony will be held at D S Senanayaka Central College Auditorium, Ampara, on November 20 at 3 pm under the patronage of Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Athukorala and Primary Industries Minister Daya Dharmapala Gamage. Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, State Minister Champika Premadasa, Former Minister P Dayaratne, Parliamentarians Sriyani Wijewickrama and Wimalaweera Disanayaka will also grace the occasion.
Agonshu’s chief donor Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera founded the Agonshu sect in Japan. Japan holds reputation for being home to a number of Buddhist sects. Agonshu is a grouping of Northern Mahayana, Southern Theravada and Tibetan esoteric Buddhism.
Historical evidence indicates how Buddhism arrived in Japan officially in the sixth century. It was multi-theism that existed before the arrival of Buddhism. Buddhism was Korea’s gift to Japan. To Korea it was a gift from China. Apparently Buddhism linked these three countries: Korea, China and Buddhism.
Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation was inaugurated in 1994 under the patronage of Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama. The Thera will turn 95 in January, 2016. A series of programmes to offer him blessings will be held following the scholarship awards ceremony.
The scholarship is the only programme offered to students who have failed their Grade V scholarship.
“If we just neglected them, the nation would have been deprived of many scholars.” SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapathirana noted.
Under its Agonshu scholarship prgoramme, SLAFF has awarded 12915 Annual Educational Scholarships and 33 Annual Scholarships for medical students so far. At its 23rd Annual Scholarship Awarding Ceremony, 735 scholarships are to be awarded to students from all parts of the island for 2016.
The scholarship programme has produced doctors, engineers, university lecturers and other scholars. The scholarship, which includes three uniforms, shoes and socks, and exercise books in addition to Malalasekara English Sinhala Dictionary, feeds its holder till they pass A-Ls. Medical College students will get a coupon. Every province, except for North, has been benefited by the scholarship programme.
Once the scholarship is offered, a strict procedure is followed. The education level is considered in addition to the low income level. Divisional coordinators are appointed to monitor the scholarship holders.
“There are times when some exploit these scholarships. We are at liberty to get rid of them immediately. Scholarship is an invaluable asset, and we cannot afford to waste it away.
The inspection for the scholarship holders will also be done. SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapathirana himself takes the trouble to go through each and every exercise book to check on the scholarship holders’ progress. “We make it an opportunity to talk to parents individually too. Some parents have financial issues as well as other material problems.”
The New Year festivities are done every Sinhala Tamil New year to gather all scholarship holders. In addition to scholarships, SLAFF makes use of its funds to help dilapidated temples. Addarapathirana knows value of scholarship since he is a Grade V scholarship recipient. He initiated his career as a teacher in Matara.
“I studied under harsh conditions. I still remember how our temple used to be. Even after 20 years, the temple was still like that. The sermon hall was beyond repair. We could build a two-storied building for various purposes.”
The foundation has built over 200 buildings mostly meant for schools. The Buddha’s birth, according to Japanese calendar, came to pass on April 8. The SLAFF had planted a Bo tree in Thanthirimale to commemorate the great event.
Agonshu’s social responsibility is not confined to Sri Lanka. Various other projects are implemented in Italy, Thailand, USA, France, Israel and Bhutan. Most Ven Kiriyama Thera, however, had remarked that it is in Sri Lanka that the Agonshu projects are carried out good and proper. Recognizing Addara Pathirana’s painstaking as well as instrumental role as Director General, he was further appointed as the Advisor for South Asian Affairs of the Agonshu Sect.
“This is a great achievement for us Sri Lankans. We could genuinely be happy as we have several outcomes. The achievements of our scholarship recipients at public exams are one. In addition the Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Special Vocational Training Centre in Matara district has given vocational training to 1240 youths. We could also offer assistance to over 200 Buddhist temples.” SLAFF Director General Somasiri Addarapathirana added.
