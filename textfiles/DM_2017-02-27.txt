AIA Group expands new business despite China curbs
	
REUTERS: AIA Group Ltd, the worlds third-largest life insurer by market value, said on Friday new business rose 28 percent in 2016, buoyed by strong customer demand in its main markets in China and Hong Kong.
Value of new business rose to US $ 2.75 billion for the year ended November 30, from US $ 2.20 billion the previous year, the company said in a statement. The category measures expected profit from new premiums and is a key indicator of growth.
Annualised new premiums rose 32 percent to US $ 5.12 billion in 2016.
The insurers value of new business in Hong Kong grew by 42 percent in 2016, driven by higher demand from its local clients as well as increased purchases from mainland Chinese customers, it said.
The Hong Kong life insurance market has seen very strong demand from customers in mainland China in the last one year, with many looking for better products and overseas investment opportunities to cushion the impact of a weakening yuan.
In the first nine months of 2016, mainland Chinese visitors contributed to 37 percent of total regular first-year premiums sold in Hong Kong, compared with 22 percent in the same period a year ago, according to brokerage Daiwa Capital Markets.
This resulted in Chinese authorities tightening norms for such purchases to curb capital outflows. In the latest move, use of Chinas hugely popular UnionPay cards to pay for saving-type insurance products was prohibited in October.
While insurance analysts have said there were other ways for mainland Chinese buyers to pay for insurance purchases in Hong Kong, worries about more regulatory tightening measures to curb such purchases have weighed on investor sentiment.
Shares in AIA dropped 15 percent in the December quarter and were down 6 percent for 2016. It was their first annual decline since the insurers market debut in Hong Kong in 2010.
China and Hong Kong together accounted for about half of new business growth globally at AIA, which was originally founded in Shanghai nearly 100 years ago and was the first foreign insurer to obtain a licence in China.
AIAs other major markets include Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia - the Southeast Asian countries that have become a battleground for foreign insurers attracted by the regions lower insurance penetration levels.
The company said it would pay dividends of 63.75 Hong Kong cents per share to shareholders, an increase of 25 percent.
Operating profit after tax rose 15 percent to US $ 3.98 billion.
AIA also announced the setting up of an internal asset management company based in Singapore, which will provide services to investment teams across the region.

As greedy TN trawlers steal fish, Northern fishermen live in agony
	
Detain Indian vessels until Tamil Nadu trawler issue is sorted out, Northern fisherman request Minister 
The Tamil Nadu (TN) trawlers illegally fishing in Sri Lankan maritime waters have become a life threatening issue to Northern fishing communities. 
Tamil Nadu fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters have been a decades-long conflict between two fishing communities. SL Navy has been arresting Tamil Nadu fishermen and vessels, while India has been arresting Sri Lankan fishermen. Yet, neither of the Governments is interested in finding a successful solution to this issue, as it seems. 
The bilateral talks held in December 30 and 31st of 2016 in Delhi India and January 2017 in Colombo - Sri Lanka, between Indian Agriculture Minister - Union Governments and Sri Lankan Fisheries minister the trawling issue has not been addressed successfully. 
In both meetings Sri Lankan fishermans position was not compromised by Sri Lankan delegation fishing community leaders said. 
After the first round of talks the trawling issue was reduced a bit and after the second round, illegal trawling had increased again as if they have taken it for granted. Despite the talks, TN fish workers as they called themselves, were coming. Since the last negotiation Sri Lankan Navy had caught 61 TN fish workers, some of them had been released while some have been retained. The illegal vessels are increasing in numbers as they were found to be 125 recently. TN fishing trawlers would destroy Sri Lankas marine resources off the coast of Talaimannar, Delft, Nainathivu, Alanaithivu, Eluvathivu and Mullaithivu. 


And Sri Lankan governments about northern fishing communitys livelihood and the Sri Lankan sovereignty in Palk Strait, the Tamil Nadu trawler owners are still sending their vessels in to the area by crossing International Maritime Border line (IMBL). They are coming on specific three - day a week, on which northern fishing community step aside because poachers damage fishermans fishing gear and sometimes take them away. 
Northern fishing communities warn that this would complicate the issue further. 
Tamil Nadu trawler owners do not accept they are sending their vessels illegally and we have caught them in action and provided the evidence, one fisherman said. 
The Sri Lankan fishing community did not go fishing in this northern area because in the past years, as there was a war going on in the region and they did not have enough boats and fishing gear. 
Fishing in these areas had been banned for Sri Lankans by Sri Lankan authorities. As the situation remained so the TN fishermen came and got the harvest belonging to Sri Lankan fishermen. 
The President had informed the Navy to catch illegal trawlers in northern seas, we are grateful of that; yet the Navy doesnt have facilities to arrest those huge trawlers. Even though the Navy is given power, they can only do minor arrests. 
The Mullathivu fishing community leader Mariyarasa said that the great prawn season has started in Mullathivu yet Tamil Nadu trawlers stride and steal the harvest. 
Sri Lanka is considered a best quality prawn found area in the world. Why cannot we harvest the prawn that lies in our fishing waters he questions. 
our problems are not addressed because we are a minor community in the North. If it was a issue in South, the responsible people would have taken quick action to solve these issues. And if the south needs our help, we are always ready to support, they said.

Request from northern fishing community to Fisheries Minister
1. Arrest, charge, prosecute  and if guilty - fine or imprison Tamil Nadu boat owners or their agents under the Regulation (Foreign Fishing Vessel Act) 1979
2. Immediately release and repatriate Tamil Nadu fishworkers on board the vessels and any detained previously under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act of 1941
3. Refuse to release any Tamil Nadu trawler arrested and detained by the Sri Lankan authorities until Tamil Nadu trawler owners stop sending their vessels to fish illegally in the fishing grounds of northern Sri Lankan fishermen
District heads of Fishermens Co-operative Society Unions federation of Jaffna, Mullathivu, Kilinochchi and Mannar had signed this petition they had sent to the fisheries minister on behalf of the northern fishing community. They request a solution from both parties. 
What is bottom trawling
Bottom trawling is done with a huge net and a scraper attached to it that is designed to scrape everything, and scraping every single species, corals and entire sea bed. More than 100 species are thrown back to the sea after bottom trawling. Scientists consider this as the most destructive fishing gear in history. 
According to the European Commission - Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) depletes fish stocks, destroys marine habitats, distorts competition, puts honest fishers at an unfair disadvantage, and weakens coastal communities, particularly in developing countries.(www.ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/illegal_fishing_en) 

Fishing Act 59 of 1979
According to the fishing act, Part II includes - CONTROL OVER FISHING AND RELATED ACTIVITIES BY FOREIGN FISHING BOATS IN SRI LANKA WATERS
4. Prohibition of fishing and related activities by Foreign Fishing Boats.
Subject to the provisions of section 12, no Foreign Fishing Boat shall be used for fishing or related activities in Sri Lanka waters except under the authority of a permit issued under section 6.
5. Foreign Fishing Boats entering Sri Lanka waters without a permit to stow gear.
Where any Foreign Fishing Boat enters Sri Lanka waters otherwise than under the authority of a permit issued under section 6, the fishing gear of such boat shall, at all times while it is in such waters, be kept stowed in the prescribed manner.
6. Foreign Fishing Boat permit.
(1) The Secretary or any person specially authorised by him may, with the approval of the Minister, on application made therefore and payment of the prescribed fee issue a permit in respect of any Foreign Fishing Boat, authorising that boat to be used for such fishing and related activities, in such area or areas of Sri Lanka waters, and during such periods, as may be specified in the permit. Every such permit shall be in the prescribed form.
(2) Every application for a permit shall be made to the Secretary in the prescribed form and shall contain the prescribed particulars.

It was peaceful before Indian trawling
Dr H.S.S.K Haputhantri -Head of Marine Biological Resources Division - NARA
We have a plan to carry out a survey to identify the type of impact on sea bottom and habitats done by Indian fishing trawlers. But as their catch is not landed in our area, it is difficult to have measurements. he said. 
He also noted that not only Tamil Nadu fishing community were engaged in trawling in our northern sea, but also Sri Lankan fishermen; but the destruction is not massive compared to Indian bottom trawlers. 
Opining on the environmental impact of trawling in sea, he said; All the habitats and the diversity is destroyed. Especially, coral reefs that provide home to many species and sea grass will be eradicated by trawling and the sea grass is crucial to the endemic species like Dugong. Environment destruction also affects Whales, Turtles and Dolphins (in Mannar). Long term effects are much more common in this kind of situations. 
He noted that collected data on bottom trawling in 2016, is being analysed now, and from several months, the data will be out and he emphasised that still they could have only the Sri Lankan side, not Indian side. 
We are planning to carry out an underwater survey on sea bottom to see the scale of destruction has happened. he exclaimed. 
It is said that Indian and Sri Lankan fishing communities fished peacefully in north sea until the TN fisherman began using the harmful trawling to catch fish after finding prawns and shrimp are highly marketable. Sri Lankan fisherman still use their traditional fishing gear and they are unable to have profits, not even catch a proper harvest because of profit loving and highly unsustainable minded TN counterparts. With the damage done to the marine environment by bottom trawling, they fear the existence of next generation of marine life and their own occupied in fishing.

Divorced women lie in graves to exorcise  marriage demons
	

China, (Daily Mail, London), 25.02.2017 - Call it divorce counselling with a morbid twist. 
A businesswoman in south west China has begun offering grave meditations, which allows divorcees to exorcise their marriage demons. Students are invited to lie in freshly-dug graves to reflect and develop the ability to be more self-reliant. 
First time attendees are encouraged to shout out their frustrations and disappointments.The class was founded by Liu Taijie in the municipality of Chongqing. 
She said: You have to be a strong woman. What if your husband abandons you and finds a stepmother for your kid. In that case, how are you going to survive.The class has attracted an almost cult-like devotion from its students. 
One of them said: When I was lying in the grave, I felt like I was dead. I just realised I wasted a lot of time on meaningless stuff.

Govt. to set up agri marketing unit to help farmers: PM
	
Government is hoping to set up a national agricultural marketing authority to help farmers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
He told those who had gathered at the opening of a new office of the Rural Economy Ministry that the Government would get the private sector involved in it as well.
The Ministry of Rural Economy has to move away from traditional thinking and on move in this direction is the setting up of a national agricultural marketing authority with the objective of helping our farmers, the Prime Minister said. The debt we have inherited amounts to more than Rs 400 billion which has to be repaid within the next ten years. Domestic debt is much higher. The revenue will have to used to repay these debts. We have to think out of the box. We need innovative ideas. Countries such as China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam have achieved development by using new ideas. While these countries have changed, Sri Lanka is stuck in one place after the end of the war.
He said the country needs peace for the economy to flourish.
We have allowed the Tamils to sing the national anthem in their language. Earlier it was sung only in Sinhala. Today we can sing the national anthem in both languages and salute the national flag together. We are trying to bring about reconciliation through little things, the Prime Minister said.
He said the country has to focus on livestock development with good varieties of cattle being provided to farmers. "We intend giving a glass of milk to children in rural schools. Instead of doing so with milk powder, we need to focus on providing them with fresh milk. Another objective is to convert poultry to an export industry. We can get a market for this produce, the Prime Minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Govt. will bar PCs from discussing separatism: PM
	
The government intends to place a bar on the provincial councils from discussing separatism, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
Mr. Wickremesinghe, who was speaking at the opening of the new 'Sanghawasa' at Nagarukkaramaya in Kotikawatte, said the government intended including a clause to that effect in the new Constitution.
He said devolution of power in the new constitution would be based on the existing provincial council system.
"The existing system will be used as a frame for devolving power in the new constitution. Some allege that the government is going to introduce federalism, but I aver that no such system will be introduced. The government does not intend to divide the nation," he said.
He said a grama rajya system, too, would be introduced through the new Constitution.
He reiterated that the status which Buddhism enjoys today will not be changed. (Yohan Perera)

Minister Sarath Amunugama said yesterday the government would go on till 2021, when the next presidential election is scheduled to be held, though some opposition politicians say otherwise to please their supporters.

The minister made these remarks to the media after a ceremony in Peradeniya.
MP Wimal Weerawansas attempt to become independent in Parliament is in vain, as it is not possible for a member elected from a political party to do so. He will be unsuccessful -- as the Muslim Congress was earlier, when it failed to get independent status after being elected from a major party, he said.
He said the Joint Opposition had begun to split into different groups, and some were trying to take advantage of this rift. Karuna Amman had said he would strengthen Mahinda Rajapaksa with the Tamil votes in the North. Whatever they say, they cannot prevent the progress of the government, he said.
He said everyone has the freedom to form parties, contest in elections and have their own policies; but they cannot stop the present government. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)

New S&P SL 20 entrant Teejay Lanka opens trading at CSE
	

Teejay Lanka PLC rang the opening bell to commence trading at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recently. The bell ringing ceremony was organised by the CSE to celebrate Teejay as the latest addition to the S&P Sri Lanka 20 Index.
The index includes the 20 largest stocks by total market capitalization, which meet the minimum size, liquidity and financial viability thresholds. 
Teejay CEO and Managing Director Sriyan De Silva Wijeyeratne, CFO Salman Nishtar, COO Operations Pubudu De Silva, COO Marketing and Business Development Rodney Arland, COO Engineering, Planning and Special Projects Janaka Gamage, COO Commercial Moiz Rehmanjee and DGM Corporate Communications and CSR Samadhi Weerakoon were present at the ceremony while the CSE was represented by Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka, CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike and the senior management.
Commenting on the prospects for the company and the industry, Wijeyeratne said, The core fundamentals that impact our business are looking very strong for the longer term. We are very bullish about the prospects of the industry and to that extent, we welcome engagement with the stock exchange and investors, as we pursue to become a much larger, more significant business.
While acknowledging that the listing sparked a thought process that helped the company to start thinking in a more corporate and global sense, Wijeyeratne stated that the capital market was a vital contributor to the organisations growth over the years.
Pointing out one such example he added, When we set our sights on becoming one of the largest fabric manufacturers of South Asia, one of the tools we leveraged for our acquisition in India was shares, where 50 percent of that acquisition was through shares.
The fact that we were public gave the company the ability to leverage on the opportunity as part of our growth momentum. Currently we have invested in synthetic capabilities in Sri Lanka. The capacity expansion ongoing in India is the largest the group has ever undertaken and with GSP around the corner, we are gearing for the next wave of growth.
Kulatilaka congratulated Teejay on the companys rise and stated that both the exchange and investors alike have benefited by the presence of an emerging player in the manufacturing sector in the market.
He went on to add that the companys listing helped enhance the CSEs value proposition, by adding variety to the market and a considerable level of interest among investors.
Teejay is a producer of value-added knitted fabric, specializing in the manufacture of high-quality, well-knitted and dyed stretch fabrics.
The company is a major supplier to apparel manufacturers throughout Asia and end-chain leading retailers such as Victorias Secret, Intimissimi, Calvin Klein and Marks and Spencer.
One of the key milestones in its journey was achieved in August 2016 where the company was recognized by Forbes as one of Asias 200 best under a billion category.

Oscars pulls a Miss Universe
	
Celebrations by the La La Land cast and crew were cut short, when it was revealed that compeers made a mistake when announcing the best picture at the Oscars.
Moonlight directed by Barry Jenkins in fact won the award for the best movie at the ceremony.
According to the BBC, compeer Warren Beatty had been handed over the previous winner's envelope containing a card saying Emma Stone- La La Land, resulting in the error.
The team from La La Land was in the middle of its acceptance speeches when the mistake was discovered.
Price Water house Cooper, the accountancy firm responsible for counting the ballots, said in a statement: "We sincerely apologise to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture.
"The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred."
Musical La La Land won six Oscars including best director and best actress. Moonlight also won adapted screenplay and best supporting actor.
Damien Chazelle, director of La La Land, became the youngest filmmaker to win a best director Oscar at the age of 32.
Beatty's Bonnie and Clyde co-star Faye Dunaway announced La La Land had taken the best picture prize but then the musical's producer Jordan Horowitz announced there had been a mistake.
He said: "This is not a joke. Moonlight is best picture," and showed the camera the card that revealed the winner.
Two La La Land producers had already given their acceptance speeches before the mistake was revealed.
Host Jimmy Kimmel joked that he knew he would mess up compering the ceremony, and added: "Personally I blame Steve Harvey for this," referring to Harvey's mistake in announcing the Miss Universe winner in 2015.
Beatty returned to the microphone to say: "I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said 'Emma Stone, La La Land', and that is why I took such a long look at Faye and at you.
"I wasn't trying to be funny. This is Moonlight for best picture."
The film's director Barry Jenkins said: "Very clearly even in my dreams this can't be true. But to hell with it because this is true. It's true, its not fake,."
Paying tribute to the team behind La La Land for the way they handled the mistake, he said: "We have been on the road with these guys and it was so gracious and so generous of them."
Emma Stone, who won the coveted best actress prize, said backstage: "I'm so excited for Moonlight. Of course it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land and I would love to win best picture. But we are so excited for Moonlight. I think it is one of the best films of all time.
She also said that she still had the envelope for best actress in her hand, although there are always two envelopes (one for back-up), which might explain why the mistake occurred.
La La Land also picked up best cinematography, best score and best original song for City of Stars. It also won best production design.
Manchester by the Sea won two awards - one of them was for best original screenplay.

Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC (PABC), a mid-sized bank, reported earnings of Rs.4.65 a share or Rs.346 million for the October-December quarter, up 19 percent year-on-year (YoY), the interim financial accounts showed. 
The net interest income stemming from core banking operations for the quarter expanded 19 percent YoY to Rs.1.24 billion.
The net fee and commission income rose 51 percent YoY to Rs.365.65 million.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the bank reported earnings of Rs.4.24 a share or Rs.1.25 billion, up 20 percent YoY.The bank attributed the performance to a combination of factors including the timely repricing of assets and liabilities, recalibration of assets into more remunerative areas, better recoveries and asset quality, the relatively strong growth in loans and receivables and better management of costs in all areas of the banking business during the year.
The banks loans and receivables growth moderated to 14 percent level during the year. The total gross loans and receivables book stood at Rs.98.5 billion as of 2016 end.Despite the slowdown in the growth in loans and advances, the bank managed to expand its asset base by 20.1 percent bringing the total asset base up just under Rs.130 billion. The gross non-performing loan ratio improved to 4.74 percent from 4.84 percent YoY and the net non-performing loan ratio too followed suit by declining to 2.95 percent from 3.26 percent.The bank managed to increase its deposit base by almost 18 percent to Rs. 91.46 billion.
However, the cost of deposits went up significantly because of the high-cost medium-term deposits rose much faster while the low-cost, current and savings accounts (CASA) took a dip, Pan Asia Bank said in an earnings release.
The total operating expenses rose by 18.24 percent to Rs.3.52 billion during the year under review predominantly due to increase in staff-related expenses and other overhead expenses due to the impact of tax hikes and inflationary pressures. As a result, the cost-to-income ratio, the key efficiency matrix in the banking sector, slightly deteriorated to 56.03 percent. The banks return on equity (ROE) stood at 19.97 percent, above the industry average of 17.3 percent. During the year, the Tier I capital adequacy ratio improved to 8.37 percent from 7.82 percent YoY due to the relatively slow asset growth compared to the strong internal capital generation during the period under review.
Meanwhile, the bank is also in the process of raising equity over Rs.2 billion via a rights issue, which will issue one new ordinary share for every two existing ordinary shares held.
However, the banks total capital adequacy weakened slightly to 11.40 percent from 12.30 percent YoY.
Business magnate Dhammika Perera as the single largest shareholder holds 29.99 percent of Pan Asia Bank.

Proper security may have prevented the shooting: Swaminathan
	
There was a possibility of preventing the shooting at Kalutara if the police were able to provide sufficient security to the Black Maria, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan said today.
In a media release, he said the usual practice adopted when transporting leading underworld criminalswas underspecial police protection.
When asked to do so, the Police has informed that they were unable to provide securitybecause of the lack of sufficient police personnel to do so, the minister said.
However, it was reported that the prison guards had transported the prisoners in twoBlack Maria.
Meanwhile, the minister said a separate investigation would be carried out by a three-member committee consisting of former Magistrate Rumi Mansoor, Former Additional Secretary to the Defence Minister, S. Medawewa and former DIG GaminiNavaratne.
He said the Ministry Secretary was instructed to pay compensation to the families of the prison guards killed in the incident. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SL doctor who killed abusive husband, granted parole
	
The Sri Lankan-born doctor, who killed her abusive husband in Western Australia's Mid-West, had been granted parole and would be released this week from prison, the ABC News reported today.
Doctor Chamari Liyanage has been serving a four-year prison term after she was convicted of the manslaughter of her husband and fellow doctor Dinendra Athukorala.
Liyanage bludgeoned Dr. Athukorala with a mallet while he slept at their Geraldton home in June 2014.
During Liyanage's trial, the court heard the couple's five-year marriage was defined by the "worst kind" of escalating sexual, physical and emotional abuse.
The court heard Athukorala kept 13 terabytes of encrypted child exploitation and bestiality images.
Liyanage was acquitted of the more serious charge of murder.
Her legal counsel, George Giudice, confirmed her application for parole was approved by the Prisoners' Review Board.
"My client Dr. Liyanage tells me her parole was approved today so she's eligible for release into the community," he said.
"She'll be able to be released in the next couple of days in Geraldton. She's relieved and very happy.Of course, she was eligible for release back in July but she decided not to take that up, because there was a threat that she'd be sent to a detention centre, he said.
"But that problem's now overcome, she's permitted to stay in Australia pursuant to the visa and she's very happy about that, she's elated actually."
Liyanage had been eligible to apply for parole since June, but there were fears that if it was granted, she could face deportation as her visa was cancelled while behind bars.
Last month however, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection revoked the cancellation of her visa after considering her case.
Liyanage has also appealed against her conviction and sentence, which the Supreme Court is still deliberating.
"It doesn't mean anything at the moment, but if she's successful in her appeal, her parole order will automatically just terminate," Mr. Giudice said.
Liyanage has been in custody since June 2014, and her sentence is due to be completed in June of next year.

## Title: Sunil Santha is Sinhala Music -Monash Academic

Sunil Santha is Sinhala Music -Monash Academic
	
Rituals and Music in the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy, Sri Lanka, was Donaldsons doctoral thesis at Monash University for research on which he visited Sri Lanka in 1996. From my Hotel room close to the Temple of the tooth Relic, in Kandy, I listen to the beating of drums in carrying out Thewawa. On carrying out fieldwork in Kandy two decades ago, that I encountered the songs of Sunil, the man who invented Sinhala music for a modern age Dr Tony Donalso

Dr. Donaldson noticed a close link between Thewava, the Dalada Maligawa ritual drummer music and Sunil Santhasand the uniqueness of the laghu-guru rule. While Australian universities assign scholarships to their students to work on areas apparently of little significance to them, a recent report indicated an instance where a local university rejected a qualified Aryurvedic physicians claim to do research on some specified local herbs which could be used in the treatment of cancer patients. It is no secret that we spent less than the standard budgeted allocations in academic research. 
Delivering the Guru Devi Sunil Santha Memorial Lecture 2016 at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on December 14, which the writer was privileged to attend, the Australian scholar began his talk by saying, much of what has been read and written about Sunil and his music by academics and critics has been wrong, and so this gives me the chance to get it right this time. It is time to crack his DNA. I will begin by contextualizing the historical conditions in this country from the late 19th century which led to the emergence of Sunil Santha in the 1940s as the inventor of a new form of Sinhala music for a modern age. I will say something about the nature of creativity in music and why Sunil Santha is a seminal figure in Sinhala music today. I will also say something about the intellectuals who set out to undo his success. In the final part of the lecture I will turn to discuss his music by asking three fundamental questions about its DNA. 
Dr. Donaldson presenting his long and comprehensive talk in the form of a paper in two parts under the following sub-headings, [The lecture was presented in English and it was translated into Sinhala by Dr. Ruwan Ekanayake, the renowned Cardiologist and Sunil fan]. 


The Battle for Sinhala-Sri Lanka Music and Three Fundamental Questions he began by stating, I will say something about the nature of creativity in music and why Sunil is a seminal figure in Sinhala music today. The music academic with degree from a New Zealand University in anthropology and ethnomusicology having spoken of four different narratives about Sunil, who wanted to create music that belonged to Sri Lanka, further said, if a music scholar decided to study Sunils music, he had to look for his narrative too; his voice was central to Sinhala music and there were few purely instrumental music traditions in Sri Lanka from ancient times to this day.
Tony continued:Words have provided inspiration to poets and singers. We can see this in the Sinhala courts as in the Pandt Sabha in the court of King Parakramabhahu II [1234-1269], Vandibhatta in the Gampola court [1347-1397], or the Kavikara Maduwa in Kandyan court [1474-1815]. 
Tony Donaldson studied Asian languages and music performance at Victoria University of New Zealand, in the mid 1980s for his first degree. In 1995, he completed a Masters degree at the same University on the music and dance of west Java. Being awarded a Monash Scholarship in 1996 for a doctoral research at Monash, Australia, on the rituals and music in the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy, Sri Lanka, while researching for his thesis he came across the songs of Sunil Santha as well. He received his doctorate in 2003. 


He was dynamically involved with composers around the globe, including the British composer Sir Michael. He took time off making performances in the States and New Zealand. He has commissioned 15 music compositions by leading composers, including David Hamilton and David Farquhar in the 1990s. On finishing his PhD, he joined the Monash Asia Institute. He has worked diligently throughout Europe and Asia on assignments relating to music. 
Beddaliyanage Joseph John born 101 years ago, on April 14, 1915, in Dehiyagatha, a village in Ja-Ela, reached the pinnacle of glory like Pansilu; he synchronized the music lovers of this nation with his enchanting melody and unbiased tonal brilliance. The beautiful song, Kokilayas kokila nade really took music lovers breathe away; his songs are absorbing, magical and awesome. Listening to these incredibly melodious songs and comparing with todays music, you cant help but question, what went wrong 
Joseph first entered Rabindranath Tagores Shantiniketan and graduated in Sangeetha Vishaarada from the Lucknows Bhathkanda University of Musicology and returned to Sri Lanka in 1952 and shunned his English name, Joseph John and adapted Sunil Santha. Sunil Santha joined with the Radio Ceylon [SLBC now] and began research to form a home-based music. His voice, melodies and instrumental music captured the ear of Donaldson who believed it was pure genuine Sri Lankan song. His melodious songs with a simple style of his own, gained instant popularity. Tony Donaldson studied music performance at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. In 1995, he completed his Masters degree. 


Dr. Donalson, who was actively involved with composers around the world, on completion of his Doctorate, joined Monashs Asia Institute. Dr Tony has worked in Asia and Europe on projects relating to music and visual arts. Sunil Santhas unique euphonious singing, lyrical melodies and own rhythmic mode created a unique listening pleasure. He passed away at the age of 65, on 11th April 1981. Sunil, who gave some important credentials to local music in spite of his rough expedition in career is regarded as the most brilliant star in the national music arena. Santha composed a national song genre; he had the idea of putting the Sinhalese/English-educated elite back in touch with songs in their mother tongue. In his introduction to songbook, Sunil Handa(Sunils Voice) he commented: 
Those assimilate to Western food and drink, clothing, customs and habits etc., have motivated our language into the kitchen. They are ashamed to talk in our mother tongue. Apart from singing an English song in an English vocal style, there is no music of Sri Lanka they like. Should I say anything about the service I have rendered through the songs like Olu Pipila and Handa Pane Those who gagged from distaste of the Sinhala language and gave prominence to English are now happily singing these lyrics. Now they would familiarize themselves with songs in their mother tongue. This is one of the goals of my new music 
Dr. Donaldsons reflections on Sunils continuing and charming inheritance 
What characterised his music as Sinhala It was to a certain degree the way he exploits the Sinhala language. He applied the laghu-guru bedha in Sinhala in his compositions; the system of short and long syllables which rules the tempos and metres of the lyrics. Unvaryingly essential were the signals of his music, which were distinctly Sinhala. In many respects the gestures in his music were more significant than the selection of instruments, the harmonic language of his music, or the conventions governing the melodies of his songs. Tony. 
The resistance to change and innovation, according to Dr. Donaldson, of Sunils music came from the Indian ideologues, and especially from Prof Sarachchandra who thought that the future of music in this country should be Indian classical raga music; and the assumption that it was the only legitimate basis for new music. While court music died after the British seized Kandy in 1815, Sinhala music lived on in folk traditions and rituals as in the verses sung in connection with the cycle of rice cultivation, or in the tradition of rituals singing in the Temple of the Tooth Relic. But even if Sinhala music did disappear, 133 years of British colonial rule could not break this deep connection the Sinhalese have to the vocals art, added the Music scholar. He further said, I will commence my talk by contextualizing the past conditions in this country from the latter part of 19th C, which led to the surfacing of Sunil in the 1940s as the architect of a new type of Sri Lankan music for a current era.


I will say something about the nature of creativity in music and why Sunil Santha is a seminal figure in Sinhala music today. During his stay in Kandy twenty years ago, researching for his thesis, the learned man says he visited the SLBC [Broadcasting Corporation] and in a conversation with the head of the music department, who was a great admirer of Indian raga music. He told me Hindi and Sinhala music were the same, and so I asked him: what about Sunil Santhas music he chuckled and said, Sunil mixed his songs up with church hymns; this claim was confirmed by Prof. Sarachchandra at the Peradeniya University. 
Tony had developed a good rapport with the traditional Kandyan drummer [tom-tom beater] community during his many visits to their village abodes. He said he was successful in unveiling some of the ancestral and confidential intricacies unique to the art which they strictly preserved within the family circles or teacher-lineage. But the honourable academic kept his pledge to the traditional artist and refrained from divulging them at the talk.

The Constitution Reform Process: Progress amidst contradictions 
	
A pre-emptive celebration of the present Government has been the proposed Constitutional reform process. However as was highlighted at the recent panel discussion on it, underneath it all looms confusion and diverse opinions. The discussion titled The Constitution, Reconciliation and You was organised to enlighten the public on the current constitution making process, the concerns related to it and how constitutional reform of which devolution is considered to be an integral part would affect the country. The event ended however on evidencing the fact that the process although hopeful is entwined with diverse opinions and confusions. Excerpts from the panelists speeches follow

Who wants what What is the truth What is camouflaged
Prof.G.L.Pieris- Chairman of Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna
Speaking at the event Prof.G.L.Pieris, the Chairman of Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna said that the entire process of constitutional reform was grinding to a halt or slowing down substantially. Something that began with great deal of promise, seems to be almost petering out, he said.
Examining the reasons for this phenomenon he said the reasons were not entirely connected to legal or constitutional issues, and that the present situation had to be evaluated in a broader
social context.
Today the reluctance to hold a referendum derives from a number of factors. The Government does not have the confidence that the people will endorse what they put before the country. One of the main reasons for this is the widespread perception that this is a corrupt government- possibly the most corrupt since independence, he said. He added that there were a series of horrendous frauds that would be taken into consideration when voting at a referendum.
The referenda conducted in the United Kingdom and Italy also bare testimony to the truth that people lose a referenda to express their views on a wide range of issues connected with the popularity and acceptability of the incumbent administration, he said. He noted that there was a total lack of clarity with regard to what is proposed by the Government in the Constitution making process. Pointing out that the President imposed upon himself a certain limitation on the parameters and the scope of the proposed constitutional reform Prof. Pieris said-His position was that he would undertake those which are capable of being effected with a two thirds majority in parliament, but without the legal necessity of holding and winning a referendum.


However he pointed out that the President had made conflicting and contradicting statements.
Emphasising that the abolition of the Executive Presidency required a referendum he said there were fundamental divergence of opinions within the government itself.
You cannot begin to undertake a serious process of constitutional reform unless there is a consensus with regard to basics. If you look at statements made every day by leaders of the government they simply cannot be reconciled one with the other, he said.
Powerful personalities within the SLFP say that there is no mandate for a completely new constitution, nor do we need one. All that is required is to address certain burning issues which can be adequately catered for by means of a 20th Amendment. A principle area which according to them is urgently in need of reform is on elections, he added.
However he pointed out that the UNP are for a completely new constitution and for holding a referendum.


"There is the problem of simulation of hypocrisy. There are political parties that openly say that they have serious reservations about the unitary state"

Prof. Pieris claimed that there was much confusion as to whether Sri Lanka was embarking upon a new constitution or changes to the existing constitution. Who wants what What is the truth What is camouflaged he quizzed.
There is the problem of simulation of hypocrisy. There are political parties that openly say that they have serious reservations about the unitary state. But this differs to the view presented by the government, he said. Elaborating further he said, Under the existing constitution the governor of a province is alter ego of the president- he is the representative of the president in the relevant part of the country. Today the governor has the power with regard to legislation that is passed by the provincial council. It is now proposed in the report on the Central Periphery relations that the governor should be responsible not to the President but to the Chief Minister and to the board of ministers. Between the president and the governor is what enables the President to exercise his authority all over the country.
Prof. Pieris said that effecting those reforms and maintaining that Sri Lanka remained a unitary state was disingenuous and hypocritical, as it was unitary in name and not in substance.
Lord Buddha says that when you have had an excruciatingly painful past with regard to a certain matter and you are now determined to forge ahead with your life, do not dwell on that problem in such a way as to perpetuate the pain and the anguish. Move on, he said.

By the enactment of this Constitution everyone other than a Sinhalese and a Buddhist was excluded from the national life of the country:
Tamil National Alliance MP M. A. Sumanthiran
What has reconciliation got to do with the Constitution It has everything to do with it. The whole national question took a violent turn only with the enactment of the 1st Republican Constitution. The party I belonged to in 1970 specifically called on the Tamil people not to vote for a candidate calling for a separate State. But by 1972 when this Constitution displayed majoritarianism the representation of the Tamil peoples voice was shut out and excluded from the national life of the country.
This is because when the 1972 Constitution proclaimed Sinhala as the official language it excluded everyone else and relegated others to second class. There was no equal citizenship right to the people of the country. When it elevated Buddhism to the foremost place it was an exclusion, again. By the enactment of this Constitution everyone other than a Sinhalese and a Buddhist was excluded from the national life of the Country. Tinkering was done later on when Tamil was also included as a language but Article 9 remains
He then went on to analyse the presence of the Tamil population in a state where they are not the majority.


It is the majority vote that will always hold sway. Whenever issues arose between communities by fact that one community was a preponderant majority it would always sway that way. Majority rule is a creature of democracy but that is not all. There are fundamentals that cannot be taken away. In 1949 Tamil leaders who, until then rejected idea of a Federal state woke up, so a party that specifically asked people not to vote for separation would join with other Tamil parties and pass a resolution to restore the loss of a Federal state.
We have now come a long way from that. Because in the last several years we have repeatedly got the mandate from the Tamil people to find a solution within an undivided country irrespective of other formations who have canvassed and told Tamil people not to trust Sinhala leaders. It is the TNAs manifesto which said one undivided country upon a sharing arrangement so that the imbalance created by the majority that is always ruling is redressed to ensure that at least in areas we are a majority some of the day to day matters can be decided by us.
It is a matter of record that after the 13th Amendment there have been several processes having substantial consensus including the Constitutional Bill of 2000.


"In 1949 Tamil leaders who, until then rejected idea of a Federal State woke up, so a party that specifically asked people not to vote for Separation would join with other Tamil parties ....."

We passed a resolution on 9 March last year which was unanimous even with the Joint Opposition which clearly speaks of the process of forming a constitutional assembly and other sub-committees and says that at the end of it, it will receive a report and a draft Constitution Bill. When the President announced his candidature in 2014 he gave three promises. The first of them was abolishing the executive presidency.
In January 2016 also he made a speech and articulated his position and two speeches later he spoke about a new Constitution which should have the approval of the people at a referendum. The present process is not one of the Government proposing something only for someone to knock it down. When the 19th Amendment was passed in Parliament and at the Committee Stage it was repeatedly said that this was merely a stop gap and that we would have a new Constitution after the election. So that process is on and as far as we are concerned reconciliation is important. We dont want it behind the backs of the Sinhala people but we want them to approve the changes of the constitution. We want a process that is transparent and that is clear

There must be a mechanism in which the minority rights are protected
Presidents Counsel and Constitutional expert Manohara de Silva
There must be a mechanism in which the minority rights are protected. But is Federalism the solution In a Unitary State if the majority community of the country rules the minority, is it the solution to say that in a regional unit we should reverse the roles and allow the minority of the country to rule the majority of the country in a region This is not reconciliation, said Presidents Counsel Manohara De Silva.
He added that the allegation that the people of this country were dominating the minority community in a manner that infringes their rights was not acceptable.
If one suggests that a mechanism should be formulated for the protection of the minorities it is a different question. But Federalism is certainly not the solution, he said. Reiterating Prof. Peiris concern that attempts to prepare a new constitution have failed De Silva said a main reason was that the people did not trust the government.
People did not trust any of the past governments either in constitutional reform. This is because the majority community did not participate in any of the constitutional amendments that were brought in the last 30 to 40 years, he said.


Elaborating he asked as to what extent the people participated in drafting the 13th Amendment.
It was drafted under the directions of the Indian government for those who were promoting Federalism, against the wishes of the people of this country. Many died fighting against the 13th Amendment. No Government fully implemented 13A because it is not a piece of legislation that received the approval of the people of this country, he added.
The 19th Amendment was passed by announcing that the abuse of power, corruption can be eradicated with its passing. We were told that the Presidential System of governance is bad, that president deciding on major issues is not advisable and therefore the powers of the President should be vested. They said if the President appoints people to various offices including the Chief Justice, Judges of the Supreme Court and court of appeal and the IGP that he will appoint his friends and relatives or his political affiliates. The very people who promote the curtailment of power being exercised by the President did not make any attempt to curtail the power of the Chief Minister, he said.


"It was drafted under the directions of the Indian government for those who were promoting Federalism, against the wishes of the people of this country"

Under 13A the Police force in a province is under the control of the Chief Minister. If the President appoints the IGP it is bad, but if the Chief Minister of a Province appoints and controls the Police force thats good, said De Silva on a sarcastic note.
Though they pledged to do away with the Presidential system of Governance, they did not amend Article 4 which gave executive power to the president because they wanted to avoid a referendum. They suggested that the powers of the president, especially in relation to the appointment of the Cabinet of Ministers, be given to the Prime Minister. In place of the President who has been voted by the majority of people of all communities of this country, the PM who is appointed by the people of the Colombo district was preferred. Fortunately the Supreme Court did not approve the suggestion made, he said.
Stating that the 19th Amendment took away the rights of the majority he said that there is no support for the constitution amending process because most of the members of the Constitutional Council are either supportive of the minority cause, or are race and religion based.

The main issue is the unwillingness of the centre to give away power
Dr. K. Vigneswaran -Member of Expert Panel to the APRC
After detailing his experiences with 13th amendment, Vigneswaran went on to speak about reconciliation.
Irrespective of the 13th Amendment there has been an unwillingness of the Presidents to part with the powers given by the Amendment. Some sort of external pressure is required if we are unwilling to do things from within. With regards to reconciliation, if you go to the airport the announcements are only in Sinhala and English. Are there no Tamil passengers Even in the railway stations, other than maybe Fort, the announcements are not in Tamil. In the courts in Trincomalee the plaints are filed only in Sinhala although Tamil is the official language there.

"Irrespective of the 13th Amendment there has been an unwillingness of the Presidents to part with the powers given by the Amendment"

Take the Police, the 13th Amendment says that for a Police officer to get their first promotion he or she must have knowledge of other official language. That doesnt take place. In Trincomalee he will record statements in Sinhala. This should have been sorted out by now. There is an unwillingness by the Government in respect rights of the Tamils. There is no urgency for solving the problem. Do we want some sort of external pressure We need to rethink ourselves whether we want the problem solved or we would rather have external forces intervene. We need to think of ourselves as one people and solve our own problems ourselves. The main issue is the unwillingness of the centre to give away power

Systemic change: No; structural reform: Yes
Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka -Former Permanent Representative to the UN
As the sole political scientist of the panel Jayatilleka looked at things externally.
I will sketch out what I think is the smart change for post war Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka needs constitutional change but not a change of Constitution. I am not satisfied with the status quo but I dont think this requires a new Constitution. It is the kind of change that is unnecessary and dangerous. I argue for an understanding of the difference between structural and systemic change. The 13th Amendment was a structural reform. I want autonomy through devolution but within the unitary state.
I have always opposed the CBK packages which took us outside and beyond the unitary framework. Therefore in summary, systemic change: no; structural reform: yes. This is a distinction between reform and replacement. The Constitution must not be repealed because we have to look at it as a system of state which is democratic, which is a republic, which has a presidential system of leadership and is a unitary form of state. The state system shouldnt be replaced because it has been a success! This can be seen in comparison to several countries.

"We refused to go beyond the 13th Amendment. Why should we convert to Federalism Even in the Geneva Resolution there is no mention of going beyond the 13th Amendment"

Singapore which we have been compared to is a city state and not a country. East Asia is not a valid comparison since they have Confucian ideologies and have had decades of military dictatorships. We have avoided that. If we look at the rest of the world, India has a terrible system of caste, Pakistan has terrorism, the Middle East has failed states and radical Islamist terrorism, Central Europe has civil wars, and Latin America has violent gangs. We have been a success and have prevailed over the most powerful terrorist movement at the time, retained our sovereignty by sending back 70,000 troops and retained social welfare. We are a success as a state! We recovered faster from the tsunami than Louisiana did from Katrina. The replacement that is sought is looked at through the abolition of the executive Presidency and the unitary form of the State. Both are disastrous.
We refused to go beyond the 13th Amendment. Why should we convert to Federalism Even in the Geneva Resolution there is no mention of going beyond the 13th Amendment. You have a community which is 74% of the place in a small country unlike the rest of the community that has relations over the world. Therefore geopolitically we shouldnt go beyond the Unitary State.

The luxury prison in Hambantota
	
Beginning from the not-so distant past, kings, queens, emperors, tribal chiefs, captains of ships, others holding high positions and later judges of courts of law had either acquired a right or had been bestowed a right to punish wrong doers including those considered as political tyrants. Such punishments ranged from beheading, hanging, walking the plank, slavery, exile and periods in jails with varying standards of habitability and even survival. Clapping criminals in irons and isolating them in dungeons and throwing away the key at times was one type of punishment seen in the early Middle Ages. 
Jail in a humane era
Those barbaric days have gone and man has become more humanea contestable view. In Sri Lanka the truth is that jails in Sri Lanka are notorious places to stomach. Perhaps for some death is a better option. While behind bars gangs continue to function with impunity, drug distribution and contact with the outside world is a piece of cake through illegal alms given to some in prison management with a penchant to look the other way. Giving alms also ensures comfortable stays in prisons. The ordinary jailbirds who are jam-packed into ancient stone structures are the ones who bear the full brunt of prison life. They have no space to sleep or lie down, the indifferent food is not fit even for starving dogs and there was no way round the dirt, squalor and the ever-present prison smell. The wash rooms had very special identities  only those who were compelled to use them can describe. Even after their release, some of those inmates claim they still have lavatory-ablution-centred nightmares.
Did governmentsever worry
At times it appeared that the condition of Lankan jails worried governments. But no-one seriously believed that any government was honestly concerned about the sub-human conditions the citizenry suffered in the countrys jails. 
Not too long ago people of this country sneered and made fun of both legal entities and the law when politicos of a Yama breed found answerable in law and jailed, manipulated the systems and used their influence to be declared medically unfit to ensure more comfort. And such pleas for leniencies in custody got the nod from legal benches. There is no need to quote examples because the media went to town with such partialities. In recent times, however, legal eagles sitting in judgment under a Yahapalanaya, have begun to give nay responses to such hoaxes to avoid prison fare citizen Pereras of Lanka endured. Meanwhile the media in a new found freedom under a Yaha regime began to open doors to astonishing Yama secrets.
The Hambanluxury prison
Meeooww, I didnt believe it; so what I heard was true! The Yamapalakayas have actually built a luxury prison in Hambans. And now, some nosey-parker had stumbled on that Yama secret is spilling the beans. But, how on earth did they manage to keep it so hush-hush Tommo a pussycat was reading the Daily Dodger, his employers favourite newspaper.
A white elephant of an airport at Wattala, another white elephant called the Hambantota Harbour not too far away, so whats wrong with a white elephant of a jail his companion Ooty an owl and Tommos fellow worker at the Wallside Restaurant and Bar posed a pertinent question. The two vermin controllers in a restaurant cum bar owned by Shelton Perera, were spending their off-duty hours in their employers house.

"The Hambans luxury prison has been kept under wraps for three years. Suddenly the wraps are off; not completely, just a wee-bit. In the rush the Daily Dodger has reported that a Yaha minister has been fishing around the place recently

Purrshsh, for many years our governors prisons have been rated worse than the slums in Haiti. So the government with human rights activists hot on their heels thought of building a prison to meet international standards whatever those were. And as usual went from one extreme to another like in the movie slum-dog millionaire someone thought up, said pussy reading the report. I also think that Yama politiccas had foreseen a distinct possibility of their good times coming to an end and a Yaha government turning their guns on them for doing the dirty at a level not heard of before. Astrologers too must have warned the Satakayas big and small the time to face some legal rock music was not far away. It worried the Yamapalakayas: how can we survive life in hell-holes called prisons if we were placed in one And there were plenty of such worriers; it was well-known that Yama politiccas were crooked, self- serving, bribable rabble all Lankans and Mother Lanka could do without.
Thuhooot, dont I know.
So what did the Satakayas do In the year 2014, they began to build a luxury prison they could occupy very likely in a special wing when their time came. As secret as Area 51 in US, it was no run-of the-mill jail but one with star class comforts. Now the thing has been completed and the news of a luxury prison in Hambans, the former Rajathumas homeland has leaked. See, they have given all the details here, purred pussy shaking the Daily Dodger. The jail complex is on 58 acres, can accommodate 2000 prisoners, has a swimming pool, hospital, indoor sports complex, a play ground, a training unit and what not. Building has commenced on May 16, 2014 and it has cost our governors Rs.5000 million bucks. Not bad, huh And you should see the photos. If some of those cells are joined up, the place can be operated as a luxury hotel.
Thuhoot, but from which hell did they get the money
Think, stupid. The luxury prison was a Sataka regime baby; they only had to e-mail some noodle benefactors for the dough; and they have got it.
Luxury confinement-for whom
I wonder how judges are to decide which crook deserves a luxury prison term The bird had a point.
The Satakayas built it for themselves, but they will throw in some ordinary governors too for appearance sake, chuckled pussy the way pussies do. They knew when their time came up, there will be no yes docs, yes judges and other yes men for special treatment of any kind. So like scouts they got prepared. But how could they be sure judges will send guilty Yamapalakayas to the luxury prison at a time Yahapalakayas are in power Another interesting bit is that the Hambans luxury prison has been kept under wraps for three years. Suddenly the wraps are off; not completely, just a wee-bit. In the rush the Daily Dodger has reported that a Yaha minister has been fishing around the place recently
Hooooot! Hard to imagine why a Yaha camper had not done that before, the bird hooted.
Dont you see, exclaimed the street- smart pussy. The Yamapalakayas have shown the Yahapalakayas the Hambans luxury prison before prison sentences begin to roll out against them. Dont forget that some no-good ex-Yamayas are in cahoots with the Yaha government. So, the Yahapalakayas sent a scout to take a look-see at the luxury prison and report to his bosses who are obliged to take a decision not only on opening it but using it as well.


Whooom, whooom whoooom, isnt there talk that projects the Yamapalakayas initiated in their innings are being declared open by the Yahaplakayas Guess the reason If the Yamapalakayas return to power, they are bound to catch and jail some Yahapalakayas who have been naughty.
Meeoowwohyeah (oh yeah).There are pedigreed black sheep among the Yahapalakayas all right, pussy grinned.
Its then Yaha rogues caught in a Yama net will be glad their predecessors built the Hambans luxury prison. Frankly, I see this as a good-will building exercise by Yamapalakayas and Yahapalakayas when any of them are thrown into jail, observed the wise-looking bird,
Purrr, purrrrrhere, there and everywhere, thats politics for you chum. And politiccas look after themselves, not their countrymen. The Hambans set-up is the grandest example of how our governors politiccas keep having the plums even in jail.

## Title: The Making of a new Constitution Power sharing at the Centre

The Making of a new Constitution Power sharing at the Centre
	
A Constitution embodies a nations fundamental choice about government. In Sri Lanka which is one of the oldest democracies in South Asia the peoples choice is for democratic government. This is why one of the objectives of a new constitution is to do away with the executive presidency which had facilitated a shift towards a more authoritarian regime. However although democracy ensues the rule of the people it must be kept in mind that in a multi ethnic pluralist state it can ensure the rule of an ethnic majority. The main stream political parties reflect the ethnic composition of the country, for example in Sri Lanka the UNP and the SLFP. 
These parties although not overtly Sinhala parties nevertheless reflect the interests and aspirations of the majority ethnic group. The minority ethnic / religious communities are represented by separate political parties, which reflect their interests. Only the main stream political parties can capture power at the centre because they represent the majority of people. 
Because of the composition of the population the country is in effect ruled by the majority community or ethnic group, which is a permanent majority, although for the functioning of true democracy the majority should be one which is changeable and not fixed. 
This is the rationale for applying a Federal system in multi ethnic states. For example in Canada although the majority is English speaking, the French speakers in Quebec province have both provincial autonomy and also some measure of power sharing at the centre. Today the Prime minister of Canada is from the French speaking community. However even without a federal constitution it is possible to have constitutional arrangements which help to give the minority groups a greater degree of participation in the government of the Country. 


Countries devising new constitutions should seek the broadest perspective in the task they are engaged in and look at the experiences of other countries, while adapting them to the circumstances in their own countries. The fact that the minority is perpetually relegated to a subordinate or secondary position and cannot exercise any power at the centre can breed a sense of disenchantment with the state which comes to be regarded as a majoritarian state, and one which does not represent them. Hence in order to have true democracy and integrate the different ethnic communities into the body politic it is necessary to have power sharing both at the periphery i.e. Provinces, as well as at the Centre. In other countries with multi- ethnic / plural populations such arrangements have been made in the Constitution. 
A brief review of some of the Constitutional arrangements devised in 3rd World Countries are as follows. 
1. A second chamber like the Raja Sabha in India or the Senate, which we had in Sri Lanka under the Soulbury Constitution. This arrangement could ensure provincial / minority representation in the Legislative decision making process. 
2. Another method is a rotating Presidency between different communities, and a qualified majority for certain categories of legislation which have a bearing on the minority, as in the Constitution of Cyprus. 
3. The South African Constitution requires the Judiciary to reflect the racial and gender composition in the appointment of judicial officers. Similarly the Canadian Constitution provides that there has to be a minimum of French speaking judges. 
4. In some constitutions representation in the executive is ensured by appointing the Vice President from the minority community. 
5. To remedy the in-balance in employment in Government administrative service, provision by law for equal opportunities in employment, or quotas in central ministries. 
6. The Constitution of Macedonia for example provides for a certain proportion of the minority Albanians in the Armed Forces of the Country. 
7 The Fundamental Rights Chapter could be expanded to include a Bill of Rights which stresses the equality in respect of language, culture and religion as in the South African Constitution. The Bill of rights could also include group rights such as the right of minorities to adequate recruitment to the Public Services and the right of disadvantaged communities, such as the Upcountry Tamils (Malayaha Tamils) to affirmative action. 
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly has released the report of the SubCommittee on Centre-Periphery relations. An interesting aspect of the report is that the principle of subsidiarity is sought to be applied so that Local government units and the Grama Rajya are also empowered, and not only the Provincial Councils. This is a welcome recommendation as it will enable even minority enclaves within majority areas to be able to have some say in managing their own affairs. This is especially necessary in the case of the Upcountry (Malayaha) Tamils. 
This category of persons in the Estate sector have been unable to participate in the decision-making process in respect of their own affairs. I note that there is no reference to power sharing at the Centre in this Report or in any of the other Sub Committee Reports. However, I understand this subject is being handled by the Steering Committee and hopefully they will make the constitutional arrangements suggested. 
I might mention that the report of the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform (PRC) does touch on this subject. It must be pointed out that this Committee which was appointed by the Prime minister to obtain the views of the people of the Country did in fact visit all 25 districts of the Country, and had sittings from north to south where they received the representations of ordinary people who were able to give their views in both Sinhala and Tamil as well as English. In Chapter 8 of the report the committee deals with both power sharing between Centre and periphery and also power sharing at the Centre itself. 


"These parties although not overtly Sinhala parties nevertheless reflect the interests and aspirations of the majority ethnic group. The minority ethnic / religious communities are represented by separate political parties, which reflect their interests. Only the main stream political parties can capture power at the centre because they represent the majority of people."

With regard to power sharing at the Centre they set out the suggestions made by the people, which were as follows. Firstly, establishment of a second chamber, which will have significant Provincial representation. Secondly election of a Vice President by Parliament from a community to which the president does not belong. Thirdly, the composition of the Cabinet to reflect the strength of the different communities. The PRC, ascertained the views of the people of the Country, and the report of this committee sets out the recommendations of the people. 
It is submitted that this shows that the issue of power sharing at the centre, has been a matter which the people in all parts of the country have sought out not only as part of a solution to the national question but more so as being required to ensure more equal representation which is essential for example in the distribution of resources. 


The greater representation of the Provinces in such a chamber will help towards a more equitable distribution of resources not only to the North but also to districts in the South as in Uva, Moneragala and Hambantota, thus far lagging behind in development. Hence it behoves the Steering Committee and the Constitutional Assembly to consider these proposals, and to act on them. 
The constitution of a second chamber is not something new to Sri Lanka as it will be recalled that the first Parliament of Ceylon consisted of two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives. One argument brought against power sharing mechanisms is that it will be expensive adding further to the burden on the people. 
However the advantages in giving people in all parts of the country a greater participation in governance and its positive effects on reconciliation, the resolution of the national question and in building a shared Sri Lankan identity not only for the minorities that have agitated for their rights (the Tamils, Muslims and Malayaha Tamils) but also for the disadvantaged poor in all parts of the country, outweighs the consideration of added expenditure to the exchequer. Democracy is after all an expensive commodity.

Trump to skip correspondents dinner as media row heats up
	

President Donald Trump ratcheted up an increasingly hostile feud with the media Saturday, announcing he will skip a century-old annual correspondents dinner a day after an fierce row erupted over press access to the White House. 
The Trump White House triggered widespread outrage on Friday by denying access to an off-camera briefing to several major US media, including CNN, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and Politico. 
Smaller outlets that have provided favorable coverage of the Trump administration, such as Breitbart and the One America News Network, received a green light to attend the briefing by the presidents spokesman Sean Spicer. 
The move came just hours after Trump renewed his assault on the mainstream US media by calling it the enemy of the people, in an ongoing battle in which he has labeled the fourth estate fake news and the opposition party. The White House Correspondents Association (WHCA) said it was protesting strongly against the decision to selectively deny media access, and would bring it up with the Republican administration. 
The New York Times described the White House decision as an unmistakable insult to democratic ideals, while CNN called it an unacceptable development and the Los Angeles Times warned the incident had ratcheted up the White Houses war on the free press to a new level.

Use 119 to make complaints over sexual harassment
	
Women and girls can use 119 Police Emergency hotline number to make any complaints over sexual harassments; especially on public transports, the Head of Child and Women Bureau, Ms. L.R. Amarasena said today.
She said that women and girls are often silent in case of sexual harassment in public transport because they need to reach their destination soon without getting involved in any legal activity against the harassment, while travelling.
Hotline number 119 is always available for immediate help and women and girls can speak out and seek support from the Police for any emergency case, she said while launching of Public Campaign on sexual harassment against women on public transport at the United Nations (UN).
Although, she said that bystanders could intervene to prevent when they witness or become aware of incidents of harassment.
We can see that women witnesses are often a step back without providing evidence of harassments on public transports but woman can play a vital role to make safer environment for another woman by stressing their voice over such incident, she said.
According to the UN Policy Brief about sexual harassments on public transports in Sri Lanka they had identified ninety per cent of women and girls had experienced sexual harassments in buses and trains. (Yoshitha Perera)

Wary of Trump unpredictability, China ramps up naval abilities
	

BEIJING REUTERS Feb 26- The PLA Navy is likely to secure significant new funding in Chinas upcoming defence budget as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its own projection of power around the globe. 
Chinas navy has been taking an increasingly prominent role in recent months, with a rising star admiral taking command, its first aircraft carrier sailing around self-ruled Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places. 
Now, with President Donald Trump promising a U.S. shipbuilding spree and unnerving Beijing with his unpredictable approach on hot button issues including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy. 
Its opportunity in crisis, said a Beijing-based Asian diplomat, of Chinas recent naval moves. China fears Trump will turn on them eventually as hes so unpredictable and its getting ready.

Won't resign, will pressurise govt.: Rathana Thera
	
MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera, who is in the centre of a controversy over his recent statement that he would act as an independent member in Parliament, said yesterday that he would not leave the present government.
He said there is no need for him to leave the government as he wished to get what he wanted done with the help of the government.
Speaking at a harvest reaping function of a paddy field where organic fertilizer had been used instead of chemical fertilizer, the Thera stated that Sri Lanka could save more than Rs. 100 billion for a year by using organic fertilizer.
Medicinal drug production in the country is also in the same state. Bangladesh and Pakistan produce their own medicine. Why is it not possible for us We have competent scientists, and our minister has set the initiative. A few similar achievements would bring the country out of present chaos, Thera said.
