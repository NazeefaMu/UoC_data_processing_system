Jesus among His Disciples after Resurrection

 

“Christ is alive”, is a metaphysical reality. What does it mean by metaphysical reality is that it cannot be authenticated by the existing laws of nature, as one does in the field of science. Yet Christians have borne witness to this reality for more than thousands of years and are still experiencing that reality. It is interesting to see whether, non-Christians too can experience this phenomenon.   
However, if one understands or accepts that man has not only a physical body but an entity which is not physical, there is a definite path on which one can meet the Risen Lord.   
In the post resurrected narratives as given by the evangelists, the people who met the Risen Lord were those who were in touch with Jesus before his death, in one way or another, or those who have vehemently opposed to the upcoming Christian Community. In the case of St. Paul, who was adamantly determined to wipe out the Christian Community, he met the Risen Lord in an extraordinary incident.” On his journey, as he was nearing Damascus, a light from the sky suddenly flashed around him. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” He said, “Who are you, sir?” The reply came, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do”(Act 9/3-6)” After this incident, Paul’s life changed. This change was not superficial but a one hundred and eighty degree turn. It was completelythe opposite of his goals in life. Before meeting the Risen Lord his goal was to annihilate totally the Christian Community from Jerusalem. After he experienced the Risen Lord, his goal became to proclaim the reality of the Risen Lord that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and He is the Messiah expected by Jews for centuries. St. Paul therefore committed his life totally to the Risen Lord and gave his life for Him. St. Peter who was the prime disciple of Jesus, and who did renounced Him at His trial. Yet with the decent of the Spirit of the Risen Lord vigorously proclaimed the fact that Jesus of Nazareth, who was put to death by the Jews is now risen the Son of God.   

 

 


What then is essential to meet the Risen Lord in this earthy life? We need to remember that meeting the Risen Lord is a faith experience. Reading and meditating The living word of God is the first step to meet the Risen Lord. Letting that wordto echo continuously in one’s inner being is a sure way to find Him. When one’s inner self is made aware thatthe universal power of the Risen Lord is in us and around us, one can definitely be in touch with that Power. When one decides, out of mere freedom, to cling on to that Power, the power which created the whole universe, whatever is, and that which sustains everything, he or she is on the correct path to be in union with the Risen Lord. To spell it in a more religious terminology, it is a contemplation of the living word of Jesus without letting that to be an intellectual discourse but making it a part of one’s real life.   
The risen Lord is accessible to the rich and the poor, literate and the illiterate, young and old. What matters,is the determination and the free will to constantly search of that Power. When one discovers thishe or she is lit up. The internal being of each person could be directed by our free will and with a strong determination to meet the Risen Lord. The path is His word. Life that is to be lived is a shadow of the life led by Jesus of Nazareth in Galilee. When one meets Him in that sense, life becomes an extraordinary journey to be in union with the Divine.
