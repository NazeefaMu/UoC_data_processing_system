The polls chief is said to be in a sulk over endless political gimmicks that keep on postponing the local and provincial polls. 

 


People who inquire from him now and again why polls are being delayed have become a thorn in his side. 


A group of friends of the Polls chief asked him the other day whether there was nothing at all he could do to prevent a further deferment of polls.


“There’s something I can do and I am certainly going to do it!” replied the polls chief. 
“O! really! What do you propose to do?” His friends asked him.


“If I find myself unable to hold the overdue polls before the next National Independence Day, I will hold a media briefing on the highway opposite the election commission on that day and tell the people:

“‘There is no freedom for the people in this country though today is supposed to be the National Independence Day!’ Mark my words! There will be no going back on these words!”
