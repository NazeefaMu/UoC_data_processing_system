Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake today said the Central Province Education Ministry Secretary should be held responsible for allowing school children to hold a 2.5 mile long bridal veil in an attempt to set a Guinness World Record as the longest sari, as he had issued the letter giving permission.

“I strongly condemn the use of school children for this event during school hours and it is an irregularity. The President has instructed not to use schoolchildren for social events in this manner. I am not prepared to safeguard anyone. The Chief Minister made a request and obtained approval for their participation but he had not instructed to line up them along the road in this manner. However, I would hold a formal investigation and submit the report to the President,” the Governor said.

The Regional Director of Education, Tilak Ekanayake, Zonal Director M.W. Wijeratne and the school Principal had been summoned to the Governor’s office last morning though the media was not allowed to cover the meeting. The governor told the media that the secretary of the ministry of education was absent as he had to take part in some other official duty.

The Governor also said the report on the inquiry into the incident would be submitted to President Maithripala Sirisena. The Provincial Director told the media that he submitted a report to the Governor and she would release a statement on this matter. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe and L.B. Senaratne)
