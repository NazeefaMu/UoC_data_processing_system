Mullaitivu Magistrate M.S.M. Samzudeen ordered the commander of the 58 division of the Army to submit to the court before April 19 a list of LTTE cadres and others who surrendered to the security forces during the final stage of the war in the Wattuwakkal area in Mullaitivu.

The Magistrate gave this order on Wednesday when the Habeas corpus case filed by the relatives of the surrendees was taken up for hearing.

The commander of the 58 division informed the court that a list of those surrendered to the security forces was available at the Mullaitivu Camp.

The case which was filed in the Vavuniya Court in 2013 was later transferred to the Mullaitivu Magistrates Court.

Attorney R.S. Ratnavale appearing on behalf of the petitioners said this was the first time the government or the army made a statement of the surrender of LTTE cadres to the Mullaitivu Army Camp. The relatives of these surrendees had filed 13 cases in this connection at the Mullativu Court.

Despite objection by the State counsel for the submission of the list, the Judge ordered to submit the list of surrendeees to court on April 19. (Romesh Madushanka)
