	The statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday had cleared the people's minds and it would pave the way for a Parliament, which would sustain the January 8 revolution, the United National Party (UNP) said.
	UNP Spokesman and UNFGG candidate Gayantha Karunatilaka told a media briefing that President's action to let people know his stand on the political situation, would certainly help him and all those who wanted political reform and freedom.
	He said the action of the previous UPFA regime to divide political parties had boomeranged today.
	Karunathilaka, who came up with details on the plans, which a UNP led government had, said the country's largest conference hall would be constructed in Bentara, Elpitiya.
	He said the largest conference hall in the country was to be built at Temple Trees premises during the last regime.
	In addition he said the coastal line from Bentota and Mirissa would be converted into a tourism zone
	He said the manifesto of the UNFGG would be launched in the coming days. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Predeep)
