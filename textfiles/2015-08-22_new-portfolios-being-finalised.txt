Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga are in the process of finalising the list of members from the two main parties to be assigned portfolios in the national unity government, party sources said yesterday.
It is learnt that the new ministers will take their oaths on Monday.
Some members have requested that they be assigned the same portfolios they held during the tenure of the 6-months old government while some others have requested that the subjects previously assigned to them be changed.(Kelum Bandara)
