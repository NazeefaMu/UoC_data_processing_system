Was it an accident or an act of sabotage?


	



 

A heavy downpour greeted the UPFA’s May Day in Galle.  However, thousands of May Day revellers remained rooted in the rain in a long wait to listen to the address by the Big Boss. Meanwhile, the public address system went dead possibly due to an electrical short circuit. 

 


At this stage, the pistol toting mayor from the Southern town offered the sound equipment –microphones, amplifiers, etc. he had in his vehicle to use as a stopgap measure. But the organizers did not show any interest in his offer.


Later some authorities had inquired as to who had supplied the public address system for use at this May Day rally and it had transpired that a Diyawanna member with close ties to a popular game was behind the hiring of the sound equipment from a service provider very close to a colleague of his from the JO camp in Rajarata.
