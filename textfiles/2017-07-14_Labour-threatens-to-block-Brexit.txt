Labour threatens to block Brexit


	

London, (Daily Mail), 13 July 2017 -  
Theresa May faces the prospect of a humiliating Commons defeat on her ‘great repeal bill’ after Labour said their MPs would not back it unless she made sweeping changes.  


Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said last night he was putting the Prime Minister ‘on notice’ of the changes he said needed to be made, including on workers’ rights and parliamentary scrutiny.  


Mrs May publishes her key bill today and MPs will vote on it in the autumn, but Sir Keir is threatening to exploit the government’s small majority knowing that if Labour were joined by a handful of rebel Tory MPs, the Bill would be defeated.
