Dayasiri challenges Arjuna to vacate post


	

Taking a swipe at his Cabinet colleague, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera challenged Minister Arjuna to vacate the Cabinet position he holds if he has any decency, without meddling in his ministry.

Minister Jayasekera made this remark when addressing the media at the Sports Ministry yesterday. This was in reply to a question raised by a journalist.

He said further that if Arjuna is not happy with what is happening at Sri Lanka Cricket he should take it over and change it. He said he was more than happy to let him have it.

He pointed out that as a minister Arjuna had been an utter failure and that he had first ruined the Ports Ministry and now he was busy destroying the Petroleum Corporation. (Namal Pathirage)
