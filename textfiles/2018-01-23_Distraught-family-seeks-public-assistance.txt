B. Mallika (55) a resident of No 91 Konakumbukwewa, Puliyankulama in Rambewa Division in Anuradhapura has been in a predicament for want of a permanent income to maintain a family of five children and to provide treatment for her 22-year-old daughter, a cancer patient, and her son, who has been bedridden with a fractured spine.   


She said her meagre income as a manual worker was not adequate to meet the household expenses; particularly to provide treatment to the two sick children. He daughter, Mahushika Dilrukshi ( 22) has been suffering from cancer that has resulted in one of her limbs being amputated. She is now affected by an abnormal mental condition. Mangalika said that she has to take her daughter, the second in the family, to the  Anuradhapura Hospital several times a month to obtain treatment at the clinic.   


She said that her son, the third in the family, who had been employed as a helper in a building site in Anuradhapua, had become the breadwinner of the family. However, unfortunately he had met with an accident during which he had fractured his spine. The injury has totally disabled him. Mangalika said that the other children in Grade eight and ten respectively were still attending school.   


“ I have to take the two children to Anuradhapura for treatment bearing a heavy cost. I have to spend about Rs.10,000 to transport them by a hired vehicle and in addition Rs.15,000 is needed for medicine. Meanwhile our wattle and daub house was razed to the ground by floods compelling us to live in my brother’s small house. My brother is a manual worker in the area and he is not in a position to help us although he provides us shelter in his small house,” She said.   Mallika said that his family was struggling for existence against heavy odds and requested for help from the public to survive. 

 

The public who are eager to help this family may deposit their contributions to the Bank of Ceylon Kahatagasdigiliya Branch A/c No. 7924314 in the name of K.T. Kumara, the disabled son. Further details about this family can be obtained by calling 0784743416.
