Jenca's visit will provide an opportunity for continued dialogue with Sri Lankan authorities and stakeholders, and will inform the longer term peace building programme of the United Nations in support of Sri Lanka.
Jenca will also participate in the UN Day event in Colombo on October 24 to celebrate the twin milestones of the UN's 70th anniversary and Sri Lanka's 60th anniversary since becoming a Member State.
