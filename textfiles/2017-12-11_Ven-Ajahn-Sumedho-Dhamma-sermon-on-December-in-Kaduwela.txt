December 12 at 6.30 p.m. at the Bodhignana Meditation Monastery in Kaduwela

 

Ajahn Sumedho will be visiting Sri Lanka and shall deliver a Dhamma sermon on the December 12 at 6.30 p.m. at the Bodhignana Meditation Monastery in Kaduwela.
The writer was most interested in knowing about this erudite monk, who is well versed in the dhamma and a great exponent of intuitive meditation.
Having followed some of his sermons on Lord Buddha’s teachings on YouTube I believe,  would be of help to all to comprehend the complexities of Dhamma.
Ven. Ajahn Sumedho very succinctly interprets Vipassana as ‘waking to reality’ rather than trying to achieve refined Consciousness through concentrating on external mind-objects or imagery.
His explanation that reality is formless being in the present “here and now” will enable to identify intangible thoughts such as happiness, anger, anxiety, jealousy, fear, sorrow brought by sensory perceptions when irritated or impinged upon results in suffering as you do not live in the present it goes unnoticed.

 


As you cannot escape the reality to accept it, ut to examine the origin of such thoughts resulting from grasping and clinging gives much needed impetus to a beginner to understand the dhamma.
 If you do realise that each conditioned thought which brings happiness or sorrow is impermanent or constantly changing a delusory or ignorant mind will be awakened to reality. That is with the right understanding “the noble eight fold path”
His teachings of intuitive mindfulness of the present “Sathi Sampajanna” is most helpful when starting to practice meditation. 
 Ven. Monk firmly extolls the virtues of the dhamma as it not just and exotic philosophy or a  metaphysical thought of a supreme being but  plain reality experienced by all forms of life.  
Being Human you are able to discern the reality where the other life forms will fail.
This great teacher was ordained in 1966 in Thailand and received higher ordination from the most Venerable Achan Chah.

 


Born in the United Sates after graduating from the University he had served  the American forces involved in the Korean War when he had come to know about Zen Buddhism as this has aroused his curiosity in the dhamma he had proceeded to Thailand to pursue Theravada Buddhist meditation.
Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Loku Swaminwanse the founder of Mahamewna Monasteries had known Ajahn Sumedho well over period of time and Ven. Ajhan Sumedho had also been present at the first ever higher ordination ceremony of Mahamewna Bhikkhus held at Gothama Thapowanaya Monastery in 2004.

 


This friendship has grown over time as Mahamewna Monasteries following the Lord Buddha path to liberation by inculcating the virtues of the dhamma by teaching how to control the sense bases smell, taste, sight, bodily feeling, arising from the five aggregates by living in the present “Here and Now” through the understanding of dhamma had especially invoked a special interest among  the young.
With great Metta Loku Swaminwanse has invited most Reverent Ajahn Sumedho to deliver a dhamma sermon on the aspects of the vicissitudes of life common to all beings.
