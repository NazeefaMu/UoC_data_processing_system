The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Maldives did not boycott the opening ceremony of the China-Maldives friendship bridge in Maldives but turned back as his vehicle was not allowed to proceed to the venue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said yesterday.

Ministry Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said the ambassador had not boycotted the event as he went there in order to participate in the event.“However, their vehicles were not allowed to proceed so they were forced to turn back,” she informed Daily Mirror.

Media reports said that the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the Maldives had boycotted the bridge opening ceremony, an event that was also not attended by the Indian Envoy.

Member of the Maldives Parliament and Joint Opposition Spokesperson Ahmed Mahloof said the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh boycotted the bridge inauguration event as their cars were stopped by President Abdulla Yameen’s security and they were asked to walk.

“Only the Chinese Ambassador’s car was allowed to proceed to the venue. Such an insult to traditional friends,” he tweeted.

The two-kilometre long bridge which connects Male and Hulhule Island, was built using funds mainly received from China. The opening was held on August 30. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
