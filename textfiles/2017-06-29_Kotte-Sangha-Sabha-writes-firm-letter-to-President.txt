Kotte Sangha Sabha writes firm letter to President


	

In a strongly worded lengthy letter to the President, the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Sangha Sabha opposed moves by certain political leaders and extremist organizations to criticize monks without a reason in a manner never seen in the history of the country, insult institutions of the Sangha and acquire property belonging to the Sasana.

The letter was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena after a delegation comprising the Mahanayake of the Sangha Sabha Ven. Dr. Ittapene Dhammalankara thera and Anuanayakes Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Wimalaratana thera and Ven. Dr. Kotapitiye Rahula thera held discussions with the President on Wednesday (28).

The Sangha Sabha especially rejected in strong terms, ‘false’ statements made by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga regarding the Sri Lankan Buddhist identity. “We feel these actions are aimed at fulfilling individual aspirations and does not contribute to the welfare of the wider society,” the statement said.

“It can be seen that some are engaged in a process to brand Buddhists as extremists who are sowing hatred among other religious communities. They are also engaged in condemning the 2500 year old Sri Lankan Buddhist culture. Therefore the Monks and the Buddhists of Sri Lanka are faced with a pathetic situation today regarding the protection of their culture that was safeguarded for thousands of years. We express our displeasure to the government for not probing and stating the truth about the statistics and statements on the wrongs that are perceived to have been done by the Buddhists of the country against other religions.

“We do not agree with alternate proposals and unnecessary discussions regarding the position bestowed in the constitution on Buddhism and the unitary state concept where all communities are living together in accordance with a Sri Lankan culture. Therefore the Sangha Sabha has put forward a set of proposals for the government regarding the present problematic situation. The Sangha Sabha proposes to establish a commission of acceptable learned persons who are devoid of extremist views to look into these matters. “
