	The government has again changed its policy on Concessionary Vehicle Permits (CVP) for Public Servants and said all Public Servants who were entitled for vehicle permits could purchase his or her first duty-free vehicle after completion of five years in service, but the second permit would be issued only after 10 years.
	State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardana addressing the media at the SLFP head office told media that the government after a review had decided to maintain the status-quo with a slight change of the policy and all senior Public Officials and Professionals in the Public Sector were entitled for the permit.
	“The public servants will be issued the second vehicle permit only after the completion of ten years from the day he purchased the first duty free vehicle. The government has also given up the idea to pay Rs. 1 million instead of the vehicle permit,” he said.
	Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake proposed in the budget to abolish the concessionary vehicle permit system for Public Servants on November 20. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
