Defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said China had a grasp of the situation regarding the carrier group in the South China Sea. 
China hopes the U.S. earnestly respects the sovereignty and security concerns of countries in the region, and earnestly respects the efforts of countries in the region to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea,  Ren told a regular monthly news briefing.

Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said China, Pakistan, Ukraine, Russia and Israel were the countries that supplied military equipment in the fight against terrorism at that time whereas India helped immensely in the provision of training for the security forces.
In an interview with Daily Mirror, he said 80 per cent of Sri Lanka militarys overseas training had been provided by India over the years, yet it could not supply weapons due to the Tamil Nadu factor.
Yet, they helped us in so many ways by way of training our officers, he said.
He said Sri Lankas military is primarily equipped with Chinese weapons for years.
We depended on China for weapons. The other countries that provided us with war equipment are Pakistan, Israel, Ukraine and Russia, he said.

Deportation spat overshadows Trump envoys talks with  Mexico
	
MEXICO CITY REUTERS Feb 23-A bid by U.S. President Donald Trump to deport non-Mexican illegal migrants to Mexico that has enraged Mexicans will top the agenda when officials from both countries meet on Thursday amid a deepening rift between the two nations. 
The U.S. government on Tuesday said it would seek to deport many illegal immigrants to Mexico if they entered the United States from there, regardless of their nationality, prompting a fiery response from Mexican officials. 
Calling the measure unilateral and unprecedented, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said new immigration guidelines would top the agenda of meetings in Mexico City with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. 
The stakes are high for the United States, since Mexico has warned that a breakdown in relations could affect its extensive cooperation on the fight against narcotics and on stemming the flow of Central American migrants that reach the U.S. border. Talking points from a senior official show Mexicans plan to seek more information on Trumps executive orders at the summit. Officials plan to say, We are worried about the consequences that these can have for Mexican nationals, in the United States, the notes show. 
As part of its response, Videgaray said Mexicos foreign ministry would get involved in legal cases in the United States where it considered the rights of Mexicans had been violated.

Edu. Min. to remove ECA evaluation reports from schools
	
The Education Ministry had taken a decision to do away with the Extra Curricular Activities (ECA) Evaluation report that school-teachers need to submit on their pupils, the Education Ministry said yesterday.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that after taking note of the difficulties faced by school-teachers when drafting these evaluation reports, the Ministry had decided to remove the old method and formulate a new one.
Several teachers have told us that the evaluation process was extremely taxing for them and takes up much of the time they need to spend with their pupils. It also revealed that the method that was being used currently was not a productive one. After taking these facts into consideration the ministry has decided to terminate the current method and introduce a new one, he said.
Minister Kariyawasam also said steps had been taken to fast-track teacher training in order to develop the school education system.
Expressing his views on the Ministrys actions, Ceylon Teachers' Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin was full of praise for the measures taken by the minister. So far the evaluations done by teachers, who put so much effort into this task, have been just thrown into the waste-paper basket when they were sent to the Examination Department", he said.

## Title: India no longer the same for Tamils
## Section: News Features
## Date: 24 February 2017 02:36 am
India no longer the same for Tamils
	
For the first time since the famous Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was signed 29 years ago, India had this week officially and unambiguously repudiated one of the major provisions of that Accord. Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar during his three day visit to Sri Lanka told the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) on Monday that India would not be pressing Sri Lanka to merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces to form a single Tamil-majority, Tamil-speaking province as envisaged by the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987. 
He was responding to a request by the leader of the EPRLF, Suresh Premachandran, that India should honour its promise to keep the North and East united as one administrative unit. According to Indian Express Premachandran had pointed out that India has a moral responsibility to ask the Sri Lankan government to re-merge the North and East as it is a part of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987. 
If the Accord is still valid, every part of it should be deemed to be equally valid and implemented, he had argued while interestingly recalling that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had promised that the merger would remain and that the proposed referendum would not be held.  However, Jaishankar had told Premachandran that much water has flowed under the bridge since 1987 and it will be better for all concerned to make use of the various windows of opportunity which have opened up recently with the change of regime in Colombo and secure the rights of Tamils. He had further argued that it would not be wise to hold every other matter hostage to one issue - the merger of the North and East.


This statement by the senior Indian official might have disappointed many Tamils in the country as well as the Tamil diaspora as they believe with or without reasons that their problems would be resolved through a settlement that includes the merger of these two provinces. But India had always handled Sri Lankas Tamil question keeping its interest in mind. The factors that pushed India to support the merger and the armed struggle of the Sri Lankan Tamil youth when the Indo-Lanka Accord was signed were different from the present circumstances under which Jaishanker absolves India from accepting some of the Tamil demands. 
Towards the 1970s president J.R. Jayawardene had provoked Indian leaders, especially Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who was a close ally of the socialist bloc in the bipolar world that prevailed then, by pursuing a policy bias towards the capitalist bloc headed by the USA. His allegiance to the West was seen by the Indian leaders as a part of the Western scheme to surround India, as Pakistan and Bangladesh already had strong links with the anti-socialist camp. At the same time India conveniently used the issue of more than 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees who had fled to India to escape the armed conflict in the North and the East as a ruse to meddle in the affairs of the island. 
Indian leaders in the process accepted the standpoint of Tamil leaders and pressurized the Sri Lankan government. It was against that backdrop that India supported the merger of Northern and the Eastern Provinces among other demands, in spite of the mixed demographic composition of the Eastern Province. Today India is definitely wary of Sri Lankas increasing economic ties with China, but it does not seem to want to use the same strategies it did in the 1980s to tame Sri Lanka. Today India looks forward to economic opportunities similar to those gained by China in the island for which Tamil demands are not so relevant. 


"However, Jaishankar had told Premachandran that much water has flowed under the bridge since 1987 and it will be better for all concerned to make use of the various windows of opportunity which have opened up recently with the change of regime in Colombo and secure the rights of Tamils"

Tamil leaders have been stressing for the past four decades mainly four main demands in their pursuit to a solution to the ethnic problem, namely recognition of right of the Tamil people to self-determination, merger of Northern and the Eastern Provinces, devolution of power and a federal form of governance.And they had in deed achieved four of the three goals for some extent through the Indo- Lanka Accord, but the merger of provinces was annulled by a Supreme Court ruling in 2006. 
It is in a way ironic that the parties that are pushing for devolution of power demand for the amalgamation of Northern and Eastern provinces as well. Devolution of power is a means to take the administration to the people by carving out smaller units of administration. The smaller the units, the easier the dealings with their local political administrators. 
The merger of Northern and the eastern Provinces was initially demanded by Tamil political parties and armed groups in the late seventies not in an economic perspective. It was purely a political demand based on an ethnic standpoint. In fact it was a shrewd concept put forward to use as a stepping stone for a future separate Tamil State. Since the government had sensed the motive it had opposed the demand from the beginning. 
When India intervened in the Sri Lankan ethnic issue in the early 1980s it had to strike a balance between the viewpoints of the government and the Tamil groups at least overtly while supporting the Tamil demands shrewdly and cautiously. Thus, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi convinced President Jayawardene to accept a temporary merger of Northrn and the Eastern Provinces until a referendum on the continuity of it in the eastern Province is held, while promising the Tamil leaders that the referendum in the East would never be held. This is what Premachandran had reminded Jaishankar of, on Monday. 


"The factors that pushed India to support the merger and the armed struggle of the Sri Lankan Tamil youth when the Indo-Lanka Accord was signed were different from the present circumstances under which Jaishanker absolves India from accepting some of the Tamil demands."

After this deception of President Jayawardene by Premier Gandhi, Sri Lankan authorities had included that agreement between the two leaders in the Provincial Councils Act promulgated in 1987. Accordingly, President Jayawardene had to merge the two provinces once the Tamil armed groups laid down arms under the provisions of the Accord.
However, fighting between the Indian forces and the LTTE broke out, in late 1987, making the merger legally impractical.Then India persuaded President Jayawardene to amend the Provincial Council Act using Presidential powers and emergency regulations in order to get the two provinces merged. 
Therefore, it is clear that the amalgamation of Northern and the Eastern Provinces was effected with Indias sheer deception and coercion and not with an understanding among the stakeholders. This was the moral basis that was employed apart from the Sinhala nationalistic agenda for the annulment of this merger in the legal battle on the matter in 2005/2006. 
All Ceylon Tamil Congress leader the late Kumar Ponnambalam had realized the undemocratic nature of the demand for the merger of the whole multi-ethnic Eastern Province with the Northern Province and he along with Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader the late M.H.M.Ashraff worked out a plan in 1988 to merge only the Tamil dominated areas of the Eastern Province with the Northern Province while amalgamating all Muslim areas in the two provinces as a separate administrative unit. 
Tamil and Muslim parties now have to look at the problem afresh in the post-war context. Now that the Tamils have lost their main bargaining power, the LTTE and the Indian support while the governments position with regard to the merger of provinces having been strengthened after their de-merger and having elections twice for the Eastern Provincial Council, the demand for the merger seems to be impractical or sometimes ridiculous.It is now just a prestige issue. 
In the same way, Muslim leaders in the East have to reconsider the validity of a Muslim Provincial Council in the light of the institution of the Eastern Provincial Council in 2007 and other post-war scenarios. The need of the day is integration of various communities without harming the identity as well as their rights them.

The National Freedom Front (NFF) led by MP Wimal Weerawansa said today the party's decision to act independently of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) has been misinterpreted.
It said the decision was taken to strengthen the joint opposition under the leadership of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The UPFA led by President Maitripala Sirisena acts as an ally of the government. Although the NFF contested the election on the UPFA ticket, it continues to act as party in the opposition. However, when allocating slots during parliamentary debates the group of UPFAers in the government are favoured better. The NFF has also been denied the opportunity to attend the party leaders meeting and make speeches under Standing Order 23/2, the NFF said.
Its propaganda secretary Mohamed Mussamil in his statement on behalf of the party said the NFF had requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on April 5, 2015 to recognize it as a separate party in Parliament but the request was not granted and as such we are making a fresh request to the Speeker.

Pakistan on edge as eight killed in fresh Lahore bomb blast
	

At least eight people were killed and 28 injured after a bomb ripped through Pakistans Lahore Thursday, officials said, the tenth attack in just under a fortnight pointing to a resurgence in Islamist violence. 
The blast, the second to hit the provincial capital this month, crumpled cars and sent panic rippling through the city after the wave of attacks across Pakistan killed more than 130 people. 
The building where the bomb went off was under construction in a market crowded with people, including children. 
Police and administration officials confirmed it was a bomb attack, as the provincial health minister Khawaja Salman Rafique and rescuers supplied the casualty toll. 
Four people died on the spot while another four died of their wounds in the hospital, Rafique said. 
No group has yet claimed responsibility. 
Just over an hour later rumours of a second blast in another affluent area nearby sent ambulances racing to the scene, though authorities later said the reports were false.
Panic also spread on social media as citizens exchanged messages purporting to be warnings from intelligence agencies, including one that falsely stated a general curfew had been ordered over Lahore with shoot-on-sight orders.
The rumours underscored growing nervousness across the country as a series of assaults shook Pakistanis emboldened by what had been a prolonged lull in violence.
The attacks included a previous bomb in Lahore on February 13 which killed 14 people, and a devastating suicide blast at a Sufi shrine in Sindh province that left 90 devotees dead.

The Coca Cola factory proposed to be established in Sri Lanka would further reduce the water resources which are already diminishing as a result of the drought, Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda charged.
Mr. Devananda told Parliament that Coca Cola was planning to shift the largest manufacturing plant owned by it in South Asia, which was initially situated in India, to Sri Lanka.
He therefore cautioned the government stating that the company has ran into trouble in India in addition to using up much of the water resources in the sub-continent.
The MP noted that at present Coca Cola was facing widespread criticism in India.
There are around 57 Coca Cola plants currently operating in India and they too have come under fire from the Indian legal system for violating the stipulated water usage limits. Furthermore, there is a severe drought affecting Indians and Indian courts have banned the company from utilizing water from the Thamirabarani River, he said.
Sri Lanka too is facing a serious drought. Several districts have no water. When such conditions are prevailing in Sri Lanka, Coca Cola want to use our water resources to meet the market demands of their largest consumer market in the region: India. How can this be allowed he questioned. (Yohan Perera, Ajith Siriwardana)

The longest night in the year when devotees pray  to attain moksha
	
For Hindus world over, Maha Shivarathri is a purely religious ceremony of daytime fast and vigilance throughout the night. They observe these special rites on the fourteenth night of Phalguna (February/March) which is the longest night in the year according to the Hindu calendar. This year it falls on the 24th of February.
These observances are started in the morning on this day and continued throughout the night in a bid to wash off all sins and pave the way for external bliss through basic religious disciplines of Avihinsa (non injury), Satya (truthfulness), Brhamacharya (Celibacy), Daya (compassion), Ksama (forgiveness) and Anissa (absence of jealousy)
Solemn occasion to worship Lord Shiva
Maha Shivarathri is a solemn occasion to worship Lord Shiva who is regarded as the ocean of love, ocean of knowledge, ocean of peace and ocean of happiness. God Shiva is formless (Arupa). However, out of compassion for devotees he appears in the form of luminous column arising out of Shiva Lingam. He takes form in this way for the sake of devotees who will otherwise be left in perpetual darkness.
Lingam  the object of veneration
The Lingam has thus become the object of veneration of Hindus. Lingam worship signifies that Lord Shiva is prevalent in Shivan temples from ancient times. It is believed that Lord Shiva is in Shivan temples wearing a leopard skin and seated on another leopard skin in meditation profound contemplation. Trident- the three pointed spear is his weapon. Udukkai, the drum which is narrow at the middle is his musical instrument. His vehicle is an ox. It is also believed that god Shiva normally in meditation is on mount Kailasa. He is emerald in complexion and his neck is blue. His ornaments are snakes. He has an additional eye which is powerful enough to destroy anything with a glance. Lord Shiva is also known as god Iswara. He is one of the Triumvirate of Hindu gods.

Brahma created the world. God Vishnu who is mild, kind and gentle protects the virtuous people and builds the world, which was created by Brahma. During the period of God Shiva, which is called Iswara Vinnsathiya, unrighteous and unjust people are punished and just and righteous people are protected by god Shiva. It is god Shiva who destroys the world at the end. As such god Shiva is responsible for the prosperity and well being of the universe. He is also responsible for destruction.
In Hinduism he is the supreme God. It is said that he has three wives. Uma or Umangana is the most beautiful goddess. Parvathi excelled in dancing and music. His third wife Ganga is only a symbol. She is symbolised as a stream of water flowing from god Shivas head.
Skanda Kumara or Karthikeya  the god of war and Ganesha god of wisdom are god Shivas sons- well known sons.
Shivarathri
Origin of Shivarathri is explained in Puranic legends. In the war between Devas (Or suras/gods) and Asuras (Demons or Titans gods were likely to be defeated at one stage. So, gods begged him to find a way to defeat Asuras who were unrighteous and unlawful. While lord Shiva was contemplating on a plan to defeat Asuras the exact way to win over the Asuras came to his mind. He felt that if they could find Amirtham, the medicine of immortality ambrosia the Asuras could be defeated because in that case gods could remain immortal.
God Shiva informed god Vishnu about the plan and it was put into action. Ambrosia or Nectar of gods was deposited in the bed of the Milk Sea. Milk Sea had to be churned to bring the elixir of immortality to the surface. God Vishnu pulled off Mandara rock and entwined with Naga King Vasuki and started churning it by pulling from the head and tail of the Naga king with the assistance of the other gods.
The valuable items that came to the surface of the Milk Sea
A number of rare and valuable things came to the surface. Lakshmi the goddess of fortune and prosperity was one of them.
The Kamadenu- the fabulous cow said to grant every wish, Karpaka celestial tree magical tree in the divine world were some other precious items that came to the surface.
The ambrosia or the medicine of immortality, which the gods needed most also came to the surface but with these items a virulent poison called Alahala was produced. God Shiva knew that this poison could be used by Asuras to destroy the universe if it were to go to their hands.
Neela Greeva  An appellation for god Shiva
Hence god Shiva gulped it down before Asuras could have access to it. Instantly god Shiva was unconscious and was swooned. Goddesses Uma and Parvathi started lamenting and all the gods were deeply concerned. However, within a spell of time the poison disappeared but god Shivas neck turned blue because the poison remained in his throat for some time. Hence Neela Greeva is an appellation for god Shiva. All the gods assembled around Kailasakuta to sing eulogistic songs because he had saved the universe from demons.
Lord Shiva worshipped in Sri Lanka from the time of Ravana
There is legendary evidence to the effect that ancestors of Sri Lanka had believed in and trusted in lord Shiva and worshipped Him from the time of Ravana. According to rock inscriptions belonging to the period from the first century to the third century BC, devoted Buddhists had the prefix Shiva before their names. In these rock inscriptions mention is made about names such as Shiva Bhuthi, Shiva Guna and Shiva Rakina. Such names had been used presumably because of their faith in god Shiva.
A tale of auspiciousness of Shivarathri
There is another story in Purana to explain the auspiciousness of Shivarathri.A hunter named Shiva who had killed many birds was being chased by a lion in the forest. In order to get rid of the lion he climbed a Vilva tree. To keep himself awake without falling into sleep and falling down from the tree Shiva went on plucking the leaves of the tree one by one and dropping them from the tree. This has pleased Lord Shiva and he has saved the hunter despite his sins of killing birds. Then the people started worshipping Shiva Lingam.

The relevance of Maha Shivarathri
	
Today Hindus in Sri Lanka and in many parts of the world observe the Maha Shivarathri -the night long vigil and prayer offered to the Supreme Being known as Sivaperuman by Tamil Saivaites.
It is about taking refuge in the divine consciousness, which brings peace and solace to all layers of consciousness. 
Shiva is considered to be the supreme of the triumvirate of the Hindu Pantheon, the other two being Vishnu and Brahma (Brahma should not be confused with Brahman or Para Brahman the Highest Brahman that which is beyond all descriptions and conceptualisations. 
Shiva is also known by other names Ishwara, Nataraja, Neelakanda and many more. He has thousands of names. The Nataraja form signifies why Shiva is the Supreme Being. The dance form is all about creative destruction. 
In Vaishnavism and Shaivism Vishnu and Shiva, respectively, are Para Brahman. In Advaita Vedanta, Nirguna Brahman (Brahman without qualities) is Para Brahman. 
Today is called Maha Shivarathri as there are 12 Shivarathries occurring every month. 
It is a major festival in Hinduism, but one that is solemn and marks a remembrance of overcoming darkness and ignorance in life similar to that of Deepavali. 
As common in Hindu thought, the concept behind the observance has theological meanings. But these concepts are related to children and the lay, in forms of stories so that once they gain spiritual maturity, they understand the true meaning behind. 
One of the important features of Shivarathri is that like Hinduism itself, the origin of the observance is not known. 
Shivarathri is observed by remembering Shiva and chanting prayers, fasting, doing Yoga and meditating on ethics and virtues such as self-restraint, honesty, non-injury to others, forgiveness and the discovery of Shiva. The ardent devotees keep awake all night. Others visit one of the Shiva temples or go on pilgrimage to Jyotirlingams. This is an ancient Hindu festival whose date of origin is unknown. During the night six special Poojas are offered to Lord Shiva. 
However, some of the laities thinking that being awake was the important aspect of the Maha Shivarathri, make it a movie marathon and go to the temple for important Poojas. Then there are others who keep awake till the midnight abishek Pooja as it is most important of all the Poojas that are held that night. 


"But then one would also ask why would anyone want to mark Maha Sivarathri in this era What relevance does it have Why waste milk and other food on abishek while there are thousands of babies who go hungry "

Incidentally, in Kashmir Saivism, the festival is called Har-ratri or phonetically simpler Haerath or Herath by Shiva faithfuls of the Kashmir region, according to some sources. 
Every lunar month, there is a Shivarathri i.e. 12 every year. The most important one is called Maha Shivarathri, or great Shivarathri. According to the Gregorian calendar, the day falls in either February or March.  One concept explains that Maha Shivarathri is the day when the Shiva Tattva touches the earth. The consciousness, the aura, or the ethereal world, which is always ten inches above the material ground, touches the earth element on the day of Maha Shivarathri. It is the coming together of the material and spiritual. 
Rathri (night) is that which gives us rest, and peace. Rathri also could be interpreted as to take refuge. Thus Shivarathri is taking refuge in ones own spirit (Shiva). It is the day that we try to understand our souls connection -that is none other than the Brahman -within ourselves as ones true nature is Shiva, and Shiva is peace, infinity. Recently scientists of the empirical school announced that after death, the soul mixes with the Cosmic Energy or the Universe (Whatever they meant by that) 
Stories 
Puranas contain many stories and legends describing the origin of this festival. According to a legend in the Shiva Purana, once the other two of the triads of Hindu Gods, Brahma and Vishnu, were fighting over who was the superior of the two. Horrified at the intensity of the battle, the other gods asked Shiva to intervene. To make them realise the futility of their fight, Shiva assumed the form of a cosmic column of light in between Brahma and Vishnu. They were instructed by Shiva to find the top and the bottom of the light column to prove their superiority. Both failed. 
The time Shiva showed up as the column of light is considered the Lingorpavam, which is that special midnight abishek Pooja of Maha Shivarathri. 
Another legend explains the all-night worship of Shiva on Shivarathri. There was once a hunter who was a great devotee of Shiva. One day deep in the forest he lost his way and could not return home before nightfall. As darkness fell, he heard the growls of wild animals. Terrified, he climbed onto the nearest tree for shelter till day-break. Perched amongst the branches, he was afraid he would doze and fall off the tree. To stay awake, he decided to pluck a leaf at a time from the tree and drop it, while chanting the name of Shiva. 


"Every lunar month, there is a Shivarathri i.e. 12 every year. The most important one is called Maha Shivarathri, or great Shivarathri. According to the Gregorian calendar, the day falls in either February or March "

At dawn, he realised that he had dropped a thousand leaves onto a Linga which was under the trunk of the tree. The tree happened to be the Vilva or (Beli) tree. This unwitting all-night worship pleased Shiva, by whose grace the hunter was rewarded with divine bliss. This story is also recited on Mahashivaratri by devotees on fast. After observing the all-night fast, devotees eat the Prasad offered to Shiva.  There is another possible reason for the origin of the all-night worship. Being a moonless night, people worshipped the god who wore the crescent moon as an adornment in his hair, Shiva. This was probably to ensure that the moon rose the next night. 
Maha Shivarathri is thus not only a ritual but also a cosmic definition of the Hindu universe. It expected to dispel spiritual ignorance, and emanates the light of knowledge, makes one aware of ones soul in the spiritual universe. 
According to one puranic story, the devas and the asuras once tried to extract the elixir for eternity from the cosmic milk ocean by churning the ocean. 
They used the Manthara mountain as their butter churn and used a serpent named Vasuki as the rope to churn the mountain. This implies that neither devas nor the evil asuras are eternal. Devas are just the refined elite among the crowd, whereas the asuras are the trade union workers. In their own way it was agreed upon that the asuras would hold on the head of the serpent, while devas would hold the tail, in case. 
During the churning process Vasuki the serpent because of the unbearable pain lets out its venom. The venom was so strong that both the devas and the asuras sought refuge in Shiva, who swallowed the venom and mitigated it. Some say the Maha Shivarathri marks this event. The symbolism involved in this story is beyond the scope of this article. The same motif is used as a basis for another Shiva Pooja known as Prathosham. But then one would also ask why would anyone want to mark Maha Shivarathri in this era What relevance does it have Why waste milk and other food on abishek while there are thousands of babies who go hungry 
Worth thinking 
Well, this goes beyond the material consumer world. The world that is felt by the physical bodies of living beings, especially intelligent humans. 
Unlike in other religions, for Hinduism the concept of Karma and rebirth according to Karma are very central. According to Hinduism the soul and the Para Brahman (Universal Energy) are infinite and eternal. Souls are eternal. So is Para Brahman. Humans are not destined or asked to rule over other beings-all are living beings (souls born into various material bodies) and one is born as a human being with intelligence based on the karma so that the soul is just one step away from leaving the samsara samudra (And become one with the Para Brahmam. 
Technologies will come and go, but the process of being reborn and seeking refuge and rest will continue. Hence, the question is irrelevant as the questions are based on the material world.

TNA will achieve purpose whatever happens at referendum: JO
	
If the government opts for a Constitutional referendum, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will achieve its objectives regardless of the referendum results, the Joint Opposition (JO) said yesterday.
Addressing the press, JO Parliamentarian MP Keheliya Rambukwella said the reason behind both R. Sampanthan and M.A. Sumanthiran calling for a referendum was because the TNA would benefit from it even if the referendum was lost.
If the referendum is won by us with a majority of over 95 per cent, the TNA would complain to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) while stating that it was the reason why they were unable to live in harmony with the Sinhalese for 65 years, he said.
MP Rambukwella also said the TNA could also complain that since the Sinhalese hold the majority power, democracy was abused -- which was the reason behind their loss, and seek the support of the United Nations to intervene for a separation.
MP said that it was the motive behind their claim for a referendum each time Parliament discusses the new Constitution as both options give the TNA a path to accomplish their objectives without proceeding to a referendum.
Therefore MP Rambukwella said that it was the people who would be the ultimate losers if the government implements the new constitution following a referendum. ( Thilanka Kanakarathna)

What should the quality of University Dons be Not this, definitely !
	
rajarata medical faculty
To read the interview by Kelum Bandara with the Rajarata Medical Faculty teacher Dr. Channa Jayasumana that appeared in the DM of 16 February (2017) captioned Sinhalese Culture and Theravada Buddhism have inseparable links was disappointing and disgusting to say the least. If Bandara intended to present to the Reader the quality of university teachers in the Rajarata Medical Faculty, well, then I honestly admire him. 

Reading the interview it was more than evident, Jayasumana a medical doctor [wonder from where he graduated] sounds a true fraud
i) as he has no clue what culture is and how the so called Sinhala culture evolved ii) has no proof but rhetoric based on blind beliefs on historical assumptions he makes iii) has no faith in the medical science he is teaching the students at the Rajarata university. Let me take the last issue, first. This is Jayasumanas world view and his belief, his trust deficit on what he learnt. In the name of modernism, what had happened in 15th and 16th centuries in Europe is the introduction of one-God concept, leaving the concept of multiple Gods. They believe in one GodWith the introduction of this new philosophy in Europe, it was spread throughout the world in the name of Protestantism, science, modern art and culture. It is the spreading of Maradivyaputhras power. And then he says, Actually, we have had a great tradition of medicine based on Buddhist teachings. We have had a great knowledge system. It is basically dependent on spiritual development.. Still, we have a few such good persons with spiritual development who can communicate with invisible spirits and gain knowledge. 


While all this is sheer hallucination, this also spells out his intellectual incapacity as a teacher in a medical faculty where Western Medicine is taught. According to Jayasumana, the ancient Sinhala vedamahaththaya who communicates with invisible spirits and gains knowledge is far superior to our MBBS qualified doctors. On his own argument, what he teaches the undergrads at the medical faculty is a project of Western imperialism to destroy Buddhism.Why is he then continuing with it 
Should a person of such unscientific mind be allowed to teach students at a medical faculty It is too dangerous to allow such a confused, unscientific person to teach in any university, let alone in a medical faculty. And therefore this brings to focus a very serious issue before authorities, especially the UGC and the higher education ministry, as to what quality of academics they would allow in universities. Will they allow a university teacher who does not believe and trust the very subject knowledge he/she teaches the students, to continue teaching in the faculty All those who are on the roads raising questions on the quality of medical education at SAITM that should not be compromised (agreed without questions) should also now raise the same issue with the quality of education at the Rajarata University Medical Faculty.What quality with teachers who dont believe and accept medical science, teaching medical undergrads  
A person with honour, one who is true to his own conscience who does not believe, does not have confidence in and trust the subject knowledge he/she had gained, would honourably resign from teaching that subject to others. A morally sound person would not teach to the younger generation any subject matter that he/she rejects as fake. Wouldnt it prove I am discussing an academic fraud


"A person with honour, one who is true to his own conscience who does not believe, does not have confidence in and trust the subject knowledge he/she had gained, would honourably resign from teaching that subject to others"


His understanding of Sinhala culture and Theravada Buddhism is also utterly chaotic. Culture is not something static and frozen in history. Culture is everything about individual and collective living. IF Jayasumana believes the Sinhala culture was there since Pandukhabaya, he is tribal in his intellectual life. Ancient Lankan life, like human life everywhere, evolved through very many external influences and interventions creating its own dynamics. All such influences and interventions changed and shaped culture anew, right along history and over centuries. 
Cultural change is so phenomenal, how ancient men dressed and had their hair is not how we do it now. That needs no proof than a photograph of those noblemen who signed the Kandyan Accord in 1815. Ancient womens dress that was according to caste is not how women dress now. Cultural change is one reason we dont see bare breasted women in society anymore. How we cook our food is not how the ancient villager or the Royals had their food cooked. Even the daily menu is different. So are marriage traditions. Wonder if Jayasumana would now want the old marriage tradition of living with all the sisters of a family taking them as wives (called binnabeheema) or sharing a single wife with all brothers (ekageyikema) That was our ancient Sinhala marriage tradition 200 years ago, replaced by the present Victorian culture of a nucleus family after the British took over the island. 
Even language, a major contributor to culture is that. Language evolves, grows through time and with borrowings from other languages. The Sinhala language that Jayasumana reads, writes and speak today wasnt in existence during Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa eras. That is why we dont have a single stone inscription in Sinhala as we know today. That was why writing on the walls of Sigiriya (kurutu gee) could not be read till Paranavithana waded through that unknown script.One neednt go far back into history to learn how language changes and evolves. One should read W.A. de Silvas novels and the present day novels to see how much even the Sinhala that we know of has changed. The Sinhala vocabulary Piyadasa Sirisena and W.A. de Silva used perhaps had far less words than what the present day writers have. Colonial interventions from 1505 have introduced many hundreds of foreign words that we dont even care to know whether they are foreign. If one removes those foreign words in everyday use like paan, bus, lorry, visa, channelling, shirt/kamise, fax, cinema, booruwa we will not be able to even communicate in this modern world. Obviously new technology, new knowledge, new concepts have introduced new words that wasnt even possible then to imagine.



So what is Sinhala culture Is it the culture of the bare breasted women and men with long hair knotted at the nape, where common punishment was to clap the guilty in wooden blocks (dandukandegaseema), eat whatever was available in the backyard, live within the birth village with no modes of transport and go to a spiritual healer when sick Or is it the culture of colours and fast changing fashions seen in women and men, where women drive the same cars and scooters the men drive on well carpeted roads that wasnt even known before the British came, sit in cafes and restaurants to order menus from China, India, or the West and shop in large departmental stores for everything from mobile phones to designer wear and imported processed food Can Jayasumana say our Sinhala culture is that of the bare breasted women of the past and not that of the T-shirt and denim wearing women of the present 


Even his talk of Buddhism is more primitive than that of an ordinary village upasaka. Theravada Buddhism is not about believing in multiple Gods as he believes. Theravada Buddhism is known to retain the philosophical base of what Lord Buddha presented in his preaching as the ultimate bliss achieved in concluding an otherwise never ending occurrence of re-birth (Samsara chakra). Jayasumana claims pre-Pandukabhaya era Lankans knew and understood this Samsara chakra even before Buddhism arrived on this soil. How on earth he assumes that is not known for most what he says lacks evidence other than his loony imaginations. 


What is more important is the fact the concluding of this Samsara chakra cannot be achieved by believing in multiple Gods. That ultimate bliss can only be achieved through a well disciplined mind that neither craves for luxuries in life nor goes on pauperised living. His notion of Theravada Buddhism with Budhusaranayi  Devi pihitayi (May Buddha lead and Gods assist) has nothing to do with Buddhas philosophical teachings. His Theravada Buddhism is a ritualistic practice with what he calls Buddhist divinities. That is nothing more than the Hindu concept of laying oneself at the mercy of the divine. 
Unfortunately for the students at the Rajarata Medical Faculty, their teacher does not even know what traditional medicine is. That traditional medicine is very primitive and is far less developed than Ayurveda practised here as one alternative to Western medicine. He is confused with men who used occult practices in their treatments and as he says .could even communicate with certain invisible forces. 
In everything he had said, he proves he knows nothing about culture, about Buddhism and about history of ancient Ceylon. Thus my appreciation of Kelum Bandaras effort in presenting to the reader, the quality and intellectual capacity of those articulate teachers in
State Universities.

Wimals decision not to go behind MR commendable: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that he was happy to note the decision of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP) led by MP Wimal Weerawansa to function independently in Parliament.
I am indeed thankful to Mr. Weerawansa and his party for this decision, as it means that he cannot work with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said.
He said there was no provision for the JNP to function as an independent entity in the House. He said each member of the JNP could function individually (according to the procedure) and not as a party. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
