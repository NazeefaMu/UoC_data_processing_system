Mr. Sudeera Senaratne, the Director of Investigations of the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka addressing the gathering

Senaratne, the Director of Investigations of the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka reminded the gathering of how just last year the Government declared the 1st of September as National Insurance Day thanks to the collaboration of the IASL and the IRCSL. Mr. Senaratne theorized this to be due to the value brought to the economy by the Insurance industry. He also advised the gathered Insurance advisors to think long-term rather than short-term. “Raising and building awareness is highly significant to the long-term development plan of Sri Lanka’s Insurance industry”.

Mr. Lokuarachchi, President of the IASL, emphasized on the primary duty of members of the Insurance industry, which is to provide protection for all lives and assets. “The current increase in life expectancy shows us that people are becoming more health conscious. A number of companies have recognized new opportunities in the current status of customer requirements and have accordingly introduced solutions to meet these needs. Today we have an opportunity to reach out to the general public and raise awareness about our trade. This is our chance to strengthen the vocation of Insurance”. 

What is now becoming the traditional oath of the industry was sworn at the conclusion of every event and group by group the Insurance advisors in their colorful t-shirts representing their respective companies scattered across the towns to fulfill their mission.
