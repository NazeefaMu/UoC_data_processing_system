The leaders of the political parties of the United National Front (UNF) pledged to stand in solidarity with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in the face of no confidence motion brought against him.

Party leaders Patali Champika Ranawaka, Palani Digambaram and Mano Ganeshan called on the Prime Minister to give him this assurance.

They said they would not support the motion because it had been brought in by the joint opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

During the discussion the Prime Minister agreed to appoint a committee to look into the crash programme introduced by Minister Ranawaka. (Kelum Bandara)
