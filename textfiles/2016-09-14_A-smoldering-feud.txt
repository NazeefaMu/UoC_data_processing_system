A smoldering feud


	



 

A state agency tasked with re-settling the war-displaced was recently established by the new Big Boss. He appointed a ‘Swamy’ from the North as the head of this agency and a ‘Bullah’ from the East as the Deputy.

 


The head of the state agency and his deputy soon fell out. The feud continued unabated and the deputy from the East finally met the Big Boss armed with his letter of resignation.


The deputy explained in the letter why he could not continue to work with the head who, he alleged, did not understand the meaning of ‘politics’.  


The Big Boss exhorted the deputy not to get unduly upset and asked the second in command to settle the dispute between the Head and the Deputy. 


The second in command brought about a settlement between the two antagonists after talking things over with them. However, informed ones say that though the fire is no more, sparks continue to simmer under the ashes
