NDB emerges as the Best Partner Bank – Sri Lanka at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Trade Finance Awards for the second consecutive year.


ADB announced the winners of its second annual Trade Finance Programme (TFP) Awards in Singapore. The awards recognized 15 leading partner banks for their role in supporting trade in the region.


This year’s TFP Awards ceremony was held at the Global Trade Review’s annual September conference—GTR Asia Trade and Treasury Week 2016—which is one of the best attended trade finance conferences in Asia. 


A total of 16 awards were presented to financial institutions, 15 awards went to financial institutions based in developing Asian countries. The awards recognize the TFP’s most active partner banks as measured by the number of transactions conducted during 2015 through to mid-2016.
Commenting on this award, NDB AVP Operations and Trade Services Rivindu Nanayakkara said, “We are extremely delighted and honoured to receive such international recognition today. Winning this award for the second consecutive year emphasizes the bank’s significant feats in the banking and financial domains and is a key outcome of successfully promoting trade finance within Sri Lanka and the region.”


The TFP provides guarantees and loans to over 200 partner banks to support trade. Backed by ADB’s AAA credit rating, the programme works with over 200 partner banks to provide companies with the financial support they need to engage in import and export activities. Since 2009, the TFP has supported more than 8,200 small- and medium-sized enterprises across the region, with about 11,800 transactions valued at over US $ 23.6 billion, in sectors ranging from commodities and capital goods, to medical supplies and consumer goods.
