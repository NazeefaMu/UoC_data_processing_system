The joint opposition (JO) today lodged complaints against the five Ministers and MPs, who were found contacting Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) owner Arjun Aloysius during the COPE hearings. 

Speaking to journalists outside the Bribery Commission (BC) office, JO MP Shehan Semasinghe said the complaints were lodged against Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara, Ajith P. Perera, Sujeewa Senasinghe and MPs Harshana Rajakaruna and Hector Appuhamy.

“We requested the BC to prepare a report after checking the assets of these ministers and MPs and their relatives. Minister Jayasekara has said he is innocent and he can prove this to the BC,” Mr. Semasinghe said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
