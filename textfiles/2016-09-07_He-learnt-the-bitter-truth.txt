He learnt the bitter truth


	



 

A prominent purohita in yahapalanaya holding a high post in his political party as well participated in a media program in Battaramulla area the other day.

 


The media program over, the purohita was hosted to tea. Meanwhile, several Betel leaf party TU activists of the place took advantage of the VIP’s presence to discuss some institutional problems. During the discussion, the purohita observed that the Betel leaf TU leaders at the institution did not appear to be active. He also wondered whether the party unionists here were followers of the former strongman. The TU leaders readily agreed that most of them remained loyal to the former strongman. They boldly added: “We too are his supporters!”


Affronted by the cheek of the TU leaders, the purohita harangued them and warned that they were no longer welcome at that media institution. 


The TU activists did not seem to have taken the purohita’s warning seriously. “We took the decision to back the former Lokka knowing well the risk we were taking,” they said easily. 


Thereafter, an irate purohita had walked out vowing under his breath to teach them all a lesson, they say.
