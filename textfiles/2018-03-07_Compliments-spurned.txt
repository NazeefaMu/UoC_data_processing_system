Compliments spurned


	



 

The purohitas in the top team as well as those at deputy and state levels who got new portfolios in the recent reshuffling of the pack had begun leaving the main office following the swearing-in ceremony. Some of them had looked quite happy while some others looked   glum; there had been one or two in an obvious sulk.

 


However, as congratulations were in order, one of the senior Blue purohita hailing from Wayamba smilingly approached a young Green former deputy soon after being sworn in as a state level one in charge of state-run lodges and said: “My congratulations, malli!” 


However, the new state level purohita ignored the extended hand of the Blue senior and retorted in an angry voice, “No felicitations please!  I am not at all happy with the damned thing I have been given!”
The Blue senior looked stunned as if he had received a hammer blow, they say.
