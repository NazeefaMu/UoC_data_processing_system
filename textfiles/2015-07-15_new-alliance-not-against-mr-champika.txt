United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) was not an alliance formed only against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but formed to fulfil the political reforms that could not be achieved in previous Parliament, Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary Patali Champika Ranawaka said today.
“This is not an alliance against Mahinda Rajapaksa. We were prevented from fulfilling certain political reforms, such as the case of appointing members to the Constitutional Council, due to lack of majority in Parliament. So, we decided to form an alliance to fulfil the political reforms promised at the last Presidential election,” he said.
Ranawaka said they would take steps to enact the Right to Information Bill and the National Audit Bill immediately after setting up the new government and added that action would be taken against corruption and fraud after setting up the Constitutional Council.
“We will release a new manifesto based on the President Maithripala Sirisena’s manifesto at the last Presidential Election,” he said.
Minister Ranawaka told a news conference that they would not allow certain forces that were attempting to turn back the peoples’ mandate at the general elections.
“We know that Mahinda Rajapaksa would not be satisfied with just an MP post or Premiership. We wanted to fight the force which is raising its head against peoples’ mandate,” he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
