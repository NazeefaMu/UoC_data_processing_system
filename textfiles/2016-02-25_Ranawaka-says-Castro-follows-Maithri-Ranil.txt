Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said Cuban leader Fidel Castro seemed to be following the policy of President Maitripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, when he extended an invitation to United States’ President Barak Obama to visit Cuba in June.

Addressing a function in Colombo, he said the Cuban leader had come to terms with global realities, and decided to afford a red carpet welcome to the US President.

He said the Cuban leader had taken such an approach after he witnessed the plight that befell the countries such as Brazil, Iran and Argentina after being hostile to the US.

“That is what the Government of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is doing.

Otherwise, it is not servitude to the US. Today, Fidel Castro seems to be following the policy of Maithri-Ranil approach in this manner,” he said.

He said the non-aligned foreign policy was always the best.  (Kelum Bandara)
