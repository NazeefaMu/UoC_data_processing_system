How he showed his displeasure


	



 

This politico, a quiet type, had been a longstanding loyalist of Number Two. However, his loyalty did not pay dividends when assigning portfolios; of course, he got a portfolio, but not the one he aspired to. 

 


The politico has his own way of registering his displeasure. His boss recently paid his first ever visit to his home turf since yahapalanaya taking office. His colleagues who attended this event brought large crowds of supporters with them. But this politico turned up at the event with a few supporters and made it a point to keep a low profile at the event, they say.
