A mothers best gift to the world
	
From the cradle to the grave, maybe a clich but it is vital and true in the case of breastfeeding. People-friendly nutritionists have found that if babies are breastfed for at least 6 months or preferably more, their immune system would be stronger, their confidence and IQ higher and they are likely to play a bigger role in making society a better place. 
World Breastfeeding Week is celebrated every year from August 1-7 to encourage breastfeeding and improve the health of babies around the world. According to the World Health Organisation(WHO), it marks the Innocenti Declaration signed in August 1990 by government policymakers, WHO, UNICEF and other organisations to protect, promote and support breastfeeding.
Breastfeeding is the best way to provide infants with the nutrients they need. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding starting within one hour after birth until at least baby is 6 months old.
Nutritious complementary foods could then be added while continuing to breastfeed for up to 2 years or beyond, the WHO says. 
This year, WHO is working with UNICEF and partners to promote the importance of helping mothers breastfeed their babies within that crucial first hour of life. Skin-to-skin contact along with suckling at the breast stimulates the production of breastmilk, including colostrum, also called the babys first vaccine, which is rich in nutrients and antibodies.
However the WHO says the Global Breastfeeding Scorecard, which evaluated 194 nations, has found that only 40 per cent of children younger than six months are breastfed exclusively which means given nothing but breast milk and only 23 countries have exclusive breastfeeding rates above 60 per cent. Breastfeeding gives babies the best possible start in life. Breast milk works like a babys first vaccine, protecting infants from potentially deadly diseases and giving them all the nourishment they need to survive and thrive, said WHOs Director General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Only Rs. 750 for a newborn is required to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding among children under six months to 50 per cent by 2025. In other words breast milk is not only priceless but also precious because it increases the bond of love between the mother and the child. 
Thankfully, Sri Lanka could be proud that it is the first in breastfeeding, according to UNICEFs Health and Nutrition Officer Dr. Dhammika Rowel. This is good news despite intensified efforts by milk powder companies to promote substitutes for breast milk. Addressing a news conference at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo on Tuesday Dr. Rowel also pointed out breastfed infants developed confidence and their IQ level increased to more than 10 points. 
The Health Ministry along with other public and private organisations will conduct country-wide programmes to make mothers aware of the need to and the benefits they could obtain by breastfeeding for at least 6 months and preferably for about 2 years. According to the UNICEF Nutrition officer a childs brain grows during the first three years in his or her life and breast milk helps the children become confident, energetic and healthy adults. She urged that breast feeding working mothers be given day care facilities in state and private institutions.
Health Promotion Bureau Director Dr. Paba Palihawadana also said breast milk increased immunity of infants while protecting the mother from breast and ovarian cancers. She said Breast milk reduced the risk of developing Non Communicable Diseases when infants became adults and therefore all infants should be breastfed during the first six months without any other liquid or food. Dr. Palihawadana also said breast milk was the best food that could be given to an infant during travelling, when facing a natural disaster and when the mother or child fell sick.
Consultant Gynaecologist Dr. U.D.P. Rathnasiri said breastfeeding also reduced the risk of developing Postpartum Depression in mothers. If mothers did not breastfeed, it could lead to various complications when the milk was collected in the breasts. Breastfeeding could also cut down the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes in mothers, he said. 
International lactation consultant Pamela Wiggins has said breastfeeding is a mothers gift to herself, her baby and the earth. We hope our mothers, especially the younger ones, will remember this.

An appreciation of Alfie David He was a selfless public servant
	
Since the sad news of our fathers passing away on July 15 (Sunday), the many messages of condolence we have received have been filled with vivid memories of his kindness, compassion, generosity and gregarious personality. We have been gladly reminded of the respect, admiration and love which people around the world felt for him. 
Alfred Kulendran David, or Alfie to his friends, was a diplomat, a selfless public servant for his beloved Sri Lanka. he was also a sportsman, a scholar, a man of deep religious faith and, above all, a man who loved his family and friends. 
His thirty-five-year diplomatic career spanned to three continents and eight postings, bookended by arriving in Paris and his retirement from Islamabad in 2000. He spoke fondly of the cohort of six who topped the entrance exams and together joined the Foreign Service in 1965: Jayantha Dhanapala, Nihal Rodrigo, Willhelm Wouterz, N. Navarathnarajha and Nandasiri De Silva. He revelled in their camaraderie and the sense of purpose that they shared. As Head of Mission, he was responsible for an ever growing number of countries. As High Commissioner to Bangladesh (1988-1993) he was also Ambassador to Nepal. As Ambassador to Sweden (1995-1998), he took responsibility for Denmark, Finland and Norway. Subsequently, he expanded Sri Lankas formal diplomatic relations to concurrently become Sri Lankas first Ambassador to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
There were many memorable highlights to his career, notably representing Sri Lanka at the 1988 UN General Assembly and the SAARC Summits of the80s and 90s. Though perhaps meeting Mother Teresa in New Delhi, where he was Deputy High Commissioner stood out. His work, experiences and studies gave him an abiding interest in approaches to peace and conflict management, particularly in South Asia.
He was proud to be Sri Lankan, proud of his Tamil and Christian heritage, and wanted above all else a peaceful, united and reconciled country. 
He was an athlete, a cricketer, a ruggerite and a tennis player. A renowned schoolboy athlete, he held the Public School Boys and the Peradeniya Hop Step and Jump record for many years and captained the Peradeniya rugby team.
Wesley College bore a special place in his heart. For the schools 125th anniversary, he wrote eloquently about the schools history and of his own time when there. He was Passmore House Secretary, Captain of the Athletics team, College Prefect, Editor of the Double Blue Magazine (1958), Student President of the Student Christian Movement (SCM) and a member of the debating team. In the year 1958 he was the recipient of the Moscrop Award for the best all-rounder. When he graduated with a History degree from Peradeniya, it was to Wesley that he returned to teach for a year.
Recommended by his friend from Jayatilake Hall, Jayantha Dhanapala, he joined Whittall Bousteads while preparing for the highly competitive Foreign Service exams.
His strong religious beliefs and concept of service to others were ignited through his association with the SCM at Wesley. His passionate activism is well remembered by those also at the 1960 SCM conference in Lahore and by his appointment as Acting General Secretary of the National SCM in 1965.
Alfie was fiercely loyal to his family. He aspired to always honour the memory of his parents, Paul (Deputy-Principal of Zahira College) and Mabel (ne Gnanapragasam). After his fathers early death, as the eldest child, he felt a deep responsibility for the well-being of his mother, his sister Sarojini and his brothers, Joe, Paul and Charlie.They too, till his very last days showed to him that same love and care. Alfie met Ranji in 1965 in Colombo. After a Parisian engagement and a London wedding in 1967, Alfie and Ranji embarked on a sometimes adventurous, and sometimes challenging, diplomatic life.
For us, his three daughters, Shona (Sudeshna), Shantha and myself, we know that he is at last at peace. We are thankful to have been loved and cherished by him and to have been encouraged to always reach for the moon (and you will at least end up on the coconut tree!). We have been blessed that his legacy will live on in his grandchildren, Oliver Elliot Rae (12), Ella Ranjini Baalham (9) and James Alexander Baalham (7).
-Dr. Sumi David

Black July 1983 PEACE: Ora et Labora
	
The day our greatest feat of communal hatred was shamefully exhibited to the whole wide world


The spirit of oppression and counter defiance continues to remain in a subtle way in the minds of people to date

We remembered 70 years of our Independence this year. Our ethnic struggles spanned 60 years since 1958 and 35 yearssince 1983.

Thirty-five years ago on Friday, July 27, 1983, a rumour spread like a wildfire through the city of Colombo, that the LTTE had infiltrated Colombo!
There were chaos and utter panic in the city. Fear gripped the people, offices closed, transport ground to a halt. In some IDP complexes, crackers were lit, people came out of some IDP centres on to the streets, hoping to cheer the liberators!
It was only a rumour! While there was panic on the part of the majority community, there was a spirit of jubilation among the common minority folk.
There were no liberators and so they slunk back into the IDP centres. In the North, it was on this same day July 27, eight years earlier, that Jaffna Mayor Alfred Durayappah was assassinated on the steps of the Ponalai Vishnu Temple in 1975!
This spirit of oppression and counter defiance continues to remain in a subtle way in the minds of people to date.
There is no great change in attitudes, in spite of all our religious asseverations, there is mistrust, suspicion, pride and unwillingness to reach out to one another.
Today violence, robbery and murder are taking place even in places of religious worships.
Is it because we have glorified some parts of our history and forgotten some good and noble qualities of our Kings We all know of the battle of the Kings  Dutu Gemunu and Elara. Dutu Gemunu and Elara are slain.
What do we know about the Elara Sohonna [Elaras Tomb] The royal funeral was King Dutu Gemunus greatest tribute to the fallen King! 
On the spot where his body had fallen he burnt it with the catafalque and there did he build a monument and ordain worship. And even to this day the Princes of Lanka when they draw near to this place, are wont to silence their music because of this worship [MW. XXV. 71  74. ]
The Dakkhina Viharaya was thought to be the Elara Sohonna for a long time! Now, we do not know where it is!
This may or may not be the place, what is important is the magnanimous gesture of the King Dutu Gemunu to honour the fallen King Elara  his enemy.

On the spot where Elaras body had fallen King Dutu Gemunu burnt it with the catafalque and there did he build a monument and ordain worship.

What an example for us to emulate today to ensure respect and dignity of all sons and daughters of Sri Lanka.
In 1948 our forefathers united and strove for our Independence from colonial domination. Ceylon was now free to develop and impact our part of the world.
The Colombo Plan an intergovernmental effort to enhance human resource development in the Asian nations was conceived in January 1950 and formally launched in July 1951 in Colombo.
Present at these strategic meetings was Lee Kwan Yew the founding father of Singapore.
He saw the blueprint for the development of his little nation! He dreamed a big dream and made his pluralistic citizenry realize the dream of unity in diversity!
Did Singapore take away our birthright
With her struggles and Independence in 1965, that little dot in Asia has earned the status of a 1st World nation.
Singapore - a little bigger than the City of Colombo, having four official languages is a multi-faith, multi-ethnic, a vibrant economy exuding a proud united Singaporean national spirit, an example to all nations!
While other nations were experimenting with the legacy of the Colombo Plan agenda to build up their nations, we had divisive policies that led to the infamous 1958 Racial Riots [May 22-27]. We followed with the JVP Insurrection April to June 1971. There was our comeback to communal conflicts Aug 12 -20 1977.

There is no great change in attitudes, in spite of all our religious asseverations, there is mistrust, suspicion, pride and unwillingness to reach out to one another.

Following this was our greatest feat of communal hatred which was shamefully exhibited to the whole wide world from 24 to 30 July 1983 when many parts of our motherland were filled with fears, tears and smoke  Black July!
If the noble teachings of our religions cannot speak, let the stones and statues speak.
All who travel to Jaffna on the A 9 highway, have seen or should see the King Pandara Vanniyan statue in the Vavuniya Kacheri premises.
He was one of the last warrior Northern Kings who prevented the colonial forces from entering the Vanni.
This same King is revered highly by the Sinhala people as Vanni Bandara Deio whose name is used in incantations for blessings and protection. Can we not use these beliefs to enable adherents of diverse faiths to reach out to one another in comradeship as fellow citizens of a united Sri Lanka.
Why have we not honoured real-life heroes like Ven. Ananda Himi of Madukanda, who has donated blood 50 times for largely Tamil people What about the 300 seamen from the Poonewa Camp who responded when the Vavuniya Hospital was filled with over 3,000 injured evacuees from the Vanni and there were no blood donors to help in such a humanitarian crisis to save lives at the end of the war in 2009.
What about the unknown elderly couple who led a former Defence Minister and party through the jungles to safety in Vavuniya, after their chopper crashed in the Vanni area What un-applauded sacrifice, courage and service!
Recently, a Whatsapp clip of an ITN Over The Shoulder programme featured Mr Dharmasiri Bandaranayake.
Bandaranayakes strong and emotional condemnation of the burning of the Jaffna Public Library evoked many painful memories in ones mind.
He specifically mentioned the untimely demise of the late Rev. Dr H.S. David. This illustrious priest scholars heart could not cope with the senseless, horrendous act, where his lifetime labour of love was burning under the night skies of Jaffna.

Jaffna Public Library
He died of a heart attack with a phone in hand!
It was one of Jaffnas darkest nights [1 June 1981] and a permanent indelible black spot in Sri Lankas history! How can this happen Why has it happened
Going back to the Jaffna Library burning, let us take a mental journey to the Christu Seva Ashram, Chunnakam.
Here another Tamil Christian leader Sevak Sam Annan quietly and secretly started collecting debris from the burnt library and piling it inside the Ashram premises! This happened sometime during the IPKF occupation of Jaffna.
It was also at this time that ola-leaf manuscripts, ancient jars, pottery and other artefacts exposed to the elements near the telecom buildings were being salvaged by the IPKF and taken for safekeeping to India!
Later Sam Annan succeeded in erecting a Calvary Hill of Forgiveness near the entrance of the Ashram!
This saintly man of God turned the piles of rubble into a serene hill of contemplation.
What should we do to those who seek to destroy us and all that is ours We need to forgive. Father forgive them for they know not what they do.
As a Christian, he was able to relate and direct the hopeless, helpless situation to Jesus Christ his and our Suffering Servant Lord!
Today this silent sentinel of peace and reconciliation stands as Jaffnas grieving heart!
It is a transformed micro representation of the debris of the old Library!
So, the original bleeding heart of the Library is mysteriously enshrined in the Ashram! There it stands hidden from the gaze of many and unknown to many of our citizens.
It is only Gods grace and love that can help us and our nation to overcome evil! So as Christians we also pray and actively work, worship and many times walk to promote the cause of peace and reconciliation in our land!
We remembered 70 years of our Independence this year. Our ethnic struggles spanned 60 years since 1958 and 35 years since 1983.
As we are in the Black July Week and the Black Friday, July 27, 1983, what can we do to bring about a difference
Is there something you need to do personally The time has come for all of us to walk our talk on behalf of our motherland or it may be too late for change! Ora et Labora!

Do away with Schol altogether
	
Religion is the business of the parents and the home. It is NOT the business of the school.


Religion (and culture) is bred in our hearts and bones by daily practices, by home observances, by parental guidance and example.
The Daily Mirror Editorial gave a horrendous picture of the average day of a Grade Five student.

It is a time for them to be CHILDREN not crammers hell-bent on getting into an elite school after the results are known.


The continuing folly of the Grade Five examination has been attacked in the Daily Mirror of July 26 with great force but as usual the pundits of the Department of Education will take no notice.
On another page of the same date Minister Eran Wickremaratne has suggested the importance of an ethical education for children. Again, who is going to do anything about actually ensuring such a thing

It cannot be taught. Value Education on the other hand can be handled by teachers with a fair amount of general knowledge and a desire to read. Subjects like Abortion are discussed and every child givesa view.

Most educationists agree that the Grade Five exam is a ridiculous test of the future aptitude of children.
I have written about it several times but always with a sense of hopelessness since I well know that my views will never be even read by those who are in a position to change the course of Education in our country.
So, let me take the question Ethical Education first. I was probably the first person to actually teach it during my tenure of Principal of Asian International School. When the school was founded there was absolutely no Government interest in the syllabuses of the schools and no ridiculous enforcement of religion being compulsory.
Ergo, Principals were free to teach Ethics or something along those lines if they wished.
Being influenced by the sage Krishnamurti from an early age I looked around for a system which would help out students which was acceptable to all faiths.
I was able to access what was termed VALUE EDUCATION in Krishnamurtis school in India (the highly regarded Rishi Valley School) and my daughter, Khulsum Edirisinghe, visited his school Oak Grove in Ojai, California and brought back the syllabuses taught there.

One hopes the Grade Five exam will be done away with altogther. There must be a better way of giving bright children placements at better schools more to their liking.

We implemented them at once and never has any subject been so popular with the children.
The classes we selected for this course were all Middle School children and to this day they recall the subjects discussed, the facts they learnt about other faiths and the open opinions they were allowed to give with gratitude.
Unfortunately the teaching of this subject depended on the one teacher who had been to the Krishnamurti schools and knew how to teach it.
It was not possible to continue for more than a few years. The teaching of religion on the other hand sent most kids to sleep.
Syllabuses are boring specially when memorization of Gathas are necessary, and the failure of religious education is clearly seen in the rising violence among the youth of this country.
Religion is the business of the parents and the home. It is NOT the business of the school.
Religion (and culture) is bred in our hearts and bones by daily practices, by home observances, by parental guidance and example.
It cannot be taught. Value Education on the other hand can be handled by teachers with a fair amount of general knowledge and a desire to read. Subjects like Abortion are discussed and every child gives a view.

But one wonders what ethical values can be taught in Sri Lanka when our teachers are assailed almost daily in the press as engaging in the most egregious activities
Nothing is forced on a child but they can learn to think for themselves.
But one wonders what ethical values can be taught in Sri Lanka when our teachers are assailed almost daily in the press as engaging in the most egregious activities
I come now to that Grade Five exam and the effect on our youngsters. The Daily Mirror Editorial gave a horrendous picture of the average day of a Grade Five student.
They are only ten years old for heavens sake. Why all this regimentation at a time they should be enjoying themselves and enjoying being at school It is a time for them to be reading, playing games, being naughty perhaps, engaging in one or two extra-curricular activities.
It is a time for them to be CHILDREN not crammers hell-bent on getting into an elite school after the results are known.
Matters are further exacerbated by the publicity given to those children who get the highest marks. All those who NEARLY made it to the top get nothing. The anger and frustration of parents who have probably spent a fortune of tuition has to be imagined.
Then the Press gets into action with pictures of the top scorers printed in the papers and all sorts of prizes being also highlighted for the general public to see. Frankly, how many of us care Those children may or may not be the successes they are expected to be. I am told (but have no proof) that they can be very unhappy at these elite schools where they are nowhere near the top of their classes when faced with their better prepared classmates. They therefore, allegedly, spend all their time studying and have no time for sport or any school activity like drama, choir etc. Is this true
What is more relevant at this point is a follow up of the scholarship winners of about ten years ago to find out whether or not the system has worked in their favour and if it has been worth it. Are there any such statistics
As for the psychological impact this Grade Five exam has on children of ten years I hesitate to even comment. It must be appalling. Ten years old and pressurized by parents and teachers to study, study, study. Truly, is this education
One is reminded of the Mandarin Exams of China where candidates were put into little cells and the exams went on for a few days. They memorized great tracts of information and the results earned them high offices. But they were adults. They were not children of ten. One hopes the Grade Five exam will be done away with altogether. There must be a better way of giving bright children placements at better schools more to their liking.
Or are our opinions treated like the famous Bob Dylan song just Blowing in the Wind

Esala on Deer Park Valley of Isipatana
	
Countering Racial Myths Through Middle Path

Pavattite ca panabhagavatadhammacakke bhumma deva saddamanussavesu<U+1E43>saddamanussavesu<U+1E43>: eta<U+1E43>abhagavata bara<U+1E47>asiya<U+1E43>isipatane migadaye
The devas of the earth proclaimed, The Bhagava has set in motion the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, which cannot be stopped by Sama<U+1E47>as or Brahmins, Devas, Maras, Brahma or anyone in the world. 
Thus at that instant, the cry stretched as far as the extraterrestrial worlds, and tens of thousands fold planetary system quaked, shook, and trembled and a vast magnificent radiance emerged, outshining the divine splendor of the Devas. 

Bringing the mindto the centre
His voice lingered setting forth the Dhamma Wheel through the valleys of Deer Park, in Isipatana, Baranasi; avoiding the extremes, the middle way realized by the Buddha produced knowledge and vision. This knowledge helped followers of the Buddha find tranquility and self-awakening.
We human beings, why erect walls between our neighbours and ourselves through imaginary phenomena, race, creed, caste, and class  which breed loneliness and isolation

Only a mentally unsound person sees illusions or things that do not exist, but believes that they do exist

 
The Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta
The commencement of moving, Dhamsak Pevatum, Great Discourse can mean a range of effects depending on its circumstance; here, it refers to the Buddhas teachings or truth that guide one to freedom from suffering. Cakka can be interpreted as wheel. Dhamma-Wheel, is --a Buddhist icon referring to Buddhas teaching of corridor to enlightenment. Pavattana is setting in motion, turning, or rolling. The enlightened one illustrates the four noble truths ariyasaccas for the first time. The two ends that are disapproved or undesirable are of commitment to self-suffering, devotion to sensual pleasure; painful and unprofitable. avoiding both of these extremes, focus on middle path as comprehended by the Buddha. 

An important ritual, the Vas, or the rains retreat of the monks begins on the day after the Esala Poya

The significance of the day
Esala symbols the announcement of the Noble Eightfold Path. It is the anniversary of the first sermon by the Enlightened One. Buddhas preaching of Dhamma-cakka-pavattana Sutta on an Esala Poya Day in Benares at the Deer Park to the five ascetics, which could be considered the most important event in the history of Buddhism. Esala celebrates several other happenings too the conception of the Bodhisatta in Queen Mahamaya, the arrival of the Tooth Relic in Sri Lanka, Great Renunciation by Siduhatt, performance of Miracles and preaching of the Abhidhamma by Gautama Buddha in Tavtimsa heaven to Mathu Divya [mother]. The first ordination in Sri Lankan of the nephew of the king Prince Arittha, at Anuradhapura by Arahath Mahinda; the foundation laying for the Ruwanveli Dagoba are also among them. An important ritual, the Vas, or the rains retreat of the monks begins on the day after the Esala Poya. 

Freedom from Sansaric bonds
Only in the minds which are conflict-free, one can find total freedom; it cannot be established in any political structure like democracy, communism or socialism. To be free, we have to look within our own minds and work towards freeing ourselves from the chains of unawareness, ignorance and craving. Buddha, never chose to influence political power to introduce his Dhamma, although the Blessed One closely was associated with kings, ministers and princes; nor did he allow the teachings to be misused or abused to gain undue benefits. Many politicians, of competing factions today, are dragging Gautama Buddha and his Dhamma into politics by quoting and misinterpreting the Sutras. Quite a few temples have become central propaganda offices of political interests. Recognised political organisations persuade Sangha units within the party machinery while a few saffron robed extremists elements have formed political units to assist politicians contest elections. 

Racial myths and Dhamma
When we divide and call ourselves as Sri Lankan, Sinhalese, a Muslim, a Buddhist or a Christian, or anything else, we are separating ourselves from the rest of mankind and we become violent. Why do we become violent Because when we separate ourselves by belief, by nationality, by tradition, it breeds hostility and aggression. A man who is seeking to comprehend violence does not fit in to any race, any country, or religion, or to any political party. Extreme nationalism is one of the fundamental reasons for war and for the awful destruction and misery of the humankind. What is the purpose of we identifying ourselves with a faction, with a particular country or group, weather socially, economically, or politically

We are only Homo sapiens
Unlike flora and fauna, all human beings belong to one species only, the human variety/species is called Homo sapiens. Tamil, Sinhalese, English and a thousands of other nationalities and races are only labels born out of belief and having no inherent significance whatsoever. 
Check your entire body as carefully as possible. Is there any particular part in it or spot which differentiates it as a Muslim, Sinhalese or Tamil People differ in complexion of skin such as tan, black, brown, fair..., as a result of climatic and geographical conditions. Does that colour indicate as to what nationality, race or caste a person fits in to We are common to the human race, unfortunately, as a child grows up he or she will be deemed to belong to a particular nationality or race. The child who is incompetent in rational thinking, cannot differentiate fact from fiction and who does not have the ability to judge, compare and contrast against, believes selfishly and mistakenly the nationality, race, caste are as facts, being ignorant that it has been forced upon him or her. Having accepted it he/she gradually comes to believe that it belongs to a particular race or nationality. One becomes a Sinhalese or Tamil not because he/she had something obviously Sinhalese or Tamil, but because of the self-assurance formed and forced on the person by the civilization and culture. 
Only a mentally unsound person sees illusions or things that do not exist, but believes that they do exist. At the mental hospice there was a patient who called himself King Dutugemunu. Not only did he confidently believe that he was Dutugemunu, but in his conduct he even demonstrated a pompous royal appearance. If challenged, the unfortunate man would regard the challenger to be a lunatic. 

What the Awakened One said
Gautama Buddha emphatically stated in Kalama Sutta, Do not accept anything on the influence of tradition handed down by the older generation; anything because you think it ought to be so; anything because of its agreement with the doctrines of your books. Do not accept anything because it is rational; anything because it is logical; anything because it agrees with your own pet view; anything because it is said by an ascetic whom you are bound to honour. 
In realising the truth, it necessitates that we take nothing for granted; that we believe nothing on faith or conviction. Question every little thing about ourselves, practice with diligence and sincerity. Confront and challenge most basic beliefs and convictions, even those we may have about the Dhamma itself; a spirit of inquiring, a spirit of critical assessment, that is what Buddha lay emphasis on in Kalama Sutra. 
To transform the world, we must commence with ourselves; and what is noteworthy in beginning with ourselves is the purpose. The purpose must be to understand ourselves and not to assign it to others to convert themselves or to get about a personalised change through revolt. It is significant to know that this is our responsibility. Thought is so cunning, so smart, so crafty that it distorts everything for its own expediency. 
May all beings be happy!

IMF warns China against aggressive economic stimulus
	

BEIJING AFP July27, 2018- China must resist taking aggressive stimulus steps as it navigates troubled economic waters as they could add to excessive debt levels leading to an abrupt adjustment, the International Monetary Fund said Friday. 
The IMF warning, contained in a policy report, comes after Chinese leaders earlier this week signalled a shift toward looser fiscal policy to help barricade the worlds second-largest economy against global economic turbulence. 
After more than a year of aggressively cracking down on dangerously high debt levels, Chinas cabinet on Monday said it would be more active in stimulating the economy, citing external uncertainties. 
But the IMF said a reversion to credit-driven stimulus would further increase vulnerabilities that could eventually lead to an abrupt adjustment.

Imran Khan declares victory but his win could thrust Pakistan into turmoil
	

By Pamela Constable
(c) 2018, The Washington Post, Jul 27, 2018 - ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Imran Khan, onetime international cricket star and tabloid playboy who reinvented himself as a crusading anti-establishment politician, declared victory Thursday for his party in parliamentary elections, even as his rivals charged that the polls had been rigged and the official results remained unclear.
In a statesmanlike address, Khan set out a grand vision for a new government that would end corruption in high places, protect the weak and ensure equal rights for all. But the taint of a questionable victory, and the contentious aftermath of an election that toppled the ruling party, seemed more likely to usher in a period of political turmoil than a smooth transition. Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state and a longtime security ally of the United States, has a history of the military pushing out or overthrowing elected leaders. Until 2008, no elected head of state had finished a full term. Wednesdays election has been seen as a critical test of the democratic institutions in a country with a strong, influential military.
On election day, opponents from several major parties alleged fraud at the polls.
In his speech Thursday, Khan tried to placate the election critics, offering to help probe any wrongdoing at the polls. 
Khan also briefly described his foreign policy plans, saying he wanted to have mutually beneficial relations with the United States. In the past, he has strongly condemned the U.S. deployment of drones to kill suspected Taliban extremists in the border areas of Pakistan.

## Title: Media mislead us on Trumps press conference in Helsinki

Media mislead us on Trumps press conference in Helsinki
	

I dont think Ive ever witnessed in all my years of journalism such a hysterical outpouring against a presidential statement as Ive seen the last week. President Donald Trump has even been accused of treason by prominent columnists and politicians. Theres barely a voice of dissent in the media.
(Maybe its written but not published.) No wonder that even some of my normally open-minded friends feel that things are as bad as they are made out to be. Sorry to say it, as Ive told them, they are being brainwashed.
The issue is Trumps dishing of his intelligence services during his press conference with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. He denied their conviction that Russia had meddled in the election that brought Trump to power. In standing by Putins denial on this he speared the sacred heart of the American foreign policy establishment, the so-called Blob. Only Republican voters stood upright beside him- the same ones who Trump boasted would still support him even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue as they walked along.
I dont know who is right about this. Im a Trump opponent too. But I want the truth revealed. Maybe Trump is right, maybe the critics are. But Im waiting for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, charged with investigating the election and the allegations swirling in its aftermath, to present his full report. Before reading a word of it I lean towards believing it. Why

I dont know who is right about this. Im a Trump opponent too. But I want the truth revealed. Maybe Trump is right, maybe the critics are. But Im waiting for the special counsel, Robert Mueller, charged with investigating the election and the allegations

When Richard Nixon was president two successive Special Prosecutors did a superb job in investigating Watergate. It didnt matter that Nixon was a paid-up Cold War warrior, he had done a grievous wrong in trying to influence in an underhand way the coming election and it had to be exposed. Facing impeachment Nixon resigned. This is why I have a good deal of faith in Mueller.
But I dont have faith in Americas public opinion being whipped into an anti-Trump shape by overstating and misleading the public on what transpired in Helsinki without proof at hand. I prefer to wait and see until the evidence is fully sifted.
No other country has twisted and misrepresented its intelligence findings more than the US. There would have been no war against Iraq if US intelligence, with British MI6 connivance, hadnt said that Iraq held weapons of mass destruction when they knew it hadnt. This time we need to be allowed to read the intelligence given to the President for ourselves. Thats what the media should be digging for. But will they So many of its most influential members supported going to war against Iraq.
Its unlikely, given their display of wrath last week, they will do any better this time around.
Today its an accepted fact that US and British intelligence connived to misrepresent the state of Iraqs military power in order to justify going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction when it didnt. Many of the big voices in the media supported going to war.
People who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones. The New York Times in February interviewed Steven Hall who had been the chief of Russian operations at the CIA. Did the Russians break the rules, the answer is no, not at all. The US absolutely has carried out such election influence operations historically, Hall said, and I hope we keep doing it.
In the 1950s the US-engineered coups against democratically elected regimes in Iran and Guatemala. It connived in the murder of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo in 1961 and Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973, both democratically elected. The CIA supported brutal anti-communist governments in Latin America, Asia and Africa.
More recently, the US successfully funded opposition in the election which aided the successful effort to depose Slobodan Milosevic, the war-minded leader of Serbia. The retired secretary of defence, Robert Gates, has written in his memoirs about our clumsy and failed putsch in Afghanistan.
Not least, and most relevantly, President Bill Clinton, fearing that Boris Yeltsin would be defeated in Russias election, authorized a secret effort to help him.
Hall has his reasons for interference and meddling in elections. He says, in effect, the US is on the side of the angels, doing good by working against authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, while Russias activities are aimed against Western democracies. The motivations matter.
How can he say that when America is riddled by ballot cheating- during the Kennedy/Nixon election, during the Bush/Gore election and the widespread gerrymandering today. Moreover, when one considers the large amounts of cash swilling around elections in order to get favoured candidates elected its difficult to accept that the US is an honest democracy.
Russian interference in a US election, even if proved, is a minor influence compared with these.
Lets have a level playing field when we debate the rights and wrongs of outside intervention.

MR asks envoys appointed by him to plan for future
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had held talks with envoys appointed during his Presidency to serve in Sri Lankan missions abroad and requested them to come up with suggestions on Sri Lankans foreign policy to be adopted under a future government.
Former External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris told the Daily Mirror that all envoys appointed by Mr. Rajapaksa had attended the meeting.
We had a fruitful discussion. We talked about what we were trying to accomplish during our time in office and where we might have gone wrong. We contrasted it with the present situation in the country, he said.
He said the former president had asked them for their thoughts on a future foreign policy.
The former envoys formed themselves into various committees on the basis of geographical regions where they served. Those who served in Asia were in one group. I will be meeting them every month as they formulate their thoughts, Prof. Peiris said.

No school admission for doctors children: GMOA
	
Some 90 children of government doctors have been unable to secure admission to national schools for the last seven months, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soyza told Daily Mirror that doctors who were subjected to transfers every four years and who were coming from abroad had the ability to admit their children to national schools under the retainability concept, but it had only been implemented for one year since Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne took office.
Government doctors are forced to leave the country due to this matter. The government should provide our children with a solution to this problem. However, children of pro-government parties are given admission to national schools without any issue, he said.
Dr. Soyza said the majority of students who were deprived of school admission were for Grade 1 and that for the last seven months they had been studying at primary and private schools. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

PC polls: Delay likely to be prolonged
	
The delay in conducting elections to the Provincial Councils is likely to be prolonged because political parties are yet to reach consensus on the electoral method to be adopted, it is learnt.
Representatives of political parties met on Thursday and discussed the matter. The three parties viz. Democratic Left Front led by Minister Mano Ganesan, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress led by Minister Rauff Hakeem and All People Makkal Congress led by Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, insisted that the elections be conducted according to the previous proportional representation system.
If the elections were to be conducted under the old system, the Parliament has to repeal the Act that was enacted last year providing for the implementation of a new system which is a mix of the proportional representation and the first past the post system.
However, the joint opposition, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the joint opposition believe that the election should be conducted under the new system without any further delay.
Another meeting is scheduled for next week to discuss matters further.
At the moment, the elections are overdue for the North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils. Also, three more Provincial Councils will stand dissolved by October this year warranting elections. (Kelum Bandara)

Remain committed to uphold religious freedom: SL
	
Sri Lanka remains committed to advance and uphold the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion including the freedom to change ones religion or belief, Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said.
He made these remarks at the first Conference to Advance Religious Freedom which was hosted by the US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo from July 24-26 in Washington DC, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said.
Mr. Kariyawasam has said that Sri Lanka upholds the right to change ones religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest ones religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.
He acknowledged challenges to inter-religious understanding and harmony in Sri Lanka, and outlined steps being taken to overcome challenges and advance religious freedom.
Sri Lanka will join the international community to foster what the world needs most today to progress  peace, compassion, mindfulness, and justice, and recognition of our common humanity, he said.
Inaugurating the Conference, US Secretary of State Pompeo remarked that the US advances religious freedom in its foreign policy, as it is a universal right of all mankind.
The Ministry said Sri Lanka was among a number of countries that endorsed thematic statements issued at the Conference focusing on Blasphemy/Apostasy Laws, Religious Freedom Repression by Non-State Actors, including Terrorist Groups, and on Counterterrorism as a False Pretext for Religious Freedom Repression.

SL a key component of Maritime Silk Road: China
	
Sri Lanka is a key component of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road with Hambantota Port and Colombo Port City as the two flagship projects of the pragmatic cooperation between China and Sri Lanka under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Chinese Ambassador Cheng Xueyuan said yesterday.
In a statement, he said that they believed that China-Sri Lanka economic and trade cooperation would inject new vigor to Sri Lankas economic and social development, enable development achievements to better benefit our two peoples, and let ordinary people get more sense of gain.
He said Sri Lanka also attaches great importance to the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and will send a high-level delegation to China.
Sri Lankas black tea, rubber, gems, textiles and other featured products will come to Shanghai, exhibiting the charm of Sri Lanka to the huge Chinese market. We believe that China-Sri Lanka traditional friendship will continue to deepen on this new platform, he said.
In November this year, China will hold the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai.
This is the worlds first expo themed on import and is a major policy measure of China to further open its market to the world. In the coming 15 years, China is expected to import 24 trillion USD worth of goods. CIIE will provide new opportunities for export, build new platforms for countries to share dividends of Chinas development and inject new vitality to world economic growth, Ambassador Cheng said.
Meanwhile, he said according to the statistics released by Chinas National Bureau of Statistics, Chinas GDP growth rate in the first half of 2018 reached 6.8 per cent.
The national economy sustained the momentum of steady and sound development with its inner stability and coordination strengthened, outstanding achievements in transformation and upgrading, new growth drivers thriving and the quality and performance improving steadily. This is good news for the whole world, he said.

Surtax on wheat flour will affect bakery products: AIBOA
	
The prices of all bakery products will soar if the government increased the tax on wheat flour, the All Island Bakery Owners' Association (AIBOA) said.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, AIBOA President N.K. Jayawardana said Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had told a recent media briefing that if there were a surplus of paddy production, it was essential to impose a tax on wheat flour to protect local farmers.
There is no such surplus in the country. About 60 per cent of people consume food made of wheat flour. Everything cannot be made out of rice flour. If there were an excess of stocks, there is no need of rice importation. The first thing the government should do is stopping rice imports. This government and the previous regime imported large stocks of rice. New varieties of rice were imported. However, if the government decides to increase the tax on wheat flour, there will be a definite price hike in all bakery items, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Trump approved 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians: Cohen
	

Michael Cohen is reportedly prepared to tell special counsel Robert Mueller that then-candidate Donald Trump knew and approved the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russians and his campaign staffers.

Cohen, Trumps former personal attorney, alleged that Trumps son, Donald Trump Jr, was the one who informed him that the meeting would take place. 
During the meeting, the Russians were expected to dish out dirt on Trumps Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. 
Don Jr, his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort, who was Trumps campaign chairman at the time, were all at the meeting.
According to CNN, sources claim that Cohen is willing to make that assertion to Mueller, but he doesnt have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim.
Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The president has previously denied knowing in advance that the meeting was going to take place, and he has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia. 
In a January letter to Mueller, Trumps lawyers said the president dictated a short but accurate response to the first report that his son, Don Jr, and others had met with the Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential election.
The New York Times revealed the existence of the letter last month. The Trump Tower meeting - and the White Houses initial response to the first reports of the meeting - has been a key moment in Muellers investigation into whether anyone on the campaign colluded with Russia and whether Trump obstructed justice.

Trump threatens large sanctions against Turkey
	

US, (Daily Mail), 26 July 2018 - President Donald Trump says the United States will impose sanctions on NATO ally Turkey over a detained American pastor held on terror and espionage charges.
Shortly after the possibility of sanctions was first announced by Vice President Mike Pence Thursday, Trump wrote on Twitter that the U.S. will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson.
He is suffering greatly. This innocent man of faith should be released immediately! the president added from aboard Air Force One as he flew to Iowa for an event.
Turkeys foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, quickly responded, also via Twitter:
No one dictates Turkey. We will never tolerate threats from anybody. Rule of law is for everyone; no exception.

Brunson, 50, an evangelical Christian pastor originally from North Carolina, was let out of jail Wednesday, after 1 1/2 years, to serve house arrest because of health problems, according to Turkeys official Anadolu news agency.
