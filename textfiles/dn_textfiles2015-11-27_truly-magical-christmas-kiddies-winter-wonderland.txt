A Truly Magical Christmas at the Kiddies Winter Wonderland

Every year it is the children that enjoy Christmas the most. It is these little ones who wait for this one day for an entire year and all celebrations are centered on making their little dreams come true.
In keeping with this tradition Waters Edge has transformed their premises in to the magical "Winter Wonderland" complete with Santa's sleigh and reindeer parked on the front floor, a giant Christmas tree made from glass tubes and fairy lights illuminating the entire surroundings.

On December 6, the hotel will hold their third annual "Kiddies Christmas Party" at the Grand Lawn from 3.30pm to 6.30pm. Santa himself will make a non-traditional yet grand appearance on a sea plane while his merry little elves will arrive on a boat. The traditional lighting of the Water's Edge Christmas tree will take place later that evening.
"The Water's Edge Kiddies Christmas Party is the highlight of the season for us at the hotel. Every department gets so deeply involved in making this day extra special for all the little ones who come in wide-eyed wonder to see what special offerings we have for them every year. Our chefs go all out to make mouth-watering treats, while the décor and event teams put their creative caps on to make magic. We are very excited to see the reactions of the children this year when they walk in to the Winter Wonderland", Water's Edge ?Director - Sales and Marketing Thilanka Muthukumarana noted.

Kids of all ages and their parents can enjoy a variety of games and activities such as water walkers, face painting, nail art, pony rides, balloon magic, an assortment of bouncers, bowling, a balloon dunk tank, lazer games, merry-go-round, giant wheel, fun train rides and much more. Special appearances by cartoon characters and superheroes such as Dora, Batman, Ironman and Thor will also be a highlight of the evening. A scrumptious buffet overflowing with traditional Christmas favourites will also be on display as a compliment to the culinary prowess of the Water's Edge chefs. Parents also have the opportunity of handing over their children's special Christmas gifts to the hotel prior to the event so that Santa can hand them out on the day.

To add even more reason to celebrate, Water's Edge will also offer many prizes and surprises to kids participating at the event. The first prize is a 15min scenic helicopter ride for 4 people sponsored by SimpliFly, while the second prize will be a complimentary 10pax kid's birthday party at Water's Edge. A third place winner will also walk away with a complimentary 2kg decorative cake from Water's Edge for their next birthday.
