Looking for  ‘comforts’ on circuit


	



 

A divisional head of a key Ministry had been recently transferred out following complaints about his immoral conduct.

 


According to the complaints, whenever this white-collar high-up was on circuit duty at the periphery, he would ask his subordinates whether they could provide him with ‘comforts’.  And there had been occasions when some subordinates had supplied him ‘comforts’ out of concern for job security, they say.


The political authority who was shocked to hear about the conduct of the white-collar high-up has decided to report him to the authorities concerned for investigations.
