The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today people would question the practical need for provincial councils if the government delayed elections to them any further.

Party Chairman G.L. Peiris said it was nine months since the term of office of the Sabaragamuwa, Eastern and North-Central Provincials Councils had expired while the Northern, Central and North-Western Provincial Councils would end their tenure by September this year.

“The government is determined not to have elections to these six PCs till the next presidential elections are over. By then, the PCs would have been non-functional for two years,” he said and wondered whether in such a situation PC were needed to administer the provinces.

“If the yahapalana government fails to hold elections, why should the new government hold elections,” Prof. Peiris asked.

Responding to remarks made by Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, he said it was preposterous for him to say he would not object to the postponement of elections provided his term was extended.

Asserting that it was legally impossible, Prof. Peiris said the CM had no existence outside the provincial council. He said no government benefited from postponing elections. (Kelum Bandara)
