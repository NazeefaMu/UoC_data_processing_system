The National Transport Commission (NTC) said today it decided to remove some 450 semi-luxury buses from service by the end of the year.

NTC Chairman M.A.P. Hemachandra told Daily Mirror this decision was taken following a meeting held in January at the Transport Ministry after a number of passengers expressed concerns over the lack of service equal to the higher bus fares.

“The semi-luxury buses now in operation will be given till December 31 to convert them into luxury buses or to offer normal services,” he said.

Meanwhile, Acting Transport Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe said they planned to import low-floor buses to upgrade the public transport service.

“Ordinary Leyland buses are in operation since the Sri Lanka Transport Board (formerly CTB) was nationalised in 1958. Therefore, the ministry has decided to import new low-floor buses and remove the old ones from the fleet,” he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
