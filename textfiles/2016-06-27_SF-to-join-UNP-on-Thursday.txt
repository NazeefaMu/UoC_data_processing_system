Democratic Party (DP) Leader and Minister Sarath Fonseka is expected to obtain United National Party (UNP) membership on Thursday.

UNP sources said party leader, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would hand over the membership to Field Marshal Fonseka.

Democratic Party sources who confirmed the report said the Field Marshal would explain the situation to his party members on the same day.

He was appointed a MP through the UNP national list to fill the vacancy created by the death of former minister M.K.D.S. Gunawardene earlier this year. (Yohan Perera)
