MANILA AFP Jan30, 2017- Miss France was crowned Miss Universe on Monday in a made-for-television spectacle free of last year’s dramatic mix-up but with a dash of political controversy as the finalists spoke out on the refugee crisis and other hot-button global issues.  Iris Mittenaere, a dental surgery student from Lille in the north of France, beat 85 of the world’s most beautiful women at the event in the Philippines scheduled for prime time viewing in the United States.    Mittenaere, 24, edged out Miss Haiti, the first runner-up, and Miss Colombia the second runner-up.
