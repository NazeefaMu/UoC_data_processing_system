UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila said today that he had decided to deliberately fall down at each ‘Jana Satana’ rally organised by the Joint Opposition.

Addressing a news conference, he said the video showing him tripping down at the Joint Opposition rally held recently, went viral and especially some of the media institutions, which had not given him publicity in the past, had repeatedly displayed the video.

“Some even show the video in slow motion and repeatedly. These media hardly ever gave publicity to me in the past. Therefore I have decided to trip down at every upcoming Jana Satana rally,” he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)
