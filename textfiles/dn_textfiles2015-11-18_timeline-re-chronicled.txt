Timeline re-chronicled

He is very much particular about the way you should spell his name. Anyone should be able to pronounce a name properly, he believes. And thus spelling his name is even easier than eating a piece of cake. It simply goes as Ananda Dias-Jayasinha - no more complex 'ghe's. That preciseness is very much alive in his works too. An engineer by profession, Ananda Dias-Jayasinha found inspiration in confused histories of missionary schools - which included his own Alma Mater, Richmond College. That rarely taken journey reached a pinnacle when Dias-Jayasinha won the State Literary Award for the best miscellaneous work of 2014 (other nominated works being Neville Jayaweera's Jaffna Exorcising the Past and Holding the Vision and P Pushparathnam's Tourism and Monuments).
Q: Why do you write?
A: I never wrote in my life except a few technical manuals when I was working overseas in Australia although they were collaborations. More than a writer I am an avid reader. I remember the time in Galle when my father would get up around 3 am to read the Daily News. It is the time that the distributors would bring it to Richmond Hill. However newspaper vendor opened his shop around 7 am.
So it was arranged that the papers be left in the open veranda of our house until the shopkeeper came for it. The van driver and his assistant were in the habit of throwing the whole bundle of paper onto our veranda rather than gently delivering it. The bundle, when thrown on to the veranda, landed with a big thud the sound of which made my father wake up. It was his alarm.
I usually woke up with him so that I could get my father to explain the cartoon strips. Thus I got the habit of reading from my father. During that tender age I could not understand most of what was written. But with my father's help and armed with a dictionary I managed. My father would tell me to read from top left of the newspaper front to the bottom right of the last page a habit that has remained with me to date. I was born with a hearing defect that caused me to read my schoolbooks rather than trying to understand what the teachers told me in the class.
For instance I would look for many books as possible say of chemistry or physics and would try to understand different views of the authors. I had my education after the eight standard in English. Though my mother tongue is Sinhalese in my household the standard language of communication was English; the reason being my parents knew I will pick up mother tongue Sinhalese in any case but not English.
Q: What made you dig into the forgotten history of Richmond College?
A: In early 1960's when I was around 12 or 13, I stumbled upon the 1951 Diamond Jubilee Souvenir of Richmond, which in the opening pages spoke of a school that started in 1814 as the first Wesleyan Methodist Mission School in Ceylon and in Asia and Richmond's special connection to it, while we were being taught that the School started in 1876. It was very confusing and I turned to my grandfather who was a Richmondite during the Rev Darrell's time and a contemporary of C W W Kannangra. He explained that Richmond was the continuation of the First English School, known as The Galle School, started by the Methodist Missionaries in Asia and in Ceylon (Sri Lanka).
Thus why was the school teaching us it started in 1876 shedding 62 years of important history? I sought answers from every source without success and I was determined to get to the bottom of this. I started to gather information and found most of the information to the relevant period mainly from the Bodleian Library of the Oxford University and the archives of the New York public Library (NYPL). Sifting through almost 270 official documents of the Methodist Mission, nearly 605 Imperial Colonial papers and almost 100 publications, I made notes of the pertinent information for nearly 10 years that finally led me to author the book which took me about three more years.
I wanted to share the knowledge and the historical information that I gathered about Richmond with many who were not aware of the school. When I researched I found that many schools in the country have a dubious chronicle.
Some of them perhaps for the sake of prestige has backdated the beginning of their school while some in ignorance has come to accept even dates that have got advanced by many years.
If I take Richmond as an example, she started in 1814 as an elementary English school and then over the years progressed and in 1876 was made a high school -thus her beginning is 1814 and not 1876. For a school to become a high school is has to start at grass roots grow over the years before it can become high school. As far as Richmond is concerned it is on record that in a letter sent by the Rev Samuel Langdon to the Methodist Headquarters in England in 1877 he says that two student of the school entered Ceylon Medical School while several others passed the Calcutta University exam.
It is not possible for students of a newly started school to attain the high standards required to enter medical school or a university. Nowhere in the world a high school have been started overnight as it is impossible.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most?
A: I read anything that I get to hand and I have no preference to a genre. If I can gather knowledge and learn things that I didn't know or don't know I will read such books. I read both English and vernacular there again no particular category. However books set in the background of years of yore interests me.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours?
A: That's an interesting conundrum. In turn, I would tell him or her "not to worry about what I am doing, but to worry about why he or she is worried about what he or she is doing!"
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book?
A: If your question is related to the contents then no. But I did find some grammatical errors that have slipped through two copyeditors, which I would like to correct.
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards?
A: It is a good thing that would be an inspiration to others who are not regular authors. It is good to be recognised for whatever the effort that one had made in putting together the research done or weaving a factious or a fiction story that would keep a reader spellbound.
It is not an easy task to write a book be it fiction or nonfiction.

 
It needs lot of effort, logical thinking and burning midnight oil sometimes for months if not for years.
One has to be convincing of what goes into his or her work.
During the launch of my book I said that this was going to be my first and the last book. But I have changed my mind and already started on two books.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most?
A: Without a doubt award-winning books would appeal to me most. If what you mean by popular books are the so called popular fiction such as romance, fantasy, crimes, fiction &c., then I would read them for relaxation.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating?
A: Oh no! My wife Preethie will not think of it even if you mean dinner or lunch. That habit is tabooed.
If you are asking me whether I would munch snacks, the answer is I do it rarely since I need both my hands when using the computer and a third hand I wish I had.
I don't except for the notes I make put my thoughts interpretations to paper but would rather key into the computer as it would save me lot of time.
