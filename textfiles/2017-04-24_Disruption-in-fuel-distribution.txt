Disruption in fuel distribution has been reported this morning due to the indefinite strike launched by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Union Collective, CPC Managing Director Nadun Fernando said.

Speaking to Daily Mirror he said a slight delay was seen at island-wide distribution centres. However, the situation has been brought under control to a certain extent, he said.

“A discussion is to be held between the subject Ministry and the trade union leaders and most likely the entire issue could be settled within the day,” Mr. Fernando said.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
