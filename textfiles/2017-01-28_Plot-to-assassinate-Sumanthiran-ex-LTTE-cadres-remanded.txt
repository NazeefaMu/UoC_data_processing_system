A plot to assassinate Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran by exploding a claymore mine while he was travelling along the Soranpatru-Thaalayadi Road in the Jaffna peninsula was uncovered by the Police Terrorism Investigation Department (TID).

The four former LTTE cadres arrested in this connection and produced before the Kilinochchi District Judge A.A. Anandarajan on January 20 were remanded at the Anuradhapura prisons.

It is suspected that the assassination plot was backed by the overseas LTTE faction headed by the Norway-based Perinbanayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyavan.

It is reported that two plots hatched to kill Sumanthiran on the Soranpatru-Thaalayady road on December 12, 2016 and January 13, 2017 did not succeed due to "accidental" reasons.

An enhanced security arrangement has been provided to Mr. Sumanthiran following a meeting by the National Security Council. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have expressed grave concern at the perceived threat to the TNA MP's life. (D.B.S. Jeyaraj)
