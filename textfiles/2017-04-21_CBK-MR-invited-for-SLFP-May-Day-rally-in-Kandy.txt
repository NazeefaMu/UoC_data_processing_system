Former presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa have been invited to participate in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party May Day rally to be held at Getambe in Kandy, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake said.

He said party members from across the country were expected to attend the rally in Kandy.

“The joint opposition is also holding a May Day rally in Colombo. A May Day rally should not have a political agenda, but should be about the rights of the workers,” he said.

When journalists asked about former president Rajapaksa's standing among party supporters, Mr. Ekanayake said as the leader who contributed to the ending of the war, Mr. Rajapaksa would always have a special place among party supporters. (J.A.L. Jayasinghe)
