SLFP argument no longer valid: DM


	

The argument by the SLFP and a few other parties which opposed the 19th Amendment if not introduced simultaneously with electoral reforms is no longer valid, because the arbitrary powers of the executive presidency has not been curbed to the extent originally planned, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Ajith P. Perera said today.
He told a news briefing that the government had decided to omit certain sections of the 19A draft that would be taken up for debate in Parliament; because the Supreme Court verdict on its constitutionality stated that they required approval at a referendum.  
“It is very clearly mentioned in President Sirisena’s manifesto that any constitutional amendment that requires a referendum will not be implemented. Therefore, we decided to omit the sections that need a referendum and go ahead with those that can be passed in parliament by a 2/3 majority,” the deputy minister said.
He said the original clause that declared the President as the Head of State, the Government, the Executive and the Commander of the tri-forces still exists.
“So as you can see, the only curtailing of powers with regard to that clause in 19A is the section which calls for important decisions regarding the appointment of ministers and dissolving Parliament to be carried out in consultation with the Prime Minister. If a situation arises where the President and the PM are in conflict regarding the course of action to be taken, the matter will be referred to Parliament,” the deputy minister said.
He said therefore the argument put forward by the SLFP and other parties on having to approve the 19A together with electoral reforms simultaneously was no longer valid because the country has not been destabilized in any way because the powers of the executive presidency have not been curbed to the extent envisaged at first.
The deputy minister said neither the SLFP nor any other party had any grounds, legally or ethically to object to the implementation of the 19A.
“I must also mention that the omission of certain clauses has not in any way caused a hindrance to our promise of establishing and strengthening good governance and democracy in the country. Meanwhile, we also recognize the importance of implementing electoral reforms but that will be carried out in due time without haste,” he added. (Lakna Paranamanna)
