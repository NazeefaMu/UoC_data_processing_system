Reviewing the Book ‘Optimum Nutrition for Beating Diabetes’ by Dr. Renuka Jayatissa (MBBS, MSc, MD, FPGIM)

 

The morbid disease named Diabetes is a “Global problem with devastating human, social and economic impacts.” Having secured 30 years of service as a Medical officer, Public Health Specialist and Nutrition Specialist attached to the Ministry of Health, Dr. Renuka Jayatissa comes forward with a wholesome and informative book tackling all aspects of the disease. Having worked with UNICEF Colombo to serve the displaced population, this work is but another step in the direction of community care by the writer.

‘Optimum Nutrition for Beating Diabetes’ presents a 10-chapter analysis of Diabetes in its variations, its understanding, its symptoms, relevant courses of action and personalised precautions. It simplifies complex and advanced medical information which enables a wide spectrum of readers to absorb its benefits.


It discusses in-depth conditions like hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, gestational diabetes and other subject matter one may not typically be aware of. Following a clear differentiation of the 4 types of Diabetes and each of their relevant causes, the book moves on to self-identification, interpretation of symptoms and finally to defence mechanisms against the disease. Instructions to evaluate blood glucose levels, BMI, daily energy intakes etc are provided.


A step-by-step method of classification allows the reader to analyse oneself and follow relevant meal plans which include arrays of pragmatic options. Tabulated data reveals menus based on ideal quantities, necessary nutrition and recommended carbohydrate intake. Readers will discover daily meal options which even consider one’s occupation, weight, activeness, BMI and ultimately find what best suits them.


In addition to dietary suggestions, the book explores a chapter on how “exercise is extremely important in managing blood sugar levels in diabetic people because of its effect on blood glucose and fatty free acids.” It includes practical and doable suggestions to attain a moderate level of burnt calories.


Prof. Sarath Lekamwasam writes that “this book written by Renuka fills a major void in the diabetic care in this country.”


Blending the factual with the practical, Dr. Renuka has compiled an intrinsically organized, easy-to-understand guidebook which tackles the foreboding disease and ultimately presents it as positively preventable. The authoress encourages her readers to follow simple but effective lifestyle alterations against the disease. The reader-friendly book takes into consideration all aspects one must be aware of in order to ‘beat Diabetes’ and in this manner becomes a useful guidebook for its readers. It includes tips, tables, charts and pictorial food guides that enlighten not only pre-diabetics and diabetic patients, but also any individual seeking information regarding this extremely relevant health crisis. 


Dr. Renuka Jayatissa is currently the head of the Department of Nutrition at the Medical Research Institute and extends this publication with the hope of uplifting the diet and diabetic knowledge possessed by medical professionals and the public.
