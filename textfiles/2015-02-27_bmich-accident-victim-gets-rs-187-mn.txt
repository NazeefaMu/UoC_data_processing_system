The Colombo District Court today ordered the payment of Rs.187 million as compensation to Dr. Samitha Samanmali who was paralysed after an iron bar fell on her back during the MEDEX exhibition at the BMICH on February 15, 2008.
She was a medical student at the time tragedy struck her. The plaint filed by her stated that as a result of this injury she would not be in a position to lead a normal married life or to perform her duties as a medical doctor and would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life.
