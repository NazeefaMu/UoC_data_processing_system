President pledges new constitution

Steps would be taken to strengthen freedom, democracy and human rights in Sri Lanka by introducing a new constitution to the country in the future, said President Maithripala Sirisena, who is in New York to attend the 70th United Nations General Assembly Sessions.
The President was speaking while on a visit to the New York Buddhist Viharaya to participate in religious observances on Sunday (Binara Poya Day).
Addressing members of the Sri Lankan community on the occasion, President Sirisena said measures would be taken to strengthen freedom, democracy and human rights in Sri Lanka by introducing a new Constitution to the country in the future.
The President said the new Sri Lankan government had received great support from the international community towards the strengthening of its economy.
He said he would use the power entrusted to him by the people correctly to cater to their progress and welfare. The Maha Sangha led by New York Buddhist Viharaya’s Viharadhipati Ven Kurunegoda Piyatissa Thera chanted Seth Pirith and invoked blessings on the President. The President also had a chat with the Sri Lankans present.
