In order to upgrade the service quality of the passenger transportation in three-wheelers and student transportation in school vans, the Cabinet on Tuesday has approved to establish a regulatory authority, Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today.

The establishment of a regulatory authority for three-wheelers and school vans is a 2017 Budget proposal.

The setting up of the regulatory authority will be done on the consultation of various ministers, institutes and on certain subjects from Provincial Councils. A study should be done with attention on taking relevant measures as well as on responsibility, role, and formulating the mechanism.

Therefore, it was also decided to appoint a committee comprising Secretaries of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, Local Government and Provincial Councils, Justice, Law & Order and Southern Development, Megapolis and Western Development, Higher Education and Highway, Education, Finance and Health to report regarding the relevant matters to the Cabinet of Ministers within 02 months.
