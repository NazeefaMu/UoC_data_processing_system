The country’s first prison facility built in line with international standards at Angunukolapelessa, Hambantota is to be declared open on Monday.

The prison which is known as the ‘Super Prison’ among the public due to its luxury features made headlines in view of its special features.

The prison facility which was built at an estimated cost of Rupees 9.5 billion on a 65-hectare land was to be opened with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena on March 16 this year but was postponed as the President had later declined the invitation.

The new complex will house the inmates of the Tangalle Prison which is in poor condition and is capable of sheltering about 1,500 inmates.

The prison complex would be declared open by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale and the Prison Reforms Minister D.M.Swaminathan with the participation of officials of the Department of Prisons. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
