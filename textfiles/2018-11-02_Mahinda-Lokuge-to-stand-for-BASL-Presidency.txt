Former Secretary of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka Mahinda Lokuge has announced that he will stand for the post of President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) for the term 2019/2020.  

Attorney Lokuge has served the Bar during 30 years of private practice engaged in criminal and civil work in both original and appellate courts, in all parts of the country. Throughout his career as an attorney-at-law, he has served the membership of the BASL by being the Secretary (2010-2012), Zonal Vice President (2006-2007), Treasurer (2003-2005), as a delegate of the Bar Council for 28 continuous years and 15 years as a member of the Executive Committee.  
During his period of service at the BASL, he had functioned as the Chairman of the Continuing Legal Education Committee, Lawyer’ Skills Development Committee, Social and Welfare Committee, Sports Committee, Lawyers – Police Relations Committee, Diary Committee, Neethi – Raga Committee, Rule of Law Committee and the Outstation Bar Committee. He has also served as President of the Colombo Law Society, the branch of the BASL with the largest membership, for the period 2006/2007.  


Commenting on his candidature Mr. Lokuge said: “I will work towards enhancing the integrity and transparency and the efficiency of the internal working mechanisms of the BASL, while retaining a non-partisan stand and politically balanced view regarding governance issues at national and provincial level and other matters of national importance, I will along with the other leaders of the Bar work towards the further strengthening of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary. I will also ensure that members of the legal profession enjoy a high standard of recognition in society, and receive a conducive environment to discharge our professional duties and responsibilities in an independent and unimpaired manner. I will most certainly give leadership to carry out effectively the BASL’s traditional welfare activities for the benefit of the membership. As I have done in the past, I will treat members of the Colombo and outstation Bars equally, and be empathetic towards the needs of junior members of the Bar.”
