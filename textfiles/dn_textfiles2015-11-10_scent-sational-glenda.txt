Scent-sational Glenda!

They say diamonds are a girl’s best friend. However for Glenda Parthipan, celebrity perfumes spell passion!
Many know her for her enthusiasm to dress up but what even her close friends do not know about this lady is that she has a rare hobby – collecting celebrity perfumes.
Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Katy Perry, Beyoncé and Justin Bieber all stand proudly on Glenda’s shelf, cherished and preserved in their own unique aroma.
“All of them are gifts given to me by loved ones. The first in the collection was the J Lo perfume which I got three years ago,” said Glenda, the founder and managing director of Emphasis, a leading PR and Event Management company in the city.
A true socialite, Glenda is a familiar face in all the top events happening in town, even if she is not part of the organizing committee. Many pictures of her in alluring attire and accessories have been splashed across all the main newspapers and magazines in the country. Many have ‘oohed’ and ‘aahed’ over the vibrant colours of sarees and dresses matched with enthralling accessories she carries off effortlessly.
“It is a personal feel good factor to be wearing one of these branded perfumes along with an outfit. It completes the look and compliments the one who wears it beautifully,’ Glenda says.
She added that she does not have a special favourite in her collection. She loves all of them since each comprises a different fragrance and goes with diverse moods. Some have identified the perfume she wears and this has often given a boost to her happiness.
It is an age-old enterprising streak among celebs to cash in on their global fame and image by launching fashion and lifestyle merchandise under their name. Clothes, accessories, shoes, bags and cosmetics are some of the products which have the names of globally well known faces. Perfumes are one of the items that many celebs vie to give their name to. Not only are they one of the most elegant products in the market but who wouldn’t like to associate themselves with such a divine smelling product? For fans, it is just a matter of taking home a piece of their favourite celebrity, albeit just their name on the tag.
While many actors before her endorsed perfumes, celebrity Sophia Loren launched her own brand under her name in 1981. The iconic beauty’s perfume was floral with dominant notes of jasmine and rose. Bling and drama queen Elizabeth Taylor’s ‘White Diamonds’ is one of the top selling perfumes in the world ever since it made itself to the market in 1991. Other best sellers include ‘Lovely’ by Sarah Jessica Parker, ‘Diavolo’ by Antonio Banderas, ‘Homme’ by David Beckham, ‘Heat’ by Beyonce and ‘S2’ by Shilpa Shetty.
So which perfume is next on Glenda’s wish list?
“Paris Hilton,” she was quick to note with a smile.
