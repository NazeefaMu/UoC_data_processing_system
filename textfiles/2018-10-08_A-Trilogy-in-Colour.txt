A Trilogy in Colour


	



 

Famous Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky once said: “There is no must in Art because Art is free.”

This could be experienced at an event that has been organized to experience the freedom of art, Trilogy - an art exhibition which opens today and will go on till October 13 at the J.D.A Perera Art Gallery at Colombo 07.

The exhibition brings together the creative energy of three artists-B. Sarath Gunasiri Perera, R.M. Dharmasena and Santos Arzu, who belong to the school of Figurative Abstract Expressionism.

Figurative Abstract Expressionism is a form of art which broke the convention of painting in the backdrop of WWII, in the United States.

This deeply expressive art form champions a two-way approach, gestural application of paint and large areas of colour compositions in all media on large canvases, using shapes, symbols and colours.

Artist Sarath Gunasiri Perera is a senior lecturer at the Department of Painting of the Faculty of Visual Arts at the University of Visual and Performing Arts. He is also the President of the Visual Arts Panel of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.

Artist R.M Dharmasena is a retired senior lecturer of the University of the Visual & Performing Arts. Santos Arzu Quioto is a Latin American artist from Honduras.Trilogy is a rare instance when art enthusiasts have the opportunity to meet the art teacher (R.M Dharmasena) and the student (Sarath Gunasiri Perera) both in the exhibition with another skilled artist, Santos Arzu.

Artist Sarath said he and Honduran artist Santos first met at an exhibition held in Korea, where they became friends.

Later with their friendship evolving, an idea to organize an exhibition together turned up and Trilogy was born.

Referring to the exhibition, Mr Dharmasena said they organized the exhibition after a five-year break during which they had done many experiments with their medium.

He said he had done 12 paintings following the theme Creative Landscapes. 

“Being a true artist means travelling through an endless route of learning. Every artist should follow this route of learning, growth and evolving. Artists should never paint or have exhibitions to please society or to imitate others who are doing exhibitions often.

“An exhibition is an intersection where you practise what you have learned throughout the journey. Never make it a competition with others in the field,” 
he said.
