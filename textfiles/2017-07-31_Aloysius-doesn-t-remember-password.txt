President’s Counsel Anuja Premaratne, appearing for Arjun Aloysius today informed the PCoI that according to his instructions Mr. Aloysius has forgotten the password of his Apple Account.

PC Premaratne is appearing for Mr. Aloysius in the wake of President's Counsel Kalinga Indatissa’s withdrawal.

PC Premaratne sought PCoI’s indulgence to get back the Mr. Aloysius' SIM card handed over to the CID or to obtain a SIM card with the same number from the mobile service provider. He was of the view that his client was in need of his SIM card considering the difficulty he has in conducting his business matters.

However, Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda objecting to the request said Mr. Aloysius had not supported the investigation so far by providing his apple account and the password.

“Forgetting the password cannot be accepted because the investigations had revealed that he had used his account for the i-store to download applications, and the new version of the IOS had been updated on his phone which cannot be done without the password, so forgetting it is an absurd excuse,” the ASG said.

He said Mr. Aloysius had lied and it will be proved at the appropriate time and hinted that the investigators were carrying out other methods to locate the password.

The ASG said all the devices could be returned within 48 hours if Mr. Aloysius divulged his password, or else the investigators would need time to do locate the password and Mr. Aloysius would have to be patient it was found. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
