Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has offered national school admission to the schoolgirl from Ganemulla who was allegedly afflicted with a stigmatized disease.

Issuing a statement, the Education Ministry said this matter was taken up after Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake brought it to light. It said studies of the victim had been disturbed due to stigma.

“Several media reports uncovered that the schoolgirl was insulted by school authorities solely due to her health condition and that she was likely to lose her school over the issue. Furthermore, Minister Kariyawasam has taken steps to provide employment to the victim’s father,” the statement said.

However, the minister pledged to appoint an independent supervisory board to resolve matters similar to this depressing incident and to regulate the functions of all government and international schools. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
