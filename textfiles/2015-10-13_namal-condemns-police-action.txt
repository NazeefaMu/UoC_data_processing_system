Hambantota District UPFA Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa today ‘strongly’ condemned the alleged assault on a group of civilians by police during a demonstration held at Badagiriya in Hambanthota yesterday.
“Strongly condemn police clashing with protesters at Badagiriya, Hambantota. They were only asking for clean water,” the MP tweeted.
