While thousands of commuters were stranded in railway stations the Railway Trade Union Alliance said the strike action which were launched last night was a success.

While speaking to the Daily Mirror the spokesman of the union said several trains had operated yesterday but not after midnight.

He also said no higher authority responded to them and therefore, they would continue the strike today as well.

However, the Railway Control Room said 14 trains had been operated by this morning.

They said eight long distance trains were arrived in Colombo Fort and another six trains were operated between Panadura and Ragama. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
