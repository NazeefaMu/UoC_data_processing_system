Out of the 17 beverage companies in operation, 13 are about to fold up under the weight of the special tax imposed on them by the Budget 2016.  The closure of these companies would mean the loss of employment for a 10,000 to 15,000-strong workforce.
The industry leaders have already brought this situation to the notice of the authorities in the highest echelons, company sources say.
Meanwhile, there is hush-hush talk that a certain interested group is planning a visit to Aluthkade to unfold some unknown story about the bigwigs who are said to be behind the imposition of the massive tax.
