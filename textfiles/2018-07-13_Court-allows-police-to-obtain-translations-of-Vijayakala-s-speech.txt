Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake today directed the Commissioner of the Department of Official Languages to provide verbatim reports of the Sinhala and Tamil video recordings relating to the speech of former child affairs state minister Vijayakala Maheswaren to the Organised Crime Prevention Division (OCPD).
The two video recordings were provided by two media institutions to the OCPD consequent to the Chief Magistrate’s directives to all media organisations.

In a motion filed today, the OCPD requested the Magistrate to direct the Commissioner of the Department of Official Languages for a complete translation of the alleged speech.
Ms. Maheswaran had made the statement on July 2 during an event at the Weerasingham auditorium in Jaffna.
The OCPD is conducting this inquiry on a police complaint by ‘Sinhala Ravaya’ national organiser Magalkande Sudantha Thera on July 3.

Police investigation is underway to inquire whether the alleged speech amounts to an offence under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Penal Code reading with Constitutional provisions. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
