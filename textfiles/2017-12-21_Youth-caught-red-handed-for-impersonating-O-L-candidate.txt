An individual, who allegedly impersonated an O/L student and sat on behalf of him for the examination, had been taken into custody at the examination centre in Wewala, Piliyandala today.

The Police said the arrest was made following a tip-off received from the Deputy Examinations Commissioner.

It is learnt that the individual, who was arrested at noon during the exam, had pasted his picture on the candidate’s identity card in a bid to impersonate him.

The 23-year-old suspect, a resident of Udawalawe, is expected to be produced before the Piliyandala Magistrate today.

The Police had also directed the candidate to be present at the Police station but said he was yet to make an appearance. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
