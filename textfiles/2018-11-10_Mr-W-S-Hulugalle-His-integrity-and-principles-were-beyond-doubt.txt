It was with profound Shock and grief that relatives, friends and colleagues received the sad news of the demise of Mr. W.S. Hulugalle of Kurunegala.   


He hailed from a very respectable family and was a member of the Sri Lanka Administrative service. He was extremely committed to his official work and well known for “Paying attention to details.” Having served in almost all key functions of “Kachcheri” service, he moved to Mahaweli Development project as the Director Administration for Mahaweli Engineering and Construction Agency (MECA) of Mahaweli Authority (MASL). I was privilege to work under his blessed leadership to obtain much valued advice during that period.   


Mr. Hulugalle was a man of undoubted integrity and principles. He had a wide circle of friends not only in administrative service but also in the villages in Kurunegala District. His signature in any document signified fairness, justice, logicality and lawfulness of that document which could not be argued or denied by any authority in the administration sector or in the judiciary.   


Mr. Hulugalle had a lot of political friends up to the top row of any Government but he was never involved in politics. He leaves behind his beloved wife, Rupa Tennakoon, loving daughter, Sriyani, and only son Laxhman Hulugalle.   


“May he attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana. “
