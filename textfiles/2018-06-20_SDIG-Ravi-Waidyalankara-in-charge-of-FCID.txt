Retired Senior DIG Ravi Waidyalankara has been re-employed on a 9-month contract, from yesterday and will head the FCID, following a cabinet decision, the National Police Commission (NPC) said.

He retired from service on May 14.

The NPC had said earlier that the SDIG would be reinstated on a contractual basis, if Cabinet approval was granted.

It had also rejected a recommendation by IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the Law and Order Ministry to suspend the services of SDIG Waidyalankara, who was facing disciplinary inquiries.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
