Expert financial planner NDB Wealth recently marked 25 years in operation with a simple, yet tasteful, celebration for staff. 
This follows NDB Wealth’s mid-June 2017 relocation to a spacious and elegant, purpose-built Private Wealth Management Centre, to enable future growth for the company. 
Uniquely, a visit to Sri Lanka’s first one-stop Private Wealth Management centre allows NDB Wealth clients to access a full range of financial products and services. Further, it is backed by support from a dedicated team comprising over 200 financial planning experts.
Since its beginnings as Eagle NDB Wealth Management, in June 1992, NDB Wealth has distinguished itself through an unprecedented track record of success, leading to growth having occurred virtually every year. This has enabled NDB Wealth to maintain its coveted position as an industry leader almost from the beginning. Today, NDB Wealth’s portfolio encompasses over Rs. 80 billion in funds under management, earning it an enviable standing as the largest private sector wealth management company in Sri Lanka.  At the same time, NDB Wealth has been repeatedly lauded by Global Banking & Financial Review. Most recently, in 2016, the magazine recognized NDB Wealth as the “Best Asset Management Company, Sri Lanka 2015”, for its expertise in the Asset and Wealth Management sub-sectors of the local Financial Services industry. This was the second consecutive year that NDB Wealth won this prestigious honor.
Additionally, NDB Wealth further separates itself from the pack by providing end-to-end, research-driven solutions for Institutions and high net worth private wealth clients. Also on offer are a number of introductory, easy-to-understand wealth plans for smaller clients and first time investors. Importantly, these ready-made plans are available across a range of options, from kids and women, to income and retirement, and much, 
much more.
Commenting, NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, “For a quarter century, the exemplary financial planning culture that is the cornerstone of NDB Wealth has allowed us to stay at the forefront of the local wealth management industry. Our work, even after 25 years, continues to be important to our country, helping Sri Lankan companies and citizens secure their financial futures. Going forward, we will be stepping up our efforts to make financial planning more accessible and understandable, particularly for everyday Sri Lankans.”
Samarasekera added, “Visit our new offices at 135, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 4, and find out how you too can take full advantage of your current income and savings, turning it into a substantial nest egg for retirement. Or learn how to plan even smarter, so you can retire even earlier. It’s time to access the unlimited benefits of ‘smart’, non-traditional financial planning, to ensure a safe and secure future for you and your family.”
