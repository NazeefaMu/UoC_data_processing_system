Improving from within

Knowledge is power and education is priceless. A solid foundation to enhance both is absolutely essential. The International Schools of Sri Lanka (TISSL) is the umbrella organization that seeks to facilitate this. The TISSL assists collaboration among schools to meet the needs of the next generation, as youths would require communication and critical thinking skills to meet future demands.

The third Annual International Conference for heads of schools organised by the TISSL was held from November 13-15 at Ahungalla.
“The doors of this conference are open to all schools in Sri Lanka – State, private and international. We live in an era where there is much debate on the future of schools and how schools should transform to meet the needs of the next generation. Among the many skills spoken of, there is one skill that takes centre stage. That skill is the ability to collaborate,” said TISSL Chairman Dr. Harsha Alles.
Collaboration is key and one cannot think of a better place than a school where there is much opportunity to collaborate.
“Collaboration can take place both horizontally and vertically. Horizontally, from student to student and teacher to teacher while vertically from student to teacher and teacher to school head. The theme of this conference is ‘Improving schools from within’. This means that even though we perceive that some schools are good and others are not so good, what matters more is not the school that you attend but which classroom you go to in a particular school,” Dr. Alles said.
The vision of the Minister of Education in making ‘the nearest school the best school,’ demonstrates the fact that he is not looking for the usual quick fixes to the country’s needs in education. Irrespective of where a school is located, if school heads and teachers can work together for the common progress of all students, such schools would experience not only growth but also achievement.
“We at the TISSL believe that we are all on a learning journey. The international conference that we organize every year is a result of our desire to constantly upgrade ourselves. In August 2016, the heads of all the TISSL schools will attend a week’s residential training programme at a prestigious university in Malaysia,” Dr. Alles added.

The key to minimizing the inequality of standard within a school is by good collaboration within the school community. However, in doing so, it is important to remember that while a top down leadership can get things started, to keep improving and moving forwards, schools need to work from inside out.
In his address, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said, international and private schools play an important role in the Sri Lankan education system providing English medium primary and secondary education which is in high demand in the current global, social and economic context.
“These schools follow the national or international curriculum. A total of 217 international schools and 80 private schools are functioning at present. Schools which follow the international curriculum give the opportunity for migrants to obtain their education. The country receives foreign exchange as school fees,” the minister pointed out. “However, there are disadvantages as a lot of money goes out of the country as examination fees. In addition, students are encouraged to follow higher education courses at foreign educational institutes making the situation worse with regard to foreign exchange. However, it is heartening to note that some international schools are slowly but steadily adopting the national curriculum,” Minister Kariyawasam said. Private schools which have the national curriculum provide a valuable service. One of the burning issues of the government is the difficulty in accommodating students at popular government schools. However, private schools fulfill this need of parents and students.
“Private schools save the government a great deal of expenditure. However, it has become mandatory to monitor schools to maintain the quality of education. The country’s future depends on the children’s education. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to take steps to monitor these schools to ensure the quality and uniformity of education to achieve national educational goals rather than adopting a pessimistic attitude towards private schools,” the minister said. Director of Undergraduate Programs in the Faculty of Education, Monash University Dr. Elizabeth Tudball also raised pertinent questions as to what should or could the focus be to improve schools from within.
“What does research tell us about successful school improvement strategies in the 21st century? What processes can be developed to improve schools? So much depends on the school context, on needs and priorities, the needs of teachers and students. Is your focus really on student learning and achievement?” she asked.
“You can’t do it all and improve everything in one quick go. It takes time. There will be things that are more strategic for you as leaders or for you as senior teachers in your school community. The important thing is to work out what area needs improving. Is it an area of well-being and engagement? This is increasingly a critical issue for us in Australian schools where we find young people caught up in the digital age,” Dr. Tudball said. What should be the focus for you in your schools? Dr. Tudball asked. “Is the focus on teaching, learning, assessment and innovation? Being clearer about what young people know and understand is important,” she said. How to use digital technology effectively and the importance of teachers' quality need more attention, she added.
Dr. Tudball cited Wooranna Primary School in Melbourne, a multicultural school with 38 different nationalities and Balwyn High School to point out school improvement strategies. “In Australia, every government school must go through a continuous school improvement review and they have to set goals which are highly statistical, evidence-based and data-driven.
“I was amazed how Wooranna Primary School improved from within. There are 420 children and every child chooses a ‘passion project’ once a year which is very interesting. It is a differentiated curriculum.
It is individual learning but also collaborative with extraordinary partnerships between parents, teachers, learners and community.

The students have the opportunity to be learners who embrace culture, think critically, communicate clearly and work collaboratively, utilizing connectivity and developing creativity,” Dr. Tudball said.
At Wooranna, it is about learning to learn, meet diverse needs, learning collaboratively and maximizing learning. Sometimes it is interdisciplinary learning, flexible use of time and space and including student and parent voices.
Dr. Tudball stressed that it cannot happen at once and that the challenge is to work out what matters most to you and your school – when, who, where, what, how much it is going to cost and what is required.
“Choose things that matter to you and what you believe in, and it is likely to happen.
At Balwyn High School, the key areas are rigorous and differentiated curriculum to cater to individual learning needs, improving literacy outcomes for all students, developing a whole school literacy plan with accurate and consistent approaches to assess individual students,” she said.
