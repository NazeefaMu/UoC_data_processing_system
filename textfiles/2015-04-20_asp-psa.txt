The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) had summoned businessman and Sri Lanka Labour Party Leader A.S.P. Liyanage to record a statement under the Money Laundering Act to find whether he had sold his residence to Rs. 450 million.
He had been summoned to appear at the Division at 2 p.m. today to record the statement as there could be certain legal issues if he had sold the residence to such a high price, the CCD had informed Mr. Liyanage.
