Former Chief of Defence Staff Roshan Gunathilake was interrogated by the Police Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID) on the MiG aircraft transaction in 2006, Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said the interrogations were based on the Rs.1.5 million spent on repairing four MiG aircraft bought in 2006 from Ukraine.
Meanwhile, former President’s Chief of Staff Gamini Senarath was again interrogated by the FCID this morning in connection with the large scale corruption alleged to have taken place at the People’s Leasing Company. (LSP)
