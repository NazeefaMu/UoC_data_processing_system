President Maithripala Sirisena has said that when appointing a Cabinet minister, the person selected must not only be acceptable locally but also internationally.

This had transpired when the BBC Sinhala channel interviewed the President during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.

The President said he had to consider the international atmosphere as well when he was asked about the views expressed in the country as to who should be appointed as Law and Order Minister.

"The one who is to be appointed to a ministerial portfolio should have local and international recognition," he said.
