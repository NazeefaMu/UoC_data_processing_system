Nine women were arrested by the Peliyagoda Police Marine Division today on charges of throwing garbage, waste water and other effluent substances into the Kelani River.
Police said those arrested were residents of Henamulla and Thotalanga and the arrests were made during a raid carried out by the Marine Division.
The women were released on police bail, but will be produced before the Maligawatta Magistrate on December 7.
Recently, 23 people including 13 women were arrested on charges of dumping garbage into the Kelani and Bolgoda rivers.
The Central Environment Authority earlier said that several factories located on the banks of Kelani River were also charged of disposing their waste material into the river but no legal action has been taken against the factories as yet. (Piyumi Fonseka)
