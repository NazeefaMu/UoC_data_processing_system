A yahapalanaya purohita has taken the initiative to open up new colonies in the Mannar area and some of them are named after some foreign countries, they say.


Some Diyawanna members representing the main Tamil alliance had apprised the government and opposition members of this ‘disturbing’ new development. 


According to the information provided by these Diyawanna members the three main colonies already set up have been named as Turki Colony, Pakistan Colony and Qatar Colony and non-nationals account for the majority of those settled in these three colonies. The members of the main alliance of the North have urged the government authorities to call a halt to the ongoing illegal activity before the issue grows into crisis proportions.
