Peterhansel wins as Peugeot dominate Dakar fourth stage

 
SAN SALVADOR DE JUJUY,, WEDNESDAY: Stephane Peterhansel kept a float his bid for a 12th Dakar Rally crown when leading a Peugeot clean sweep in Wednesday's fourth stage around Jujuy in Argentina.
The marathon event's all-time most successful competitor held off teammates Carlos Sainz and Sebastien Loeb by 11sec and 27sec at the end of the 429 kilometre stage.
This was the veteran Frenchman's 66th stage win, a record tally split equally between cars and bikes.
The 50-year-old from Alsace made his Dakar debut in 1988, winning the first of his six overall victories on two wheels back in 1991 and taking his 11th victory behind the wheel of a Mini in 2013.
World rally legend Loeb, with two stage wins in the bag already on his promising Dakar debut, remained atop the overall standings with Peterhansel in second at 4min 48sec. Defending Dakar champion, Qatar's Nasser Al-Attiyah (Mini) is third at 11min 9sec.
Al-Attiyah, who won bronze in the men's skeet shooting event at the London 2012 Olympics, reflected after his fourth place: "It ain't easy.
"I did my best to attack, but you just can't keep up with the Peugeots."
