The third annual Lanka Comic Con is set to take place today and tomorrow at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre from 10am to 8pm and 10am to 6pm respectively. Organized by the Geek Club of Sri Lanka, Comic Con brings together fans that share a passion for a wide variety of multi entertainment genres such as comic books, video and board games, animation, superhero movies and many more. With last year’s event attracting more than 3000 people, the organizers are prepared to bring you a bigger and better convention beyond anyone’s expectations.   
This year several international and local speakers and guests, including JayanthiKuru-Utumpala, the first and only Sri Lankan to climb Mount Everest, will be attending the event. In addition to this there will be a variety of events and attractions for both adults and kids alike.
The agenda includes-
· The cosplay (“costume play”) activities [last year, we had over 300 cosplayers]   
· The sword fighting tournament   
· The ‘Pro Wrestling’ / Mixed Martial Arts matches, by contestants dressed as monsters.   
So get your costumes ready, grab your ticket and get ready to have the time of your life.
