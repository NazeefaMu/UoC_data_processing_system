While the communal fires were raging in the upcountry, someone had taken advantage of the chaotic situation to set fire to several government bungalows built on a hilly terrain, they say. 

 


A palatial residence owned by a powerful politico is located in close proximity to the government bungalows torched by unknown arsonists.


Some residents in the area are said to be directing the finger of suspicion at the powerful politico, who, they say, is known to have been keen on annexing to his own premises part of the state-owned land where the bungalows are located.
