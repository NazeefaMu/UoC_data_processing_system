Prove your innocence-JHU to Gammanpila


	

The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today reiterated that none of its members were behind the arrest of its former member and MP Udaya Gammanpila and urged him to prove if he was innocent without blaming the JHU and its members for no reason.

JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Mr. Gammanpila was making hate-filled statements directed at JHU members especially at Party Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.

“Gammanpila is trying to cover up his wrongdoings and frauds hiding behind ‘nationalism’ and ‘Sinhala Buddhist’ concepts. He preaches against imperialism but his family members live in imperialistic countries. He was arrested not because one of us made a complaint but because one of his old friends - Lasitha Perera,” he told a news conference held at the party head office in Battaramulla.
