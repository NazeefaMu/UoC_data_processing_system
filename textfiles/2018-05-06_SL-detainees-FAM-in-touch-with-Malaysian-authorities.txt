The ministry said out of the 131 persons, 127 were arrested under the Immigration Act 1959/63 and presently detained at Pekan Nenas Immigration Detention Centre in Johor Baru.

The remaining four peoplewere arrested and detained under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act of 2007.

“At present, investigations are still underway, and officials of the Sri Lanka High Commission in Malaysia are working closely with the relevant Malaysian authorities in this connection. While the identities of the 131 persons are still in the process of being determined, initial information indicate that 43 of the 131 persons arrested hold identity cards issued by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR),” it said.

It also added that further information regarding the individuals arrested will be shared when available, and as appropriate, respecting the need to ensure that information thus shared does not jeopardize the investigations that are presently underway.
