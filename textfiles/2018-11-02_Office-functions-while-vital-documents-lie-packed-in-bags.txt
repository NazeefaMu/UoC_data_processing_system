Office functions while vital documents lie packed in bags!


	



 

Office files of a major council pertaining to matters of vital importance to the ratepayers, packed in fertilizer bags are lying gathering dust for the last five months, they say.

 


The council in question moved into a new building complex five months ago. However, the important files brought to the new building complex packed in bags are still lying idle as the racks meant for stacking the files are yet to be constructed.


The authorities concerned do not appear to be taking any interest in expediting the construction work on the record room to arrange the files in some order. As a result, the office aides are compelled to pull out files from the bags with great difficulty whenever the need arises, they say.
