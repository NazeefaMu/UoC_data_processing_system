A letter, signed by more than 60 UPFA MPs calling for the appointment of the MP Dinesh Gunawardena as the Opposition Leader of Parliament replacing Nimal Siripala de Silva, has been handed over to Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa this afternoon.
These MPs claimed that the post should be handed over to an ally of the UPFA, since some SLFP Parliamentarians had accepted Ministerial portfolios in the government.
