The process for releasing 30 ex-LTTEers detained in prisons countrywide will begin tomorrow, the Prisons Department said today.
Prisons Commissioner General Rohana Pushpakumara said the Attorney General’s Department had given the green light last week to release 30 of the 168 ex-LTTEers detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
He said the AG is yet to submit the names of those to be released under this procedure.
“Those detained for minor crimes will be released first,” Mr. Pushpakumara said.
The detainees had begun another hunger strike recently demanding that they be release. Prisons officials said it was still continuing.
The ex-LTTE detainees launched a hunger strike at several prisons on October 12 and it was called off after an assurance given by the President to set up a mechanism to look into their demands.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
