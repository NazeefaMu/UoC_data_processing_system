A governing style that irks everyone


	



 

A meddlesome governing one has become a big headache to a chief purohita and the senior provincial white-collar ones, they say. 

 


This governing one has already taken over some of the functions and responsibilities at the upcountry council which clearly come under the purview of the chief purohita.


The governing one, they say, is a powerful character enjoying free access to the authorities in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya and would report to the latter practically every case of ‘dereliction of duty’ or real or perceived ‘insubordination’ on the part of staffers. Therefore, everyone at the council including the chief purohita dread incurring the displeasure of the meddling one.


Incidentally, this character is said to be a close kin of the chief purohita and this happens to be the reason why he is so slow to lock horns with her for encroaching on his area of authority, they say.
