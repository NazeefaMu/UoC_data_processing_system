Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was today further remanded till February 16 by the Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayaka for allegedly threatening Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda.

Ven. Gnanasara Thera, was granted bail by the Homagama Magistrate on Tuesday (9).

The Ven. Thera was remanded on charges of contempt of court, and threatening Mrs. Ekneligoda. He was given bail on the contempt charge. However, he was re-remanded for allegedly threatening Mrs. Ekneligoda.

Meanwhile, the lawyers appearing for the Thera said the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act, No. 4 of 2015 was taken to Court proceedings for the first time and this act was not relevant to the case proceedings of the Ven. Gnanasara Thera.

But the aggrieved party claimed it was relevant for the case.

Court proceedings were temporarily halted for about two hours to allow the lawyers of both parties to discuss and come to an understanding, but since there was no agreement when the case continued, the lawyers requested the Magistrate to postpone the case to study the case.

The Magistrate had subsequently postponed the case till February 16, the lawyers said.

The Magistrate had also asked the lawyers to inform him by February 15, what the consensus was, and that regardless of the agreement, the case would be taken up again on February 16.  

Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnansara Thera was arrested by the Homagama Police, and was remanded on the orders of the Homagama Magistrate till February 9 on January 26.

Homagama Magistrate ordered the Police to arrest and produce the Thera before Court on January 25. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Muditha Dayananda)
