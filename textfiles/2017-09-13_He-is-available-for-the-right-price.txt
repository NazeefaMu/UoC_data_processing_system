A once loquacious JO stalwart hailing from the upcountry is playing William the Silent these days, they say. 

 


The man being conspicuous by his absence in the JO’s political battle ground in the recent past has set gossipy tongues wagging. 


Meanwhile, a story doing rounds in political circles says that he has received an invitation from yahapalanaya and he has indicated that he is prepared to make a positive response if the right offer is forthcoming.


He had initially indicated his preference for the media subject, but given the subject is already being handled by a senior purohita, their attention has turned to an alternative subject like Mahaveli, they say.
