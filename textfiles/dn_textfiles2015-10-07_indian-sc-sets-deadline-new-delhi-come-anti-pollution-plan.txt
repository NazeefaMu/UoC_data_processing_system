Indian SC sets deadline for New Delhi to come up with anti-pollution plan

INDIA: India's Supreme Court has given New Delhi three days to come up with a plan to clean up the air in a city ranked by the World Health Organisation as the most polluted in the world.
Successive local governments in Delhi have failed to check pollution from industry and increasing traffic. This is not the first time the court has passed such an order - successive local governments have failed to solve the problem.
About 52,000 commercial vehicles, excluding taxis, enter the landlocked city each day, more than double government estimates, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said in a report this week. Such vehicles account for about a third of the city's pollution.
"If we are able to have a strategy to address this commercial traffic, it will help clean up the air," said Anumita Roychowdhury, an executive director at the CSE.
