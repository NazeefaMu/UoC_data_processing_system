Assault on past student; Police to obtain TV footage
	
Galle Chief Magistrate Nilupuli Lankapura yesterday granted permission to the Police to obtain TV video footage of a Southland Vidyalaya's former student who was assaulted while filming the protest by past students and parents yesterday at the Galle bus stand.
Permission was granted on the basis of a report alleging abuse threats and criminal harassment committed against a woman.
Some 200 past students and parents called for the cancellation of the transfer of the Principal of the Southland Vidyalaya in Galle.
The 20-year-old woman was videoing the protest when some protesters asked her to stop the videoing. But she had continued the videoing claiming nobody can stop her from doing so. She was then assaulted until police arrived on the scene and removed the attackers.
A woman has been taken into custody in this connection. Investigations are continuing under the instructions of Galle SSP Salaiya Silva and ASP Sathis Gamage. (D.G. Sugathapala)

Dead peacock mystery solved
	
Details have emerged about the man shown holding a dead peacock in one hand and an airgun in the other, which went viral on social media, Wildlife Conservation Department spokesperson Hasini Sarathchandra said today.
According to the mans wife's statement, which was recorded by the Wennapuwa Police, her husband had not shot the peacock.
The peacock was accidentally knocked down by our vehicle while we were on our way to attend Mass at Wennapuwa Church last year. After knocking it down, my husband lifted the dead peacock by its neck while holding the air gun in his other hand. He threw the peacock into the jungle before attending Mass. My husband is now working in Italy. This photo was taken last year, the wife said in her statement to the police. We keep an airgun to scare away animals which stray into our property because we have not yet fitted the doors and windows of our house.
The man was a resident of Lunuwila in Wennappuwa. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

EgyptAir Hijacker arrested
	
The hijacking of a domestic Egyptian flight that was forced it to divert to Larnaca airport in Cyprus has ended with all hostages being released and the hijacker surrendering.
EgyptAir Flight MS181 was taken over by a passenger claiming to be wearing a suicide explosive belt.
In a tweet, the Cypriot foreign ministry said: "It's over. The hijacker arrested."
The motive behind the hijacking remains unclear.
Some reports saying the man wanted to talk to his estranged Cypriot wife, while others said he was seeking the release of female prisoners in Egypt.
The situation ended when the hijacker, reportedly an Egyptian, was seen walking down the steps of the aircraft with his hands raised.
It came shortly after several people were seen fleeing the aircraft. One - apparently a crew member - escaped by climbing out of the aircraft's cockpit window.
The plane had been surrounded by police since it landed at Larnaca several hours earlier on Tuesday morning. (BBC)

Govt. to launch 'Post school education' programme
	
The government will introduce a new change in the education system by May this year, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Speaking during the opening of Royal MAS Arena at Royal College Colombo, the Premier said a new Post school education programme would be introduced under this new system of education. Accordingly he said this programme would be carried out by schools to prepare students for higher education.
The Premier said he had discussed the new system of education with the subject minister and other stakeholders.
The system of education, he said would be one where the central government and the provincial council could work together. Further he assured that proper officers would be recruited to the ministry of education and the institutions that comes under it. He further assured that the government would allocate six percent of the GDP for education as promised.
We had an education system which provides opportunities for all the children but we have lost it and we have to reintroduce such a system again. There are conservative people who may shout against it but we will have to go-ahead with the education reforms  he said.
He stressed the need for providing state of art facilities such as Roya MAS arena modern sports complex to all schools in the country.(Yohan Perera)

A deputy purohita who had planned to make a foreign trip soon after his previous jaunt, paid a courtesy call on his senior purohita on the eve of his departure.

When he was about to depart, the senior purohita asked him: Whom are you taking along with you on this trip
My wife! Who else should accompany me when I go abroad was the purohitas quick rejoinder.
Didnt she accompany you last time too, the senior purohita asked again.
I trust my wife though some people dont trust me, was the purohitas laconic reply. The senior purohita blanched. He knew the reply was a barb aimed at him, because he immediately recalled that once he had remarked that he could not trust his deputy.

It was a major construction project. Documents relating to the awarding of the contract were cut and dry and the two parties involved -- the government authority and the successful tenderer had only to sign on the dotted lines.

The other day a senior Purohita who had decided to award this contract to a friend of his, arrived at the Ministry with the latter to wrap up the deal. And he found to his utter dismay that a close kin of a higher yahapalanaya authority had the contract already signed, sealed and delivered to a pal. The Purohita seething with frustration later spewed out some spicy details about the high political authority who had beaten him to the punch, they say.
By the way, the purohita is still clueless as to how the high political authoritys kin had manoeuvered to award the contract to his intimate so secretly, they say.

Minister Amaratunga admitted to having ordered the removal of the walking path which was built at a cost of Rs.80 million. After I saw the news, I thought he will be arrested under the Public Properties Act or produced in the Negombo Magistrates Court. But nothing has happened so far, joint opposition organiser MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.

Minister Amaratunga to reconstruct walking path
	
Tourism, Lands and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga today assured that the walking path along the left embankment of Kalu Ela at Mabole, Wattala, that was removed several days ago, would be reconstructed soon.
Issuing a statement, the minister said that he had no personal involvement with the matter. First of all I wish to categorically state that I have no personal involvement in the matter, my involvement is purely to ensure the well-being of the people of Wattala, he said.
The Statement;
Over the last few days various media reports have been broadcast and published to the effect that I have been involved in the removal of a walking path along the Wattala- Mabole Kalu Ela left embankment.
First of all I wish to categorically state that I have no personal involvement with this matter, my involvement is purely to ensure the well-being of the people of Wattala.
The pathway that has been removed has been constructed on private land by the previous government.
In fact following a query made from me by the land owners I in turn wrote to the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Province Development on the 16th of March 2016, seeking clarification with regard to the land in question.
The LRDC replied my letter on the 18th of March 2016 confirming that the land is not vested with the state and that it has no objection to a road being constructed if the land owners are agreeable. This letter has been signed by LRDC Director General Srimathi Senadhira.
The roadway that is to be constructed replacing the existing pathway is primarily to access a block of land where it has been proposed to construct a housing scheme for low income families in the area.
These families that have been ignored for years are in dire need of decent housing. The roadway will also assist in keeping the canal clean by facilitating the movement of equipment.
However, considering the inconvenience that has been caused to a number of people I will immediately intervene to get the walkway reconstructed.
I wish to state that as the second most long-serving Member of Parliament, next only to the Prime Minister and having represented the Wattala electorate for an unbroken period since 1977, the welfare of the people in the area are my topmost priority.
It is unfortunate that individuals with vested interests are using this matter to further their political ambitions.

New constitution in 2017: PM
	
A new constitution will be enacted in 2017 when Sri Lanka completes 70 years since the setting up of the legislature, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
Parliament will celebrate its 70th anniversary in 2017. We will discuss with the Speaker and the party leaders as to how we should mark this event. By that time the present Parliament will enact a new constitution, he said at a seminar jointly organized by the Sri Lankan Parliament and the USAID-funded programme for Parliament.
The Prime Minister said various constitutions would be studied and assistance of several countries would be obtained in drafting a new constitution.
We must get to know the US Constitution as it is the first written constitution and see how powers are expanded. Speaker has also taken the initiative to talk to Germany. We have to to talk to the EU about obtaining its assistance for this programme and we will confer with the West Minister Foundation. Britain is engaged in democratic initiatives to decide whether to stay with the EU. We can learn about it as well. I have asked the help of Austria, we can study the systems in Japan and India. I hope to meet the National Peoples Congress Chairman in China, he said.
The Prime Minister said the Constitution should be drafted and approved with knowledge of the system. There is no point in an MP lifting the hand for a proposal about which he is unaware as it happened in the past, he said and stressed the need for MPs to understand the true meaning of democracy. Democracy means benefits. One must understand what a constituion is about, he said.
Talking about the shortcomings when enacting a constitution he said a cabinet system was introduced in 1943 during the war time but Sri Lanka did not have any experience on implementing such a system.
He said the governments which enacted the first and second republican constitutions had a two-thirds majority. I was in Parliament when the second republication constitution was enacted. These were enacted according to the needs of the ruling parties at the time, the Prime Minister said pointing out that there were shortcomings in it.
He recalled that it was the 13th Amendment which was enacted with the active participation of several parties. SLFP did not participate in this exercise. Had the SLFP participated in it they would have won several provincial councils in 1988, he said.
The Prime Minister said a national government is being formed under President Maithripala Sirisena and the two main parties got a mandate to enact a new constitution at the general election. This won't be a government or party-drafted constitution, he said.
The Prime Minister said the foremost factor when drafting a constitution is peoples sovereignty. This is Sri Lankan identity. We are all same and are children of one mother. We have the right to safeguard our own religion and the freedom to follow it, he said.
He also spoke of universal franchise. The PM said party leaders are discussing a new electoral system at the moment. We are discussing a mixed member proportionate system. Agreement is being reached on the fundamentals. We have to decide whether we are going to have 60 per cent or 50 per cent proportional representation or whether we need a national list, he said.
With regard to the rule of law and constitutionalism, the PM said it was important as it has to be decided how the executive and the legislature would work, We have to decide whether we need a second chamber, some want it others dont, he said.
The PM elaborated on power devolution. He said there was no issue with the present system, but one should think of how it is going to be strengthened without affecting the unitary status and the sovereignty of the country.
Many countries have devolved power in various ways, the US in one way, India in a different way and Britain in another way. We can do our own thing. We have to think of whether we are going to centre power in ministries; We will have to think about de-centralizing power as well and include this in the constitution, the PM said
He said the constitutional assembly would have to go forward on the recommendations of the public relations committee. We have to decide whether were are proposing sub committees right away or are we going to wait till we get the report of the public relations committee and form them in May, he said. We will have a parliamentary form of governance with standing committees. We have to think of what Buddha preached when establishing our Parliamentary system."
The PM said it was necessary to meet in peace, confer in peace and conclude in peace. This tradition he said cant be broken. If this tradition is broken by some one, he is neither a Buddhist, Christian, Muslim nor Hindu. (Yohan Perera)

No need for them to apply for leave
	








Sports instructors at the sports division of a higher education institution in the city have hit upon a novel ruse to mark their attendance even when they keep away from work. They resort to this ploy with the connivance of the acting head of their division who has risen from their ranks, they say.

Employees in all sections of this institution finger-print their arrival and departure accept these sports instructors who mark their attendance in a separate register. These instructors reportedly mark their times of arrival and departure as 8.00 am and 4.15 pm respectively no matter what time they report for work or leave the workplace. Some instructors who may fail to report for work on one particular day, would conveniently sign the attendance register for that day when they come for work the following day with no questions asked. So according to official records of the institution, these instructors are not on leave, even when they are not working and given this privilege there is no need for them to apply for leave either.

163.4 billion.
I am delighted to be associated with the Bank in this momentous year of growth, Chairman Aswin De Silva said. The achievement is significant as it is attributed largely to an organic growth representing core business areas. As we forge ahead towards building a financial resilience in Sri Lanka, we are bolstered by trust and confidence placed in us by all our stakeholders, he said. De Silva added that sustainability of this growth momentum is a key focus area for the Bank. To this end the Bank would embark on several new initiatives in 2016 and beyond to complement its core areas of activity. The Banks growth in profitability in 2015 has been attributed to five key factors: growth in co-business signifying a 26 percent increase in net interest income, improvement in asset quality through the reduction of the Banks non-performing loans ratio from 7.6 percent in 2014 to 3.5 percent, increased business volume through a clearer focus on under penetrated business areas such as inward foreign currency remittances, enhanced efficiency and productivity through a well managed operating cost structure and wider reach and accessibility through an improved relationship with the national postal network, particularly within rural
Sri Lanka.
We are privileged to have contributed Rs. 11 billion to the Government by way of taxes, fees and dividend during 2015, said the General Manager/CEO S. D. N Perera. In my view, the strategic and operational action plan will assist continuity of growth and meeting targets he added.
NSBs loans and advances grew by 22 percent, its retail lending portfolio increased by 16 percent and corporate lending by 29 percent. The total assets of the Bank stood at Rs. 848 billion indicating a growth of 9 percent. NSBs Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio stood at 17.8 percent, while total capital adequacy for the reviewed period was at 16.3 percent which were well above the minimum regulatory requirements.
The Bank added 9 new branches in 2015 increasing its total branch network to 245. NSB has always been the safest place to Bank  it was the first local bank to receive AAA credit rating from Fitch Ratings Lanka Limited. The rating has been consistently reaffirmed for the past 13 years.

Power cut during President's speech
	
There had been a power outage lasting for more than half an hour this afternoon, during the North Western Province Medical Awards Ceremony (organised by the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine of the North Western Province) while President Maithripala Sirisena, who was the chief guest, was addressing the gathering.
The event, held at the auditorium of the provincial council, had continued in darkness as the standby generator at the auditorium, too, had failed to function.
The president, after he had completed his speech in total darkness, was presented with a commemorative trophy with the help of a torch. Power had been restored sometime later. Sources said the usual power cut applicable to this area had been imposed by the Electricity Board which had not been informed of the event at the auditorium. These power outages had interrupted council sessions earlier too.
The journalists of the area had boycotted the event as a mark of protest, as the Chairman of the North Western Provincial council Tikiri Banda Adhikari had allegedly abused them. (Pushpakumara Jayaratne)

Sampath Bank to promote responsible holidays
	
The picture shows Sampath Bank Senior Deputy General Manager Consumer Banking, Tharaka Ranwala exchanging the agreement with CEO of The Carbon Consulting Company, Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne

Proving once again that they stand firmly beside their proposition of being the Responsible Choice, Sampath Bank announced their latest innovation in the Banking sector. 
Teaming up with The Carbon Consulting Company, the countrys leading provider of Corporate Sustainability Solutions  The Bank announced unveiled its Carbon Neutral Hotel Stay programme. Certified by the Carbon Consulting Company as a ZeroCarbon Hotel Stay, the Bank from now on undertakes to completely offset the carbon emissions of any hotel stays made through their credit cards.
Remarking on this ground-breaking initiative, Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy General Manager  Consumer Banking, Sampath Bank PLC said, At Sampath Bank, we are strongly driven toward creating a positive impact not just for the citizens and country, but to the environment that provides us with unlimited and invaluable resources to carry on with our daily activities. As such, by being positioned amongst the masses as a Responsible Choice, we took it upon ourselves to be an integral contributor to our environment that has been providing us with a planet which will be the home and future of our generations. Putting together the expertise of Sampath Bank and The Carbon Consulting Company, we strongly believe that together we can build a greener future for betterment of the Earth and the People.
A hotel stay carbon footprint consists of emissions associated with energy consumption in terms of fuel &electricity usage and waste generation, during an overnight stay of a guest in a paid accommodation in the Hospitality & Tourism Industry. The average CO2e emissions per different types of accommodation were assessed through a study done by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Using this research and providing for a significant buffer, Sampath Bank will commit to bringing the carbon emissions of their customers hotel stay to Net Zero status by investing in local and international green energy projects through the internationally recognized mechanism of Carbon Credits. All Sampath Credit Card customers have to do is to pay for their hotel stay using the credit card and Sampath Bank will retire the necessary amount of carbon credits corresponding to that stay through The Carbon Consulting Company.
This is a ground breaking and innovative concept in Responsible Tourism says CEO of The Carbon Consulting Company  Sanith de S. Wijeyeratne. To the best of our knowledge no where else in the world is there such a facility where, a credit card issuer completely offsets its customers carbon footprints at no cost to them. When we at Carbon Consulting Companyconceived of the idea it was immediately evident that SampathCards were the obvious choice in the local credit card market.
Havening completely disrupted the market with the endearing proposition of The Responsible Choice in credit cards, SampathCards have now extended this proposition to an aspect of environmental responsibility as well. Now the card holders can rest assured that the environmental impacts of their hotel stay have been completely negated by their Sampath Credit Card. We are privileged to work with such a visionary and environmentally conscious Brand as SampathCardsand we look forward to bringing further innovation into the environmental field together. Sampath Bank has continued to remain a forerunner in venturing into unique initiatives that not only brings about positive change in the lifes of citizens, the country and the economy, but also guarantees a sustainable future for the environment and its natural resources. As such, this ground-breaking project is yet another justification of Sampath Banks promise to a responsible choice and a responsible corporate citizen for the betterment of the people, the nation and the earth.

They were all waiting for the arrival of the Chief Guest to start off the ceremony. Meanwhile, the fair purohita was cooling her heels inside her car.
The day being unusually hot, a villager who presumed that the fair purohita would welcome a cool thambili drink, climbed a tree to pluck a nut or two. He had slipped down and the death had been instantaneous. And a funereal atmosphere had prevailed at the opening ceremony held later, they say.
