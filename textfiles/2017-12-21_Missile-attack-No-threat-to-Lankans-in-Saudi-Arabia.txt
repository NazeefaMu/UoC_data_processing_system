The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) today said they were vigilant of any threats to Sri Lankans after the ballistic missile fired by Yemen’s Houthi group towards Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

SLBFE Media Secretary Nalin Rajapaksha said they had made inquiries from the Sri Lankan Embassy regarding the safety of expatriates working in the region and were assured they faced no threat.

Spokesman for the Ministry Maheshini Kolonne told Daily Mirror that Sri Lankan expatriates in Saudi were not threatened by the incident.
