North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he strongly supports denuclearization during a rare meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The diplomat is visiting Pyongyang after a landmark agreement between the two Koreas.  


“The denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is the firm position of the North Korean side,” Kim Jong-un told Wang Yi on Thursday.   


During the talks Kim also emphasized “peaceful changes” and further promotion of peace in the region that came after he traveled to the South and met his counterpart Moon Jae-in. The declaration, signed by the duo at the historic meeting on April 27, marked the beginning of “new age of peace” and sought “complete denuclearization”.  


Beijing hailed the agreement that ends “the state of war” and said it “fully supports” North Korea’s commitment.  


On Wednesday, Wang Yi started a two-day visit to the neighbouring communist state and met his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong-Ho. Wang became the highest-ranking Chinese official to travel to North Korea in 11 years.
