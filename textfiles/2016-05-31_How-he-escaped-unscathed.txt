How he escaped unscathed


	



 

Sparks flew as expected during the much publicised Diyawanna council debate on an airline that had become a heavy burden on the exchequer.

 


A certain purohita who had had close ties to the institution operating this airline had made a great effort on the eve of this debate to avert criticisms expected to be directed at him.


This purohita had approached all opposition members listed to participate in the debate and had implored them not to drag his name in the mud during the debate.  Meeting these members individually and addressing by intimate terms such as Malli, Aiya and Machang, he had told them: “Please don’t drag my name. You all ought to know that I had no hand in those deals.”


The purohita’s humble appeal was not in vain for none of the opposition members attacked him during the debate. They directed all their fire at the kith and kin of the former strongman.
