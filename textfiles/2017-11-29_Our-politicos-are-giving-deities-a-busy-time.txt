Our politicos are giving deities a busy time


	



 

If the pantheon of deities in our neighbouring country were to give ear to the supplications of our leading politicos who are visiting the Kovils dedicated to them these days, they would surely have no time to look into the woes of the people in their own country. 

 


It was only a few days ago the people here heard that their Number Two was conducting a pooja at a Kovil in Mysore. Soon after, a news story said that King Rooster from the estate-kingdom had pitched camp at a Kovil in Karnataka for a multi-day pooja. Meanwhile, reports said that his main political rival Deega was visiting Tamil Nadu to seek the blessings of deities at several Kovils in that state.  The next on the list to join the Indian Kovil-bound parade from Mother Lanka are two or three devotees from the JO, they say.


Another devotee due to visit India shortly is none other than the chair of our Diyawanna council who will be on a pilgrimage to Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur, the birthplace of Ambedkar-led Buddhist revival 
in India.
