SLFP agrees to join National Govt.


	

The SLFP Central Committee today decided to form a national government with the UNP for two years with either party failing to secure an overall majority to form a government at this election.
The UNP, the party with the single highest number of seats, got 106 seats in the new parliament, falling short of seven more slots for the simple majority. The SLFP-led UPFA received 96 seats.
The SLFP Central Committee even appointed a six-member committee headed by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga to work out the modalities for the formation of this government with the UNP. It comprises former Ministers S.B. Dissanayake, Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Susil Premajayantha and Nimal Siripala de Silva.
However, a section of the SLFP’s new parliamentary group is opposed to the formation of a national government. President Maithripala Sirisena met the newly elected SLFP members yesterday to discuss the national government concept.
The President said the party should take people oriented decisions regarding national issues and only then it would propel the country to new heights.
At the meeting, a committee headed by Ratnapura district MP elect John Seneviratne was appointed to hold talks with the other members of the group, and submit a report on their ideas regarding the national government. The committee comprises Mr. Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Keheliya Rambukwella and Kumara Welgama.
In the meantime, another set of senior members held the view that the SLFP should get the Cabinet portfolios of Finance, Law and Order, Trade, Education and Highways in such a government. They opined at the meeting the party should not compromise for less influential ministerial posts as in the 100-day government. (Kelum Bandara)
