The Foreign Correspondents’ Association (FCA) of Sri Lanka strongly condemned the twin attacks in Afghanistan where 10 journalists were killed and urged the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest.

The FCA said they were deeply shocked by the killing of the journalist colleagues in the attacks.

“The FCA strongly condemns these cowardly attacks and urges the authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest,” it said in a statement.

“The FCA conveys its deepest sympathies to the families of BBC journalist Ahmad Shah, 29, and AFP chief photographer in Kabul, Shah Marai, 41, and the families of the other journalists who were killed on Monday. The BBC’s Shah was killed in the eastern Afghan province of Khost hours after the other nine journalists, including AFP’s Marai, fell victim to a suicide bomber who had disguised himself as a press photographer. The attacker targeted journalists who had rushed to report on the first suicide bombing in Kabul. We also wish a speedy recovery to those injured in the senseless violence,” the statement added.

The FCA said it was aware of the serious challenges faced by reporters and photographers in Afghanistan who were working under some of the most dangerous conditions in the world.

“ In Sri Lanka, dozens of journalists and media workers were killed during its decades-long separatist war which ended in May 2009. We wish to express our support to all our colleagues in Afghanistan at this very difficult time and wish them the courage to carry out their duties without succumbing to terror tactics of the perpetrators,” it said.
