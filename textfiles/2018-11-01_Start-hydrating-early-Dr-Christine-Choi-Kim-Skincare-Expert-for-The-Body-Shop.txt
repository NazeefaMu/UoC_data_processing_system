City living does take a toll on skin; with its constant exposure to exhaust fumes, grubby winds, damaging UV rays from the sun, or even the air conditioning in our offices and homes. As a result, our skin becomes dehydrated, giving a tight, dry, and even dull appearance. Until there is a solution for pollution however, what can be managed is how we take control of this flaky situation.

The Body Shop comes to the rescue -yet again- with its new 100% vegan Vitamin E gel moisture cream! The latest addition to the much-loved Vitamin E family, the new lotion -true to the iconic British brand’s ethical promise- is filled with proven, safe, and highly effective all-natural ingredients filled with antioxidants to fight against the effects of time, sun-damage, and the stress that comes with being a busy and confident woman.

While it is already common knowledge that moisturisation is key to skincare, ensuring hydration is additionally important as lack of adequate water has been proven to speed up the skin’s ageing process.

“It’s never too late to start paying attention to your skin’s hydration, especially if you are prone to dry skin,” advises Dr. Christine Choi Kim, Skincare Expert for The Body Shop. “Our cell turnover starts to slow down in our mid-20’s even if fine lines and wrinkles don’t show up until our 30s. By the time you see the first signs of ageing, you’re playing catch-up! So start hydrating early.”

The lightweight Vitamin E gel moisture cream is suitable for all skin types -even combination skin- and its non-greasy, fast-absorbing properties protects and locks-in moisture for at least two whole days. Just one application of this facial day moisturiser will leave your skin feeling -and looking! - notably refreshed, soft, and radiant. The infusion of raspberry extract will have you smelling delicious too!
The new and improved quenching formula boasts the moisture-power of 100% natural origin hyaluronic acid from Pomacle, France, teamed with the antioxidising power of wheatgerm oil - one of the richest sources of Vitamin E. Effectively mixed with community trade shea butter from Ghana infused with raspberry extract, and community trade aloe vera from Mexico, The Body Shop delivers a conscience as clear as your skin!



For best results, use the Vitamin E gel moisture cream as part of the perfect skincare regime; after cleansing with Vitamin E gentle facial wash, and paired with the Vitamin E Hydrating Toner.
Like a tall glass of water for your skin, this necessary dose of hydration deeply nourishes and protects against harsh elements without making you look or feel greasy.

The Vitamin E gel moisture cream -as well as the entire Vitamin E range- is available at The Body Shop flagship store on Bagatale Road, and outlets at Odel in Alexandra Place, and at the Kandy City Centre.
