Deepika goes solo

Soulful songstress Visharada Deepika Priyadarshani Peiris is ready to mesmerize Sri Lankan audiences with her Solo Musical Concert 'Kaviya Obe'. In a career spanning more than three decades, she has regaled local music lovers with an intensity and feeling that comes from the bottom of her heart. A lady who feels for others, she is driven by a need to create change for the greater good of all.
"We live in an age where people are not able to enjoy songs because of their busy lifestyles. Nevertheless there is an interest and demand, because people still like to enjoy these songs.
That is why many people have requested me to do a concert like this. I also have an onus to take my songs and my love of songs not only to Colombo audiences but to the rural community as well. If you take Colombo audiences, they have easy access to halls and theaters. I want to go into this rural sphere and create a discourse about these songs and enable the rural folk to enjoy these songs. In this concert of mine, some of my very popular songs will be sung," said Deepika.
Deepika has been fortunate to have had the opportunities that she has had in life. Feeling extremely privileged to be leading the life she is leading, she is also thankful for having the privilege of associating with so many people in the industry who have influenced her and formed her.
"Here I want to remember my fans with affection and warmth. If I can use my songs for the betterment of society, to the best of my abilities, then I can consider that a worthy accomplishment."
Deepika is concerned about her motherland. She is concerned about the future of the people of our society. "With my popularity if I can point and guide children down the correct path, that is something I place great value on."
It seems Deepika's is a crusade to promote not only the tradition of Sri Lankan music but also values that go hand in hand with it. As a society she feels that we must aim for something. Aim to do something good with the passion of song in mind. She feels that should be done for those in our country who truly love our song tradition, even those who may not be able to go to the BMICH.
"With the best of my ability I want to safeguard and preserve this tradition of song, this heritage. That is my fervent wish and expectation.
The previous generations did not have this problem. Today reviving our song culture will take some effort. It may be a long journey but we must take the first step."
In an age where young Sri Lankans run after Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift this concert by Deepika will be a refreshing experience and opportunity to enjoy Sri Lanka music.
