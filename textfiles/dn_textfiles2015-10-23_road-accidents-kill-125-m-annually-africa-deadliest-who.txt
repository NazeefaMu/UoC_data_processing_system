Road accidents kill 1.25 m annually, Africa deadliest - WHO

SWITZERLAND: Some 1.25 million people are killed in traffic accidents around the world each year, with Africa by far the continent with the most dangerous roads, the World Health Organization said in report published Monday.
"Road traffic fatalities take an unacceptably high toll, particularly on poor people in poor countries," WHO chief Margaret Chan said in a statement. The UN health agency's Global Status Report on Road Safety showed that the situation is improving, with the number of deaths remaining stable in recent years even as the number of cars and other vehicles on the road has increased rapidly. But traffic accidents are still the leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds worldwide and cost governments on average about 3.0 percent of their annual gross domestic products, the report showed.
