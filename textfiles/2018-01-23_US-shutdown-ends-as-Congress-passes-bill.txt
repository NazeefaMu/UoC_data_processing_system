US shutdown ends as Congress passes bill


	

The US government partial shutdown has come to an end after Republicans and Democrats voted for a temporary funding bill, the BBC reported today.

Accordingly, the Democratic leadership has agreed to back the bill after accepting promises from Republicans for a debate later on the future of young illegal immigrants.

President Donald Trump, who signed the bill on Monday evening, took a swipe at Democrats.

It is the fourth temporary measure since October because Capitol Hill cannot agree a longer-term budget.

The spending bill passed the Senate by 81-18 and the House of Representatives by 266-150 earlier on Monday.

The continuing resolution keeps the government funded until February 8 in the hope that Congress can reach a longer-term budget agreement in the meantime.

Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said his party had "come to an arrangement" to negotiate on the Democrats' calls for an immigration deal.

Democrats want protections from deportation for so-called Dreamers, more than 700,000 young immigrants brought to the US as children.

But Republicans had insisted no agreement was possible while federal government services were closed.

President Trump, a Republican, said in a statement: "I am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses.

"We will make a long-term deal on immigration if, and only if, it is good for our country."
