Sri Lanka Bar Association President Udaya Rohan de Silva PC, said it was an insult to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry probing the bond issue when outsiders speak about its activities, ridicule them and point fingers at the officers of the Attorney General’s Department.

He said attempts seemed to have been made to violate the trust of the people about the Commission by popularizing the views of various people saying that certain things had happened due to the commission. He said some persons whose corrupt activities have been revealed seem to have attempted to tarnish the image of the rule of the law and its independence.

He said it went to prove that statements made regarding the hiding of 50 files of politicians against whom allegations have been levelled for crimes were done on the need of the Justice Minister. (Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)
