A mobile travel application is to be introduced by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development in a bid to further reduce traffic congestion and facilitate convenient travelling to the ordinary passenger.

Minister Champika Ranawaka explained it as a cloud application which could be downloaded to smart devices allowing the public to be aware of traffic congestion in the area as well other information such as bus time tables.

The Ministry aimed to pull out passengers before or after peak hours to reduce congestion at the time.

“People can save time and fuel by doing this,” he said.

A pilot project had already been conducted in Kandy and the results and experience gained through the project was sufficient to implement the same in Colombo.

He also said that the Innovation & Entrepreneurship Department of the Moratuwa University had developed the application. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
