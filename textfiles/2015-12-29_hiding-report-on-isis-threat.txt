	Two foreign countries had warned the State intelligence of spreading Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorism in Sri Lanka, the General Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said today.
	“It is disappointing to hear that the government had to wait until foreign countries alert them. We have alerted the government several times and warned the intelligence services over an ISIS attack in this country within a year,” he said.
	“The two foreign countries have already raised alarm on ISIS threat. Now only our intelligence service says yes. They have taken a long time to figure out the threat,” the Thera said.
	“The things we had exposed to the people and the government have now come to the light,” he said.
	Speaking at the media briefing the Chief Executive Officer of the BBS Dilantha Withanage said according to a report, the ISIS threat was vastly spreading in the areas of Dehiwela, Kurunegala, Kolonnawa and Kandy.
	“As an organization, we demand the government to release the details of the report to Parliament and to the people,” he said.
	“We suspect the government is hiding this report to prevent communal conflicts in the country,” the prelate further said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
