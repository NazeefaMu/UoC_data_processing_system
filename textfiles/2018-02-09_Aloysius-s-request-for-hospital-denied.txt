The Prisons Department has turned down a request made by Arjun Aloysius to be admitted to the Prison Hospital citing he was suffering from a back pain.

Department sources today said the request made on Wednesday (7) was denied after medical officers examined Mr. Aloysius.

Though his request has been denied, the medical officers had provided him with basic treatments.

Meanwhile, another request made by Mr. Aloysius to provide him with a pillow brought from outside has also been rejected.

However, he had been later provided with an ordinary pillow and a mattress used by other inmates.

Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Owner Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena were re-remanded on Monday till February 16.

The two are being detained at a special elite prison cell in the E Section of the Welikada Prison in Colombo.

According to sources, no politician other than Mr. Aloysius’s family members had visited him after he was remanded. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
