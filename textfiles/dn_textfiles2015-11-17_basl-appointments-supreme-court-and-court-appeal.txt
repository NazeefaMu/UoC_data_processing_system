BASL on appointments to Supreme Court and Court of Appeal

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has consistently and constantly emphasised the critical need for an independent and impartial judiciary comprising persons of undoubted competence and integrity, the BASL stated in a statement regarding appointments to the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal.
The Bar Association has on several occasions in the past criticised the lack of transparency and the arbitrary manner in which appointments to the judiciary, especially to the superior courts, were made. This also seriously undermines the credibility of the institution of the judiciary and has serious and lasting ramifications for the rule of law and for democracy and our nation as a whole, the release added.
Excerpts from the release: "It is therefore imperative that all future appointments to the Judiciary are made in a transparent and non-arbitrary manner. This is the spirit and purpose behind the enactment of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution and the setting up thereafter of the Constitutional Council.
"With the impending vacancies in the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, the Bar Association calls upon the President, the Members of The Constitutional Council and those responsible to act in the best interests of the nation, it's people and democracy by resort to transparent and reasonable criteria in appointing judges to the Superior Courts. The Bar Association is mindful that constant vigilance, especially on the part of civil society and professional organisations, is essential in this regard.
When making appointments to the Supreme Court from among the judges of the Court of Appeal such appointments should, ordinarily, be made in line with the seniority of the incumbent judges of the Court of Appeal commencing with the President of the Court of Appeal, unless there are manifestly good reasons for not doing so.
When appointments are made to the Court of Appeal from the High Court, such appointments should, ordinarily, be made in line with the seniority of the incumbent judges of the High Court, unless there are manifestly good reasons for not doing so.
When appointments are to be made to the Supreme Court from the Unofficial Bar such appointments should, ordinarily, be from among Attorneys at Law of over 30 years standing who have distinguished themselves in the legal profession.
When making appointments to the Court of Appeal from among the judges of the High Court such appointments should, ordinarily, be made in line with the seniority of the incumbent judges of the High Court, unless there are manifestly good reasons for not doing so.
When appointments are made to the Court of Appeal from the Official Bar, such appointments should ordinarily be, in the order of seniority, from among the the holders of the rank of Additional Solicitors General. When appointments are made to the Court of Appeal from the Unofficial Bar, such appointments should ordinarily be from among Attorneys at Law of over 20 years standing who have distinguished themselves in the legal profession.
Due consideration should be given to the fact that, appointments to the Superior Courts are made from the ranks of the judiciary, the Official Bar, the Unofficial Bar and Jurists and that, it is in the best interests of the superior courts and the legal system that, the superior courts consist of a fair representation of all these sources.
However it should be done keeping in mind the need to ensure that, career judges are given due opportunity and recognition when appointments are made to the superior courts.
The Bar Association is however also mindful that appointments to high judicial office should not be determined on seniority alone but also by taking into account efficiency, competence and integrity of the nominees concerned."
