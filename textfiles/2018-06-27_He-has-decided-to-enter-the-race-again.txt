Number One in yahapalanaya, who is also the Blue party leader is said to have taken a firm decision to enter the fray at the upcoming big poll.

 


However, it is not clear so far whether he has an idea of coming forward as a Green party-backed candidate. Nevertheless, his intimates say that it is a cinch that he will woo the support of the Blue party splinter groups and that of the minority communities in the country. 


Meanwhile, some sources say that there is a strong possibility that Number One will try to make a political bargain with the Green party at the eleventh hour. 


His regular visits to the North, South and the East these days are a prelude to his campaign in earnest, they say. 


His intimates claim that holding the Blue party’s May Day in the East this year for the first time was part of his poll campaign plan.
