The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today they had given a few more days to the government to find a solution to the issue which had arisen due to the undue intervention of the Medical Services Director in the post-Internships appointment process before their proposed trade union action on May 31.

GMOA Secretary Nalinda Herath said they attempted to resolve the issue through discussion but had to resort to a trade union action as there was no option having failed in finding a solution to the issue.

He said they would decide whether to continue their strike action on May 31 and what sort of strike it would be depending on the government’s response to it.

Dr. Herath said Medical Services Director was acting in an arbitrary manner even beyond the instructions of the health minister.

He said the GMOA was planning to complain to the Public Services Commission against the Medical Services Director over his arbitrary actions.

Dr. Herath said the strike would not be conducted in Hospitals in floods and landslides affected districts in Colombo, Gampaha, Kegalle, Puttalam and Kilinochchi and the services of Cancer Hospitals, Maternal Hospitals and Children’s Hospitals would not be affected due to the strike.

He said doctors in Batticaloa and Ampara would launch a token strike tomorrow. (Ajith Siriwardana)
