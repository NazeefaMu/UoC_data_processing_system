The special commodity levy on imported sugar has been reduced from Rs. 30 per kilogramme to 25 cents with effect from midnight today, the Finance Ministry said.

The government on July 12 amended the prices of 15 consumer goods including sugar, dhal, potatoes, big onions, dried chilies, dried fish and milk powder.

"Sugar is now imported to Sri Lanka at Rs.115 a kilogramme and the tax was reduced to facilitate the sale of sugar at the new control price," Consumer Rights Protection National Organization (CRPNO) President Ranjith Vithanage said.
