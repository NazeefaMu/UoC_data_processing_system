MYTH: Brown sugar is not healthier than white sugar. They are more or less the same. 

BUSTED: “This is not true. Brown sugar is much healthier than white sugar. When sugar is cleaned well, you get white sugar. Brown sugar also contains a little bit of fibre. So when comparing the two, we always recommend brown. But we must also remember that sugar is contained in all our food.

Therefore, we recommend that people should have six teaspoons of sugar per day because of the fact that all food contain some amount of sugar. We see that when we drink tea, we don’t taste the tea but we are looking for the taste of sugar,” said Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Non-Communicable Diseases Unit of the Health Ministry.
