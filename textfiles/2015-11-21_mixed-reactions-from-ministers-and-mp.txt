The 2016 budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake drew mixed reactions from Parliament with government members hailing it while the opposition, said it failed to meet expectations.Opposition Leader R. Sampathan 
It seems a development oriented budget. Most of the proposals seem acceptable.Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen
It is one of the best budgets, and has granted relief to the people by reducing prices of essential commodities. Funds have been allocated for education and health as never before.Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake
The budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is development oriented, and that it places no burden on the ordinary people. Every sector in the country has been considered in the budget. Sunil Handunetti MP – JVP
The economy has been opened up extensively without much protection for the local industries. The government will end up with nothing by trying to perform magic. One has to be sensible in dealing with the economy. The government should follow other countries which have protected local industries without opening up the economies to the fullest.Dinesh Gunawardena MP - UPFA
The government has not presented a budget that meets the expectations of the people, but it is an ideal budget for foreigners. The budget speech clearly stated that the government would raise funds by printing money, which is detrimental to the economy.
This is not a budget expected by government servants and the people. It will adversely effect the rupee, the cost of living and cause inflation. Economic hubs have been proposed to be sold to foreign companies directly. The government has not fulfilled its pledges to tea, rubber and paddy cultivators.Eran Wikramaratne MP - UNP
Privatization is not a sufficient solution. All strategic institutions will be under the government and the private sector will be allowed to participate in non-strategic enterprises. A Public Wealth Trust will be set up and this trust will hold shares of some enterprises on behalf of the public.Udaya Gammanpila MP - UPFA
This is a set of fairy tales just like the January 29 budget. Rs. 1.5 billion has been allocated for the development of each Grama Niladari Division. There are 14,200 Grama Niladari divisions. A sum of Rs. 22 trillion is needed for this, but the total allocation is less than that, and therefore insufficient. The government’s estimated revenue is Rs. 2 trillion. The Minister of Finance has not done his homework. Funds have been allocated to build hospitals for kidney and cancer patients. But prevention is better than cure.
