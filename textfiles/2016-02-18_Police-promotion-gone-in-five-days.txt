Police promotion gone in five days


	

A mere five- day difference in service has denied promotion to hundreds of Police officers in the Sub-Inspector category because of the decision by the Police Department to extend their service period in the present position to become eligible to be promoted to the next level, Police sources said today.

Earlier, they were required to serve eight years in the current position to become eligible for promotion to the category of Inspector of Police.

However, the Police Department has decided to extend this service period up to 13 years.

According to the new decision, those who completed 13 years by December 26, last year, have become qualified for elevation to the next level as Inspectors of Police (IP).

However, Police sources said there were as many as 400-500 Police officers, who completed their 13 years in service by January 1, 2016, only five days after the deadline stipulated.

“This is total injustice. A five-day difference has denied promotion to many Police officers,” they said.

It is learnt that these Police officers, aggrieved by the decision, contemplate action to be taken against the move. These officers had urged the Inspector General of Police to review the decision. (KB)
