Govt. to expedite investigations against MR, family


	

The government has reportedly decided to expedite investigations into allegations faced by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family.

This decision follows complaints lodged with the government by backbench UNPers who pointed out that the investigations against the former president and his family members were proceeding at an extremely slow pace and this despite the government having already completed two and a half years in office.

Several ministers have pointed out that for the government to maintain its credibility it was imperative that action was taken to expedite proceedings against those persons who had allegations of corruption levelled against them immediately. These views were expressed at a cabinet meeting held last week.(Ranjan Kasthuri)
