Former deputy minister of petroleum industries and former chairman of Development Lotteries Board (DLB) Sarana Gunawardena was released on bail by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today.

Mr. Gunawardena is alleged to have misused a state vehicle valued over Rs.8 million, while he was serving as the Chairman of DLB under the previous regime.

When the case was taken up, the Magistrate informed the courts that the suspect could not be released on bail, unless under exceptional circumstances as the charges leveled against him were under the Public Property Act.

However, medical reports presented to the court stated the suspect was diabetic, which had resulted in him suffering from a retinal detachment disorder.

Thereafter, the Magistrate ruled that the suspect’s condition could be taken as an exceptional circumstance and released him on cash bail of Rs. 30,000 and three sureties of Rs. 500,000 each. (Yoshitha Perera)
