Pakistan make three changes, bowl first against Sri Lanka

 
 
Pakistan have won the toss and elected to field first in their last Asia Cup match against Sri Lanka at Mirpur on Friday.

Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have included Niroshan Dickwella in place of the injured Angelo Mathews. Dinesh Chandimal will captain the side in Mathews' absence.
