New Delhi, (Hindustan Times), 27 June 2018 - The Congress on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan whether the government will stop oil imports from Iran as asked by US President Donald Trump and given that scenario what impact it will have on petrol prices and national interests.  


“At 18.4 million tonnes of crude oil annually, Iran is India’s 3rd largest supplier.  


“Will the Prime Minister and Petroleum Minister tell the nation if they will adhere to the US decision asking to stop oil imports from Iran and its impact on petrol prices and national interests?,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted.  


The US has told India and other countries to cut oil imports from Iran to “zero” by November 4 or face sanctions, making it clear that there would be no waivers to anyone.
