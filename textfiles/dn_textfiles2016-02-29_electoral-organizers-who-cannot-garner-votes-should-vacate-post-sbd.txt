Electoral organizers who cannot garner votes should vacate post : SBD

An electoral organizer who cannot garner at least 75 per cent of the votes cast for the party from their electorate, should vacate their electorate, Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare S.B.Dissanayake stated.
The Minister who was appointed as the new SLFP electoral organizer for Hewaheta said that he was happy to leave his former electorate Udunuwara as he could not fulfil this requirement at the last general election.
Disanayake said that he was only able to get 10,000 votes out of 20,000 votes cast for the SLFP at the Udunuwara electorate. In contrast Dissanayake said that he had obtained 99.9 per cent of votes cast for the party when he was organizer of the Hanguranketha electorate.
The Minister also recalled that during his tenure as the SLFP General Secretary, he was instrumental in bringing a regulation that party organizers who cannot garner 75 per cent of votes cast for the party from their electorate should resign.
Dissanayake said that as a politician who hails from Udunuwara he was confident of gaining the upper hand for his party in the electorate at future elections.
