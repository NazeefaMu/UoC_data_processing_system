Sri Lanka Labour Party leader and businessman A.S.P. Liyanage has urged the IGP to launch an investigation with regard to reports that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had stashed away gold and cash packed in polythene bags inside a swimming pool at the Peacock Mansion in Rajagiriya, which belongs to Mr. Liyanage.
When the mansion was prepared to be gifted to Mr. Rajapaksa, several changes in the mansion had been made according to architects’ instructions, including filling the swimming pool with sand.
Following the rumours on hidden cash and gold, Mr. Liyanage had requested the IGP for an investigation
“The stories had become a mental distress to him and his family members,” he said.
