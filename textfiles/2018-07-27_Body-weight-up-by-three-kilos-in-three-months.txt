A leading politico has reportedly increased his body weight by record three kilos within three months in his new high office.

 


Accounting for the top team member’s rapid growth in girth, a close aide said that since assuming duties in his new portfolio he had   occasion to make official visits to many places where he had to taste multiple delicacies and novel culinary delights. 


During a recent official visit to a state establishment in the South, this politico had to enjoy, among other things, fruit juice including that of wood apple, king coconut water, Kurakkan soup and jumbo peanuts.


“He has to taste at least a little bit of what is served. These things have expanded both his palate and the waistline,” the aide added.
