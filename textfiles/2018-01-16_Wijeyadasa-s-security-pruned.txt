Former justice minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s security has been reduced by recalling five of of seven officers of the ministerial security detail.

MP Rajapakshe said the security officers had been recalled even without informing him.

“No prior notice was given about a reduction on the security detail. When I inquired from the Ministerial Security Division (MSD) Chief as to what had happened, he said he was instructed by the IGP to leave behind only two officers with me because I’m an MP now. However, when the MSD Chief had asked the IGP whether the security detail of 11 members given to MP Ravi Karunanayke should also be reduced to two, the IGP had told him not to touch Ravi’s security detail,” he said.

Mr. Rajapakshe also claimed that in addition to MSD security, Special Task Force Personnel were also provided to Ministers Faizer Musthapa, Thalatha Athukorale, Mano Ganeshan, Rishad Bathiudeen and MP M.A. Sumanthiran.
