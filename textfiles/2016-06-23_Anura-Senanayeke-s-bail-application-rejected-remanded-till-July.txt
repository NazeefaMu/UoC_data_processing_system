Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris today rejected the bail application submitted on behalf of former senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera and re-remanded them till July 7.

Counsel Anil Silva, appearing for Mr. Senanayake, said that according to the medical examination carried out by specialist doctor Chula Herath, the suspect had been diagnosed as suffering from the initial stages of cancer and has to be further examined under the supervision of his specialist doctor.

The Magistrate, having considered the medical report submitted by Dr.Herath, directed the Prison Authorities to have Mr. Senanayake examined by a JMO for the purpose of checking his medical condition.

The former DIG was arrested on May 23 in connection with the killing of former Havelock’s rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
