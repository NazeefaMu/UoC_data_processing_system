Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, one of the key activists in President Maithripala Sirisena’s election campaign, today said that they didn’t ask for the 100-day programme.
“We in fact suggested six months to deliver promises given to the people,” he said. 
Holding a news conference at Naga Viharaya in Kotte, the Head of the National Movement for Social Justice, Ven. Sobitha Thera said their movement's opinion was to make the reforms within six months of time but the political parties including the UNP opted for the 100-day programme.
"We didn’t ask for 100 days. The government could take until next April to deliver its promises as it seems it is running out of time. An election is not the priority at this time. People voted for reforms, which the government should deliver at any cost," he said. 
The Thera said the government should do away with the Preferential Vote System and bring in a new electoral system before a general election.  “This is a must,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
