Anuradhapura district parliamentarian S.M. Chandrasena (UPFA) today threatened to mobilize the masses for a massive protest to be held outside the North-Central Provincial Council unless a joint opposition member was appointed chief minister.

He told the media that a crisis situation had erupted in the NCPC after the removal of K.H. Nandasena from his portfolio.

“Transport Minister S.M. Ranjith has resigned from his portfolio in protest against Mr. Nandasena's removal. Several other ministers and councillors are concerned about the evolving situation. Several UPFA and JO parliamentarians met me with the JO councillors deciding to function independently and are keen to have one of them appointed as chief minister. The appointment of the chief minister should be decided by a majority vote. The government has resorted to undemocratic measures contrary to the policy of good governance. We are not prepared to let them go ahead in this manner," the MP said said. (Dayaratne Abogama)
