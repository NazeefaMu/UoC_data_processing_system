President Maithripala Sirisena did not have had good leadership qualities and therefore should resign from the office, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday.

Addressing a news conference, he said that the President had shown his incapability on numerous occasions and had failed in taking crucial decisions.

“The President seems to be desperate and heartbroken following the negative remarks that have been made by some UNP members recently,” he said.

“Moreover, the way he has acted in the Cabinet meeting held on Tuesday was not something he would have done as the Head of a State.

“Nevertheless, the decision of President Sirisena to walk out of the Cabinet meeting shows that he is incapable of running even a Cabinet meeting. How can a President handle a country, when he is unable to handle a Cabinet meeting?

MP Abeywardena said the only option for President Sirisena was to leave Presidency and resign respectfully without creating further chaos. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
