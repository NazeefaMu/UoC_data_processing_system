IFFC opening dinner

Hameedia recently hosted the opening dinner for the International Film Festival of Colombo for the second consecutive year. The festival took place from November 6 - 11 and was attended by a distinguished gathering of renowned actors, actresses, filmmakers, filmgoers and critics from around the world.
The opening event brought together members of the Film Directors' Guild, festival participants and audience members in an effort to celebrate a new era of Sri Lankan and international cinema. The International Film Festival of Colombo was launched in association with the Okinawa International Movie Festival of Japan, to further promote the development of the film and cinema industry in Sri Lanka. Although Sri Lankan cinema has gained recognition at various independent festivals, the country had not been able to establish an effective film festival of its own. In order to fill this void, the International Film Festival of Colombo was launched to help take Sri Lankan cinema to new heights.
"It was a great honour for us to host the opening dinner for the International Film Festival of Colombo, for the second year. Hameedia has continuously set the benchmark in the fashion industry and is recognized as the leading menswear specialist in Sri Lanka.
"We have a strong association with many international and local events and felt truly proud to extend our support to this important festival. Fashion like cinema is an art and we remain committed to supporting the development of the arts in Sri Lanka and gaining international recognition for our local talent and creativity", Fouzul Hameed Managing Director Fouzul Hameed Hameedia stated.
