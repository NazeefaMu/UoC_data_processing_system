Doctors attached to all Government Hospitals in the Eastern Province warned that they will launch a strike after Thursday (26) unless their demands were met.

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said their members, deployed for work in the East, would resort to a work stoppage due to the failure on the part of the authorities concerned to make their overtime payments.

Addressing a press conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama had instructed officials to pay the arrears before the Sinhala-Hindu New Year and to pay the increase in overtime payments by this May.

However, he said the medical officers in the Eastern Province had not received the arrears in overtime payments so far, adding that he had been informed that it had also become an issue to pay the increase in overtime payments in the coming month due to the negligence of the officials.

Furthermore, the Eastern Province Branch Collaboration had informed the GMOA that there were vacancies in key administration positions at several hospitals in the Eastern Province, thus creating even more problems.

As such the Eastern Province Branch Collaboration had informed the GMOA that it would resort to a work stoppage in the entire Eastern Province if the authorities failed to resolve these issues by April 26. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
