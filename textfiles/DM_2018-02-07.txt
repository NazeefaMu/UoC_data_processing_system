A tall one about a tall one
	

A senior purohita from the upcountry betraying a fighting mood made an explosive revelation while addressing an election rally in the estate sector the other day.

The Yahapalanaya big boss too was present on this occasion.
Lashing out at an unnamed political party bigwig, the purohita accused him of being the kingpin of the racket responsible for distributing heroin to estate workers while being part of yahapalanaya committed to eradicating the menace.
The purohitas hard-hitting expose took everyone on the stage by surprise. And they were sharing their wonderment with each other when another senior politico from the state sector itself revealed the identity of the one accused of the heinous crime; a tall one who has now become the biggest rival to the king rooster who has failed to hold on to the mantle inherited from his grandfather.

Action against ex-CJ Mohan Pieris: BASL expresses concern
	
The Executive Committee and the Bar Council of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement issued today said it had unanimously resolved to view with grave concern the initiation of criminal proceedings against former Chief Justice Mohan Pieris PC and Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz, who is a sitting judge of the Court of Appeal, apparently on the basis of professional advice given by them, in their former capacities as Attorney General and Deputy Solicitor General respectively.
"While we do not in any way intend to obstruct or interfere with the course of Justice or the right of Law enforcement institutions to carry their functions, our concern stems not from the stand point of the individuals concerned, but as a matter affecting the BAR, the independence of the Judiciary, rule of Law and the interests of the public at large.
"It is a trite proposition that an opinion tendered by Counsel alone cannot form the basis of criminal proceedings against them. We wish to emphasize that if Counsel are vulnerable to criminal proceedings in respect of such they would not be able to discharge their functions untrammelled by the threat of criminal action.
"We also wish to stress that unless a charge against a judge involves any moral turpitude such will not in any way undermine the confidence the BAR has in the Judge concerned," the Bar Association said.

Afghan army officers fired  over Kabul military base attack
	

Seven Afghan army officers, including two generals, have been sacked over a deadly attack on a Kabul military base, President Ashraf Ghani said Tuesday, as the Afghan capital braces for further assaults. At least five attackers --gunmen and suicide bombers-- launched the pre-dawn raid claimed by the Islamic State group on January 29, killing 11 soldiers and
wounding 16. Seven high-ranking officers including two generals committed professional negligence. All seven are sacked and referred for further investigations, Ghani said on Twitter after a probe into the incident. 
Ghanis US-backed government is under growing public pressure to improve security in the capital after a series of attacks demonstrated the ability of the Taliban and Islamic State group to strike at the heart of the country. 
Since January 20, militants have stormed a luxury hotel, bombed a crowded street and raided the military compound in Kabul, killing more than 130 people. 
The assaults, including a devastating ambulance bomb attack that killed more than 100 people and wounded hundreds, have left already war-weary citizens grief-stricken and angry as the Taliban and IS escalate their offensives. 
Kabul remains on high alert for more attacks. 
The National Directorate of Security, Afghanistans spy agency, on Tuesday seized a truck it said was carrying two tonnes of material which could be used to make bombs. 
The truck was travelling from Kabul to the northern province of Parwan where the US Bagram airbase is located, an official said.

The JO was vociferous in demanding a debate on the PCoI report. The Betel leaf stalwarts were equally strident in their cry out for the debate. Now both the bond report and the financial crimes report are before the Diyawanna council.

Meanwhile, Number One revealed at an election rally about a secret powwow held with a view to getting the debate postponed.
Number One also referred to a duo that figured in the powwow held in the Borella area.
Following this revelation coming from the highest in the power echelons, the inquisitive ones started inquiries to identify the unnamed duo and they had come up with the goods!
One of them was a big brain behind the Pohottuwa and the other a onetime Green highflyer whose wings have been clipped now, they say.

Legal action would be taken against anyone caught under the influence of liquor when casting their vote at the upcoming Local Government election. This will also be applicable to persons who behave badly and engage in violent activities at polling centres, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
He said such individuals could be arrested in accordance with the provisions in the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance and the Penal Code.
SP Gunasekara warned that the police could also act against candidates who are accompanied by drunkards and individuals with a record of violence to polling and counting centres as aiding and abetting is a criminal offence.
He said that although such candidate, if elected, could lose their electorate if found guilty of any election related offence.
SP Gunasekara added that the police and other law enforcement authorities deployed in and around polling stations and counting centres would be asked to keep a close eye on the conduct of candidates and voters alike and requested all persons concerned to help to hold a peaceful LG election.

Author of vote-buying rumour chastised
	

A Diyawanna member from the main alliance of the North phoned up Number One the other day to make a serious complaint against the sole Blue party member from the North who had made it to Diyawanna through the charity list.

The main alliance member told Number One that the Blue one Rama had accused his alliance members of obtaining a hefty santhosam from yahapalanaya as the price for their vote for the last annual Budget. We came to the rescue of the government at a time when it needed our support most. If your own members make accusations of this nature to disparage us, how can we consider supporting the government in future he asked Number One.
After thanking the alliance one for bringing the matter to his notice, Number One gave Rama a severe tongue-lashing capping it with the warning of zero tolerance for any act of misconduct on his part in future, they say.

The better half of a purohita who sweated much to usher in yahapalanaya has made it a practice to go about with elite security escorts in front and behind in regal fashion, they say.

The family of this purohita representing a district not far from the city is deeply involved in politics.
The imperious behavior of this fair one has raised many an eyebrow and the government sympathizers themselves ask whether her conduct is in keeping with the norms of yahapalanaya.

Cant form Govt. with the corrupt: President
	
Addressing the last SLFP rally for the forthcoming local government elections held today (7) in Polonnaruwa President Maithripala Sirisena said he does not wish to form a government with corrupt politicians from any party.
While stating that he left the Rajapaksa Government in 2014 due to fraud and corruption, President Maithripala Sirisena today said he was surprised at the way the incumbent Government was behaving.
President Sirisena said had decided not to form a Government with fraudsters. I have taken a clear policy decision not to form a Government with such parties-be it the former regime or the present one, he said.
He said his plan after leaving the Mahinda Rajapaksa government in 2014 was to engage in clean politics. But I became disillusioned after the new government was formed to see what was taking place in the highest echelons of power and this has made me even more determined to form my own government that does not include corrupt politicians, the President said.
He thanked the people of Polonnaruwa for attending the final rally of the SLFP in such great numbers and said no one from outside the Polonnaruwa District was brought to the meeting.
It is the people of Polonnaruwa that I owe so much for my journey into politics. You are all gathered here to ensure a massive victory for the SLFP and the UPFA at the February 10 local government election, he said.
First we have to identify the problems we are facing today. The UNPs election theme is let us develop the village. Mahinda Rajapaksa wants people to vote for them in order to protest against the present government's inability to manage the economy and the country.
But as SLFPers we ask for your vote to develop the country and the village with a well disciplined, cultured generation of politicians.
He asked the people to vote for the party and to support the SLFP as it works for a better future. Our symbol for Polonnaruwa and several other districts is the hand. In Colombo and the Badulla District the symbol we are using is the betel leaf. In the hill country we are affiliated with Mr. Thondamans party and contest under the symbol of the rooster. In the east the SLFP and Mr. Attaullahs party contest as an alliance and our symbol is the horse.
During my recent visit to Jaffna the Tamil people and the Muslims expressed their support for our victory, the President said. He requested the whole country to rally round him to help him fight corruption and develop the country. (K.G. Karunaratne)

BEIJING AFP Feb6, 2018 -

The big boss in yahapalanaya at his recent election rally in the gem city extended an open invitation to the Pohottuwa faction team up with the Betel leaf group to form a government of their own.

Intrigued by this invitation on the eve of an election, the former strongman had phoned up the friendly senior purohita based in the gem city to inquire into the nitty-gritties of the invitation.
The senior purohita had explained that a group of 20 members had given an undertaking to throw in their lot with the Betel leaf in the event of the two factions getting together to make up the headcount of 96 and the big boss had made the invitation on the strength of the undertaking given by the group of 20.
The former strongman had greeted this explanation with a derisive guffaw and quipped: Thats yet another bouncer given the election is close at hand!

## Title: Lets not forget the 3 million disabled voters

Lets not forget the 3 million disabled voters
	
Come 10th of February, as many as 15.8 million Sri Lankans will be eligible to elect 8,293 members to 24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils and 276 divisional councils. 
Colossal economic and social waste plague the country in untold proportions. 
It is thus imperative for all local Government bodies to identify root causes and enforce a plan of remedial action. 
Two prerequisites here are: (i). Arresting the waste of human talent and instead mobilizing this asset and (ii). Minimising unwanted dependency through inclusion, empowering and equal opportunity. 
Almost all of us will spend some of our time living with deficiency in ability: moving, seeing, physical coordination, etc. 
Sri Lanka has a fastest ageing population - 16% of it will soon be over 65 years.
The way a country treats its disabled population is an internationally recognized measure of a countrys good governance
A wide and diverse range of our population - at least 20% - continue to cry louder over twenty years concerning their marginalisation, social exclusion and SAFETY and thereby loss of dignity and productive opportunities in day-to-day life. 
On 30th March 2007 Sri Lanka signed the UN Convention for the protection of the rights of disabled persons. 
Accessibility is a key HUMAN RGHTS Issue and one of the eight pillars on which this convention stands. 
Hence, Mayors and local councillors must recognise and respect: Accessibility for All is not an option but indispensable.
Practices in issuing certificates of conformity by Local Government bodies concerning ALL PARTS of buildings the public needs to use in daily life often, still, VIOLATE THE SUPREME COURT ORDERS of 27 April 2011.
Such injurious action is not only a violation of a Human Rights issue and non-compliance with the UN Convention, but also end-up DISABLING society  a major setback to the mega-polis agenda.
Mayoral and other candidates must realise the colossal waste of human talent and potential - the countrys greatest resource - through exclusion. 
They also must implement on fast track, plans for complying with the legislation that all members of Parliament have unanimously approved on 20th March 2007.
Result of their injurious actions Naming only a few here. 
None of the rooms and ballrooms in many 5 star hotels and not a single ward in just opened hospitals, even in Colombo, amazingly have EVEN ONE ACCESSIBLE TOILET! Even in Megapolis territories, hardly any ATM machine, Supermarket, Educational institution, Sports complexe and glamorous posh Restaurant can be accessed and used even by those affected by debilitating medical conditions. 
Victims here are the eligible voters and their ability restricted children - not fewer than three (3) Million in number - the inevitable accidents, numerous debilitating medical conditions, wear and tear of the body, etc., and the 30 years of war, have been robbed of their abilities to see, walk, climb or even stand steadily, to a greater or lesser extent, permanently or temporarily.
Rights of voters to enjoy education, employment, shopping, recreation, tourism and travel, therefore are often denied by Local Government bodies - overlooking their LEGAL OBLIGATIONS and Social Responsibility. 
Often these critical shortcomings also pose SAFETY HAZARDS.
More than one in six voters are thus often unable to ensure for themselves the necessities of day-to-day life.
But, still, rightly built facilities could reverse this trend to a significant degree!
Malady of forgetting the largest minority.
A Mayor elected on 10th February shall be the leader of that local body. There are also the organisers appointed by top leaders of all main political parties. 
Indeed it is a national tragedy that hardly any of these 8,293 men and women seeking our votes to be our leaders of tomorrow, see this countrys largest minority group  a huge voting base when their families too are added.
The measures required to comply with legislation are low cost and easily feasible.
As violators of SC orders are often backed by political powers, Local Government bodies shamelessly tend to succumb and allow violators to go free; the victims must either plead and earn the good-will of violators or suffer further!
10 eyeopening points for NEW Local Government bodies
(1). The Supreme Court has recognised the unlawful playing with precious human life causing safety hazards. 
They have ruled that failure to refrain from issuing certificates of conformity where there is anything less than FULL COMPLIANCE with its 2011 April orders, shall be considered as a serious punishable offence attracting punitive repercussions, including for Mayors and Commissioners. 
PLEASE NOTE: Any violation through failure for compliance, Supreme Court gives the liberty to ANYONE to file a motion under its given order SCFR 221/2009.
(2). Access for all really means Access to Justice which can no more be delayed under a true and truthful good governance! 
(3). Local bodies should respect the fact that, The way a country treats its disabled population is an internationally recognized measure of a countrys good governance and a far more telling indicator of societys development than GDP. 
(4). The Mayor and his/her team, on a high priority basis, should establish a workable mechanism for the EFFECTIVE enforcement and implementation of legislation to prevent issuing of C.O.Cs to facilities failing to comply totally. 
It is equally crucial to make the public clearly aware of such measures in advance. 
(5). New and renovated buildings (even on rent or lease)  toilets in particular - the NEWLY ELECTED Local Government bodies should immediately be looking at for compliance, includes following essential facilities the public need to use in daily life: 
All Star Hotels and places of tourist attractions, Restaurants, Institutions of secondary and tertiary education and vocational training, Wards and Counters in Hospitals, Banks, Sports Stadia, ALL Government and Private Sector facilities at up-coming cities, towns, basic urban infrastructures and; services - including train and bus facilities - within MEGAPOLIS and Port City Territories 
(5). Business leaders should be reminded of the fact: Safety and Inclusion of all customers by physical design is paramount for the growth of businesses and to maximize its potential. 
(6). In working closely with the Ministry of Tourism, the star-status awarding procedures to Hotels must be remedied immediately making compliance with accessibility legislations  NOT IN BITS and PIECES but - in total - mandatory. 
We witness fast growing ability restricted senior touring populations of the world demand their right for equal access. 
With their high spending potential, they are an unrecognized, but growing niche - certainly an overlooked growth market here. BUT that requires tourist establishments and essential facilities truly meeting accepted design standards.
Hence, **accessibility in tourism**, ALL hoteliers must be re-told, is an indispensable economic element.
(7). Most of the accident victims continue to find physical access to courts a nightmare. Therefore Local Government bodies should ensure all new and renovated Court Complexes comply with Supreme Court Orders for accessibility. 
(9). To make these crucial initiatives a meaningful reality, at least Municipal Councils, must enforce a system of **independent** physical audits and checks to establish compliance with accessibility legislations.
 Expert Accessibility Advisors
Accessibility experts perform a highly responsible specialised job, involving money, time and effort concerning precious human life. 
It requires a good in-depth understanding of intricacies, years of practical experience and thorough working knowledge beyond text-book material. 
It is NOT one where standards and specifications can just be read and applied.
Looking at reality proves that, absence of the services of experienced accessibility experts is a very costly blunder that fuels social exclusion and loss of business opportunities and good name.
Hence, at least the municipal councils and major urban councils, very much need now the services of Accessibility experts as advisors.
Fervent last hope
We still hope that this article will be an 11th hour EYE OPENER to all Mayoral Candidates and their teams.
May they make clear public announcements indicating PROPOSED PLAN OF ACTION on FAST TRACK so that for the fast increasing biggest minority group of voters, the degree of their mobility should no more be a disadvantage caused by physical and architectural barriers and thereby everyday activities should no more become a daunting task to accomplish with safety and with dignity.
Remember, although the largest minority, they have NO VOICE in Parliament or even in local government bodies to be formed. 
At least all Municipal Councils should have ONE independent council member  a disabled - APPOINTED by the Mayor to rectify this major shortcoming. 
(Dr. Ajith C. S. Perera - A former senior manager in industry - was left instantly a Paraplegic for life by a fallen way side tree in 1992. Undeterred by this personal adversity he has bounced back to serve humanity as a widely experienced and highly competent accessibility advisor and accessor - as has been befittingly recognised by reputed bodies overseas. Since 2004 he has also been the pioneer campaigner for Accessible Tourism in Sri Lanka. For further information seehttp://goo.gl/3FWyW)

Maldives opposition leaders fight back on social media
	

As security forces surrounded his home shortly after a state of emergency had been declared in the Maldives, 80-year-old ex-president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom deftly hit social media to tell the world of his impending arrest. The government quickly sought to control the flow of information out of the holiday islands following its declaration of emergency late Monday night. 
However, Gayoom, opposition politicians and even the Supreme Court gave a blow-by-blow account of the dramatic events via Twitter, Periscope and other social media platforms. 
Moments after posting a tweet stating that a large number of police had converged on his home, Gayoom calmly delivered a live video message that was aired by an opposition politician on her Periscope account. 
Right now, police are here to arrest me. I remain steadfast in my resolve, Gayoom said in a
quiet voice. 
 When the Maldives top judge was arrested on Tuesday, officials from the Supreme Court similarly fought back via social media.

New speed-detecting systems on expressways from Feb.14
	
A new speed-detecting system will be setup on Expressways from February 14, so that speeding drivers could be fined at the exit points, Expressway Operation Maintenance And Management Division said.
Southern Expressway Deputy Director R.A.D. Kahatapitiya told Daily Mirror these steps were taken to curtail the increasing number of accidents on the expressways involving speeding vehicles.
With the use of the new speed-detecting system, the vehicles will be compelled to maintain a speed limit 100 kmph and the drivers of vehicles exceeding the limit will be fined, he said.
Mr. Kahatapitiya said drivers found exceeding the 100kmph speed limit would be given a photograph taken at the time the vehicle had exceeded the speed limit and fined.
He said the photograph would include the vehicle number, observed time and the speed at the time. The new system is capable of capturing these details even at night.

Mr. Kahatapitya said though they were aware that several drivers were known to exceed the speed limit, they were not equipped with a sufficient number of speed detectors nor did they function at night. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Quick action important but legal process time consuming: Eran
	
Quick action should be taken against former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran but it would take time because of the legal process in Sri Lanka, which is a time consuming one, State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne said today.
State Minister Wickramaratne told a media briefing today that action would be taken against Mahendran upon the warrant issued against him by the Court.
We hope that quick action would be taken against Mahendran but it is not possible because of the legal system in Sri Lanka, which is a time consuming one, the State Minister said.
However, he said action against all wrongdoers would be expedited with the Special Courts, which would be established in August this year.
Mr Wickramaratne also said that action should have been taken against Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius and CEO Kasun Palisena months ago.
I am a person who called for a probe on the bond issue right from the beginning. We were of the opinion that the bond scam has begun before 2015 and this has been confirmed by the Presidential Commission which carried out investigations, he added.
He said people should focus on the Presidential Commission on Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) report as well because it had made several serious recommendations.
The PRECIFAC report had faulted several members of the Rajapaksa family and former Ministers. One cannot afford to ignore this report as it was presented to President by a Commission, which comprises prominent legal experts including the incumbent Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Supreme Court Judges Anil Gunaratne, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, and retired Auditor General Sarath Mayadunne. The acts of corruption revealed in PRECIFAC report worth billions as well, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Ravi faults Marapana Committee
	
Says similar to'Kekille rajuge nadu thinduwa'
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday slammed the Marapana Committee saying it has made a 'Kekille rajuge nadu thinduwa' by recommending that he should be removed from the post of UNP's assistant leader.
He said this during the debate on the presidential commission reports in Parliament.
I like to tell the UNPers that they should not destroy leaders but should work towards creating good leaders," the MP said and added that UNPers will give a good answer to those who are trying to destroy party leaders and would tell the people to vote for UNP on February 10 2018.
Past leaders of the UNP were destroyed in different ways. Dudley Senanayake was subjected to mudslinging. President Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake were shot dead but this had not destroyed the party," he said.
The MP said the facts included in the statement by President Maithripala Sirisena after he received the bond commission report were distorted and in this context what was stated in the bond commission report was that legal action should be taken against him if he had done anything wrong.
He said the commission report had stated that there was no evidence to suggest that he had given any advice to the Central Bank and that the central Bank and commercial banks were not under his purview during the time that the controversial bond issue took place.
The commission report has never recommended any legal action against me. Therefore this distortion is a result of a conspiracy. I won't accuse the President of distorting facts. However my problem is to find out who is behind this conspiracy," the MP said and claimed that he was subjected to harsh questioning by the bond commission.
He said he was waiting to raise a privilege issue after the President's public statement and the publishing of the bond commission report but the conspirators prevented that as well.
This is a political assassination and one has to question good governance," the MP said and blamed certain sections of the media which were being used by the conspirators.
Conspiracies are natural as even the Buddha had to face such conspiracies," he said.
While recalling that he had upheld the practice of good governance, he said heresigned from his ministerial post even though he had played a leading role in bringing the yahapalana government into power. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Scuffle mars the powwow
	

A top level conference of a minority political party with a strong voter base in the East held in a leading hotel in a distant city ended on a discordant note when a heated exchange between two party heavyweights culminated in near-fisticuffs, they say.

The two antagonists were the political head of a province and a Diyawanna member from a district in the East. The scuffle had broken out in the presence of the party leader and the party seniors present had quickly intervened and separated the belligerent duo heading off a serious fight, they say.
However, one party to the incident is set to file a law suit against the other citing a charge relating to a love affair.

Weve extended our fullest cooperation during investigations
	
This special interview with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe centres around the forthcoming Local Government Elections and the current political situation in the country.
Excerpts: 
Was there transparency like now
	Now it appears that the talk on frauds committed by the Rajapaksas has been set aside
	Our aim is to keep on increasing our votes at every election
	We have never received a black mark
	The UNP is striving to win a majority stake
	The two parties joined together to rule the country and not to fight during elections
	Our first attempt is to establish a Govt. answerable to Parliament
	The UNP is striving to win a majority stake
	Every party is faced with a problem of independent groups contesting in electorates
Q Its just a few days before the elections. Shall we start on that topic What will happen at the elections, Mr Prime Minister 
Now the election heat is on. Casting of votes would be in the region of 50 to 60%. Even last time it was around 50%. The candidate who can muster the largest number of supporters to cast their votes would win. Judging from the present trend I can say that the UNP is ahead of all other parties. All signs indicate that we will secure more power. 
Q Though you say this, there are many serious allegations levelled at the UNP presently. Do you think it will be easy 
Despite all these there is every possibility that we will gain power. This election is held under a new system. It is the first time an election is held under that system. During this election one needs to observe what the result would be under the Electoral and Preferential System. Every party is faced with a problem of independent groups contesting in electorates where the recognized parties nomination lists were rejected. The more you attempt to limit their influence, we gain. 
Their votes would be split among the two groups. At the same time there will be votes that would not be cast for these two groups. There is a keen competition among these two groups. We arent hoping to receive these votes as a result of the split
Q Some observe that the split in the SLFP will favour the UNP. Are you also anticipating this 
Their votes would be split among the two groups. At the same time there will be votes that would not be cast for these two groups. There is a keen competition among these two groups. We arent hoping to receive these votes as a result of the split. The UNP is striving to win a majority stake.These two groups were together during the last election, but we obtained more votes. It is a temporary manifestation that the split in the SLFP is beneficial to the UNP. Our aim is to keep on increasing our votes at every election. 
Q Despite you saying that the UNP is increasing its vote base at every election, some are expressing the view that with the Central Bank Bond Scam the Elephant has lost its balance and fallen flat.Your comments 
The alleged Central Bank Bond Scam has been discussed over the past two years. It is I who started the investigations regarding this allegation. I handed over the matter to the Parliament and when it was being probed, an opposition MP was appointed to head the COPE. When they issued their report it was sent to the Attorney General. They had recommended that a different machinery be set up to investigate into Perpetual Treasuries. When the President appointed a commission to look into this matter we agreed. I also gave evidence before the commission. We displayed transparency. The Attorney General informed that he is acting on the recommendations of the commission. Weve extended our fullest cooperation during investigations. We never made any unnecessary intervention in this matter. The Commission had noted that Perpetual Treasuries had earned an undue profits while a loss of Rs 600 million had been incurred. The total figure estimated by them is Rs 9 Billion. As a result of our actions, funds worth Rs 12 Billion in the account of Perpetual Treasuries have been retained. The loss could be recovered by taking action in keeping with the recommendations of the commission. 
Q Despite what you say, it is apparent that it isnt easy to get rid of the black mark on the UNP. Your comments 
We have never received a black mark. During this issue we displayed transparency. If we did not act in that manner there would have been many more issues. Despite having power we didnt attempt to hush up the matter. You must well remember how the former government acted during similar situations. Was there transparency like now The black mark you refer to is the creation of the media. The media is bent on attacking the UNP. 
Q What were your reasons for appointing Arjuna Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank. 
He was appointed as he satisfied the requirements for the post. But with the surfacing of this incident we took necessary action. These actions are now duly proceeding in a transparent manner. If any irregularities had taken place anywhere the whole country could now what happened. We will never allow room for fraud and corruption, nor support such activities. 
Q Are you attempting to put the entire blame on Ravi Karunanayake The Thilak Marapona Committee had recommended that Ravi Karunanayake be stripped of his position of Deputy Leader of the party. 
There is no such thing. No UNP member is connected to the alleged Bond Scam and none of them are responsible. We accept the commission report. Former Minister Karunanayakes issue is connected with the evidence given by him before the Commission. The commission has recommended that a final decision has to be taken by the Attorney General, Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption. We await its decision. Injustice wont be caused to anyone. Everyone is equal before the law and necessary steps would be taken as required. 
The highest amount of investments came in 2017. We received 1  Billion. We know how investors were treated during the Rajapaksa Government. The investors had to meet the President or a Minister to commence work. Now it is through the Board of Investments that they commence work

Q Even for President Maithripala Sirisena the best trump card on the election platforms had been the Bond Scam. Prior to January 08th 2015 you all were vociferous in slating the Rajapaksas as thieves, but now it appears that the talk on frauds committed by the Rajapaksas has been set aside. What has happened to the investigations now 
We have traced a number of acts of fraud committed during the Mahinda Rajapaksa era. The President speaks about them during election meetings. He also speaks about the Bond Scam. The issue is why the media always highlights what he says about the Bond Scam and not what he says about the Rajapaksas. Even the President asked me about this. I dont know why they do it. You should know better than me what the reasons are. The media isnt depicting the correct position. We wonder whether the media is attempting to portray that there is a big dispute between me and the President and also whether they are not taking the maximum out of the freedom given to them. 
Q Do you infer that President Maithripala Sirisena, whom you and your group installed in office after making many sacrifices and fighting a severe battle, is not criticising the UNP Or is it mere deception 
This is a common thing thats happening on election platforms. They criticize us and we criticize them. The two parties joined to rule the country and not to fight during elections. During an election we must safeguard the identity of our party. This happens in other countries as well. They come together to govern, but fight elections separately. Both parties believe in this type of strategy. This is no deception. 
Q President Sirisena invited the Joint Opposition to join him in forming a SLFP Government and requested them to visit his house to have further discussions. If that happens how will it affect the UNP Has the President had enough being with the UNP and governing the country 
This Government will remain as it is. Nothing will happen to it. We will wait and see whether the invited groups are coming. We may have to appoint them also as Ministers. There is no alternative. Anyway I read (In the newspaper) that Mahinda Rajapaksa isnt willing to come. 
Q Minister Lakshman Kiriella had said that regardless of whether anyone wins or loses, allocations will be made only to those local bodies which are controlled by the UNP. Its the Prime Minister who allocates funds. Are things going to take place in the manner in which Kiriella has implied If its so its going to be a questionable issue. Your response 
We have several projects. Funds are allocated accordingly. Some dont accept them. We will work with those who accept these allocations. If we secure power the allocation of funds would be done much easily. Other than this no one would be left out. Even provincial councils had been allocated money. If there are alternate good proposals, we could consider them as well. 
Q Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa asks where the investors are as promised. He says that some investors have withdrawn from these projects according to information he has received. 
The highest amount of investments came in 2017. We received 1  Billion. We know how investors were treated during the Rajapaksa Government. The investors had to meet the President or a Minister to commence work. Now it is through the Board of Investments that they commence work. None of us demand commissions. We never ask arriving investors to meet us first. This was the habit during the Rajapaksa Government. 
Q There are many who are giving serious thought to what the future holds when the term of this Government concludes. There are many who are making forecasts. Mr. Prime Minister what will actually happen
Were moving ahead to obtain majority power at the Parliamentary Elections. After that we will form a government by ourselves. 
Q Are you going to come forward as a candidate at the next Presidential elections 
Our party, TNA and the JVP agreed before the Presidential Elections to abolish the Executive Presidency and work for a power sharing system without damaging the Unitary state concept. We are rooted firmly on that stand. Other parties arent taking the same stand. Those in the Pohottuwa hadnt intimated their standing on this matter, while the SLFP says they are against the abolition of the Executive Presidency. We hope to discuss further in this regard. Our first attempt is to establish a Government answerable to the Parliament and focus on what powers should be given to the President. We would agree in due course about the most suitable decision we should arrive at. 
Q The opposition always claims that the manner in which you accepted the post of Premier was unacceptable and that you had no moral right to accept this post. Your comments 
In our Election Manifesto we mentioned that I would become the Prime Minister and the people voted for us knowing this well. During the presidential elections we wanted to dissolve Parliament. No one expected Maithripala Sirisena to appoint someone from the alliance as the Prime Minister after he assumed duties as president. That can never happen. 
Q While President Sirisena keeps taking swipes at the UNP and blaming it on election platforms how is it that you continue to keep your balance and stay calm
He says what he has to say and I say what I have to say. 
Q Are the UNP backbenchers criticising the President with your knowledge 
We have told them not to engage in public criticism. Some are responding to matters raised by the President. We advise them not to criticise because though we have split during the elections this Government has to continue. We have admonished those who exceed the limits of criticism. 
Q It was believed that the UNP has veterans in the field of Economics, but recently the President announced that Economic development during the past three years under the UNP has failed and therefore he intends taking it over.Your comments
These comments werent aimed at frustrating us. Only the UNP has the capability to deal with economics. The Economy of the country has advanced. The president says that the progress is not sufficient. I too discussed this matter with him. We are ready to discuss this matter further at the National Economic Council. It is not an issue for us. 
Q Those UNP party members who slave for the progress of the party say that they have been overlooked and it is only a dream for them to expect state employment.What do have to say to this
We are continuing to assist everybody, but there are priorities. We are aware that we could not provide them all with jobs. There are jobs in the state sector and our aim is to increase the intake of labour by the private sector. 
We are continuing to assist everybody, but there are priorities. We are aware that we could not provide them all with jobs. There are jobs in the state sector and our aim is to increase the intake of labour by the private sector
Q The artistes and civil society members who were in the forefront of setting up this Government are now frustrated about the regime because of your lacklustre attitude towards arts and culture. 
There were a large number of Artistes and those involved in cultural activities. They wanted a free country. We have given it. We have directed our attention to all cultural activities. The understanding we built up with them is still there. The activities centred around the Culture Hub based in Colombo are continuing and we are now in search of allocations. By this no Sri Lankan cultural activity will be threatened. We continue to support our traditional cultural activities. In other countries these activities are highly patronized by the private sector. 
Q Are you content with the attention given by you to the education and health sectors
There are many changes envisaged in the field of education. Earlier most of it was highly politicized. Now there are ministers who are well informed and keen on bringing new proposals. It will take about three to four years to realize the fruits of these projects. 
Q People believe that the UNP doesnt gain publicity despite what it is doing. Your response
We have that defect and we accept it. The individual Ministries should take the responsibility. Our attention has been drawn towards this and action is been taken to rectify it. 
Q Do you browse the Face Book and other Social Media
Yes when ever time permits. I remain in the correct position in every situation. There is no offence in dancing a bit during a party!
Q What are your future ambitions as the Leader of the UNP 
Before we think of the future we should deal with the present situation. Its now only that the second generation of leaders is being formed. They will secure more responsibility in the party in due course. A capable person would emerge as the leader. Patience and experience are necessary leadership qualities. 
Q Are you frustrated about the fact that you were Prime Minister on four occasions, but never the President 
No nothing of that sort. Every time I became Prime Minister I have performed well.

Where children  are the centre of attention
	
The Montessori method is based on a very deep understanding of the child as it is and not as adults imagine how it should be
What is the Montessori method of education and how does it work is a pertinent question asked with regard to teaching kids. Help me to do it for myself a simple explanation of the montessori method of education. 
This quotation aptly captures what the Montessori method of education aims at and what we aim to do for the children in our school. 
The Montessori method is different from all others. It is based on a realistic balance between freedom and structure, specifically designed for the young child. We aim at providing a pleasing environment with carefully devised materials that meet the childs natural needs. We provide overall guidance through experienced and trained teachers whom we call the directresses. 
The montessori provides the child with a strong base during his/her formative years. This helps in the developing of the individuals to be happy, well-rounded, responsible and a fulfilled person. 
Many of the characteristics which young children have were observed by Dr. Maria Montessori during her initial contact with children. As a result of her observations, she devised a system of early childhood education that was specifically designed to meet the need of the child. Her methods, material and exercises all accord with what the child wants and needs. Hence the Montessori method can help the child to grow in many ways as it actually caters to the inner needs of the child. 
Dr. Maria Montessori devised a whole environment designed to help the child to gain a holistic development. The Montessori environment in our classroom is the childs real teacher.
Maria Montessori was born in Italy in 1870. She became the first woman doctor in Italys history. Her early work was with retarded and poor children. Through close observation and experiment, the system that she devised enabled these deprived children to attain levels of learning normally associated with average children. Her great triumph came when her retarded pupils took state examinations with normal children and passed! The educational establishment of the day was compelled to recognise a breakthrough. 
A sensible system 
Her method became known all over the world. Many countries have adopted them into their own educational systems. Today, there is renewed interest in her system in the United Kingdom. The failures of more traditional methods of education are becoming more and more apparent. The Montessori way offers a sensible, structured system that lets the child develop at his or her own pace. The method uses the individuals ability to the full, with guidance coming from the directress (teacher), who uses specially designed Montessori material. 
The Montessori system has three main parts: The child, the environment and the directress. 
Its correct that the child should be at the very centre of any system of early education. The Montessori method is based on a very deep understanding of the child as it is and not as adults imagine how it should be. This method allows the child to learn in the way that he/she finds easiest and most natural. Basically doing things on your own teaches the individual to be independent from a small age. Within certain limits the child can choose work that appeals to his/her own inner interests. He/she can exercise his/her sense of freedom and spontaneity. The individual can feel joy and enthusiasm in learning because he or she is doing what he or she wants to do and not what someone has asked thestudents to do. 
Gradually, the child builds up a strong sense of independence, coupled with an ability to sustain concentration. The individuals self-confidence grows as his range of skills increases. The Montessori method is founded upon the childs natural curiosity and the love of learning, instilling a Life song motivation for continuous learning, which will stand him in good stead for the rest of his life. The method also helps the child to stay in touch with his natural growth of development. This avoids forcing him/her to do anything for which he/she is not ready, whilst encouraging him/her to attempt new things as his/her ability increases. In this way we ensure that every child can set its own pace and progress as far and as fast as the individual wishes to. Every child is treated as the individual he or she undoubtedly is and the process of leaning becomes neither boring or frustrating. 
Holistic development 
Dr. Maria Montessori devised a whole environment designed to help the child to gain a holistic development. The Montessori environment in our classroom is the childs real teacher, since the child will teach himself/herself through the use of a wide range of scientifically researched and prepared Montessori material. They are child-sized, attractive, simple and often self- correcting. This helps him/her to correct himself/herself if an error is made. Hence it is not necessary for an adult to point out the mistake. By correcting his/her own mistake independently, without adult interference, the child gains self-esteem. Because the child is free to choose his/her own work within a structured and prepared environment and do it at his/her own pace, he can discover his/her own world and build his/her mind and body. The classroom is not a competitive place to prove himself/herself to others hence he/she has many opportunities for success. 
In our Montessori classroom children of varying ages are socially grouped together. The ages usually range from two and a half years to six. This helps the younger children to learn from the older children and also affords the older children the opportunity to reinforce their own knowledge by helping the younger ones. This way of grouping is called vertical grouping. The classroom becomes an extension of his/her own family home. This is a sound and realistic way of helping social development, confidence and responsibility. The children learn to work independently and with one another and are able concentrate and persevere in their learning. This is possible as the children are provided with guidelines for self-discipline in the form of ground rules, which are easy to understand and easy for them to remind each other to follow. 
Within this prepared environment, Dr. Montessori clearly observed that the role of the adult is to direct the childs activity, rather than actually teach in the formally understood sense. Therefore a teacher in a Montessori classroom is called a directress. 
A directress has many jobs to do. Unlike the teacher in a conventional class, she/he is very rarely the centre of attention. Often she/he is hardly noticed among children at work. She/he has no desk and spends much of her/his time working with children at child-sized tables or on a rug. Her/his experience and training makes her/him a very keen observer of children and aware of each childs fundamental needs of development. The directress job is to find the right response from within the resources available in the classroom. This enables the directress to support each childs development to its fullest. Through the directress observations she/he is able to guide the child by introducing him/her to the materials, through presentations to reach from one level of complexity to another. Having expanded the childs repertoire in this way, she/he will often leave the child with the new material to work with on his/her own, while the directress herself/himself will return to making observations of the class. 
The directress only intervenes only when it is absolutely necessary. She/he is a friendly helper and a guide, who is there when needed by the child. Above all, she/he is someone who helps the child to do things for himself. Thus the simple explanation of the Montessori method of education. Help me to do it for myself.
Applications called for Montessori Teacher Training
AMI Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Centre, the only AMI authorized Montessori training Course in Sri Lanka, is now in the process of calling for application for its Diploma Course (two years). At the end of of the course successful candidates are offered an internationally recognized diploma from the Association Montessori Internationale in the Netherlands. The course is conducted both in English and Sinhala languages. 
Applications can be collected from Montessori Training Centre, St Bridgets Convent, Colombo 7. Further information regarding the course could be obtained by calling 0112697896 (from 8.30 am to 4.00 pm) or by sending an email to mont2638@sltnet.lk or by writing to The Secretary, Montessori Training Centre, St Bridgets Convent, Colombo 7. 
Value of montessori education
Doctor Maria Montessori one of the most important educators of our time, emphasized the need for early education. More recently, educational research has verified that the early years are the most important in the life of a child. 
The importance of the above facts and the growing awareness of the worlds complexities are driving parents to seek a montessori education for their children. More than just an early education, these parents are seeking the best education available. The montessori schools provide a programme especially suited to the needs of the child. The method not only offers individual attention, but sees to the whole development of the child. It also provides the foundation on which the child can build his future, which is so vital for success and happiness. 
Montessori attitudes and philosophy are most consistent with the needs of the child in the process of developing and learning. Montessori educational theories are based on natural laws of development and then correlated for use as an educational system consistent with these laws. Because Dr. Montessoris experiments made the child the centre of education, her programme is adapted to the interests and needs of children.
As a result, children concentrate with enthusiasm and achieve a real and profound understanding of their work. This intellectual progress is accompanied by emotional growth. 
The children become harmonious in movement, work independently and honestly and are helpful to one another. 
The montessori method contains the greatest possibility for flexibility in permitting individual lessons and progress, while still retaining group sessions at no expense to the individual child.

Wi-Fi, the burning issue of the country: MR
	
Former president and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday ridiculed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes renewed pledge that the country would be enabled with free public Wi-Fi by the year end, by saying that having free public Wi-Fi has become the burning issue of the country today.
Mr. Rajapaksa sarcastically said villagers are asking for Wi-Fi instead of fertilizer for their farms.
Wi-Fi is one of the most necessary item of the people today. The most burning issue of the country today, to our people in the village, is not fertilizer or other necessities but Wi-Fi. People are asking for Wi-Fi everywhere. Therefore, the Premier has to provide it. He has said Wi-Fi will help the youth when dating. One cannot even do that in an empty stomach, he told journalist at the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Office yesterday.
When asked as to why he didnt take part in the debate on the bond commissions report and the PRECIFAC report, Mr. Rajapaksa said he would attend the debate on its last day.
I was about to go, but a decision was taken by our party leaders to release me because I have to attend a meeting in Kantale. First we thought the debate will be concluded within a day. Had it been for one day, I would have spoken. Since the debate will be held for three days, I decided to speak on the last day, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
