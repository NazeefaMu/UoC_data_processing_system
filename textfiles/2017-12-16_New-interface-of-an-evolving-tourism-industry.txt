New interface of an evolving tourism industry


	



 

When traced the routes of the tourism industry, it could be found that it was mostly the residents of European countries who had the passion to travel the world. The industry has supposedly evolved in European countries where national and international tourism originated by travelling from one place to another. The people at the time had travelled short distances before moving on to see the sights in neighbouring destinations. There were and there still are a thousand reasons to travel the world. The purpose of travelling is for leisure, to embark on new business ventures, in search of education opportunities or greener pastures, to visit the loved ones or sometimes for religious purposes. After 1950s, people residing outside European nations were encouraged to travel the world with the development of air transportation. This widened world travel and tourism activities. Tourism related businesses started flourishing and today has become the world’s largest and fastest growing service industry.

 


It is noteworthy that Sri Lanka is one of the South Asian countries that has been reviewed by the World Tourism Council. Tourism in Sri Lanka has created its own brand. The creation of niche tourism products like eco-tourism, ayurvedic tourism, adventure tourism, cultural tourism, wildlife tourism and nature tourism widen the net of this service sector. Inbound tourism is booming and the country is going all out to lure more foreign tourists. Contrary to perceptions across the world that tourism in Sri  Lanka is still confined to traditions, the country is opening up with trendy tour packages and at affordable air travel deals to inbound visitors from every segment.

 


The industry provides cultural, medical and business services. It is expected that the sector’s contribution to the national gross domestic product will soar in the upcoming years. The local tourism sector has been flourishing in recent years with the improved and enhanced connectivity to and from the country. Better accommodation facilities at tourist destinations have contributed to augment the number of foreign tourist arrivals. The policies, rules and regulations implemented by the government have also been instrumental in providing the much-needed boost to the industry. Sri  Lanka is able to offer a plethora of tourism options due to its rich bio-diversity. The country boasts of natural resources like sandy beaches, mountains, rivers and rainforests.

 


However, for the booming industry to further contribute to the national economy, focus should be paid on increasing the average spent on per tourist in addition to boosting the arrivals. Sri Lanka tourism is the third large export earner in the country after remittances, textiles and garments. Hence, we have an opportunity to attract more tourists. To achieve this target, we have to identify our strategic potentials to vie with our main competitors, especially those in South Asia. The sluggish progress made by the tourism industry due to poor planning, mismanagement and limited diversity in tourism markets and products, contributes to a lack of value adding opportunities and limiting per capita visitor expenditure.
As a tourist destination, Sri Lanka can compete with other destinations partly because of its unique natural and cultural resources. Therefore, if the tourism industry were to make a significant contribution to the national economy, Sri  Lanka has to focus on promoting new sustainable tourism markets. We need a fresh approach to promote sustainable tourism market segments such as eco-tourism, community-based tourism and green tourism, as they could minimise adverse impacts.

 


The basement of the tourism industry, ‘mass tourism,’ has itself become a massive threat to the country. In a bid to recover damaged environments, most of the countries including Sri Lanka have lately turned to sustainable tourism concepts.
Sri Lanka’s sustainable tourism strategies however may bring significant socio-economic benefits to host communities such as job opportunities, cultural identity, preservation of cultural sites, expansion of educational  opportunities, development of infrastructure facilities and so forth. Therefore, it could be surmised that sustainable tourism is by far the best concept in new tourism market products.
It fulfils a country’s foreign exchange need, conserves its culture, environment and economy and encourages safe travelling. Sri  Lanka claims a competitive edge due to its rich culture, climate and the lifestyle and hospitality of its people. It is however necessary to set up legislation for the government, tour operators, developers, travel agents, workers, host communities and tourists themselves.
