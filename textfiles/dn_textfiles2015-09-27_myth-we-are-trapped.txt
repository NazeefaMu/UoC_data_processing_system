The myth we are trapped in

If only baby Seya Sedewmi was his daughter or even granddaughter and the boy of ten whose limbs were severed and beheaded was his son or grandson would this well meaning, now presumably Australian be preaching to us about Buddhism and Capital Punishment?

Seya Sedewmi 
He abhors the "willful taking of life", this is exactly what these monsters in human form have done, he goes on to say that "it has no place in civilized society and even more preposterous in a Buddhist nation that professes sanctity of all life...". What may we ask, the learned Professor, is the appropriate punishment for the willful taking of another's life which is what these monsters have done, they have willfully and cruelly taken the lives of two innocent children, (we have murders happening on almost a daily basis in our country today). Prof Ubesiri has apparently coined a new phrase "Judicial Murder"! I wonder how he would define 'civilized society'? perhaps one that would allow murderers to lead happy lives at our expense in prisons even after they have taken the lives of others.
Peace and security
As for us being "a Buddhist Nation", that is no doubt an absolute myth--- for the teachings of the Buddha are not practiced; take for example the Karaneeya Metha Sutra in which the Buddha stated "JUST AS A MOTHER WOULD PROTECT HER ONLY CHILD EVEN AT THE RISK TO HER OWN LIFE, EVEN SO MAY WE HAVE BOUNDLESS LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR ALL BEINGS"; 'All beings' are described in the Suthra as follows: "long, short, thin, stout or medium, seen, unseen, born yet to be born, all beings without exception. May all beings be well and happy". The practice of these teachings of the Buddha goes by default. What a wonderful country ours would be only if we practice Buddhism.
Our Buddhism is not 'Prathipathithi Pooja' - (the practice of the teachings) but "Aamisa Pooja" ----or (the practice of rituals). There is no practice of Sila (morality) and Samadhi (Meditation, the control of the Mind) by all our people.
Today the two most important needs of our people are peace and security and it is the foremost duty of the State to ensure that for the people, so that we can build a truly civilized society, for our religions have failed us in their practice. We value the sanctity of life and we must therefore be protected from those who violate the sanctity of our lives.
Criminal justice system
As stated earlier since religions have failed to ensure their practice, and there is no love and compassion for all our fellow beings, 'Capital Punishment' is the only deterrent that would instill fear and shame and ensure peace and security for us all, but I must confess that it does raise many issues: cases drag on for years, and it is no deterrent if the punishment is carried out years after the offence was committed.
I recall a former AG stating that a case of rape of a fourteen-year-old girl had taken 20 years to be concluded and what he said was not an isolated instance --- yes our criminal justice system MUST be completely overhauled, let us in the first instance bring back the Administration of Justice Law which was introduced by the late Felix Dias Bandaranaike which was introduced to overhaul the system and cutout the delays, but had apparently been repealed at the instance of Lawyers who lived on 'Dates'!! Let us have separate courts to hear cases involving children (there is said to be over 260 cases of crimes against children) and women, let us speed up the system and make it meaningful to us all.
