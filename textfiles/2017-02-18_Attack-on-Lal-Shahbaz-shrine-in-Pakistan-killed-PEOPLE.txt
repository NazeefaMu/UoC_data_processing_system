At least 72 people were killed and more than 150 injured in a suicide attack on the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar in Sehwan on Thursday evening.   


“So far 72 people have been killed and more than 150 have been wounded,” Inspector General Police Sindh A.D. Khawaja said.   


“Many of the wounded are in critical condition and they will be shifted to Karachi as soon as navy helicopters and the C-130 plane reach the nearest airport.”   


Medical Superintendant Dr Moinuddin Siddiqui of Sehwan Taluka Hospital confirmed that 61 bodies were received by the hospital.   


“Almost all the bodies were brought here. We have handed over 26 bodies to the heirs of the deceased, while those that remain unidentified are at the hospital,” said Siddiqui   
Deputy Commissioner Munawar Maheesar confirmed the dead included at least four children and 12 women. The Assistant Superintendent of Police in Sehwan said a suicide bomber entered the shrine through its Golden gate. The attacker blew himself up after throwing a grenade, which failed to explode, he added.   


The explosion took place in the area where the dhamaal (a Sufi ritual) was being performed after evening prayers.  A large number of devotees, from different faiths and from across the country, frequent the shrine on Thursdays — a day of spiritual significance in Pakistan’s shrine culture.   
Security for shrines was tightened across the province following the attack.
