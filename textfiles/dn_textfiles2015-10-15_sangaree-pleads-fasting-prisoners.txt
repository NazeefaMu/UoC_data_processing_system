Sangaree pleads for fasting prisoners

TULF General Secretary V. Ananda Sangaree in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested to release detainees who are engaged in a fast unto death in various prisons without any punishment.
He said that these detainees should be released without punishment as they had already served 20 years in jail.
Sanagaree has proposed a procedure through which about 250 detainees in various prisons can be released.
Sangaree through his letter has proposed to select a modern building in one of the prisons with all facilities and have all those prisoners transferred to that building under one set of officers.
"Select few retired judges both male and female and form few panels to inquire each case and to release them accordingly. That the panels are empowered to deal with them and recommended their release,"he said.
Excerpts of the letter:
All these years all the politicians who intervened on behalf of the prisoners claimed them as political prisoners and their claims had been consistently disputed as offenders by the Hon. Minister of Justice. There must be a fixed term of imprisonment as punishment for any offence and there can't be more than 20 years for any offence in the penal code (Exclusive of fines). If they had been detained for 20 years obviously they are over punished.
Your Excellency I am not arguing with you about these cases. I am only pleading with you to deal with their cases wit the sympathy each case deserves.
Recently a judge had discharged a Brahmin woman who had been in prison for over 20 years. If the case had been taken up for disposal 20 years back, she need not have served a long period in jail. Above all Your Excellency, the tradition of the Brahmins is that they can't eat in the presence of others and are governed by many other such rules. Further more, if I have not still reached the level of a lawyer, may I plead with you as a laymen, at least to adopt the following procedure to release them.
Select a modern building in one of the prisons with all facilities and have all those prisoners transferred to the building under one set of officers.
Provide them all facilities that they are entitled to, to make them more comfortable. Select a few retired judges both male and female and form a few panels to inquire each case and to release them accordingly. That the panels are empowered to deal with them and recommended their release. The complicated cases if any can be dealt with by senior lawyers or judges and recommend for release without any punishment since they had already served 20 years in jail.
Please consider how your predecessors tackled various matters including those of combatants. I need not tell you how problems should be solved to a person who can arbitrarily save a person condemned to death.
