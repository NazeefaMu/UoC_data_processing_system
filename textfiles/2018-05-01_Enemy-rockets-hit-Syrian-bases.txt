DAILY MAIL, 30th APRIL, 2018- The Syrian government said its territory has been hit by ‘enemy rockets’ during ‘new aggression’ last night.  


The country’s army said rockets had struck several military bases in the Hama and Aleppo countryside, according to state television.


In a news flash, state television said the missile attacks took place at 10.30pm.


‘Syria is being exposed to a new aggression with some military bases in rural Hama and Aleppo hit with enemy rockets,’ an army source was quoted as saying without elaborating.


Earlier, state television said successive blasts were heard in rural Hama province and that authorities were investigating the cause.


The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) recorded a 2.60-magnitude earthquake in the area after the huge blast.


An opposition source said one of the locations hit was an army base known as Brigade 47 near Hama city, widely known as a recruitment centre for Iranian-backed Shi’ite militias who fight alongside President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war in Syria through activists on the ground, reported loud explosions in the Hama countryside and Aleppo province resulting from missiles targeting a base of the 47th Brigade in Hama that houses Syrian government and allied Iranian forces. 


It also reported missiles hitting positions near the Nairab air base and Aleppo airport. It said the source of the missiles was not immediately known, and had no information on casualties.
