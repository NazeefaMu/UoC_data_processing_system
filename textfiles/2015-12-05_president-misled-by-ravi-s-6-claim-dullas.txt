UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had even misled President Maithripala Sirisena by making false claims about the 2016 Budget allocations.
Mr. Alahapperuma said the President had in a speech at a school recently said that the government had allocated 6 percent of GDP for education based on the Finance Minister’s claims.
“The truth is the government has not allocated 6 per cent of GDP for education. It would have been acceptable if the government had said they couldn't allocate 6 percent for next year, but would do so in the coming years. Instead, the government hoodwinked everyone,” he said, speaking to the media at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre in Borella.
Mr. Alahapperuma said the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera would have been greatly disappointed by the budget as one of the main demands of the National Movement for Social Justice headed by the prelate was the allocation of 6 percent GDP for education.
He added that the SLFP MPs of the joint opposition had voted against the budget as it had violated the basic principles of the SLFP and was based entirely on UNP economic principles. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
