A Brief History of the late Rev. Fr.  Peter Pillai and the founding of the PPSI
	
Peter Alcantara Pillai was born in Wennappuwa on 19th October 1904 to Jacob Pillai a schoolmaster, and Anna Pillai. They originally hailed from Kayts, an islet of the Jaffna peninsula. Four sons of Jacob and Anna Pillai were ordained, priests.
Their eldest son was Fr. Cajetan Pillai (OMI) who offered his services for ministering to the victims of the Colombo plague in the 1920s. Eventually, he succumbed to the plague himself. The next son, Rev. Br. Luke Pillai was director of St Benedicts College. Another son, His Lordship Dr Emilianus Pillai was Bishop of Jaffna. The other son Mr J.L. Stanislaus was the only layman in the family and he worked as Acting Secretary
to the Treasury. 
Rev. Fr. Peter Pillai was the youngest of the five sons of this devout Catholic family. As a young boy, he began schooling in the Tamil medium at the school in Wennapuwa where his father was teaching. 
From an early age, he was an exceptional student. At the age of nine, he started school at St Benedicts College Colombo 13. In 1918 at the age of 14, he passed the Cambridge Junior with eight distinctions thereby ranking first in the island and in 1920 at the age of 16 he passed the Cambridge Senior with distinctions in all subjects. 
This was the highest number of distinctions obtained by any student in the British Empire. He proceeded to Ceylon University College and graduated with BSc First Class Honours. At the age of 20, he passed his B Sc Hon with a double 1st in Mathematics. In 1925 he gained admission to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge where he graduated at the age of 23 in 1927 with a B.A. (Cantab) majoring in an MA and MSc.(London)from University College London. 
His decision to enter the priesthood surprised many, who believed that he could have held prestigious positions in the secular world with his brilliant academic achievements. He entered the Oblates of Mary immaculate order in Belgium at the age of 24 and then the Rome Dominican University where he obtained his PhD in Philosophy and Theology. 

"Some of the highlights of his campaign included the fair treatment of the working class, enforced payment of living wage, establishment of an eight hour working day, unemployment insurance, inauguration of an Employees Provident Fund, improvement of working conditions of offices and shops, alleviation of poverty in urban, rural, plantation and industrial sectors... "
Two years later at the age of 30, he was ordained to the priesthood in Rome and at the age of 32 he obtained his Doctorate in Divinity (Rome). After his sojourn in Rome, he decided to serve his country and therefore returned to Ceylon in 1936. 
His first job was as a member of staff at St. Peters College Bambalapitiya. He was appointed Warden of Aquinas Hall, the University Catholic Students Hostel. He founded the Catholic Social Guild in 1936 and early in the next year the Movement for the Restoration of Social Justice with the journals Social Justice review in English and Samaja Samaya review in Sinhala. Through his articles and discussions, he sought to achieve social justice. 
Some of the highlights of his campaign included the fair treatment of the working class, enforced payment of living wage, establishment of an eight hour working day, unemployment insurance, inauguration of an Employees Provident Fund, improvement of working conditions of offices and shops, alleviation of poverty in urban, rural, plantation and industrial sectors, promotion of religious and communal harmony, economic development geared towards an equitable distribution of resources, retirement benefits, adequate housing, agrarian reforms and a new land policy. 
He also campaigned for industrialization including assistance for small industries, elimination of bribery and corruption in society and slum clearance. 
The local government appointed him to the Social Services Commission and the Divorce Commission while the Municipality appointed him to the Library Commission. 
In general Fr Peter Pillais policies led him to campaign for safeguarding freedom and human rights of all people. Many of the social benefits that we take for granted today are due to the pioneering efforts of one of the most brilliant minds of our country. 

"From an early age, he was an exceptional student. At the age of nine, he started school at St Benedicts College Colombo 13. In 1918 at the age of 14, he passed the Cambridge Junior with eight distinctions thereby ranking first in the island and in 1920 at the age of 16 he passed the Cambridge Senior with distinctions in
all subjects."
Fr Peter Pillai was appointed rector of St Josephs College, Maradana on 8th of December 1940, the first Ceylonese to hold this position, while succeeding another distinguished rector Fr. Maurice James LeGoc who hailed from France. As a longstanding Rector of the school, Fr Peter Pillai on occasion taught Mathematics while standing in for teachers who were absent. He also taught religion to pre University students in both Arts and Science streams.
Being mentor to several young boys who walked through the portals of St Josephs College, he worked tirelessly to develop the school into one of the premier educational institutionsin Sri Lanka. 
Aquinas College of Higher Studies was established by him in 1954 and he was its first Rector. The Aquinas College of Higher Studies was the first university in Sri Lanka to offer external degrees, thereby giving undergraduates the opportunity to pursue their higher studies while being employed. In addition to his other duties, he was appointed Vicar General. In 1961 he retired as Rector of St Josephs College. He had an illness toward the end his life. Even while he was ill he would hold discussions and courses to guide young priests, as they were one of his primary concerns. 
Rev Fr. Peter Pillai passed away at Aquinas College precincts at the age of sixty on 27th September 1964. 
Peter Pillai Social Institute: The Peter Pillai Social Institute (PPSI) was incorporated under the laws of Sri Lanka in 1979 in recognition of the contribution made by Very Revd. Fr. Peter Pillai to the cause of justice in Sri Lanka. The membership consists of priests and lay people. Annually scholarship awards are made to First and Second Year GCE Advanced Level students who meet the criteria of academic achievement and excellence.

Buddha statue at SL Temple vandalized in Canada
	
Ottawa police in Canada are investigating a report of vandalism at a temple after a Buddha statue was destroyed overnight, CBC News reported.
It said police were called to the Hilda Jayewardenaramaya Buddhist Temple at 1481 Heron Rd. Friday morning after two monks who live there reported the damage.
The head of the statue, which sits outside the building, appears to have been smashed apart.
Manoj Da Silva, the temple's treasurer, said the statue was installed about four months ago and cost approximately $8,000 to purchase and ship from Sri Lanka.
He said an iron bar believed to have been used to damage the statue was found nearby.
Da Silva said he doesn't know if the attack was random or targeted, and that it has raised concerns about personal safety.
I was very sad and we were shocked, he said adding nothing like this has happened at the temple in its 20 years of operation.
We have some activities going on during the day and there are some meditation programs going on. The temple was open at the time the vandalism happened. Therefore, anyone can step in at any moment. We are concerned about the safety of the resident monks,

Consensus among political parties to revert to PR system for PC polls
	
The political parties have, by and large, agreed to revert to the old Proportional Representation system for conducting the elections to the provincial councils, a Minister said yesterday.
The government has already enacted legislation to conduct the elections to the provincial councils under a mix of the First Past the Post and Proportional Representation systems.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem told Daily Mirror yesterday that the complications arose from the same electoral model adopted for the elections to the local authorities concluded on February 10, 2018.
In respect of the local authorities, the First Past the Post system returned 60 percent of members and the Proportional Representation 40 percent. However, the formula, proposed for the elections to the provincial councils, will provide for the election of 50 percent of members each from the two systems.
There were complications from the formula meant for the local authorities. If we use the same for the provincial councils with slight changes in percentages, it will again create complications after the polls, he said.
He said the political parties made representations to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in this regard recently.
There is growing consensus among the parties that we should return to the old system in view of elections pending, he said.
The Prime Minister, at this meeting, agreed to have further talks with the political parties. (Kelum Bandara)

GSLF holds protest against UNHRC in Geneva
	
With the participation of a large number of Sri Lankans living overseas, a protest organised by the Global Sri Lankans Forum (GSLF) was held outside the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland on Sunday against the UN Human Rights Council's maltreatment of Sri Lanka.
GSLF representatives from Italy, Britain, Denmark, Germany, France, Monaco, Sweden and Switzerland took part in the demonstration while retired Rear-Admiral Sarath Weerasekara, Dr. Nalaka Godahewa and Anuradha Yahampath, who were in Geneva also attended the protest.
Dr. Godahewa addressing the protesters said the Sri Lankan Government had committed a grave offense by co-sponsoring the 2015 US resolution without studying its contents.
"Because the Sri Lankan government has co-sponsored the resolution, even Russia and China who have veto power will hesitate to support us if a proposal was made to the UN Defence Council to impose sanctions on Sri Lanka. The GSLF has taken up the responsibility to show the world that the majority of Sri Lankans reject the UN resolution on Sri Lanka, though it was endorsed by the government," he said.
GSLF President Wasantha Keerthirathna said the GSLF, which was launched in Italy three years ago, had expanded its network to many other countries today. He invited Sri Lankans living abroad to join them to overcome challenges faced by the nation in the international arena. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Hamnet  lurking in the Writers heart
	
Immensely absorbing with overwhelming interest, the book is a recollection ofa human memory shining througheverything she writes

A legend written from the heart subconsciously to create a fictitious prince, Gwen Herat breathes life into a spirit who rise from ashes of time and walk into eternity. It is a pleasure to review or criticize her work because of the lyrical quality found in words and above; for the sudden twists and turns she injects with no prior indication to the reader, who is taken unawares, as to in which direction the story is heading. 
They all amount to surprisesand mystery. To be or not to be moans Hamlet in Shakespeares Tragedy. To live or not to live Ophelia breathes her last from Herats Tragedy. While the first is a famously quoted Shakespearean phrase, the second is bound to pick up in no time. Now, starts the race when Hamnet, the Prince from Nowhere clean-sweeps the bookshelves and reaches Shakespeare readers and also make way to classrooms. To live or not to live will soon be a popular quote. Both phrases are aptly placed generations apart. To use prose and words as self-expression is the forefront in her texts and all those, who have followed Herats works, will agree that they are all symphonic sonatas reflecting a days mysteries that Hamnet and Ophelia experience in their tryst. Elegant structures and bewildering pen-scribbles go to make this tragedy a modern classic. What spurred such a creative parallel between two lives, drawing her inspiration from a Prince who is Hamnet of today and Hamlet of yesterday, is perhaps someone in possession of her soul.Of noisome winds upon enamelled green, Morning dawns, the evening ends, Stay gentle, sweet Hamnet And I shall be thy faithful maid. Upon the prints of steps, Thou leave behind Beyond the realm of yonder land We shall find our resting place - 49 Herat is so good in her prose that I cannot but quote still more beautiful verses. At times, the tenses run haywire but they all meet to swell the story. Here is yet another that caught my imagination:- Or the last vestige, like the broken rocky hill, When volcanoes run the great flow, When shinny cradle see the day, Alas: The day has dawned when earthlings rise Our spirits to engulf. But I see thee in thy golden robe As preamble the nightingale a distant call - 122 

"An intimate portrait of a person she carries in her mind subconsciously. Herats delightful literary style is appealing to both young and old. "

TRANSITION TO INCARNATION 
A touch of re-birth pre-dominate one life followed by another leading the way to spiritual attainment. There is no doubt that illusion makes great stories. Many writers are capable of creating uncanny senses of living every minute in a readers mind but Herat goes a step further as she by-passes the sense of dying as well. 
One must remember the writer to be a Christian and therefore re-births are not active in her mind. 
It makes her tick as a perceptive analysis of character. 
Time ago, I was listening to her keynote address to SAARC women on fate and destiny of Asian women, when suddenly she turned around and said loud and clear. 
I am my destiny 
A very strong statement from
the Chair. 
Those words kept ringing in my ears until, by chance, I came across her latest book, Hamnet, which is all about destiny gripping its central figures, including a sloth bear. 
Laden with lyrical prose, apart from the leading story of intrigue, passion and sacrifice, with a snarling beast that mauls them to a gruesome death in the lonely forest of Elsinore, with Ophelias soliloquy reverberating in the darkness of the night, creating a harrowing effect on the reader due to its fast-tracked words. 
My ripped heart ached for his love declared too late in the wilderness. It was him I loved and not Hamlet, the secret I kept locked in my heart as we held back our forbidden passion for each other.
We were Elsinores dream but fate had her own reasons unknown to us and shortened our lives before the early buds opened out in their glory to paint the flowers in myriad hues and sap the nectar of youth in us. 
To live or not live 
As every sentence compels her deeper into the mystery with strange happenings, seemed a predestined mock of life, upon identical twins to the point of separation: One to live, the other to die as the intrepid journey of one as opposed to luxury living, both given to love Ophelia.  It captures the magic of youth at crossroads. The reader will feel the darkness across the woods and midnight close at hand. 
Compassionate, resilient and emotionally broken, Ophelia seeks his love she never
had in life. 

"Herats inner spirit has come in contact with someone she would have met for the first time even briefly, possibly in a split of a second, or someone in a crowd but not without leaving behind a deep impression. "

A PSYCHO - LOGICAL ANALYSIS 
The potent element that functions as human soul or mind, relevant to the psyche of the unknown mysterious character -that subconsciously torments the writer-arises in the prose so cleverly composed. 
Trapped, bound and chained in her own dream world from which she cannot free herself, Herats inspiration remains a vision. 
Shakespeare would have grabbed the idea like no other for the new twist given towards its
story value. 
Her mind would have walked pass mountains and valleys to discover Hamnet, her idol, inspiration without which, the story would not have
seen the day. 
Therefore, Hamnet is someone she knows subconsciously- perhaps love. 
Now, wait a second: This type of psychological conception is pure imagination born out of a vision that grips the mind to formulate each character like Hamnet. 
With my experience as a senior psychologist, I did come across and did discover one or two possessed by such enigmas in my class like I find in Herat, awaiting explosion or coughing up. 
Herats inner spirit has come in contact with someone she would have met for the first time even briefly, possibly in a split of a second, or someone in a crowd but not without leaving behind a deep impression. 
And that someone is Hamnet. 
From behind the darkened shadows
Cast by floating clouds
Thou appeared from nowhere
And seized my heart, my soul, my all.
Precious Prince from nowhere
No crown upon thy head
That glittered in princely gems
The glow upon thy wondrous face
That was Hamnets grace (132) 
Immensely absorbing with overwhelming interest, the book is a recollection of a human memory shining through everything she writes. 
An intimate portrait of a person she carries in her mind subconsciously. Herats delightful literary style is appealing to both young and old. 
This magnificent book is dedicated to Rt. Rev. Dr Devsritha Valence Mendis, Bishop of Chilaw. 
Front cover - Mystery of Elsinore woods in glorious colour. Hand-bound hardcover priced at Rs. 800, US$:20.00 and available at Vijitha Yapa bookshops islandwide.

Australia, (Daily Mail), 17 March 2018 - -A Melbourne mother has sued her son over an alleged unpaid home loan, as more parents using their finances to help their children enter the increasingly competitive property market.
Lalanah Brujah took her son Taras Wolf to court last week over what she claimed was the remaining balance of money she lent him to buy a house in the inner Melbourne suburb of Collingwood in 2001.
During the hearing at the Melbourne Magistrates Court, the court heard that Ms Brujah had covered the deposit, settlement and stamp duty for the property when it was purchased for $500,000, according to domain.com.au.The mother-of-three alleged she is still owed $289,800 from the initial payment made when her son was in his late 20s. Despite his mothers claims, Mr Wolf, who is now an award winning architect with Melbourne-based firm, WOLF Architects, said the money was a gift. 
Mr Wolf said there there was no loan and no discussion of payments during the purchase.

OMP rejects GSLF allegations
	
The Office on Missing Persons(OMP) Chairman Saliya Pieris PC today rejected the allegations made by the Global Sri Lankan Forum (GSLF) raising concerns over the conduct of the OMP.
In a statement, the OMP Chairman said their attention is drawn to a letter purported to be addressed to the President, by an organisation calling itself the Global Sri Lankan Forum which was published in Daily Mirror.
Regrettably the contents of the letter are teeming with inaccuracies and distortions, not least on the law relating to the OMP.
The OMP last week issued a detailed media release in its mandate and objectives.
The OMP reiterates that the definition of Missing Persons in the OMP Act is not limited to those missing or disappeared, during the conflict in the North and East and its aftermath but also covers persons missing and disappeared as a result of enforced disappearances as well as other political and civil disturbances in every part of the country.
The mandate of the OMP is not limited to a particular area, community or time period and also covers those of the Sri Lankan Forces Missing in Action.
The OMP is not a quasi-judicial body and its objective is to trace the missing and disappeared and to inform the relatives of those persons, the circumstances of the disappearances and the fate of their loved ones.
The findings of the OMP do not give rise to criminal or civil liability. While the work of the OMP is confidential in nature, it is as is every institution in the country subject to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in the exercise of its Fundamental Rights and Writ jurisdiction. 
The OMP intends to follow the best practices in setting about its work and will act impartially and independently without fear or favour.
None of the members of the OMP have ever advocated the cause of separatism and all members of the OMP unequivocally support and believe in a united Sri Lanka and are convinced that a strong domestic mechanism will be useful to establish the credibility of the country in granting relief to the loved ones of the missing and disappeared, the statement said.

The five were killed after a shell fired by Pakistani soldiers hit their home in Poonch region along the militarized Line of Control that divides the Himalayan territory between the two nuclear-armed rivals, said S.P. Vaid, the police chief.
The dead included a woman, two children and a teenage boy. Vaid said the injured have been hospitalized and authorities were evacuating civilians from the area amid shelling and firing. Indias army said its soldiers were responding to what it called unprovoked violation of the 2003 cease-fire agreement between the two countries.
Pakistan did not immediately comment. However, both the nuclear-armed rivals routinely blame the other for starting any firing and insist they are only retaliating.

Putin wins Russian election
	
Russias Vladimir Putin won a landslide reelection victory on Sunday according to exit polls, extending his rule over the worlds largest country for another six years at a time when his ties with the west are on a hostile trajectory.
Putins victory will extend his total time in office to nearly a quarter of a century, until 2024, by which time he will be 71. Only Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ruled for longer. Putin has promised to use his new term to beef up Russias defences against the west and to raise living standards.
In a widely-expected result, an exit poll by pollster VTsIOM showed Putin, who has dominated the political landscape for the past 18 years, had won 73.9% of the vote. Backed by state TV and the ruling party, and credited with an approval rating around 80%, his victory was never in doubt.
The Kremlin was seeking legitimacy in Sundays vote by attempting to boost turnout, while the  opposition called for a boycott and sent observers across the country to monitor for fraud.
None of the seven candidates who ran against Putin posed a threat, and opposition leader Alexei
Navalny was barred from running.
Critics alleged that officials offered voters the chance to win iPhones in raffles and prizes for the
Best polling station selfies. Russias central election commission recognised that there were some irregularities, but were likely to dismiss wider criticism and declare the overall result legitimate.
Putin loyalists said the result was a vindication of his tough stance towards western powers.
I think that in the US and Britain theyve understood they cannot influence our elections, said
Igor Morozov, a member of the upper house of parliament. Our citizens understand what sort of situation Russian finds itself in today.
The immediate question following the result is whether Putins opponents, such as Navalny,
organise protests

Trump attacks FBI, and his lawyer says Russia probe must end
	
Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on March 16, shortly before McCabe was set to retire. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) 

President Trump escalated his assault on federal law enforcement agencies Saturday while one of his attorneys -John Dowd- argued that the controversial firing of a top FBI official was reason to end the Justice Department special counsels expansive Russia investigation. 
After Attorney General Jeff Sessions acted late Friday night on Trumps publicly stated wishes to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe just hours before he was set to retire with full benefit  the president celebrated the ouster as a triumph that exposed tremendous leaking, lying and corruption throughout law enforcement. 
The move emboldened McCabe, who said in a public statement that his dismissal was a deliberate effort to slander him and part of an ongoing war against the FBI and special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs probe of Russian interference in the 2016 elections. 
Like former FBI director James B. Comey, who was fired by Trump last year, McCabe kept contemporaneous memos detailing his fraught conversations with the president, according to two people familiar with the records. The danger for Trump is that those memos could help corroborate McCabes witness testimony and become damaging evidence in Muellers investigation of whether Trump has sought to obstruct justice. 
Dowd said in a Saturday morning statement, I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabes boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.

UNHRC adopts Sri Lankas UPR report
	
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Report on Sri Lanka was adopted today at the 37th session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Geneva said.
Sri Lanka was represented by Permanent Representative Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha and assisted by the Deputy Permanent Representative Mrs. Samantha Jayasuriya during the session.
Sri Lankas review under the third cycle of the UPR was held during the 28th Session of the UPR Working Group that convened from November 6 to 17, 2017.
Speaking at the adoption of the UPR on Sri Lanka, Ambassador Aryasinha said out of the 230 recommendations received during the constructive dialogue last November, Sri Lanka accepted 177 recommendations along with 12 voluntary pledges.
We have also taken due note of the remaining recommendations made by member states, and we express appreciation to all delegations for their active participation in Sri Lankas review and their valuable recommendations, he said.
The Full Statement by Ambassador Aryasinha
Mr. President,
Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates,
I am honoured to be here today, for the adoption of the final report of Sri Lankas review under the 3rd cycle of the Universal Periodic Review that took place in November 2017. I would like to thank the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UPR Secretariat and the Troika of Sri Lankas review  Republic of Burundi, the Republic of Korea, and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela  for their contributions and invaluable cooperation in Sri Lankas UPR process.
Mr. President,
Out of the 230 recommendations that Sri Lanka received during the very constructive dialogue last November, Sri Lanka accepted 177 recommendations along with 12 voluntary pledges. We have also taken due note of the remaining recommendations made by member states, and we express appreciation to all delegations for their active participation in Sri Lankas review and their valuable recommendations.
Sri Lanka is a strong supporter of the UPR process. Its peer review nature allows for open and constructive engagement that encourages countries to address important issues relating to human rights, and to learn from each other. Sri Lanka remains firm in its commitment to this process. We also remain committed to constructive engagement with the UN systems and procedures as well as engagement with individual member states in promoting human rights locally and internationally.
As you are aware Mr. President, Sri Lanka participated in the 3rd review in November 2017 in the backdrop of a renewed and transformed local setting following Presidential and Parliamentary elections in the year 2015 with a renewed focus on strengthening, promoting, protecting and upholding human rights; strengthening democracy, good governance, and the rule of law; reconciliation and sustainable peace; equality and dignity for all; upholding the pluralistic nature of society; and creating inclusive and equitable growth and development in the country.
In the 4 months that have passed since Sri Lankas review in November last year, we have already made progress on the implementation of some of the recommendations.
-On 5 December 2017, Sri Lanka acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, and designated the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka as the National Preventive Mechanism. We have requested the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka to liaise with the Subcommittee to obtain the advice and technical expertise required for the effective and efficient operationalisation of the National Preventive Mechanism.
-Legislation to give effect locally, to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was enacted by the passage of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in the Sri Lanka Parliament on 7 March 2018. This criminalises Enforced Disappearance.
-On the recommendations made by the Constitutional Council as per the Office on Missing Persons Act, the President appointed the Chairperson and Commissioners for the Office on Missing Persons on 28 February 2018, making the Office fully operational. At a meeting with the Chairperson and Commissioners on 28 February, the President assured them of the fullest support of the Government to ensure the effective functioning of the Office. We have circulated among delegations, the initial statement made by the Chairperson of the Office on Missing Persons on 12 March 2018. Sri Lanka Rupees 1.4 billion (approximately 9 million USD) has been allocated in the National Budget for 2018, for the Office on Missing Persons. The Constitutional Council, in its selection process, has ensured that the Chairperson and Commissioners represent a cross-section of society, with individuals who possess experience in human rights as activists, ex-public servants and professionals, as well as a family member of a missing person.
-Progress has been made in the drafting of new Counter Terrorism Legislation. We envisage a Counter Terrorism Act that conforms to human rights safeguards and other international standards and we expect the draft legislation to be gazetted for tabling in Parliament for consideration, once the established procedures including translation into local languages are completed, shortly.
The Cabinet of Ministers, on 6 March 2018, approved the formulation of legislation by the Legal Draftsman, for the establishment by law of an Office for Reparations. Once the draft legislation with translations into local languages is finalised, the draft Bill is expected to be gazetted shortly.
-For a country that has experienced conflict, that now seeks to take measures to forge reconciliation and ensure non-recurrence, Sri Lankas accession on 13 December 2017 to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on their Destruction (Ottawa Convention) and accession on 1 March 2018 to the Convention on Cluster Munitions are important steps. Demonstrating firm commitment to the implementation of the provisions of the Convention, Sri Lanka received from 4-7 March 2018, the Special Envoy on the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, Prince Mired Bin Ra'ad Al-Hussein.
-Sri Lanka has been and continues to engage actively with UN systems and procedures and across all agencies at all levels.
Sri Lanka received the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for an official country visit from 4-15 December 2017.
In January 2018, Sri Lanka participated in the review on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Moreover, Mr. President, amendments were brought to the Local Authorities Election Act and the Provincial Councils Election Act, ensuring a quota to elect female representatives to the Local Government and Provincial Councils which are important grass-root-level decision making bodies. At the recently concluded Local Government Elections held on 10 February 2018, the legislation ensuring 25% quota for women was implemented, securing a record number of women being elected.
-For the effective implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021 which was shared with all delegations in November during Sri Lankas review, a three-tier mechanism has now been established to regularly monitor progress being made by all the relevant line ministries and agencies, and to give necessary guidance and direction. All action points specified in the plan are being incorporated into the action plans of the relevant ministries and agencies.
The first tier, an inter-ministerial committee, is chaired by the Prime Minister and convenes every 6 months. The second tier, which is an officials committee, is convened by the Secretary to the Prime Minister every two months. This committee comprises of Secretaries to ministries. The third tier of the monitoring mechanism are ten sectoral committees at the level of ministries, namely, on civil and political rights  chaired by the Ministry of Justice; Torture  chaired by the Ministry of Law & Order; Women  chaired by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs; Internally Displaced Persons  chaired by the Ministry of Resettlement; Rights of Children  chaired by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs; and Persons with Disabilities  chaired by the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry. The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka is represented in the Officials Committee, and civil society representatives nominated by the Human Rights Commission are represented in all ten sectoral committees.
Mr. President,
This Council is aware of the recent incidents that took place in certain parts of my country targeting members of the Muslim community who represent an integral part of the pluralistic society of Sri Lanka.
These cowardly acts instigated by some organised groups and individuals who have no place in the democratic, pluralistic society of our country. Such acts go against our shared vision of a Sri Lanka where equal rights and rule of law are guaranteed for all. We are determined to take action against all perpetrators of these incidents in accordance with the due process of the law. Victim compensation processes have already commenced; and arrests have been made as well.
As a result of these incidents, Mr. President, where it was discovered that social media and messaging platforms were being used not only to incite and spread hate and false messages but also to organise attacks, the Government was compelled to impose temporary restrictions on the use of social media. All these restrictions have now been lifted. The Government as a result of this experience has now entered into active engagement with social media operators, particularly facebook, to work on the prevention of hate speech. The emergency regulations which the Government was compelled to impose on 06 March 2018 as a measure to protect communities were rescinded on 17 March 2018.
What was heartening Mr. President, amidst the disturbing incidents, were the acts of compassion of the peace-loving people of my country that came to each others help, and the public calls for unity and peace and the denouncing of hatred and violence by key members of the community  the clergy, community leaders, sports personnel, artists, and musicians  cutting across ethnic and religious lines.
Mr. President,
We firmly recognise that the UPR should not be a mere three-and-a-half hour dialogue that takes place every four years. Therefore, with technical assistance from the OHCHR, we are already in the process of exploring the best possible mechanism to put in place locally, for regular reporting and follow-up of recommendations emanating from the UPR process as well as other processes including the treaty body reporting and follow-up process. We appreciate the assistance in this regard that the OHCHR has offered us.
Mr. President, Excellencies, Distinguished delegates,
Thank you for the opportunity to deliver these remarks. I look forward to listening to the views from the floor from all who will be speaking today.

Almost all prominent members of the United National Party (UNP) have agreed on the reorganization of the party, State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
Dr. De Silva said this at the opening of the Janaliya Self employment project in Kotte last morning.
Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe is also currently discussing on the reorganization of the party, he said.
"No Confidence motion against the Prime Minister has nothing to do with the reorganization of UNP and Joint Opposition MPs should not get involved in it," he added responding to a statement made by some JO MPs who have said some UNPers are also supporting the motion against the Prime Minister.
He also said he and State Ministers Ajith P. Perera and Eran Wickramaratne had joined JHU Leader Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to fight for the inaction of Judicature Bill.
"People wanted us to bring robbers behind bars and that is why this legislation has to be passed, he said while stating that a number of petitions have been filed in favour of the Bill.
Asked about the move by the SLFP to oppose the Bill, Dr. De Silva said no robber will back the Bill. Which robber will back the Judicature Bill," he questioned.
Further, he said the request made by Buddhist monks that the Bill should be enacted soon should be heeded. (Yohan Perera)

WWFs Earth Hour to spark global awareness and action for a healthy planet
	
Earth Hour, WWFs landmark movement, is set to once again unite millions of people around the world to show their commitment to the planet. As our one shared home faces the dual challenge of climate change and plummeting biodiversity, the worlds largest grassroots movement for the environment aims to mobilize individuals, businesses and governments to be a part of the conversation and solutions needed to build a healthy, sustainable future  and planet  for all.

Having started as a symbolic lights out event in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour is now celebrated in more than 180 countries and territories as a global moment of solidarity for the planet. Online, #EarthHour and related terms last year generated over 3.5 billion impressions in the run up to Earth Hour, trending in at least 30 countries worldwide on the night. The movement has been a game-changer for popularizing climate and environmental action across the globe. As global biodiversity declines at an unprecedented rate, Earth Hour will focus its efforts on galvanizing mainstream support for action on biodiversity and nature.

Biodiversity and nature underpin our lives, our economies, our health, our well-being, our happiness. It is the foundation of our living planet. Today, as we push the planet and its natural systems to the edge, Earth Hour is our chance to use our power, as individuals and as a collective, to demand and take action to protect this web of life in return for all it gives us. For the benefit of all life on Earth and of our own future said Marco Lambertini, Director General, WWF International.

In the past decade, Earth Hour has inspired millions to support and participate in critical climate and conservation projects led by WWF and many others, helping drive climate policy, awareness and action. Among its highlights, the movement has helped in the creation of a 3.4 million hectare marine-protected area in Argentina, a 2,700-hectare Earth Hour forest in Uganda and helped pass new legislation for the protection of seas and forests in Russia.

In 2018, WWF and Earth Hour teams around the world will be using the movement to highlight the environmental issues most relevant in their country or region. In Colombia, people will call for the country to commit to zero deforestation by 2020. French Polynesia is expected to move to protect 5 million square kilometers of its seas to preserve ocean ecosystems. In Guatemala, citizens will raise their voice on the importance of freshwater conservation and in India, people will pledge to shift toward sustainable lifestyles. In Nepal, WWF will mobilize public support for a clean, renewable energy future for all.

We know that Sri Lanka together with the Western Ghats of India, is endowed with a rich biodiversity and considered, one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world. Said Abdul Qadir Uvais, Country Representative and Manager of Earth Hour. However High population density and expansion of the human environment are increasingly threatening Sri Lankas biodiversity, which may lead to extinction of species. Further added Uvais. As a country which has ratified the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1994, Biodiversity conservation is a responsibility of all Sri Lankans said Uvais. He further added that People are just one part of Earths vast web of life and most of the resources we use come from the environment. Thats why we have to do our part to protect the Environment around us!

When asked about what actions individuals can do to be part of this global Earth Hour campaign, the local Earth Hour Country Manager and Coordinator, Abdul Qadir Uvais had this to say;
Earth Hour Sri Lanka is asking the government, businesses, organizations & individuals to:

 Switch off non-essential lights (corporate signage) on Saturday 24th March 2018 from 8.30 pm- 9.30 pm
 Join the movement by signing up and taking part atwww.earthhour.org
 Go beyond the symbolic gesture of switching off non-essential lights for Earth Hour and drive climate action throughout the year, leading an environmentally conscious lifestyle.

Starting today, supporters can visit connect2earth.org to share what biodiversity and nature means to them in the places they live in and find out more about it. Created in partnership with the secretariat of the United Nations Convention of Biological Diversity, the platform aims to build mass awareness on the values of biodiversity and nature by kick-starting global conversations on issues such as climate action, healthy oceans and sustainable business. The project is supported by Germanys Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety with funding from the International Climate Initiative.

"Earth Hour is a testament to the power of a simple idea to inspire people to take action to protect the Earth. As we take an hour to reflect on the vital role that biodiversity and nature play in our lives, let this be the spark that galvanizes action for transformation to a more sustainable future, said Cristiana Pasca Palmer, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The CBD Secretariat is delighted to be working with WWF, and with people all over the world to build a movement where people and communities make a personal connection with Earth. The reflections, conversations and actions we start today will help protect biodiversity at the local, national and global levels, and lead us on a journey of living in harmony with nature.

Visitwww.earthhour.org to know whats happening in locations around the world and read individuals stories about what they are doing for our planet. This is our time to secure a healthy, sustainable and climate-resilient future for all.
