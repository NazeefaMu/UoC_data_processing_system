SriLankan airlines today asked all passengers to report at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) as usual, three hours prior to departure times.

On Sunday, SriLankan airlines asked passengers to arrive at the BIA four hours prior to departure times because of renovation work at the airport.

However, SriLankan airlines today said, “We wish to inform all passengers that in view of a slight delay in the planned construction work, we are not restricted in space at this early stage of the renovation. Hence, passengers have the option of still reporting three hours prior to departure time of their flight.”
