The government is to take steps to control the importation of milk powder and ban the importation of substandard milk powder from abroad in order to encourage the local dairy farmers and promote the dairy farming in Sri Lanka, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said.

Issuing a press release, he stated that several incidents were being reported that the local dairy farmers had experienced losses owing to the importation of milk powder from abroad.

“We in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Standards Institution are going to introduce a labeling system on the dairy products including yogurt, ice cream so that the consumer could distinguish local dairy products from substandard products. We are going to make it compulsory soon. It should be labeled on the products whether the products are manufactured using local dairy or imported milk powder,” Harrison said.

He further said that the government would promote the products made of fresh milk to discourage consumption of milk powder which are being imported. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
