BOC supports tea factory owners build working capital
	
Bank of Ceylon (BOC) has launched a special loan scheme for tea factory owners to build working capital with the direction received from the Finance Ministry and Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL).
The opportunity is open for the tea estate owners who have registered with the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB).
The tea estate owners who meet the requirements denoted by the SLTB will be eligible for the amount recommended by the SLTB. The facility can be scheduled for a 60-month repayment period allowing them to use it more effectively.
This special loan scheme will be disbursed to the eligible tea estate owners under an annual interest rate of 8 percent, where a special interest subsidy of 2 percent will be borne by the CBSL on behalf of the tea factory owner, enabling him/her to enjoy a very low interest rate of 6 percent for the first two years.
The ceremony to launch this special loan scheme was held yesterday at the BOC head office under the patronage of BOC Chairman Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera.
BOC Director Ranel Wijesinha and the banks General Manager D.M. Gunasekara were also present. CBSL Regional Development Department Director General Ashoka Handagama, SLTB Chairman Y.G. Wijerathne, the SLTB Director General and Tea Commissioner also participated.

Central Bank issues fresh statement over 30-year bond issue
	
		 		 
		 
			
The Central Bank on Wednesday issued a detailed statement over the controversial 30-year bond issue.
The statement explains the decision taken by the Central Bank in February 2015 to move into the fully auction-based system for bond sales from partial private placements earlier practiseda decision that was announced to the bond market participants only after the controversial 30-year bond sale.
The full Central Bank statement is produced below.Policy of issuance of Treasury bonds through public auctions
The Central Bank commenced issuing Treasury bonds only through public auctions from the auction of the 30-year Treasury bonds held on February 27, 2015. In response, several reports published in the media have alleged that the sole reliance on issuing Treasury bonds through auctions conducted since February 27, 2015 has led to additional costs to the government. Accordingly, they appear to support that issuance of Treasury bonds through a mix of private/direct placements method and auctions that have been followed during the past several years should be reintroduced to reduce such costs. The some reports hypothetically calculate the additional costs to the government based on certain assumptions. In this regard, the Central Bank wishes to provide the following clarifications for the awareness of the public.
1. In terms of the Operational Manual of the Public Debt Department, issuance of Treasury bills and bonds should be undertaken as much as possible through public auctions based on market conditions and any balance funding requirement could be raised through private/direct placements as per the procedure laid down in the manual. However, in recent years, nearly 80 to 90 percent of government funding raised through Treasury bonds was via the direct placements method, alternative to auctions, based on strategies followed at that time. The current policy of issuance of Treasury bonds via public auctions only is expected to enable further market development process initiated in the past several years by moving to a full scale auction arrangement for issuance of Treasury bills and international sovereign bonds which will bring more benefits to both the government and investors in the near future.
2. At the 30-year Treasury bond auction held on February 27, 2015, Rs.10.06 billion was raised at the weighted average yield to maturity of 11.73 percent.
Prior to this auction, at the previous 30-year Treasury bond auction held on May 27, 2014, Rs.2 billion was raised at the yield to maturity of 11.75 percent.
After this auction, further Rs.77.8 billion was raised from direct placements of around 30-year maturity Treasury bonds at yield rates ranging from 8.85 percent to 11.80 percent as per the prevailing practice and the overall weighted average yield covering the auctions and direct placements was 11.47 percent. At other previous issuance of Treasury bonds of around or close to 30 years, lower or higher yield rates have been determined.
3. However, the yield rates of Treasury bonds or any security issued at auctions in the market are not directly comparable across the auctions or across different maturities of securities because each auction in the market environment involves different market conditions and factors. Changes in market liquidity, policy interest rates, foreign investors behaviour and market expectations will have diverse impact along with demand and supply forces on the yield rates. Therefore, commenting on the additional costs or saving to the government from issuance of a Treasury bond at a particular auction compared with the yield rate of a Treasury bond issued at another auction or in a particular period is not acceptable and justifiable.
4. The calculation of additional cost to the government due to the 30-year Treasury bond issuance at the auction held on February 27, 2015 in some analyses is solely based on the assumption that if Rs.1 billion as announced for the auction was accepted on bids at the weighted average yield to maturity of 10.38 percent as per those bids up to Rs.1 billion and direct placement window was opened after the auction at that auction weighted average yield rate to fund the balance funding as per the prevailing practice. Accordingly, the additional cost to the government as per such calculations is 1.35 percent being the difference between the yield rate of 11.73 percent at the auction for Rs.10.06 billion and the yield rate of 10.38 percent applicable to Rs.1 billion at the auction. However, the two issuing options are completely different as the full auction system is market-based whereas the limited auction with direct placements is a funding method combined of market and administratively determined arrangement. Therefore, such additional cost calculation has no practical grounds.
5. Some analysts calculate a further addition to the above additional cost by calculating the increase in yield rates of Treasury bonds of other maturities issued at auctions after February 27, 2015 compared to yield rates of such matures issued at the latest auction or direct placement made prior to the 30-year Treasury bond auction on February 27, 2015. Such analysts update the total additional cost on an on-going basis as and when a new Treasury bond is auctioned. As the yield rates at different auctions are not comparable due to different market conditions and factors as stated above, the calculation of such additional cost has not justification.
6. The auction-based issuance arrangement will contribute to the development of government securities market in many ways and some are highlighted below.
a. The benefit of price discovery realized in the market mechanism is not available in the direct placement led issuances. Therefore, it is not possible to gauge whether the yield rate in this system is lower than the yield rate to be realized from the full auction system. In economics, it has been established that market mechanism is more beneficial than administratively-managed market arrangements to market participants in terms of the efficient pricing in place of administered prices. In the medium term, when the full auction system comes into place, the funding cost to the government will be determined based on market mechanism with close monitoring by the Central Bank with a mix of debt-raising instruments to reduce the excessive volatility in yield rate or costs.
Accordingly, the immediate increase in the yield rates at auction on February 27, 2015 and the aftermath would be corrected by market forces. In addition, removal of special standing facility rate of 5 percent by the Central Bank on March 3, 2015 also led to the increase in the yield rates, which is a factor external to the issuance of the Treasury bond under reference. However, as shown in the subsequent auctions without direct placements, yield rates gradually started adjusting and stabilizing in a market environment. Also, the demand increased across several maturities of government securities from the short to long term. Therefore, the overall cost of borrowing through Treasury bonds has been declining and moderating in general. However, the cost at individual auctions may vary due to changes in market conditions.
b. The auction process improved tremendously as shown by increased participation by dealers and investors in the primary and secondary markets. As a result, the government could raise as much as Rs.316.4 billion through Treasury bonds at auctions since the issuance of 30-year Treasury bond in reference supported with other debt instruments to meet the government funding requirements.
c. The secondary market of government securities (Treasury bonds and bills) also expanded due to active auctions in 2015. As a result, investors who are not in a position to access the auctions or large institutional investors who fail to secure bids at the action started bidding in the secondary market across the primary dealers looking for yields comparable with primary market/auction yields. As a result, an active secondary market has now begun to operate in the country. The active secondary market will improve further competition in the government securities market facilitating the government to raise funds at competitive yield rates.
d. The promotion of the open market mechanism for government securities will attract international investors to the government securities market and the stability in investment flows and investor confidence will improve in the medium term.
e. In addition, the issuance Treasury bills and Sri Lanka Development Bonds will further facilitate the government to raise funds through the auction system in a market environment.
7. In view of the above, the current policy initiative for issuance of Treasury bonds only at public auctions should be evaluated with a medium to long-term view to understand the benefits of the market mechanism to all participants.

Former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva claimed yesterday President Maithripala Sirisena should learn the law of the country from the kindergarten level.
Addressing the UPFA election rally in Kurunegala, he said a secretary of a political party could not be removed without an order from the Supreme Court when an election had been declared and therefore, the removal of the UPFA General Susil Premajayantha and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Anura Priyadarshana Yapa were legally not valid.
He said a lower court has no jurisdiction in this regard. Already, he said the elections commissioner had accepted these two as the party secretaries and therefore, a district court could not rule against the election law.
He said the election law could not be changed from a signature of a district judge who was on his way home after finishing duties for the day.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is contesting Monday's parliamentary elections from the Kurunegala District today alleged the government banished foreign investors including those from India and China and had welcomed underworld figures instead.
Addressing the UPFA election rally in Kurunegala, he said people who were responsible for unleashing underworld tactics were involved in the present government.
There was an infamous underworld figure called Gonawala Sunil, who raped a 16-year-old girl and went to jail. However, he was released two days after he went to jail and was also awarded with a Justice of Peace post. People behind these moves are today advising us, he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rajapaksa said both the UPFA and SLFP had been well persevered and grown because of the action taken by the General Secretaries of the UPFA and SLFP, Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
He said he would not leave Kurunegala which he is contesting from instead of his home town and said Wayamba (North Western Province) had made him alive. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

I never knew Mr. Thajudeen: Yasara
	
A name that has come up with the death of Rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was of Yasara Abeynayake. In her comments to the Daily Mirror, Yasara said, I never knew Mr. Thajudeen nor have I ever even spoken to him. These rumours started back in 2012 by a website named Lanka Leaks and it has spread like fire ever since then. I dont know why they attach me to this story but they unfortunately picked me and spread it far enough for people to believe their false story.
When asked whether the diplomatic position she was awarded to serve in Australia had any link with the incident she said Mr. Thajudeen passed away in 2012 and I got my posting in mid-2014 so my posting had nothing to do with the incident. Also this incident had nothing to do with my break-up as I never knew Wasim. Yoshitha and I were engaged and it came to an end because our horoscopes did not match and his family was very superstitious about astrology related matters.This break-up with Yositha was just like any regular break-up but the sad part is that most people in the country decided to make it their business.
Meanwhile, in an interview with our sister paper, the Sunday Lankadeepa Yasara has mentioned that she had wanted to speak to the media when the incident happened. Most people discouraged me from resorting to it saying that it was gossip stories which were unfounded and to take no notice of them. It was not my intention to follow these gossip web sites. After some time those stories stopped circulating. But again after the elections it had come to the scene once again. Whenever I meet people they say things, which had greatly caused me and my family much distraught. This is unjustifiable. See the plight of people who are subjected to this harassment. It is my honourable request not to welcome all what is been published via the internet, and do not be in a haste to take decisions. Once the reports are released people would know the truth.

The company registered a 21 percent growth in GWP in the life insurance segment on the back of a remarkable increase of 48 percent in First Year Life Premiums, the highest recorded since it set out on a strategic drive to transform this business. The GWP for general (non-life) insurance segment grew by 13 percent.
Janashakthi posted these impressive numbers while continuing to honour its commitment to policyholders. The insurer settled claims totalling Rs.2.2 billion across life and non-life categories at the end of first half, 2015 of which Rs.1.2 billion was disbursed in 2Q, 2015.
The double digit growth in gross written premium alongside the Rs.1.2 billion claims payout in 2Q, 2015 is a reflection of our mission of bringing hope and prosperity to all.

Mr. Weerawansa said President Sirisena allowed Mr. Rajapaksa to lead the UPFA election campaign and as such he would certainly offer the premiership to him as well.
President Sirisena gave nomination to Mr. Rajapaksa even with displeasure and so we are sure he will give the premiership as well even with displeasure. He is sure to say that he gave it with displeasure, he said.

Sri Lanka Tourism to make cruise segment a top 5 earner for Sri Lanka
   
    - Global market worth $4 billion
    - Sri Lanka to reach 60,000 by end 2015
    - Targets 100,000 by end 2016
A giant step forward for the development of cruise tourism in Sri Lanka to be a 100,000 visitor arrivals source Sri Lanka tourism promotions bureau has invited Mr. John Tercek, Vice President of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd to visit Sri Lanka and address the business community of the 4 billion dollar industry said chairman Sri Lanka tourism Promotions bureau Dr Rohantha Athukorala.
Cruise Tourism has seen a substantial growth in Sri Lanka with numbers going from 18 cruise line visits in 2011, 22 liners in 2014 and currently at 40 visits from liners. The Asian Cruise Trends Report for 2014 by CLIA goes on to state that Asia is growing in both capacity deployed and as a passenger source market. Already 52 ships are being deployed in Asia in 2015 with over 1000 cruises and voyages being scheduled; Sri Lanka with its excellent geo strategic location, and being a maritime hub, must leverage on this surge. The proposed cruise terminal building, pending cabinet approval, initiated by the Ministry of Ports is exactly the kind of infrastructure support that is required to fast track and catapult cruise tourism promotion, which would provide much greater economic benefits and a high return on investment.
In this global backdrop SLAITO together with Sri Lanka tourism has finalized marketing plans for cruise tourism and the strategies set out by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, the acceptance of Mr. John Tercek,s invitation to be a keynote speaker for the Cruise Tourism industry at the Colombo International Maritime Conference (CIMC) conference to be held in Colombo 24  26 September 2015, is an achievement of its own to the development of Cruise Tourism in Sri Lanka. We are honoured and humbled by his acceptance of our invitation, said Dr. Rohantha Athukorala. He went onto further comment that our invitation to Mr. Tercek is also extended to spend a few days with us here in Sri Lanka, apart from the programme, so he may experience first-hand what Sri Lanka has to offer.

Suspected LTTE senior member detained, deported: IGP
	
On Aug 7 the Polices Counter Terrorism Special Branch launched an operation in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur which led to the arrest of a male Sri Lankan citizen. The 37-year-old is suspected to be a senior member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorist group who entered Malaysia in December 2012 with a Social Visit Pass.
Early investigations found that the suspect had made Malaysia his hiding place and was extorting Sri Lankans in Malaysia to raise funds to revive the LTTE struggle in Sri Lanka. From interrogations, he had confessed to having been involved in a credit card fraud syndicate in Malaysia which was masterminded by other foreign nationals.
The suspect was arrested under Section 15 (1) (C) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 for exceeding his stay in Malaysia more than the period allowed by the Social Visit Pass. He was deported to his home country on August 14 for further actions by the ruling power of Sri Lanka, said Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar in a statement today. (NST)
