Petition against UPFA national list

A petition was filed today calling for the termination of appointments made through the national list of the United People's Freedom Alliance during the recent general election.
The petition which was filed by attorney-at-law Nagananda Koddithuwakku, pointed out that 14 amendment to the Constitution had not been passed by a general election, hence was not valid. Therefore he appealed to the Supreme Court to make the decision illegal that had appointed defeated candidates as MPs.
