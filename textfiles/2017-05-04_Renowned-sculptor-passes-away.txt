A 88-year-old sculptor Esweda Naidelage Piyatillake of Dembemada in Rambukkana who turned out the first Mace of the Sri Lankan Parliament died today.

A reputed sculptor from early in his life, he had been awarded the contract of turning out the Mace in Parliament in 1958 according to a design made by a reputed jewellery mart in Colombo. Piyatillake who received an injury while working in the paddy field had developed fever and admitted to Kegalle general hospital on April 26. However, he died yesterday morning while receiving treatment.

His son Athula Jayadewa said his father who visited Parliament last on March 16 on the invitation of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was shown the Mace, now on display in the Parliament museum which aroused his nostalgic memories of the past.

JMO Kegalle Hospital Dr. Ramesh Alagiyawanna who held the autopsy reported that death had been caused by a germ that entered through an injury. (Chaminda Jayalath)
