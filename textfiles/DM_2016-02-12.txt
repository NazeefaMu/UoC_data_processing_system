Supporting academic excellence of youth with the potential to become future leaders of the countrys insurance industry and seeking further development of the company, Asian Alliance Insurance PLC has entered into a far-reaching, mutually-beneficial agreement with the Department of Finance (DFin) of the University of Kelaniya.
The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed recently by the countrys leader in innovation in the insurance industry and one of the leading local academic institutions paves the way for cooperation in many areas  including rewarding academic achievement, knowledge-sharing and social activities.
Accordingly, Asian Alliance Insurance will award the Asian Alliance Gold Medal Award to the best student in the unit of Risk and Insurance Service Management of the Finance Degree Programme at the Annual General Convocation, as well as a Rs. 100,000 scholarship to assist the respective student to pursue further studies in the same subject area. In addition to creating strong ties between the company and some of the countrys brightest young minds pursuing academic studies in the subject areas of finance/insurance, the agreement can lead to other areas of collaboration  including guest lectures by experts of Asian Alliance and feedback from the company on the course contents of the Insurance Degree programme expected to commence in 2017.   Considering the dearth of professionals in specialized areas such as actuarial operations, this agreement represents an important landmark to us, as well as perhaps to Sri Lankas entire insurance industry, by drawing attention and directing talent towards the insurance sector, Asian Alliance Insurance PLC Managing Director, Iftikar Ahamed said. In addition, being an organisation which continuously strives to be ahead in the sphere of learning and development, we are pleased to support and reward
academic achievement.

ComBank opens landmark 250th branch in Sri Lanka
	
Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe inaugurates the Banks 250th branch in the presence of Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam, Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan and senior officials ofthe Bank.

The Commercial Banks history of service to the people of Sri Lanka reached another milestone this week with the opening of the Banks 250th branch in the country.
Located within the Orion City complex at Colombo 9, the new branch represents the Banks commitment to deploy the latest in secure technology to enhance convenience to customers and promote eco-friendly operations.
The Chairman of the Bank Dharma Dheerasinghe formally inaugurated the new branch.
Modelled on the Automated Banking Centre set up by the Bank at Ward Place, Colombo 7, this self service branch will facilitate real time cash deposits, sending of requests for account opening and loans, cheque deposits, access to the Banks Online Banking facility, fund transfers, cash withdrawals, bill payments and will also provide information services such as branch locations and interest rates throughout the day.
The new branch will also be staffed by two people to provide other assistance that customers may need.
The Commercial Bank of today is unrecognisable from the bank that opened its first branch at Galewela 47 years ago, the Banks Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said. While we remain steadfast in our commitment to the ideals that drive the business, processes, technologies and customer needs have completely transformed banking, and the ever-growing concern for our planet drives further change in the way services are delivered.
Powered by a 24-hour, high-speed secure internet connection, Commercial Banks automated branches offer opening of savings accounts and fixed deposits, access to online banking, and settlement of credit card dues, as well as deposits and withdrawals via an ATM. They help customers save time by filling out the necessary documentation for opening of accounts at their leisure and completing the process by visiting a Commercial Bank branch for verification and to pick up passbooks or other documents and make initial deposits.
The Banks paperless deposit machines eliminate the need for deposit slips and envelopes, as they have a stacker than can accept and count up to 200 notes at a go, enabling customers to make deposits of up to Rs 200,000 at a time into savings or current accounts, 24 hours of the day. The same machine can also be used to pay dues on Commercial Bank credit cards.
Commercial Bank has also achieved a significant reduction in the use of paper by actively promoting the migration of customers from traditional banking channels to digital platforms such as mobile and online banking. The Banks other environment-related initiatives include programmes to reduce its carbon footprint through energy saving, energy optimisation and responsible fleet and vehicle management, responsible disposal and recycling of materials, responsible water consumption, the discontinuation of the use of products that emit ozone-depleting substances and protecting the bio diversity in areas where branchesare present.
Additionally, the bank has begun converting branches to solar power to further reduce their carbon footprint.
The expansion of Commercial Banks physical presence across the country over the last two and a half decades saw the Banks 50th branch opening at Dambulla, its 100th at Kaduruwela, 150th at Mahiyangana and the 200that Kataragama.

A supplementary estimate was presented to Parliament yesterday to seek its approval to spend a sum of Rs 17.2 million to settle the outstanding bills for the emergency medical treatment of the late Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Nayaka Thera in Singapore.
This amount is to be spent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sought the approval of the House to spend Rs 18.8 million to purchase flag cars for the Sri Lankan missions in Brussels and Kuwait, and Rs 9.1 million to purchase official vehicles for the Sri Lankan missions in Geneva and Chennai.
Approval of the House was sought to spend Rs 12.2 billion -- pay for the helicopters procured under a Russian Credit Line in 2013. This payment is to be made by the Sri Lanka Air Force.
Approval of the House was also sought for extra money to provide relief to the people as well. These included Rs. 500 million for the production of the nutritional packages given to expectant mothers, and Rs. 40 million for providing retirement benefits for the parliament staff. (Yohan Perera)

Lankan girl receives Australian visa after minister intervenes
	
The Sri Lankan girl who made headlines after being refused a temporary visa because she has Down syndrome would be allowed to live in Australia, after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton intervened in her case.
According to ABC News, the 9-year-old Eliza Fonseka had also found an unexpected ally in former Australian cricket captain Greg Chappell, who advocated for her to be granted the visa.
"I'm very excited for Eliza, I'm very excited for the family," said Chappell, who was approached to help Eliza's family by her father, a cricket coach.
"I think in this case compassion has won out." Chappell said it was the first time he had been involved in an immigration issue.
"Probably in this particular style, yes, but through the years I've been approached to support a few things and where I thought it worthy, I've been more than happy to support the cause," he said.
"I thought [this] was a very worthy cause." Eliza's parents want to work in a Christian crisis centre in remote Western Australia.
The Immigration Department last year issued them a temporary work visa but Eliza was not granted a visa because the Immigration Department said she was considered to be a "significant cost to the Australian community in the areas of health care".
That decision caused outrage in disability advocacy circles.

He said in the past the government had appointed a Sinhalese as the Northern Province Governor.
Personally we have no objection to the appointment of Reginald Coorey but by appointing a Tamil or a Muslim to this post will be another step towards reconciliation, Mr. Sivajilingam said.

Preamble to Constitution making resolution to be amended
	
The government will list the resolution to initiate the constitution making process for debate in Parliament during the next sitting week, with amendments to its preamble, officials said yesterday.
Initially, the government tried to adopt it in January. However, the SLFP including its section with the government, and other parties in the joint opposition, sought amendments to it. The joint opposition opposed the plan for the appointment of a Constitutional Assembly comprising all the members of the House. Instead, it said the proposed mechanism should be a committee of the whole House, governed purely by the procedures laid down in the relevant Standing Orders.
A government source said the parties had agreed to incorporate, more or less, the amendments sought by other parties, and therefore the resolution could be listed for debate during the next sitting week starting on February 22.
Already, the committee appointed for deliberation with the public on the constitution making process has commenced its work.
The government is planning to evolve a new Constitution in this exercise, a pledge given in the run up to the Presidential Election last year. (Kelum Bandara)

SL maid sentenced to be stoned will return next year
	
The 45-year-old Sri Lankan woman whose death sentence by stoning for adultery, was commuted by the Saudi Arabian government last December, will return to Sri Lanka in the middle of next year after completing her term of imprisonment, the Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) stated yesterday.
The woman had been working in Saudi Arabia as a housemaid when she had been convicted for adultery with a Sri Lankan youth employed there.
As a result of the Sri Lanka governments intervention pleading sympathetic consideration in the case, the Saudi Arabian government commuted the death sentence, imposing a jail term of three years.
At the time she was imprisoned, she had already spent one and half years in jail. Therefore, only another one and half years needed to be spent in jail. Her term of imprisonment ends in June next year. We will make all the arrangements to bring her back to the country after the completion of her sentence, Foreign Employment Bureau Spokesman Madushan Kularatne said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the politician who was charged with this offense had attended the sports-meet at the invitation of school Principal Malcom Peterson despite opposition from parents and teachers.
This is an insult on the entire teacher profession. The politician, who forced the teacher in charge of discipline to kneel down before him for asking his daughter to lengthen the hem of her school uniform, has attended this very same schools sports-meet as the chief guest.

UN Special Rapporteur asks SL not to be hasty
	
UN Special Rapporteur on Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence Pablo de Greiff has said that Sri Lanka should not be hasty in trying to meet its commitments to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in regard to issues of transitional justice, the New Indian Express reported.
There is no country that can accomplish all this is a short period of time. Sri Lanka has embarked on an ambitious process that should not be prepared, let alone implemented, in haste, de Greiff said in the report on his visit to Lanka between January 26 and February 1, which was released on Wednesday.
Those that are familiar with transitional processes in different parts of the world, do not expect Sri Lanka to adopt measures for the sake of demonstrating compliance with commitments that the country has made, he pointed out.
Pablo De Greiff noted that the time frame given to the Consultation Task Force on Transitional Justice suggests unrealistic expectations. The Task Force is to complete its work and report to the Prime Minister in just three months.
The UN official noted that the Lankan government has simultaneously taken up a variety of tasks, including constitutional reform, and all these will need time to complete. However, he felt that some things can be done in the short term to create confidence in the victims of war, that justice is on the cards.
Among tasks which can be done immediately, he mentioned the return of lands held by the military; launching of victims assistance programs; giving psycho-social support; toning by the judicial system, and tracing missing persons.
On the controversial Judicial Mechanism to be set up to try war crimes cases, de Greiff said that unfortunately the debate has been on the nationality of the judges and prosecutors and not in their competence.
The debate should have been on judicial competencies in addition to impartiality and independence, he said.
Identifying some of the challenges faced by the Consultation Task Force, de Greiff said that statements by the President and Prime Minister have called into question their willingness to abide by the commitments made to the UNHRC. While praising the government for appointing to the Task Force only members of civil society with a long trajectory in defense of human rights, de Greiff said that government should try to instill confidence in the consultation process by assuring that it is not a delaying tactic.

The full observations by the Special Rapporteur
I am grateful to the Government of Sri Lanka for a second invitation to undertake an advisory visit to the country (26 January to 1 February 2016) and for the excellent collaboration in the course of the visit. On this occasion I met with high Government officials both in Colombo and in Jaffna, with religious leaders and a wide variety of representatives of civil society organizations and victims groups, and the diplomatic community. The most important interlocutor during this visit, and in a sense, the main motivation for doing it at this time, was the Task Force that has been established in order to carry out the national consultations on transitional justice. I am grateful to everyone that spent time with me. Without the support of the Office of the United Nations in Sri Lanka, the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights and the United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office this trip would not have been possible. I thank them for their contribution to this visit.
National Consultations
The international community this mandate includedhad insisted on the importance of carrying out national consultations, in the conviction that redressing massive human rights violations is best done with the participation of those whose rights were violated in the first place. Consulting victims is crucial for several reasons: it constitutes in itself a mode of recognition and respect; people whose rights were violated, often in the most brutal ways, will be listened to respectfully and their views taken seriously as to the most effective ways of redressing those violations. Consulting victims is also a means of trying to guarantee a close fit between the programmes to be established and the needs and expectations of their beneficiaries; it is a way of eliciting information about topics and issues that may not be apparent; symbolically, it is another way of reaffirming the inclusive nature of society, the reintegration of victims into the community of citizens, and a way to signal to others the currency of the notion of equal rights.
It is therefore gratifying to see that a Task Force has been established in order to design and implement a national consultation on issues having to do with truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence, which are matters of legal obligation, and which were the object of commitments voluntarily undertaken by Sri Lanka when it co-sponsored a resolution on this topic at the Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2014.
Furthermore, it is particularly gratifying that the Government has decided to establish a task force made up entirely of representatives of civil society with a long trajectory in the defense of human rights. While in choosing to appoint such a task force the Government is making a bet in favour of the importance of the independence and objectivity of the consultations, the risks being taken by those who have accepted this appointment must also be appreciated. Everyones credibility is at stake here. For the sake of the integrity of the exercise, but fundamentally, for the sake of the effectiveness of victims redress, and as a consequence, for what it would say about the robustness and the seriousness of the idea of equal rights for all, of a shared sense of citizenship in Sri Lanka, this exercise must be made to work.
A difficult context
The task force is starting its deliberations, however, against a background that is far from ideal; statements by the President of Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister, as well as several ministers, seemed to call into question the willingness to abide by commitments undertaken by Sri Lanka. Comments by high level Government officials about the fate of the disappeared also created consternation amongst family members of victims. The paucity of information made public by the Government about the task force, its mandate, and the role of national consultations within an overall strategy for the adoption and the implementation of a transitional justice policy, creates uncertainty about the determination of the Government and about whether its different members are of one mind concerning this important issue.
A second feature of the background against which these discussions are taking place is a high degree of political polarization. I take the opportunity to offer a few reminders: the extraordinarily complex nature of Sri Lankan history means that there is no community which at some point or another has not had some of its members involved in human rights violations or abuses that call for redress. Transitional justice in this context is not a matter of offering redress for the violations of the rights of only one side of what has been in effect a many-sided conflict. The instrumentalization of transitional justice measures for narrow partisan political purposes undermines the legitimacy of one of the few means available for the reintegration of societies in the aftermath of mass violations and abuses. Transitional justice measures must operate on the basis of the concept of human rights and therefore truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence, as matters of right, must be accessible in virtue of having been a victim of a relevant right violation or abuse, independently of other considerations, including identity, group membership, or religion. Sri Lanka needs to avail itself of every possible means of demonstrating to all its citizens that the equality of rights is a meaningful notion in the country. Those who approach questions of truth, justice, reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence as if they were the subject of a zero sum game, a matter of interest to one community alone, do a great disservice to the country. This includes some politicians, members of the media, and even some religious leaders, who speak as if the measures will either target or benefit one group alone. So let us be clear: criminal accountability should be sought for those responsible for massive or systematic violations or abuse regardless of identity considerations; the truth that is sought is the comprehensive, even-handed account that objectively and dispassionately attempts to understand the violations or the abuses committed by members of whichever community or group may have engaged in that practice; reparations programmes should be established in order to provide benefits for people, independently of their group identity, however that may be defined, solely in virtue of having been a victim of a violation or an abuse; and finally, initiatives should be set in place in order to offer guarantees of non-recurrence not to the member of one particular community, but to all.
Against this background the country proposes to start a national consultation process that will require a great deal of attention and support; it will be taking place under circumstances in which many victims in the North, particularly, and especially women, claim that they are still the subject of intrusive surveillance, and that their concerns about security are not completely assuaged. Furthermore, the consultations will take place without previous concerted efforts to inform the population about what transitional justice is. For the consultation to have legitimacy it will be indispensable for the Government, from the highest levels on down, to convey to all sectors of society, the armed and security forces included, its commitment to and the significance of the process, and to guarantee that the consultations will proceed not only without interference from but with the support of all sectors of the state and the Government. 
Because national consultations do not lead to actionable blueprints, even less when there is so little pre-existing familiarity on the part of the general population with the instruments of transitional justice among other reasonsit will be important to think about, AND DESIGN consultations not just as a one-off opportunity, but in terms of ongoing processes; whatever measures are implemented, those will also call for established means of communicating with and proving responsive to civil society, victims in particular.
A capacity gap
The fact that consultations will not lead to actionable blueprints also means that there is a certain degree of capacity building about the topic within the Government that ought to be taking place (it also involves that the consultations should not be used as an excuse for lack of action on some fronts). While the commitment on the part of certain individuals and sectors of Government is plain to see, and plans for sign-off and deliberation mechanisms within the cabinet have been made, the articulation of even the outlines of a comprehensive transitional justice policy requires more capacities than have been available up to now. Building up these capacities is essential so that the debate can move promptly from considerations about the desirability of establishing transitional justice measures in general, to a debate about at least the contours of concrete alternatives to be finally shaped with the inputs of the consultation process.
Insisting again on a comprehensive policy
While it is understood that in some ways it is still early in the process of articulating a comprehensive transitional justice policy, the Special Rapporteur would like to offer a cautionary note about a certain lopsidedness in the discussions heretofore; most of the discussions in Sri Lanka in the recent past have concentrated on the establishment of an accountability procedure, and indeed, on a narrow dimension of such procedure, namely, the nationality of the judges. This issue should have been approached from the standpoint of the technical competencies that are necessary to make a special accountability mechanism dedicated to mass crimes, perform its functions well (in addition to crucial considerations of impartiality and independence). These skills are typically not widely available in countries that have not gone through the corresponding judicial procedures, for they do not form part of the ordinary training of lawyers, but rather specialized skills that have slowly developed over time. The discussion about the nationality of the judges, however, has displaced a discussion about the skill set that the investigation and the prosecution of these cases will require a similarly specialized set of competencies. 
The narrow focus on (one aspect of) the accountability mechanism has also displaced attention from the other components of a comprehensive transitional justice policy, namely, truth, reparations, and guarantees of non-recurrence. Each of them requires deliberate planning on its own, but also in relationship to one another. The fact that these measures will be expected to respond to a wide variety of violations, committed by all sides, not just during the end of the conflict but rather during a more extended period of time, and that therefore the universe of potential beneficiaries is both large and heterogeneous only increases the need not to allow the planning for these mechanisms to lag behind. Similarly, thought also needs to be given to how a transitional justice policy intersects with other on-going initiatives, not the least the constitutional reform project, for clearly there are some important overlaps, especially in the areas of guarantees of non-recurrence, around issues such as the independence of the judiciary, the definition of the role of the different parts of the security services and the jurisdiction of military courts, the constraints on anti-terrorist legislation, and topics as foundational as a bill of rights for all Sri Lankans.
There is no country that can accomplish all of this in a short period of time. Sri Lanka has embarked on an ambitious process that should not be prepared, let alone implemented, in haste. The time line that the task force on consultation has received suggests that there may be some unrealistic expectations about what is involved in settling complex issues in a difficult environment, in which programmes on novel areas is being considered for the first time. Those that are familiar with transitional processes in different parts of the world understand the challenges and do not expect Sri Lanka to adopt measures simply for the sake of demonstrating compliance with commitments that the country has made. What is expected is, on the one hand, for the Government to pay immediate attention to certain issues on which it can certainly act without delay (for example, on the issue of the missing, on the prompt adoption of victim assistance programmes including psycho-social support, the lingering issue of land occupied by the armed forces, to name a few), and on the other, to engage in credible processes leading to the establishment of strong institutions capable of delivering in a sustainable way robust results over time in the areas of truth, justice, reparation, and guarantees of non-recurrence.
The Special Rapporteur reaffirms his conviction that this is a historic opportunity for Sri Lanka to address past issues that nevertheless impose significant burdens on the present and the future. Addressing them correctly, while challenging, will also open crucial opportunities for the members of all communities.

Unauthorised structures along coastal belt demolished
	
All unauthorised structures along the coastal belt from Dehiwala to Mount Lavinia were demolished today by the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) with the help of the Police and the Army.
A senior official of the CCD said these unauthorized structures were demolished after giving prior notice to those who would be effected by it. He said among the structures that were taken down were restaurants and trade-stalls and that the owners had been advised to remove them before hand. He said the occupants had ignored the order, compelling the department to demolish the structures themselves.
These officials said many of the occupants of these structures had encroached even into the land reserved for the railways.
The officials had demolished the unauthorized structures using back-hoes amidst strong protests by their occupants who said they would be left without a place to conduct business after their stalls were demolished. They requested the authorities to provide them with alternate land to sell their wares, adding that their families would starve to death otherwise. (Indika Manoj Cooray and Kusal Chamath)

In a facts report on the money laundering inquiry against Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda and seven others, the CID informed Court that Wele Suda had continued to speak to drug dealers through a mobile phone and was involved in drug trafficking while in the Welikada prison.
It sought court permission to record a statement of an inmate Suranga Sampath on the incident and informed Court that Wele Suda could be penalized under the 1979 Prevention of Terrorist Act for funding the LTTE.
The CID detectives said they were checking the bank documents of another person who was said to be involved in helping Wele Suda in money laundering and sought court orders to impose a travel ban on this man who lives in Ratmalana.
The Colombo Chief Magistrate acceded to the CID request and directed the Prison authorities to produce Wele Suda in Court.
The case was put off for June 10. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
