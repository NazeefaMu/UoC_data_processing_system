Hemas eyes Lanka Hospitals

Hemas Holdings has expressed interest in acquiring a stake of state-owned Lanka Hospitals Corporation in a stock marketing filing. "Hemas as a group has been exploring opportunities in the sectors that we operate in since we are in the business since 2008," the fling further said.
This is in response to the decision by the government in disposing of shares in ventures such as Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC.
