New Customs duties
Japanese vehicle prices to soar

New Customs duties imposed on Japanese motor vehicles would discourage the trend of importing old Japanese motor vehicles into Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Customs spokesman Leslie Gamini said yesterday.
"The buyer must pay for the freight collect or freight charges which will be assessed based on the manufacturer's value of the motor vehicle, which we call the FOB, plus the transportation and the insurance cost," he added.
"There will be no reduction of charges in terms of its age. Charges are assessed solely on the basis of the manufacturer's value of the motor vehicle," he added.
"The cost is not going to be a problem for new motor vehicles, but for older ones," he explained.
"One can assume that this could raise the prices of motor vehicles in the market," he added.
Meanwhile, Co-Treasurer of the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka, A. G. Yaseer Arafath said that the increased duties imposed on Japanese cars by the government could affect their imports and the business.
"Japanese motor cars such as Toyota Aqua will go up by Rs. 700,000 - Rs. 800,000, Prius by Rs. 1.2 million, and Toyota Premio by Rs. 1 million due to new Custom duties," he said.
The Association is planning to discuss this situation with Finance Minister Ravi Karuananayaka and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
However, the situation has not affected the imports of Japaneses motor spare parts, spare parts importers said.
