His bluster was in vain


	



 

A gangling deputy from an area North of the upcountry main city went gung ho in the recent past and began taking potshots at his leader practically from every political platform. His grouse was that the boss failed to concede a place in the top team for a deserving one from his district. Of course, he meant himself when he referred to “a deserving one”.

 


Being a member of a prominent political family for several generations in the district, the politico had reason to believe that sooner or later he would be raised to top team status.


So, when he received a telephone call from his political boss the other day asking him to see him immediately, the man thought that his long-cherished dream had come true!


So, he called on the boss post-haste. As soon as he showed up, the boss went into a long harangue reminding him of a long list of wrongs he had committed including making statements to media criticizing the party leadership. Giving him no chance to a make a reply, the boss added in a firm tone: “You can rest assured you will never get a place in the top team!”


A highly dejected politico had left the place sadder, but much wiser, they say.
