MYTH: Birth control pills can cause weight gain and develop cancer.  

 

 

BUSTED: “When it comes to birth control pills, there are pills which have less amounts of estrogen. They have less effect on the body weight as well as on the lining of the womb. Birth control pills actually improve the shedding of the endometrium every month, so it doesn’t increase cancer risk of the womb. But there are some people who have found that it might increase chances of breast cancer, but that is in women who have a high risk for cancer and not in the average women. But there are pills that have less effect on weight gain,” said Dr. U.D.Prathnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician/Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital.
