Ahead of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s planned visit to China next month, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management has recommended to resume the Colombo Port City Project, a US $ 1.4 billion real estate investment by a Chinese company, it is learnt.

Cabinet clearance was also granted shortly after International Trade and Strategic Development Minister Malik Samarawickrama visited China and held talks with the Chinese authorities on a host of bilateral matters including the Port City Project.

The cabinet committee has recommended the recommencement of the project work subject to limitations and conditions stipulated by the Environmental Impact Assessment. (Kelum Bandara)
