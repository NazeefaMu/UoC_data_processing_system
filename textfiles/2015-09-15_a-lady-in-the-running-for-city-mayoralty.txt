A lady in the running for city mayoralty?


	


Now that the elections to the local bodies is round the corner, there is much speculation in political circles as to who would be the Green party’s Mayoral candidate for the city. 
According to our reports, two Green party stalwarts are already in the running for the Mayoral seat -- one is the incumbent Muzza and the other one is Rosy who failed to make it to Diyawanna at the recent general poll. 
Despite there being miles to  go before crossing the bridge, the duo, they say, have begun canvassing in earnest, each trying to get the better of the other. 
Whether Colombo will get as its Mayor an ever-young beauty or the familiar Muzza is something time will tell.
