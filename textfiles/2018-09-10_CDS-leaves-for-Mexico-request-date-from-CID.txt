Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne, who had been summoned to the CID today, had left for Mexico for official visit this morning.

Admiral Wijegunaratne had been summoned by the Criminal Investigations Department to give a statement today with regard to the abduction of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009.

CDS Spokesman Ruwan Premaweera said Admiral Wijegunaratne left the country to attend the 208th Independence Commemoration Ceremony of United Mexican States, representing Sri Lanka on the invitation of Mexican Defence Minister General Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda.

The CDS is scheduled to return on September 19.

The Spokesman said the CDS had informed the CID in writing about the visit and had requested for another date to appear before the CID.

The Colombo Fort Magistrate earlier ordered the CID to take necessary action to arrest Admiral Wijegunaratne, if there was sufficient evidence that he had aided and abetted Navy Officer Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, to evade court, where the Magisterial inquiry into the disappearance of 11 youths was underway.
