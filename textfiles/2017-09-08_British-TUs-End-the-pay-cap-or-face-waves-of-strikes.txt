UK, (Daily Mail), 7 September 2017 -  Britain’s Labour Party and trade unions yesterday threatened Prime Minister Theresa May with a fresh round of strikes unless she agrees to increases in public sector pay.  


Nurses held a demonstration in front of Parliament to demand an end to the 1 per cent cap on pay for state workers, which has been in force since 2010.  


Meanwhile, the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents civil servants, announced it will ballot its members on whether to launch a campaign of industrial action.  


John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, blamed the Prime Minister for any future strikes, saying she was ‘provoking’ public sector workers.The PCS union said civil service pay had fallen by between £2,000 and £3,500 in real terms from 2010 to 2016 – and demanded pay rises of at least 5 per cent for all public sector workers.
