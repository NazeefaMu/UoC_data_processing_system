Gun toting papas marching as to war


	



Do those who got their marching orders from the UNP some years ago, and thus are no longer members of the party have any right to hold protests or marches, to try to get rid of a Leader who has been duly elected to the position by his party?

If the protest was as it was said to be, a peaceful one, why the need to carry guns and long cinnamon poles? The excuse for the poles was that they were to be used as flagpoles, but apparently there were no flags found with them.

The organizer seems to specialize in marches if nothing else as I think this is the third one he has tried to do. We have seen in our political history, what has happened to people who tried to run too fast and tried to oust elected leaders.

Using guns, it appears, seems to run in the genes of some, when we recall some past protests and those who were caught by camera carrying and threatening people with guns.

After a lot of boasting and arrogant talk this group got only around 0.1% of the vote at the recent Local Government Elections.

One cannot fool all the people all the time! That too, is a lesson of history.


No right-thinking citizen with a love for the country will indulge in this kind of behaviour. I fail to comprehend why this march was allowed to proceed after the guns and poles were found


Provoking people, inciting people is part of rabble rousing, which can cause violence and make it spread. Our country can hardly afford this kind of loss to the economy, which causes instability, a lack of investment and hinders tourism.

No right-thinking citizen with a love for the country will indulge in this kind of behaviour. I fail to comprehend why this march was allowed to proceed after the guns and poles were found.

What has the new Minister of Law and Order done about it? Had Field Marshall Fonseka been there, I’m sure it would have been a different story!

As a Christian, I cannot understand how people take their hatred so far as to go on and on hurling slander at a person. There has to be something in their own lives, perhaps even stemming from an unhappy childhood to make them act like this. It can be a broken home, neglect or abuse, it is difficult for us who came from secure happy homes and a cosseted childhood to understand this.

Traumas of an unhappy childhood can I guess, cloud one’s entire life.

I never watch television but I know that the majority of my friends switch off their TV sets when this kind of slander is used time and again against one man, who is respected and revered, both here and far beyond our shores.

People who act like this should turn the searchlight within and find out why hatred consumes so much of their time and thought, together with an extraordinary instinct for intrigue. 

This attitude is bad and brittle leading to assertive opportunism.

Treachery of this sort usually erodes the foundation of trust, one who does this to one, can do the same thing to another and is rarely trusted by anyone.


What has the new Minister of Law and Order done about it? Had Field Marshall Fonseka been there, I’m sure it would have been a different story!


 

While ambition and hunger remain not assuaged, the desire for violence and crime will remain and bring suffering and destruction in its wake.

People who indulge in this kind of irascible opinionated behaviour give the impression that society today.

Epitomizes the dishonest, self-seeking snatch and grab winner takes it all mentality, depriving the country of all ethical values.

Their lives have probably been strewn with broken dreams, failed relationships, disappointing outcomes and broken promises from childhood on, which they now take out by venting their anger on another.

There is, however, a God above and those who hurl abuse and organize protests against Ranil will be dealt with one day in the not too distant future.

‘Vengeance is mine’ said the Lord, ‘I will repay’. White vans would have dealt with them if they had dared to do this during the past regime.


People who act like this should turn the searchlight within and find out why hatred consumes so much of their time and thought, together with an extraordinary instinct for intrigue.


There is no other politician today, as mentioned by some Buddhist clergy on the electronic media recently, whose family has contributed so much to Buddhism and the country as Ranil’s ancestors.
These words of John Buchan seem apt to describe Ranil.

“He disliked emotion, not because he felt lightly but because he felt deeply. He loved his country. Austerely, self-respectingly, he had been used to hide his devotion under a mask of indifference and would never reveal them except in deeds. To him politics was still the greatest and most honourable adventure. Our roll of honour is long but it holds no nobler figure’.
