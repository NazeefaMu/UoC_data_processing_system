The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today said that the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) should be abolished as the initial solution to this issue without referring to any other alternatives.

While referring to the Medical Faculty Deans discussion on transferring SAITM to Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said that a solution should be given to the students in the SAITM secondarily following the abolish of the SAITM.

“The abolishing of SAITM and the transferring of the SAITM to SLIIT are two different issues. As the initial step, the SAITM should be abolished. There is no other solution. Secondarily, a fair solution should be given to students in the SAITM. The related authorities should have to get this as two different issues,” he added.

He also said that transferring of the SAITM to SLIIT or establishment of private medical college in the SLIIT should have to be discussed in a separate forum and added that the related authorities to the SAITM issue should have focus on the disputed issue.

He said that the GMOA would take stern actions by protesting of the SAITM issue even in the future if they would not be provided with a justifiable solution at the earliest by the authorities.

Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge reiterated the fact in a news conference that a presidential commission should be established to investigate on the issues relating to SAITM and the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
