Mano Tittawella has been appointed as the Secretary General of the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) with effect from March 29 this year, a statement issued by the SCRM said today.

The SCRM, which is the apex body created by the Cabinet in December to coordinate all reconciliation related activities in Sri Lanka, is established under the Prime Minister’s Office.
The Secretary General reports directly to the Prime Minister and through him the President.

Accordingly, Abesinghe Arachchige Dayananda was appointed to the post of Head of Establishments.

Meanwhile, the statement said the members to the recently enacted Office of Missing Persons (OMP) will be appointed by the Constitutional Council and will be accountable directly to the Parliament of Sri Lanka.

Mr. Tittawella is neither the secretary nor a member of the OMP, it said.
