Agony of Lower-Middle Class and Disintegration of Liberal State
	

ith almost universal literacy and high levels of educational attainment among many of the adult citizens in the country, one would have expected by now overwhelming public support for a State based on secular, liberal values. Yet, the country continues to be highly divided on fundamental, secular democratic values. Religious leaders at all levels, people who offer solutions to existential problems based on superstition, age old archaic rituals, semi-literate monks who have subverted the teaching of Gauthama Buddha to prop up a populist religion that blends with day to day politics of the land and politicians who thrive on primordial divisions among people, continue to have great influence on large segments of the population including the so-called educated opinion makers and have the ability to sway public opinion on matters of great social, economic and political significance at a critical time like the run up to a crucial national election.
This situation clearly indicates that, despite many decades of democratic rule and rapid expansion of school and university education in the country following political independence, the large swathes of the population remain uncommitted to social, cultural and political values that underpin modern, secular democracies in many other parts of the world. How do we explain this situation There is no simple answer. In this article, an attempt is made to explain this paradoxical situation by looking at some of the post independence policies that continue to produce and reproduce social and cultural divisions that underpin political and ideological divisions in society. 
As is well known, Sri Lankan political elites at the time of political independence had a broadly liberal political and economic outlook. Despite a large rural population dependent on an expanding small-holder peasant economy, the countrys economy was widely identified as an export import economy dependent largely on the export of a few plantation products. Moreover, society was polarised between an urban, English-educated elite and a mass of vernacular educated rural peasants. It is this state of affairs that came under severe criticism from both the left and the Sinhala Buddhist nationalists. It is the mobilisation of these social forces through a popular democratic process that brought about the 1956 political transformation.
The emergent post-1956 political formation had both ethno-nationalist and social democratic connotations as is evident from a myriad of state policies that were subsequently adopted. These included Sinhala only policy, vernacular education policy, segregation of schools on ethno-linguistic and religious lines, import substitution industrialisation, land reforms, protection of labour and peasant rights, expansion of peasant settlements through irrigation rehabilitation and colonisation schemes, expansion of the state sector through increased public services, etc. All these policies together contributed to a significant expansion of the lower middle class creating opportunities for upward social mobility for rural and urban lower classes.
Yet, by the early 1970s, a rapidly expanding population coupled with rising aspirations for upward mobility among youths belonging to all ethnic communities gave rise to unrest among educated segments of the population as was clearly evident from the 1971 JVP uprising followed by youth agitations in the north. Liberally oriented political opposition at the time saw the emerging crisis entirety as a failure of the state domination over a closed economy and sought to swing the pendulum to the other extreme by adopting an unregulated open economic policy. 
What happened under the post -1977 open economic polices has been widely examined and documented and therefore, needs no detailed elaboration here. Suffice it to say that the socioeconomic order that came into being after 1956 was not critically evaluated looking at its negative and positive elements and no attempt was made to adopt policies that would have reversed the negative trends while building on more socially and economically desirable aspects. A few illustrative examples can help explain the emergent situation here. 

"English language has been widely accepted as the major link in global business and communication"

As already mentioned, the large state sector consisting of pervasive state services, import substitution industries, diverse specialised state institutions, extension services, etc. absorbed most of the vernacular educated, upwardly mobile youth in large numbers creating a massive rural lower middle class. Many of them over time reached very high positions in the state sector. But, with economic liberalisation , private corporate sector emerged as the dominant and lucrative sector of the economy. Privatisation of state enterprises including plantations reinforced this trend.
Meanwhile, the English language, which was largely pushed to the background until 1977 emerged as an increasingly significant language of communication and business in the emergent globalised economy, creating the demand for English language skills. Increasing demand for English led the the proliferation of English language classes, expansion of urban private schools and the establishment of dozens of international schools. Yet, the neglecting of teaching English in the public school system for decades gave rise to a mostly monolingual teacher population, making it virtually impossible for rural children to acquire basic English language skills.
Many people migrated to the Middle East and elsewhere for employment in order to earn money to spend on their childrens education in private and international schools. Others sought to find places in urban schools. But, by now, the capacity of most state schools to impart English language skills had dwindled so that even most of those who were admitted to Royal College in Colombo left school with little or no English language skills. Meanwhile, many well-to-do families dispatched their children overseas for education. 
The result of the above developments was a clear polarisation of the countrys education system. While the vast majority of rural schools remained ill equipped to cater to the emergent demand for English language and other skills, private and international schools in urban centres prepared children and youth from more privileged socio-economic backgrounds for more lucrative employment in the private sector, international agencies
and overseas.
The vast majority of rural lower and lower middle class families dependent mostly on vernacular schools for their children s education realised that the life chances of the latter were severely restricted by their education. Meanwhile, the stagnation of the rural agricultural economy and rural industrial enterprises due to conditions created by the open economy, also restricted income opportunities in the countryside at a time when the need for monetary incomes also increased rapidly due to the proliferation of private health, education and transport services. 

"The situation in many fast growing economies like India, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore is quite different"

Many rural lower and lower middle class families responded to increasing social and economic pressures by adapting to the changing circumstances in numerous ways. Many people migrated to the Middle East for employment. Many young men dropped out of school and migrated to urban centres to find employment as drivers, construction workers, informal sector activists, etc. Many women also migrated to city centres as domestic workers, pavement hawkers, sales workers, etc. But, all these options were a far cry from their long cherished aspirations for upward social mobility through education. While many with educational qualifications could still find lower rung positions in state institutions and become members of the large lower middle class, many others could not even do so. This is clearly evident from the fact that thousands of graduates passing from public universities could not find employment in the private sector and had to wait till the governments recruited them for non-existent jobs in government institutions. Persisting unemployment of graduates despite such ad hoc measures shows that there is no solution to this problem.
Meanwhile, increasing consumer aspirations and growing economic pressure made their lives an increasingly agonising experience. Colombo continues to be the focal point of the economy, creating income opportunities for many rural people who look for non-agricultural employment. It is also the place where the best social infrastructure facilities like well equipped hospitals, public and private educational institutions, etc. are concentrated. Making use of such facilities is often beyond the means of people living in the far away provinces. Yet, they can easily see the widening disparities between rural and urban areas. 
Being brought up, socialised and conditioned in a mostly ethno-linguistically segregated educational, cultural and social environment, several generations of rural inhabitants have been receptive to ethno-nationalist interpretations of their predicament in the context of the post-independence political environment where many political parties and their leaders have sought their political fortunes through the mobilisation of political support on the basis of ethno-religious loyalties. Moreover, post 1977 liberal economic reforms have also been widely perceived by the members of the rural lower and lower middle classes as a way of undermining the moral economy established in the 1950s and the 60s by disturbing the rural urban balance in terms of equitable life chances, creating huge income disparities and bringing back the English educated urban elites, marginalising the vernacular educated rural intelligentsia.

"Many well-to-do parents prefer international school education for their children"
The lack of diversification of the economy over several decades due to diverse circumstances flushed out many people out of relatively stable rural agricultural communities, making many of them itinerant workers in Sri Lanka and overseas, with almost no formal social protection. Job creation has not been the main objective of economic growth in the country for decades. Structure of employment and income shows this clearly. What we have is a very narrow employment pyramid, indicating the relatively small size of the middle class. This situation frustrates many people in the lower segments of society. The situation in many fast growing economies like India, China, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore is quite different. 
In conclusion, it is not difficult to understand why the members of a vast rural lower middle class in the country feel that they have been dislodged from the post independence moral economy that flourished in the 1950s and the 60s, which was also largely shaped by ethno-nationalism. Given the fact that nationalist discourse has been an integral part of the post independence political discourses in the country, many ardent nationalists have interpreted social and economic inequalities in terms of the competition for scare resources as one among ethno-religious groups, ignoring its obvious social class connotations. This is widely accepted by the members of the large lower-middle class in Sri Lanka, particularly in the rural hinterland where nationalist politicians and their ideologues have an almost captive audience.

All we want for Christmas is A New Government
	
Christmas and New Year Celebrations in light of political and economic crises
A majority of vendors, shoppers and pedestrians had one thing at the top of their wish list- a political leader, who would ensure public welfare and relief.
In spite of a rather disheartening, bleak political situation, the crowds in Pettah were bustling in swarms. Fluctuating living costs, rising dollar rates and continued instability have set the theme for this years festivities. 

For Shirani Dawlagala of Maharagama Christmas was something she could not avoid celebrating.
No matter how high prices rise, Christmas is something we cannot avoid celebrating, she said.
N.M.N Mohommad Asmin, the chairperson of the Pettah Public Market delved into recent struggles as both a businessman and a breadwinner.
He explained that his sale of festival decorations had faced many setbacks this time around; higher wholesale prices, less hired helpers and an apparent fall in customers to name a few.
Last year we sold this item for less than Rs. 200, this year its Rs.250 or more. Even still, we are barely making profits. he said.
We have fallen into a great deal of hardship. Due to the political mess, we are caught in, the consumer has no money, the Council workers arent paid...
He continued that they had had no relief for the losses incurred as a consequence of political uncertainties. 
We havent received school uniforms, books, shoes so far. I have four children and I have to spend at least fifteen thousand on each child for these.
However, there were also some who perceived the countrys status in a positive light.
Roshan Samsudeen from Wattala has been maintaining his Christmas Tree business for five years now. He claimed that he had not noticed a notable change in business, due to the politics of the country.
He also believes that since the political crisis had been settled, some good would come of it.
He expressed content with regard to the decision of the authorities to relocate the throng of street vendors on the pavements in a common market area.
In his opinion, its only appropriate that they set up in their allocated spaces instead of taking to the streets to attract more business.
Amidst Christmas shopping were also preparations for the New Year; countless mothers bargaining for school uniforms, books and stationery.
Wijayanthi Rajakaruna from Wadduwa was among them.
Regardless of political turmoils, life has to go on, she said.
When asked what changes she had encountered during her end of year shopping in light of recent events, she responded;
Regardless of political events, our lives go on. Our children are starting school and we are busy with that. Politics seem to only benefit those in power, we are just inconvenienced.
Children looked forward to Christmas all year and hence skipping it was no longer an option, according to Darshini Jeyapragasam from Wattala.
We celebrate Christmas because we have little children. Just like buying school books in December, it has turned into something we must do, she said.
New Year resolutions are generally based on personal change and alteration. This year, however, most have resolved that a change in government was what the future needed.

"Last year we sold this item for less than Rs. 200, this year its Rs.250 or more. Even still, we are barely making profits"
Shirani Dawlagala elaborated on how the common man carried all the burden and made all the sacrifices, but the power grabbers enjoyed all the rewards.
A group of intelligent people must be elected into office to replace these crooks. We work hard; study in Universities ,and make do with small jobs. We wait around 60 years for our pension, while they can get it in a matter of five-six years, she said.
A similar sentiment was expressed by Kusum Imiamottige from Kadawatha:
If we make an unbiased observation of the countrys political situation, both sides are wrong...Parties dont matter to us as long as they fix the country, improve the economy and provide education and employment to the youth.
Although the masses were divided in, where their support lay, they were generally in agreement that the New Year must bring stability, selflessness and honesty in the way the nation is led.
Regardless of strife, Christmas decorations are being put up, Christmas sales are in full swing and Christmas shopping is underway.
Regardless of ethnic and religious differences, the New Year is awaited by all, with the hope that living costs will plunge and living standards will surge through able leadership.

Christmas is something we cannot avoid celebrating
Shirani Dawlagala from Maharagama, a Secretary
No matter how high prices rise, Christmas is something we cannot avoid celebrating.
There should absolutely be a change in Government. A group of intelligent people must be elected into office to replace these crooks. We work hard; study in universities, and make do with small jobs. We wait around 60 years for our pension, while they can get it in a matter of five-six years.


Government has been restored
Roshan Samsudeen from Wattala, Christmas tree business
Now that the Government has been restored to its original state, some good will come of it.


We need a change of government
N.M.N Mohommad Asmin, the chairperson of the public market
 We have fallen into a great deal of hardship. Due to the political mess, we are caught in, the consumer has no money, the town workers arent paid..
It is the public who bear the burden of even the rising dollar rates, the current leaders do not understand what has to be done. 
We didnt receive school uniforms this year, no books, no shoes nor bag. I have four children and I have to spend at least fifteen thousand on each one.
I believe we need a change of government. I am a strong UNP supporter, but its undeniable that while MR was in power, he made a difference.
We have no relief. We were told that from the 1st of next month, all these street merchants will be removed. This is unfair, we have never asked anything from the government, but we are the ones carrying the burdens.
Last year we sold this item for less than Rs. 200, this year its nothing less than Rs.250. Even still, we are barely making profits.
If we stop work, well have to starve
A.M Saleem from Wattala
Whatever happens, we have to stretch our arms and legs and get to work, if we stop well have to starve.


We celebrate Christmas because we have little children
Darshini Jeyapragasam from Wattala
We celebrate Christmas because we have little children. Just like buying school books in December, it has turned into something we must do.


Parties dont matter to us as long as they fix the country
Kusum Imiyamottige from Kadawatha
If we made an unbiased observation of the countrys politics, both sides are wrong...Parties dont matter to us as long as they fix the country, improve the economy, provide education and employment to the youth.


A change would be good
Kumari Wickramaarachchi from Kasbawa
A change would be good. Our only hope lies in a General Election.


Everyone must be removed and replaced
Wijayanthi Rajakaruna from Wadduwa
Regardless of political events, our lives go on. Our children are starting school and we are busy with that. Politics only benefits those in power. We are inconvenienced when roads are obstructed.
There should be a change, the only thing that has changed is that instability has worsened.
The government must change. Everyone must be removed and replaced. It would be good if a new government that benefits the people is made.

Bus fares down by 4% from Thursday night
	
The bus fares will be reduced by four per cent effective from Thursday (26) midnight, Transport Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said today.
He made the announcement at a media briefing at the Ministry with several bus associations, three-wheeler associations and All-Island School Children Transport Association (AISCTA).
He also said there would be no change in the minimum bus fare of Rs.12. The Minister said the bus fare stages which are at Rs.15, Rs.20, Rs.24, Rs.29, Rs.38 and Rs.43 would drop by Rs.1. Rs.34, Rs.41, Rs.46, Rs.49 and Rs.52 would drop by Rs.2. The highest fare Rs.965 would drop down by Rs.41 and it would be Rs.924.
Minister Ranatunga said the decision was taken following the announcement made by the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to reduce the fuel prices from last Friday (21) night. In line with the bus fare reduction, three-wheeler associations and the school children, Transport Associations decided to reduce their fares as well. Accordingly, three-wheeler associations agreed to reduce the fare of the first kilometre by Rs. 10 - from Rs.60 to Rs. 50. From midnight on Wednesday, charges for the first kilometre would be Rs.50.
Meanwhile, AISCTA said their fares would be reduced by three per cent from Wednesday night. At the media briefing, the Minister further added that he would do the best so that people are benefited by fuel price reductions. If the oil price in the world market drops down further, the fuel prices in our country would come down accordingly but that could also happen the other way around, the Minister said. The transport service had become an important service comparing to the education and health services in our country. As such, more priority should be given to the transport sector, Minister Ranatunga said.
While issuing a special notice, National Transport Commission (NTC) Chairman M.A.P. Hemachandra said an interim bus fare revision has been granted by the NTC effective from December 27 in the terms of the National Bus Fares Policy, in order to compensate the decrease in fuel price. The full fare in respect of approved inter-provincial, normal, semi-luxury, luxury and super luxury services implemented by the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) and Private Passenger Transport Services will be displayed for the information of bus passengers, owners, crews, authorities, and the general public.
Mr Hemachandra also said stern action would be taken against any operator who charges fares in excess of the approved fare.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Celebrating Christmas 2018 as a time for Creating harmony and seeking reconciliation
	

he core message and challenge of Christmas embody a powerful call to foster the goodwill of all and an imperative for efforts at creating harmony and seeking reconciliation of differences. It involves easing tensions, calming anger and contention, resolving conflicts and exercising restraint in all matters, initiating dialogue in patience and establishing mutual understanding between divergent ideological positions, as well as healing the wounds incurred and restoring law and order which guarantee a peaceful society of justice and solidarity. Despite the valid legal attempts made to tame the constitutional crisis, the recent political upheavals and corresponding social disturbances call all, both those at the helm of government and citizens as well of our dear motherland to give serious thought to re-discovering the lost national cohesion and the international prestige of our country whilst ushering in paths of political stability, economic recovery, national security and ethnic harmony.
The country in all its modern history had never been so severely strained under such pain, anxiety, scandal and disruption, the like of which even the civil society had never ever seen before. One is reminded of the sad eras of invasions by our former colonial rulers of this blessed land, known as Tambapanni to King Vijaya, Serendib to the Arabs and Tabrobane to the Greeks. A very serious question looms large over the horizons as we gaze in wonder at the mighty oceans that surround us, the graceful rivers that flow down and streams that trickle by, glazing mountains of the hill country with their mighty water-falls cascading, adding grace and luster to our landscape: What in the heavens has befallen this Dhamamadeepa of ours after 70 long years of liberation from the clutches of foreign rule, with the country finally coming into our own hands as on a platter
Early Challenges
In any growth process there are ups and downs as in evolution there are natural selections and random mutations. As a nation newly freed and able to take our destiny in our own hands, we had a plethora of resources both in terms of human and natural endowments in our country. We were well away in our system of education with the social fabric steady and healthy. Being a repository and sanctuary of four of the worlds greatest and living religions, Sri Lanka had a strong religiously cultural and socially cohesive structure. What was needed was a strong and stable political movement to keep the country well-anchored in her prosperity and growth. It is unfortunate, that the country and its pawned people became the battleground for party-politics vying for power purely driven by greed even at the present moment of national disaster.

"Sri Lanka had a strong religiously cultural and socially cohesive structure"

The agricultural economy of the early independence era should have been consolidated with our farmers and paddy fields taken to the fore. Agricultural farming could have been modernized with the latest technology as we ventured into the 1950s. The political upheavals were on the prowl already by this time with the capitalistic rightist ideology on one side and the socialistic leftist ideology intruding from the other side. Battles were drawn polarizing the country for a long time along these two major treks, until the open economy appeared in the late 1980s with an executive presidential form of government that enjoyed absolute power on many fronts until it
came to an unprecedented crisis about three years ago. There was an outcry either to abolish or at minimum to reduce the excessive powers of the executive presidency.
The Burning Issues
Our foreign relations went helter-skelter too between being beholden to the capitalistic western nations and socialistic eastern nations as well as some nations of the Middle-East. Once it was the USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy and Japan which were our great benefactors. Then there was a radical swing towards China and India. The relations with these latter countries proved very difficult, since they were and are still, the biggest powers in Asia. It was difficult for governments to walk the way of the non-aligned path that she had taken at the Bandung conference in 1955. At Bandung in Indonesia in April, 1955, representatives from 29 governments of Asian and African nations gathered to discuss peace and the role of the Third World in the Cold War, economic development, and decolonization. The core principles of the Bandung Conference were political: self-determination, mutual respect for sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality. These issues were of central importance to all participants in the conference, most of which had recently emerged from colonial rule. The delegates built upon the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, worked out in negotiations between India and China in 1954, as they sought to build solidarity among recently independent nations.
The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the United Nations members and contain 55% of the world population. These two historical institutions were of immense importance to Sri Lanka viz-a-viz her international relations and integration into the community of worlds nations. Internally, a false extremist trend of nationalism based on hatred towards anything that was foreign and divisive politics that preyed on the ignorance of the rural masses, paved the way to instability oftentimes.
Battle for Power
It was unfortunate that within the domain of internal politics, parties and people became polarized into two major blocks of the UNP and the SLFP. In the meanwhile, rural people felt left in the lurch and youth violence began to emerge in early 1970s. They wanted their right to good employment and quality education for the rural youth. Having failed in many ways at making their voices being heard, they took to insurrectional violence threatening institutions and political authority. Hundreds of thousands of our youth were killed in this rebellion which raised its head again in the mid 80s. In both cases, state violence was unleashed to quell the rebellions. It was resorted to sometimes in very cruel, inhuman and crude ways. Mass deaths and mass graves were the inevitable results of this
national tragedy.

"Weak coalition govts. became the order of the day until recently the two major parties decided to work as a national govt."
The culture of violence came to a hilt in the 30-year ethnic war that really throttled Sri Lanka in a terrible way, slowing down also its economy. Armaments had to be bought and the military maintained. These 30 years of war and terrorism sank the country in misery as never before and is greatly to be blamed on an unjust and bloated false nationalism as well as a plethora of social injustices that ensued there-from. Everyone began to realize that politics and government based on religion, race, language and ethnicity would end up in inevitable disaster. Also the fact, that no political party at elections mustered an absolute majority, prevented the formation of a strong legislature.
The Way Forward
Weak coalition governments became the order of the day until recently the two major parties decided to work together as a national government having agreed on a common agenda for developing the country. It is at this point that a crisis came over due to policy and ideology clashes within the ranks of the government and aggravated by a radical decision from the Executive giving rise to an unprecedented political imbroglio. This crisis will not be solved easily unless there is conversion of heart and goodwill for collaboration once again with the interest of the common good of country at heart on the part of politicians and political parties. The people at large also need education on this important issue for the country to move forward. They should not allow themselves to be bullied into fanciful party manifestos which tend to hypnotize them into false dreams. Mistakes must be humbly accepted and all errors corrected forthwith.
Having learned enough and more from this national tragedy, politicians, civil society and people in general (the hoi polloi) must stand together in bringing the nation out of its current chaos and impasse, shock and confusion. There has been an avalanche of errors and bad discernment spilling up all fronts in the rank and file of political authority: the executive, the parliament and political leadership. It is unjust to carry the masses as well into this mess who would still be blissfully ignorant of the depth of misery this constitutional crisis involves. The professionals and the intelligentsia of the nation must intervene to help translate this crisis into a moment of opportunity for insight, enlightenment and growth.

Christmas Message of Bishop of Colombo: Walk in the light of God in times of darkness
	
At a time of uncertainty, darkness, and chaos in our dear land, let us resolve to walk in the light of Jesus so that the light of the incarnation would illuminate the darkness that threatens to engulf us all, Rt. Revd. Bishop of Colombo Dhiloraj R. Canagasabey said in his Christmas message.
Christmas invites us to reflect on the duality or paradox and reminds us of the humility, servant-hood and sacrificial death of Jesus the Messiah and of the path that we followers of the Master must ourselves tread, he said in his message.
The Message said:
We approach the end of another calendar year and the dawn of the Christmas season. For us humans, it is so very easy to lose focus, when something becomes too familiar and this is more so with Christmas.
The many external elements associated with this deeply spiritual festival of the coming into this world of a baby who scripture refers to as lmmanuel - God himself with us, hides and makes us forget the true meaning and significance of Christmas.

"The many external elements associated with this deeply spiritual festival of the coming into this world of a baby who scripture refers to as Immanuel - God himself with us, hides and makes us forget the true meaning and significance of Christmas"
The Gospel writers, Mathew and Luke do not also hide the striking paradoxes between the nature of this baby, who is referred to as the Messiah, Prince of Peace, Saviour, Christ the Lord, Holy One, Son of the Most High, King of the Jews......,on the one hand, and the circumstances of his birth on the other; in the backyard of a lodging house, to a carpenter and his humble peasant wife, his first visitors, keepers of animals, very low, down in the social hierarchy.
This duality is seen right through the short earthly life of Jesus, hailed as the, Teacher, Master, Rabbi, Anointed One, Messiah, Son of God, he prefers to refer to himself as the Son of Man, as one come to serve, rather than to be served, as having no place of his own to rest.
Finally, he is publicly executed like a common criminal.
Christmas invites us to reflect on this duality or paradox and reminds us of the humility, servant-hood and sacrificial death of Jesus the Messiah and of the path that we followers of the Master must ourselves tread.
The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; On those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned. (Isaiah 9:2-7)
At a time of uncertainty, darkness, and chaos in our dear land, let us resolve to walk in that light so that the light of the incarnation will illuminate the darkness that threatens to engulf us all.
I wish all our peoples a blessed, meaningful and joyful season of Christmas and Gods Peace in the New Year.

Father sees stars after seeing results of son's 'training'
	
A brand new trishaw was gifted by a man to his son for his birthday although he did not possess a driving license neither did he have the ability to drive the vehicle.
Therefore his son went to a driving school with the idea of leaning how to drive. In the meantime his father drove the vehicle.
The boy learnt the basics of driving and was even given a thorough training on vehicle maintenance at the driving school. After he returned home he decided to put his vast knowledge into practice and started to check the vehicle paying particular attention on the battery, coolant that was used as well as whether there was sufficient air in the tyres.
As the lecturer instructed him, he searched for the place where the water was added and discovered that there was no place to put the water to cool the engine. He was now faced with a dilemma. He read the manual from top to bottom but there was nothing about the cooling system in that manual. He contacted his best friend and told him his problem. His friend, who liked to pull pranks on his friend now and then, advised him to put the water into the petrol tank and to fill it up. He took his friend's advice and filled up the petrol tank with water. When his father came back, he told him what he had done. When questioned by his father on where he got this idea from he admitted that he was just following advice given to him by his friend. The boy's father had to break the news to him that he had been taken for a ride by his friend. The man then got a friend who was a mechanic to come and remove the water from the petrol tank and put the vehicle back in order.(Pushpakumara Mallawaarachchi )

he inordinate interest shown by Western states and their Colombo-based diplomats in Sri Lankas political imbroglio, sparked off by the President Maithripala Sirisenas sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Oct. 26, formed an interesting side-show to the actual political developments as they played out in the country. The actions and statements of these emissaries, even as events continue to unfold, offer much food for thought about the motivation behind this unnatural focus on an internal
Sri Lankan conundrum.
Following the proroguing of parliament by the president, and then its dissolution, there was a raft of statements from diplomats of the US, UK, Canada and the EU demanding that Sri Lankas parliament should be reconvened. In moves that raised eyebrows, a group of them met with the ousted PM, and a delegation, accompanied by the UN resident representative for good measure, met the Speaker of parliament to influence him to this end. They warned of inimical consequences. The EU threatened to withdraw GSP+ concessions; a former US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power even suggested targeted sanctions. Two outspoken former Sri Lankan ambassadors to the UN - Tamara Kunanayagam and Dr. Palitha Kohona have described this behaviour as unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, alleging the Western envoys conduct is in breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
One only has to reverse the situation and imagine how one of these Western countries would react if a diplomat from a lesser power on the world stage took similar liberties, to understand the imperial arrogance at play here. If a Sri Lankan ambassador in Washington publicly made gratuitous judgements on political controversies in the US  whether they be allegations of Russian meddling, Trumps immigrant policies, unilateral sanctions against third parties trading with US enemies, or whatever - how would the US react There is established diplomatic protocol for envoys to observe while serving in their host countries, but it appears what is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander.
Sri Lankas judiciary has ruled on the clash between executive and legislature that was fast spiralling out of control and, for now, a semblance of order has been restored. There may be subterranean currents of discontent and intrigue in an underlying structural crisis that is yet to unfold in full. Instability is likely to persist till people have their say in a parliamentary election that reveals the true balance of forces.
Western diplomats who were the subject of some media interest as they sat, all agog in the gallery of parliament and in the court houses, tracking Sri Lankan events at micro-level, have breathed a collective sigh of relief with the exit of Mahinda Rajapaksa and reinstatement of Western-friendly Wickremesinghe as PM. Their statements this time around referred to readiness to support sustainable and accountable reform and human rights (UK), support for national reconciliation and prosperity for all (EU), calls to deliver on accountability, constitutional reform and reconciliation (Canada). One may ask what the connection is, between accountability, constitutional reform, national reconciliation etc. and a court ruling on the legality of a move made by Sri Lankas president to dissolve parliament. 
It is not without reason that the human rights-accountability-reconciliation-constitutional reform refrain has surfaced again, and at this moment in time. In order to see the full picture, it is useful to take note that these statements come from countries lying outside the geographical area where claims are nowadays being voiced, to being stakeholders in the Indian Ocean. It may be noticed that countries that do assert themselves in this maritime region, in their comments all mention Indian Ocean or Indo-Pacific. Sri Lanka is described as a valued partner in the Indo-Pacific(US); a longstanding friend and partner in the Indian Ocean (Australia); and commitment is expressed towards achieving peace, stability and prosperity in Sri Lanka and the Indo Pacific (Japan). Both categories of countries  those making claims in the Indian Ocean and those who have less maritime presence, have the same strategic focus  a geographic location at the cross-roads of vital sea lanes, the control of which may determine who rules the world in years ahead.
Sri Lankas closest neighbour India, whose concerns about what goes on in Sri Lanka are historical, and more understandable, made no mention of the Indian Ocean or Indo Pacific. It said As a close neighbour and true friend, India welcomes the resolution of the political situation in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas internal affair was not a preoccupation for most countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

"Instability is likely to persist till people have their say in a parliamentary election that reveals the true balance of forces"
Western countries that cannot make direct hegemonic claims in the Indian Ocean, but need to make common cause with those that do, have a Sword of Damocles in the form of the Geneva resolutions to rein in Sri Lanka and make it an obedient client. It may be recalled that the Canadian High Commissioner in his initial reaction to the events of Oct 26, made reference to the Geneva commitments when he said (to the puzzlement of many): The Government of Sri Lanka needs to take concrete steps to meet its commitments to its own people - and the international community - with respect to accountability, transitional justice and ending impunity.<U+200E>
The desire to assert dominance in the geopolitical great game in the Indian Ocean goes a long way to explain the over-the-top reactions of Western states to Sri Lankas political in-fighting. The most candid admission of the real reasons for the Western need to protect Wickremesinghe, and be rid of Rajapaksa, was made by former US ambassador to Sri Lanka Robert Blake. In an article published in the Daily Mirror of Dec 7. Blake made reference to the likelihood of a Rajapaksa (Gotabhaya) victory in a possible upcoming presidential election, and issued a veiled warning of consequences a future SLPP government might suffer on account of losing favour with the US. While the usual references to democracy and good governance were made, he soon got to the real reason for preoccupation with this Indian Ocean island. Shedding crocodile tears for the difficulties that Hambantota port project ran into, he suggested that Sri Lanka, among others participants in Chinas Belt and Road Initiative, would be better off with the USs counter-funding mechanisms such as Millennium Challenge and International Development Finance Corporation  as Xi Jinping doubles down on BRI and continues projects that will give Beijing the capacity to exert control over international waters in the South China Sea. 
In a world order moving towards multi-polarity, and in which western dominance is increasingly challenged, is this an example of how the US deploys an insidious combination of carrot and stick to cling to its slipping status as the worlds superpower What is important for Sri Lanka is that Western motivation needs to be seen for what it is (not what they SAY it is). It is the Sri Lankan people who must decide whether a Wickremesinghe or a Rajapaksa (or someone else) will be Prime Minister.

Government consults AG
	
The government has decided to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on the possibility of increasing the Cabinet of Ministers to 32 according to what they say is included in the Constitution, it is learnt.
A minister had suggested that a legal ambiguity existed with regards to the number of ministers to be included in the Cabinet in the event of it being a one party government.
The confusion had started when the new 30-member Cabinet was sworn in, which included the President and the Prime Minister as those holding ministerial posts.
The UNP on the other hand, was of the view that the 30-member Cabinet should not include the President and the Prime Minister as they should be counted separately with the final total coming to 32. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

I won't join UNP: Duminda
	
UPFA MP and former Minister Duminda Dissanayake today rejected reports of him joining the UNP and said he has no intention of doing so.
Responding to journalists outside the Presidents residence following an SLFP electoral organisers meeting, he said he would never join the UNP.
When asked about the new found harmony between the SLFP and the SLPP, Mr. Dissanayake said he was always of the view that the SLFP should be strengthened and it was the home for everyone.
The home accommodates everyone. However, those who criticised the SLFP had clearly realised what they have done. When asked about their new membership, they say nothing today. They say they are UPFA members. The entire country saw how they obtained membership of other parties. There were posters as well. I always stood by whats right and thats why I backed President Maithripala Sirisena when he became the common candidate. Our policies should focus on the country and its future generation and not on whimsical political developments, he said.
At the electoral organisers meeting, he said they discussed creating a broader alliance to contest elections. Thats all I can reveal at the moment. We decided not to reveal our tactics, he said.

Pakistan ex-PM Sharif sent back to jail for corruption
	
Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been sent back to jail after a fresh corruption conviction, BBC reported a short while ago.
The anti-corruption court in Islamabad has given Sharif a seven-year term for investments beyond his declared assets.
Sharif, who denies wrongdoing, was jailed in July in a different corruption case but bailed on appeal when the Islamabad High Court suspended his 10-year sentence in September.
Security around the court in Islamabad was tight for Monday's verdict.
The former ruling party - the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz - had threatened to start a mass protest movement and disrupt parliamentary business if its leader wassent back to prison.
Sharif has said the charges against him are politically motivated and is expected to appeal against his latest conviction.
The accountability court said he could not prove the source of income for ownership of al-Azizia steel mill in Saudi Arabia.
It acquitted him in a second case, Flagship Investment, in the UK for lack of evidence.
His two sons, Hassan and Hussain, who are not in Pakistan, were declared absconders by the court.
Sharif was arrested inside the court and is expected to be transferred to jail soon, BBC said quoting Dawn News.

SL lost its credibility after recent political turmoil: Kiriella
	
Sri Lanka had been a model to other countries during the past two years but due to arbitrary acts, we lost that in a short period of time, Minister Lakshman Kiriella said addressing the media today after assuming duties as the Minister of Public Enterprise, Kandyan Heritage and Kandy Development.
However, we would be able to turn it back. All of them thought that the UNPers would join and follow other parties after removing Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe from his post or after breaking the party apart.
"If we allow the President with his executive powers to appoint a Prime Minister, future presidents would tend to appoint every Prime Minister according to his choice. That's why we struggled in Parliament to establish proper precedence to elect a Prime Minister who has a majority in parliament. If we had endorsed the President's action this would provide bad precedence to the future generation," the Minister said.
It has been forty years since the introduction of the post of Executive Presidency and no Supreme Court has stood against the decisions taken by an Executive President in that time. Due to recent political conflicts, our country had gone back. Therefore, weve lost people's faith and trust.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

SLPP challenges PM to bring in motion to dissolve parliament
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today challenged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to bring in a motion to dissolve parliament.
Addressing a news briefing, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said they were ready to support the United National Party (UNP) if it submits a motion to dissolve parliament. "We also invite the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is a branch of the UNP, to accept this challenge.
Unlike the previous opposition comprised of the JVP and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), we won't allow the UNP to misbehave.
We will criticise their wrong moves. What we have today is a genuine opposition which won't dance to the tune of the UNP," he said.
Meanwhile, he also noted that the government had lost its two-thirds majority in parliament as only 102 MPs supported the Vote on Account last Friday. The government is like a dilapidated vehicle which will cease to function in a few months, Mr Abeygunawardana stated.(Lahiru Pothmulla)

Spirit of Xmas and realities in Sri Lanka - EDITORIAL
	

n two days - on December 25 - the world commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ, who preached a message of love, forgiveness and demanded irrespective of religious or political beliefs, a steadfastness to truth, justice and the upholding of the dignity of man. 
In our little corner of the world here, in Sri Lanka, while we celebrate this great festival of love, we also remember it as a time when four years ago -We the people voted into power a new regime comprising political forces and personalities of widely diverging political ideologies. The goal was to ensure good governance in the country and live up to the high expectations generated by the change of regime. The aim was to change the political culture where corruption was rampant. The media controlled. A time when people were disappeared off the streets in the dreaded white vans. A time when the forces of law and order became pawns in power games of the rich and powerful and the
media subservient. 
In short, it was a period when corruption was widespread, justice was not seen to be done, religious fundamentalism and racism were seen to operate with the blessings of the state and the CoL out of the reach of common folk. And so as we come to the dawn of what would be the final year, it is as good a time as any to check, how much of what was promised/expected has been achieved. Its time to recognise failures and put in place plans of action to rectify the short-comings and failures of the past four-year period and set up a reasonable time limit for correcting mistakes of the past and ensuring goals and
targets are met. 
A major platform of the Sirisena-Wickremasinghe combine; prior to victory at the the presidential elections of December 2014, was its promise to eliminate corruption which was widespread, endemic and affecting all levels of society. It also charged the past president and his family of being involved in mega corruption. Promised to charge them before the courts of law, bring corrupt officials to book and bring to an end corruption in public life. Instead, what the country witnessed were charges of mega corruption against the very government which promised to eliminate corruption. 
The Prime Minister himself has been accused of involvement in a $ billion bond scam. The former Minister of Finance - a close associate of the Premier - had been forced to resign from the Cabinet in the face of charges of bribery and corruption. The incumbent President and his government levelled charges of corruption running into billions of Dollars against his predecessor and members of his (past Presidents) family. 
Neither the past President, nor any members of his family have been charged in a court of law on charges of bribery or corruption. So far, no evidence has thus far been produced. The charges remain unsubstantiated and the government has failed the public totally on this count too. 
However, one of the biggest successes of the regime has been the elimination of fear which stalked the land. Through the setting up of Independent Commissions governing the public services, the judiciary and the police, the government ensured the independence of the police and judiciary to act without fear or fervor. 
Today, the fear of being arbitrarily picked up or the dreaded knock on the door at midnight is a distant nightmare. The enshrining of The Freedom of Information Act has ensured transparency in governance. 
The jailing of preachers of hate speech and their hangers-on have eased fears among minority groups. The past three years has also seen the heightened media freedom with hardly any threats made against media personnel or attacks against media institutions. But by far, the greatest achievement of the present regime has been the depoliticising of the judiciary and the strengthening of the countrys judicial system. The proof of the pudding it is said is in the eating, and the role of the judiciary in bringing to an end the recent constitutional crisis stands as a beacon of hope for generations to come. 
However, even today there is an ongoing struggle between the executive and the Constitutional Council regarding the appointment of Judges to the Courts of the land. In this struggle the independence of the Independent Commission need to be upheld to ensure the independence of the Judiciary. The continuing tussle between our President now shorn of his executive powers attempting to foist his nominees on the courts of justice needs to be resisted and the independence of the Independent Commissions need to be upheld and strengthened.

Troops rescue flood-affected in North
	
Following the torrential rains in the Northern Province, troops of the Army and Navy rushed into relief and rescue missions in the districts of Mullaitivu and Killnochchi which were worst affected by the inclement weather condition.
More than 230 army troops, belonging to the Sri Lanka Light Infantry Regiment, Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment and Sri Lanka Sinha Regiment have been engaged in these relief operations since heavy rains lashed the area beginning Saturday (22).
They said troops in Kilinochchi and Mullaittivu districts were deployed to flood-affected areas in Kilinochchi and had provided immediate rescue assistance, cooked meals, help for evacuation and relocation, medical assistance and sanitary and technical facilities.
They had assisted District Secretariats relief work to nearly 2,968 flood-affected people at Raththinapuram, Anandapuram, Kanakambikulam, Maradanagar, Pannankandy, Dharmapuram, Puliyanpokkanei, Paranthan, Kudyirippu, Uriyan, Kandawalai, Mankulam areas in Kilinochchi and Mannakandal, Kawwalakandal, Kodadikallu, KJanagaratnapuram, Vidyapuram, Udayarkattu, Kuruvilkulam in Mullaittivu.
The Army said Kilinochchi troops on Saturday avoided a major disaster by preventing possible breaches on Olumadhu and Pulimuchchunadukuluam tank bunds (dams) in Kilinochchi as water levels began threatening those tank perimeter bunds.
Troops stacked sand bags around vulnerable places and prevented them from piercing as water levels were fast on the increase. At least 42 Army personnel took immediate steps to place 838 sandbags around those tank bunds within a few hours.
Meanwhile, the Navy said they had deployed nine dinghies and six relief teams in aforesaid areas since Saturday to assist flood victims.
Naval personnel attached to the North Central Naval Command were prompt in taking into action following the flood situation and they reached displaced people residing in Iranamadu, Shamikulam, Oddusudan and Wasanthampuram areas to rescue the flood-stricken people.
As such, the Navy relief teams have transferred 103 civilians to safe locations as of now.
The Sri Lanka Air Force said a Bell-212 helicopter and Y12 aircrafts had been deployed on flights over Iranaimadhu and Mullaithivu areas to assess flood situation.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

UNP sends show cause notice to 15 MPs for their absence in P'ment
	
The United National Party (UNP) has decided to ask for an explanation from 15 of its MPs who were absent in Parliament last Friday when the Vote on Account was taken up, Daily Mirror learns.
The UNP managed to get the Vote on Account passed in Parliament with 102 votes to six.
The main opposition, the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), was absent at the time of voting. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) voted for it along with the UNP. However, 15 MPs belonging to the UNP as the governing party were absent during the vote.
A senior party official told Daily Mirror that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had instructed all the ruling party MPs to prioritize their parliamentary businesses over their other works.
Some MPs do not take it seriously. We will ask them to explain as to why they were absent during a crucial vote, he said.
In the event of a defeat of the annual budget or the Vote on Account, the Cabinet stands dissolved.
The government passed this Vote on Account outlining its expenditure for the first quarter of next year. The government is planning to present a fully-fledged budget in April.(Kelum Bandara)
