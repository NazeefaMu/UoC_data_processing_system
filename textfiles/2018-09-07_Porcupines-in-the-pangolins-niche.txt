Porcupines in the pangolins’ niche!


	



 

A certain Government Department spinning money for the exchequer had been maintaining a holiday bungalow at the periphery for the exclusive use of its employees and their family members.

 


In fact, the bungalow had been constructed on the initiative of the department’s welfare division.  


However, security men of a very high political authority who had encroached the bungalow about one and half years ago are said to be still using it with no sign of releasing it for the use of the employees for whom it had been put up.


The department’s head finding himself helpless has now virtually written off the bungalow, they say. The dues on water and electricity bills run by this bungalow have now gone into arrears amounting to about Rs. 1 million, nevertheless, the supply of both water and electricity to it continues uninterrupted, informed sources say.
