NDB Wealth advises financial independence to light up your Deepavali


	

Deepavali, or the Hindu festival of lights, as it is also commonly known, is a time when you fix up and decorate your home, buy new clothes for yourself and your family and take part in festivities with your community. 
Embodying the triumph of light over dark, Deepavali is the celebration of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity. And, prior to celebrating Deepavali, Hindus the world over get ready for future prosperity by aligning all their actions to receive it, which has a deeper meaning not only for Hindus but for everyone. If you want to be successful, be ready for that success.
Additionally, it is precisely during occasions like the colourful and festive Deepavali that expert financial planner NDB Wealth recommends that far-thinking individuals, no matter what they believe in, think about how they can achieve financial independence, which for many can mean the difference between a safe and secure future, or having to worry should emergency medical expenditures arise.
To get you started, the financial planners at NDB Wealth suggest the following, six-point plan to help manage your money more effectively: 1. Set a strict budget; 2. Regularly review finances to identify any wasted money; 3. Look at cutting unnecessary spending and luxuries; 4. Maintain a record of actual spending to compare against the budget; 5. Reconcile bank and credit card statements against spending records; and 6. Devise a savings plan, even if the amount is only a small amount a month.
“You can take action and alleviate your worries by periodically keeping a close eye on spending and creditworthiness. This can be done in a number of ways, with several apps, calculators, spreadsheets, etc. available online, to assist you in managing finances. In fact, NDB Wealth offers its own online financial utility, ‘The NDB Wealth Planner’, available on www.ndbwealth.com, which can prove very useful for your future financial planning,” comments Christina Wesley, Financial Advisor with NDB Wealth.
At the same time, NDB Wealth also offers a number of really simple, introductory products such as ‘Money Market Funds’ to help you plan better and facilitate a relatively easy entry into the world of wealth management. 
These allow you to maximize your savings and income beyond the limitations of traditional banking, by initiating clients into high performance instruments such as money market funds. For instance, NDB Wealth’s money market funds offer safety, anytime withdrawal and high rates of return in comparison to traditional savings accounts. Another benefit of NDB Wealth’s Money Market accounts is that earnings are credited to your account daily.
