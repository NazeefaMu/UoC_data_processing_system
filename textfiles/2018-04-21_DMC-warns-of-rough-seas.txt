Naval and fishing communities were strictly advised to restrain from fishing and naval activities in the sea areas from Puttalam to Batticaloa via Colombo and Galle due to rough seas, the Disaster Management Centre today said.

Quoting the Meteorology Department’s recent report, DMC Deputy Director Pradeep Kodippili said the sea surf could be two to three meters high in the coastal areas until Tuesday (24) morning.

People who are living by the sea shores were advised to be vigilant as the sea surf could reach the shores. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
