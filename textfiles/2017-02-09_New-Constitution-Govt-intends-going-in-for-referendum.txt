The Government intends to go in for a referendum with the consent of all parties including the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) on the new Constitution, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament today.

He came out with this remark when joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansha questioned about a statement made by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera that the government would go for a process of devolution of power.

The MP claimed the minister had made such a statement to the foreign media.

Mr. Kiriella said the government will not go for federalism while Parliament's approval would be sought for all aspects of the constitution including the devolution of power.

“Nothing would be done without the approval of the House" he added. (Yohan Perera)
