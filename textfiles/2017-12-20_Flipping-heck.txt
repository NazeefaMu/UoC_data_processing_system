The lion is at the top of the food chain,but for one tragic lioness, her last chance at survival slipped through her claws and almost ended up killing her in the process. A tragic incident was captured on film at Kruger National Park in South Africa, shows a buffalo flips and launches the lioness into the air. Without the safety and security of the lioness pride, she had been unable to hunt and feed herself and is starving and injured. (Daily Mail)
