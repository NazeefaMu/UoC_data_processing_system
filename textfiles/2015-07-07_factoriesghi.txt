TU action closes 23 tea factories


	

Ongoing trade union action by estate workers, demanding a basic wage of Rs. 1,000, has forced tea manufacturers to close 23 factories by today.  
Estate superintendents said the manufacturers made the decision to avoid losses caused by the go-slow protest by workers which began on Monday (6).
The Unionists said the go- slow had reduced the output of an eight hour work day to 3-5 kilos causing heavy losses to companies. Each worker was required to pluck 15 -20 kilos of raw leaves for the daily wage of Rs.485.  
Estate superintendents said they were left with no alternative but to close the tea factories to prevent heavy losses. (Ranjith Rajapakse)
