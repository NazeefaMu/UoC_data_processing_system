Be poetic, please!

 
In the late 60s, a group of us were invited to participate in the BBC's 'Poetry Please' session organised by the World Service. It broadcast poetry to 44 countries. As an onlooker, I was inspired as to how poems could be delivered to our local listeners.
Three poets were invited to read out poetry. The first poet was a broadcaster himself in his 50s. He came all the way from California to spend a month in the UK. I still have the collection of poems by this poet, Robert Bly, who introduced himself, if I remember right, as a prose poet. His compilation is titled as 'The Morning Glory' running to 35 printed pages with illustrations (a publication of Kayak Books in San Francisco 1969).
We listened silently to his first prose poem.
Looking at a dead wren in my hand
Forgive the hours spent listening to radios,
And the words of gratitude I did not say to teachers.
I love your tiny rice- like legs, like bars of music played in an empty church,
And the feminine tail,
Where no worms of Empire have ever slept,
And the intense yellow chest that makes tears come.
Your tail feathers open like a picket fence,
And your bill is brown,
With the sorrow of an old Jew whose daughter has married an athlete
The black spot on your head is your own mourning cap.
A serious discussion followed.
Bly simply said: "I am an imagist. I think in terms of images."
This was followed by Ronald Duncan, a scientist turned poet. He was inspired by T S Eliot who had also been one of his mentors. His collection was titled as 'Man'. He wanted to bring out three more parts of 'Man' in time to come. Ronald also wanted to write his autobiography, but it had so happened that in his isolation he had played with words. In the end it had given way to another form of a biography.
"I was in no state to tackle any serious creative work. In 1961 I suffered an emotional crisis. I found myself having to live alone in a modern luxury flat in London. To prevent myself dwelling in my predicament, I wanted to write my autobiography.
But what happened was amazing. I jotted down some lines which read more like poetry rather than a biography."
Then Duncan went on reading some lines.
I am God: I could become
If I could remember my future
As I have forgotten my past
I am God: I will become
When I can imagine the whole
As I have remembered a part.
I am the god I shall become
For I am the only conscious thing
In an unconscious universe
I am the dreamer who can dream
He is dreaming
I am the miracle: man
A year of years lies behind my name
A century of centuries has waited for this hand
It took all time's tide to reach me
The expanding darkness has groped for me;
Through the leafless wood the blind winds blown to me;
Beneath the heavy ocean,
The patient coral reached for me;
I am the miracle; the man
look into my eyes for there all history is recorded
And even the granite's tale is told.
What a fascinating little poem... we all acclaimed Duncan. And Duncan responded: "Thank you for your miraculous listening. Let me tell you frankly that it is an unfinished piece though it looks complete."
The third poet was a fellow broadcaster from Yorkshire, Christopher Pilling. He distributed a flimsy collection of poems titled as 'Snakes and Girls'. He was the first winner of the New Poet's Award in 1969. He was the runner up in the Camden Festival of Poetry Competition.
I recall what he said: 'This is just not a romantic poem. But I am undoubtedly inspired in my childhood from many romantic poems. I thank them for making me alive.'
Then he read his sonnet-like poem in a singsong manner.
Wild Flower
Only the thistle did not droop
It did not prick my hand
Round its stem of hairs
It asserts its realm
In earthenware
I am the mauve one
Handsome spiky
Because you held me
I stand for the hillside.
He made a melodious hum after two lines.
The radio broadcasting of poems was to be a tough task back then. The radio producers had to imagine how a poem could be aired. Anyhow, this was a pioneer attempt. It made things easier for the young poets to read their written poems to an audience leading, which finally led to a poetic discourse.
