As the low pressure area South-West of the Bay of Bengal is moving further away from Sri Lanka, the Meteorology Department today said it was expecting the effect on the country to lessen gradually.

According to weather statistics, a depression is likely to develop in the low pressure area during the early hours of tomorrow, moving towards the north – north-westward direction in the sea area of the Bay of Bengal and was located nearly 850km North-East of Trincomalee by this evening.

Hence the Meteorology Department Director General K.H.M.S. Premalal said we could expect fair weather but it was important to remain alert, as there could be a sudden change in weather conditions.

Accordingly showers or thunderstorms would occur at a few places in the Uva, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern Provinces and in the Ampara districts tomorrow after 2.00 p.m., while temporary localized strong winds could be expected during the thunderstorms. Occasional gusty winds could also be expected.

However, the warning issued to the naval and fishing communities were further extended and the Eastern seas from 300 km off the coast, would be rough and unsafe. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
