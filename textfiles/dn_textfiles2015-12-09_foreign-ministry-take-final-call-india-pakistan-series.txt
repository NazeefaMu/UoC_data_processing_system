Foreign Ministry to take final call on India-Pakistan series

NEW DELHi, Tuesday : In yet another twist, it is now being reported that the India-Pakistan series announcement is likely to be made either today or tomorrow.
According to CNN-IBN, Sushma Swaraj and Sartaz Aziz are likely to make an announcement regarding the series in a joint statement.
Swaraj is in Islamabad to attend the Heart of Asia regional conference.
"We have been informally told that Swaraj will talk on cricket and decide the fate of the series," PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan had earlier told media.
The series, agreed between the two boards in a memorandum of understanding signed last year, ran into trouble amid strained relations over cross-border shelling in disputed Kashmir.
But Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi met on the sidelines of a climate change conference in Paris last week as the two countries seek a thaw in relations.
That informal meeting was followed by "cordial" talks between the Indian and Pakistani national security advisers in Bangkok on Sunday, giving Khan fresh hope the series could yet take place. "The recent meeting between the two prime ministers and security advisers' meeting in Bangkok have hinted the situation between Pakistan and India will improve," he said.
Making arrangements for the series -- which could run from December 17-January 3 -- would be "challenging" at such short notice, Khan said, "but we will do it once we get clearance from the Indian government."
