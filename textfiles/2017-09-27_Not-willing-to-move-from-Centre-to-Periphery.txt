Not willing to move from Centre to Periphery!


	



A group of Diyawanna members were engaged in usual gossip in the lobby the other day, when one of them mentioned that according to a story doing rounds the young Green one looking after the Rakwana electorate was to come forward as his party’s Chief Ministerial candidate. At that very moment, the young member from Rakwana walked up to the group. One member hailed the new comer saying “Talk of the devil! He will appear!”


Another member explained to the young member that they were talking about the story that he was to contest the upcoming provincial polls as the party’s chief ministerial candidate. However, the young member did not look happy about the story afloat.  “I don’t think this will happen,” he said and added: “I am not interested either!”


“Then how come some newspapers carrying stories hinting that the party is to field you as the chief ministerial candidate?” another member queried.


“A certain one from our party had planted that story. He wants to push me into it because of my popularity in the district!”


“Who is the powerful person in the party who wants to push you into the provincial council?”


However, the young member from Rakwana declined to name the person.


A member in the group at this stage mentioned the name of a Green party purohita hailing from Sabaragamuwa and asked the young member whether he was the ‘certain one’ referred to by him earlier.


The young Green member gave an involuntary chuckle and walked away saying “ta!  ta!” to his colleagues.
