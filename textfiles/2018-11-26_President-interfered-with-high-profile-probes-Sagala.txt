President interfered with high-profile probes: Sagala


	

Former Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake yesterday said there were instances in which President Maithripala Sirisena interfered with high-profile investigations.

“As a responsible Cabinet minister, I have never spoken in public about instances in which the President interfered with high-profile investigations. But if the wild allegations continue, I will be forced to divulge details on who interfered, when, where and how,” the MP tweeted.

He said the IGP Pujith Jayasundara's recent letter to Secretary Defence over transfer of CID officer Nishantha Silva clearly states President Sirisena had given the order.

“This is a clear example of the President's interference in action - a recurring habit these past three and half years. If there was corruption during the past three and half years, President Sirisena, head of the unity government and the Cabinet, has equally to share the blame. We welcome the appointment of a Presidential Commission, but insist the President is not made immune to the investigations himself,” he said.
