Top 5 Reasons Why You Need An eWallet


	

An ‘e Wallet” is a common term which refers to technology that helps you store payment
information, and make transactions digitally. An e Wallet allows you to do away with your
cash and physical credit cards in favour of electronic transactions and payment methods,
usually relying on a person’s phone to transmit payment data securely.

Okay, that sounds good. But, do I need an e wallet? Let’s dive in.

Here are the top 5 reasons, why an e wallet will make your life easier.

Mobile Friendly 

Most of us have very busy schedules and we are always looking for ways of going about our business in the most effective manner. Mobile phones have already become a ubiquitous device that helps this process. Add having access to an ewallet through your mobile phone and voila! life instantaneously becomes so much easier..

Automated Logs

Sometimes, you may lose track of your expenditures when using physical cash. It happens.. even when you do consciously keep track. But with an e wallet, everything is logged, so you have nothing to worry. You can check how you are doing using automated records. It’s that simple.

Loyalty Benefits

Let’s say you’ve earned a loyalty card or gift card which you carry around that in your wallet. Most of the time its more likely that you have forgotten about them. An e wallet onthe other hand offers the potential to store gift cards in your digital space, thus saving you more space in your wallet, and making you more prone to actually using them.

Security Matters 

Let’s say you lost your wallet, chances are that your valuables are gone forever unless some kindhearted person decides to return it to you. You would also need to go through the hassle of calling your bank to deactivate the cards. On the other hand if you lose your mobile device with an eWallet access, you can do a remote wipe of it and know the data is still secure. It is secured using multi step authentication.

It works!

How often have you been ready to step out to get something done, only to have to go rummaging around your house or digging in your purse or backpack to find your wallet?
