Audit Bill to be presented to Cabinet this week


	

The much-delayed Audit Bill is expected to be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers this week, sources close to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

They said the Government had decided to go ahead with passing the Bill as the Supreme Court had given the nod for it.

Accordingly, the Attorney General had informed the Secretary to Prime Minister that the Bill was in accordance with the Constitution.

The Bill, sources said would give wide powers to the Attorney General on making public institutions more accountable.

However, there was a notion among some sectors of the Government that the Bill would put State Officials in jeopardy. (Yohan Perera)
