	A jailer and a jail guard were reportedly assaulted by a group of remand prisoners during a clash at the Colombo Remand Prison yesterday evening.
	A move to transfer two remand prisoners from their cell to a different one had led to the clash.
	Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the incident had occurred at about 7.30pm and a call had been sent to Borella Police by the prisons authorities.
	A police team from Borella had been sent into the prison to conduct an inquiry -- which was in progress at the time of going to press.
	Police said damage had also been caused to prison property. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
