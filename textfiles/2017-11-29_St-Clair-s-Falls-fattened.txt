A sluice gate of the Kotmale Reservoir was opened today due to the heavy rainfall experienced in the hill country, the engineer in charge of the reservoir said. With the opening of the sluice gate, the water level of the Kotmale Oya also increased. Seen here is the beautiful St. Clair's Falls which is nourished by the Kotmale Oya.
