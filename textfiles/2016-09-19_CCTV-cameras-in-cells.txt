In the wake of an inmate found dead at the Matara Prison, the Law and Order Ministry said today that CCTV cameras would be installed in all Police cells to monitor the detainees.

Ministry sources told the Daily Mirror that this was revealed by the Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake at a meeting with top Police officers in Jaffna on Sunday.

“I have informed IGP Pujith Jayasundera to install CCTV cameras in all Police cells so that Police officers could monitor, what is taking place inside cells,” he had told at the meeting.

A 28-year-old man was also found dead inside a cell at the Pusellawa Police station recently. He was reported to have committed suicide by hanging inside the prison cell. (Yohan Perera)
