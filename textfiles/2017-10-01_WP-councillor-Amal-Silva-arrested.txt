The Police had arrested a drug peddler, who was also a resident of Ratmalana last week with 32 grams of heroin during a raid in Ratmalana.

Police detained the suspect for 7-days after being produced in the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court for further questioning and recovered a locally made firearm following the questioning.

The councillor was arrested based on the information given by the drug peddler.

He is to be produced in the Mount Lavinia Magistrate Court today. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
