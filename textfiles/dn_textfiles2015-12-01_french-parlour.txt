From the French parlour

Cult brand, French skincare luminary Biologique Recherche is now available in Sri Lanka, exclusively at Crown Hair and Beauty. What started 35 years ago as a research and development laboratory for the creation of formulations for skincare professionals who were dissatisfied with what was already available in the market; the Biologique Recherche Methodology has today gained a reputation for astounding effectiveness based on a clinical approach to beauty care using pure, concentrated, raw ingredients, as well as innovative and meticulous protocols and procedures.
Created by Yvan Allouche, a biochemist, skin researcher and product formulator, and Josette Allouche, physiotherapist and esthetician, Bilologique is now headed by the couples' son Dr. Philippe Allouche. The arrival of Biologique recherché into the Sri Lankan market signifies a new era in skincare, as the brand offers a specific set of technologies that treat different skin care issues, offering in-depth and highly specialised skin care treatments. The brand is perhaps best known for its Lotion P50, one of the most highly acclaimed skincare products in the world. With celebrity fans including Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Jennifer Conelly, Madonna, Sharon Stone and the Olsen twins, Biologique Recherche is by far one of the most desirable product lines in the skincare arena today, with a well deserved reputation for delivering astounding results.
The Biologique Recherche philosophy is built on the pillars of authenticity and harmony, and every product in the range boasts high concentrations of botanical, marine and biological extracts. No artificial fragrances are used in the products, thus preserving the integrity of its formulations and lowering the chance of allergic reaction. The company uses only the highest quality active ingredients, and its cold made formulations ensure the preservation of the structure of these active ingredients for an extended period.
The entire Biologique Recherche skincare line is available at Crown Hair and Beauty. Customers can choose to consult Crown facialists and purchase the products that are most suitable to their skin types, or can opt to experience the treatment in house. Crown Facialists have been trained and educated by the Biologique Team in order to ensure the delivery of the best and most accurate treatment and results.
Biologique Recherche uses a seven-step treatment methodology. The full treatment experience is composed of three main stages.
The first, the Assessment Stage, takes users through a series of epidermal tests which serve to determine the level of treatment they must receive. Next is the Initialisation Stage, which is composed of three steps: relaxation, preparation, and mask application. Finally the Treatment Stage remodels the face, and quintessential serums, and finishing creams and serums are applied.
