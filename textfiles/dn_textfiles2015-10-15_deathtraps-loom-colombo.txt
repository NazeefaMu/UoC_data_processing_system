Deathtraps loom in Colombo

Colombo city authorities have drawn criticism from many quarters for turning a blind eye to potential deathtraps on the roads of the capital city.
This highlights not only the negligence on their part, but also the absence of a holistic vision when it comes to road safety issues.

For many decades, the road system in the Colombo city, the commercial capital of the country, has been put to question due to the poor maintenance of roads. Over a million people and millions of vehicles enter the city every day. They are in serious danger due to the poor maintenance of roads.
The Daily News went on a city round to look into the condition of roads in the Colombo city area to demonstrate certain hiccups of authorities when providing basic facilities to the public. Numerous potholes and puddles can be witnessed while electric wires lay dangerously on several roads. Some roads which were in good condition for sometime after being repaired, have cracked and sunk. Some have become the motorist's nightmare, owing to the poor condition.
A hole had been dug for the last 10 days near the traffic lights at Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Slave Island. However, no action had been taken to complete it.
A shopkeeper in the same area, Rilwan Aadam said there is a huge drainage problem in the area which had not been solved yet. The situation is worsened by the constant digging of roads by authorities.
Authorities said they would improve the drainage system. However, no proper methods have been adopted to do so. There are also parking issues in the area due to the poor condition of roads, Aadam said.
A large hole is also visible near a school which has been there for the past 10 days.
Dimuthu, a resident of Pamankada said there are a lot of potholes on Stafford Road, from Kirulapona to Pamankada bridge. Stafford Road is one way and there are no other alternative roads. Therefore, it has to be maintained properly, he said.
Meanwhile, Malay Street at Slave Island was damaged due to inclement weather. All vehicles and buses travelling to Pettah had undergone numerous inconveniences yesterday.
Residents in the area said they informed the Colombo Municipal Council and the police about the pothole on the road.
They had also informed that although main roads are cleared and carpeted, connecting byroads are not up to the same standard and are neglected.
The people in the area face many difficulties during the rainy season, residents said. They alleged that the road work is taking longer than necessary.
"The roads have to be made. However, authorities are not considerate of the people who live in the area. They need to be efficient in their work. They must consider the timing with regard to reconstruction work. For example, they should work on weekends and during night-time. The road work tend to drag during weekdays as they work with the heavy traffic," a resident three wheel driver said.
Drivers said their vehicles often broke down and developed technical defects that required repairs at heavy cost due to the poor state of the road. Drivers always try to avoid potholes in fear of possible damage to vehicles. This could result in accidents, they said.

Electricity wires were lying exposed at Flower Road yesterday, threatening people's lives. Some one could easily touch the exposed wires. The threat is heightened due to wet weather.
High voltage electric wires come from a variety of sources. Some from electricity substations from which the supply is distributed while others from connection boxes which have been left uncovered on pavements.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) is responsible for the maintenance and development of highways and ensuring that road networks in urban and rural areas are safe and in usable condition for motor vehicles and pedestrians. When the Daily News contacted RDA Project Director K. Amaraweera to ask about the holes dug near Sir James Peiris Mawatha, he said he had not received any complaints pertaining to the issue. He added that he needs to check whether the road belongs to the RDA or not.
Some roads in the city are under the RDA and some are under the Colombo Municipal Council, he said.
When questioned about several other roads, he stressed that he needs to confirm whether the roads belong to the RDA or not before commenting to the media.
A Colombo Municipal Council senior official said in the city limits, around 50 roads are under the RDA. They are also maintained by the CMC when the RDA maintains the Marine Drive, W. A. Silva Mawatha and Baseline Road.
When questioned about the holes dug on roads, the official said excavation permits are given for some projects for one or two weeks. Once the drains are open in the process of road development, it takes sometime to cover it due to the work taking place. Thus, there is a practical difficulty, added the official.
Responding to questions about the maintenance of roads, the official said: "Roads get damaged due to inclement weather. But our maintenance crew inspects roads daily. If there is a crack, we carpet the road to prevent it from spreading.
"We don't have enough staff to look into the issue immediately. But whenever residents or people complain, we properly looked into these things," he said.
The official said the life time of a road is measured by its usage. The Ceylon Electricity Board, Telecom, private telecommunication institutes, Water Board and other authorities dig roads to provide water or telephone connections. The authorities obtain permission for one or two weeks from the CMC and the police to begin their project.
With the increase of development projects in the Colombo city, it is hard to maintain rehabilitated roads. There is also a huge increase in the number of vehicles entering the Colombo city, he added.
Referring to Malay Street, the official noted that the road is often used by other authorities for estimation purposes. Therefore, it is difficult to bring the road to the original condition. The roads are often damaged.
Many roads need to be re-carpeted as the premix carpet is damaged due to frequent use.
If potholes are repaired, drivers will not need to suddenly swerve their vehicles to avoid them which will help reduce accidents. Then it would be a pleasure to drive on Colombo roads and safe for travellers and pedestrians.
