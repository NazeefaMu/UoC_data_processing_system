This book by Dinesh Weerakkody-who has many publications to his credit- traces the political journey of an extraordinary statesman. It should be of interest to all citizens of Sri Lanka, whether they are his supporters or not. The publication begins with his ancestry. Many have often wondered why a person coming from his back ground chose to enter the world of politics. This profession to some is a labyrinth which must be avoided at all costs.

Dr. Greg Power in his foreword advises everyone to read it in order to learn and understand the value of leadership, in making critical national choices and in using power wisely. Through the eyes and pen of a person, who has had a long and close relationship with his subject, it is certainly refreshing to get an insight into the personality of an often misunderstood statesman. This politician is none other than Ranil Wickremesinghe who has  had the tenacity and endurance to stick to his belief in democracy and display incredible patience as the Leader of the Opposition. The author has seen beneath his somewhat aloof personality-- the real person-- who portrays dedication,discipline and a genuine concern for the people of this country and their woes. Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thero, who has known Wickremesinghe from his childhood, comments in the book that even as a child, the Premier never indulged in wrongdoings, malpractices or injustice. As a result he has emerged as a rare being in this country; a professional and a leader combined.  

The author refers to Wickremesinghe’s love of history and comments that this perhaps stems from the fact his father, the late Esmond Wickremesinghe, obtained a first class Honours in history, from Ceylon University College. He explains the political heritage Wickremesinghe has inherited from the Wijewardene’s and the Jayewardene’s who were the movers and shakers of their time in Sri Lanka’s political history. He links Wickremesinghe’s political interest to Lake House which was begun by his Grandfather, the late D.R. Wijewardene.

The latter started the newspaper group with the objective of helping Sri Lanka obtain  Independence. He states that among Wickremesinghe’s first dreams was the desire to be a journalist. He describes Wickremesinghe’s parents and their influence on him, his father’s dynamic personality and the closeness to leaders like Sir John and J.R. He was a powerful force, among those responsible in bringing the UNP back into power, under the leadership of the late Dudley Senanayake. Esmond Wickremesinghe was from a prominent Christian family and fought hard and long for press freedom. His mother Nalini, was a dignified, stately, beautiful, and devout Buddhist who was very close to her son. It was perhaps both these influences which combined in making Wickremesinghe a politician and a devout Buddhist. However, he also respects all religions and insists on the freedom of worship for one and all .  

While speaking of his early childhood, his education, first was at the Kindergarten at Bishops College. Then he moved to Royal College and the friends he made there have remained as very close associates. The writer states that Wickremesinghe was always an avid reader. He was also very protective of his only sister, Kshanika. He was a good brother to all his male siblings.The author refers to Wickremesinghe’s grounding in law, after passing out as an advocate and while working in the chambers of two leading lawyers of the time-the late H.W. Jayewardene and Vernon Wijetunge. The author recalls ‘the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ in the premier’s political journey. He writes that Wickremesinghe remained unstintingly loyal to his party, the UNP.

He underscores Wickremesinghe’s patience and persistence while brickbats were thrown at him. While reading this book, one finds a new understanding of Wickremesinghe’s wide experiences as a statesman in good governance. There are also references to the many projects done by him for youth, education and industry during his tenure as Minister of these particular Ministries. The reader gets to know of the hard work done and the secret meetings held to ensure the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena. These were efforts taken to defeat the former Government which plunged the country into bankruptcy. It was a regime which was looked upon with disgust by all those in the democratic global world.

He writes about the dreams that Wickremesinghe had for Sri Lanka and the opportunity the premier received to make them realities. We also get to read about Wickremesinghe’s annexures in the book, by those who knew him well including the late Anura Bandaranaike, interviews with NDTV and N Ram in the Hindu and speeches by the Prime Minister at Business and other forums. The book is a good read for everyone and offers an example to younger politicians about the importance of learning to follow before one gets to lead. The book also highlights how Wickremesinghe learned to walk the straight path with unfailing loyalty to his former leaders and to the party. Wickremesinghe’s climb to the top is shown as a slow and steady one.

During this journey he has given priority to the next generation, not the next election. He has not made false promises to stay in power. The book pens a portrait of a gentleman politician, someone who can be termed a rare breed. As we read we figure how this politician used brain and not brawn to get where he is today. The author also stresses that Wickremesinghe must rise to the challenge and deliver before it’s too late!
