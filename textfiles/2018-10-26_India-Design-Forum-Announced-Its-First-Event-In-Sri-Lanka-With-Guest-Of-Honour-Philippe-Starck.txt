India Design Forum (IDF) and IDF Singapore announced their first design event in Colombo, Sri Lanka, which took place on Thursday 18th October 2018.

IDF Colombo was held at the former offices of the world-renowned Sri Lankan architect, the late Geoffrey Bawa, and was included a series of discussions with a selected group of eminent regional and international design industry figures, including the inimitable inventor, creator, architect, designer, and artistic director, Philippe Starck. To honour his contribution to the design industry, specifically within the South Asia region, IDF presented Starck with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the event. 

Starck considers it his duty to share his ethical and subversive vision of a fairer planet, and creates unconventional places and objects whose purpose is to be good before being beautiful. His mission and vision is for creation - whatever shape it takes - to "make life better for the largest number of people possible". The designer was in Colombo for the launch of Sapphire Residences, ITC Colombo One, for which he led the interior design.

In keeping with Starck's design ethos, the panel discussions at IDF Colombo explored topics such as responsible luxury and the relevance of architecture in an era of sustainability; the significance of design in a rapidly urbanising South Asia; the impact of globalisation on local design practices; and subaltern perspectives in architecture and design.

Speakers included: Christopher Turner (Director, London Design Biennale; Director of Architecture and Design, V&A); Vicky Richardson (Writer, curator, and Honorary RIBA Fellow); Abha Narain Lambah (Principal Architect, ANL Associates); Vic Froglia (Gensler Architecture); Madhura Prematilleke (Principal,Team Architrave); Annika Fernando (Owner and Curator, PR fashion boutique); Ruchika Sachdeva (Creative Director, Bodice); and Rajshree Pathy (Founder Director, India Design Forum and IDF Singapore).
