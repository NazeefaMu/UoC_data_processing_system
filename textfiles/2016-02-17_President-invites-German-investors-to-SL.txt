We invite more German investors take advantage of the increasing economic opportunities in Sri Lanka. A high level trade and investment delegation is accompanying me on this visit. We will participate in a special forum organised to create awareness on Sri Lanka’s economic prospects and potential. Out business delegation will interact with German investors and identify opportunities for joint ventures. The contribution made by Germany in skills development through the establishment of Technical and vocational Training institutes in Sri Lanka stand out as an excellent model of corporation. We are very grateful to the government and people of Germany.
