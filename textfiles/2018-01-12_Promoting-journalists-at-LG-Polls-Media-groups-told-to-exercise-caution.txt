In the context of a number of media personnel contesting the local government elections from different political parties, the Elections Commission requested media institutions to exercise caution to ensure that no party or candidate was aggrieved by their coverage of news and events.

The EC said it received complaints about media men contesting the elections this time and using their media to promote themselves. It asked the media institutions not to leave room for these candidates to promote themselves or their parties in this exercise.

The EC asked for verification of reports filed by these media personnel in the fray with extra care, before marking them for publication or airing.
