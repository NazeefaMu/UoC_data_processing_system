A partial solar eclipse Today


	

A partial solar eclipse occurred in the 3rd quarter of Denata (Danishta) constellation in the Aquarius zodiacal sign beginning at 12.25 hours today, reaching the maximum eclipse at 02.21 hours and ending at 4.17 hours when it was still night time for almost the entire Asia. This came on the heels of a total Lunar eclipse that occurred in Aslisa constellation in Cancer Rashi at 16.21 hours (Colombo time) on January 31.


According to ancient Indian rishis, no auspicious event in life should be timed for the day of the eclipse and also for the three days before and after its occurrence. Further, no auspicious event in life should be held in the Rashi (Zodiacal sign) and the constellation in which an eclipse occurs on the day of the eclipse and during the 7 days before and after its occurrence.
