'Namal has no account in foreign banks'

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's spokesman Rohan Welivita yesterday said that Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa does not have any account in foreign banks.
Speaking on the recent allegation that a son of VVIP had a bank account in Dubai, the former President's spokesman stressed that the government can find out if there is an account in a forieng bank in favour of Namal Rajapaksa.
"It is not ethical to sling muds at the Rajapaksa family by levelling baseless allegations," he said.
He asked as to how Rajapaksa became the first in terms of preferential votes in the Hambantota district, if he was unpopular among the people.
Media reports said that the Sri Lankan government had initiated an judicial process in UAE to freeze a bank account owned by a son of a VVIP.
