The European Union (EU) had made certain requests to be met, which Sri Lanka could not agree under any circumstances-such as the enactment of right to engage in acts of homosexuality- when it considered the Sri Lanka’s application for GSP Plus, State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane said today.

He said the Sri Lankan government would meet the requests made by the EU in accordance with the law of the land and the Constitution and the EU must wait till Sri Lanka obtained Cabinet Approval and Parliament approval before proceeding with any action.

He told a news conference that it was unfair to make this kind of requests that directly affected the religious, social and cultural and sentiments of the people.

He said that Sri Lanka would implement only the requests she could carry out without harming the interests of any community.

“Some proposals made by the EU have not been met even in certain European countries. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for Sri Lanka to go ahead with them. That is why, the Cabinet decided to totally remove certain clauses in the proposals,” he added.

Minister Abeywardane said the EU had not made any demands or conditions as a prerequisite to renew GSP Plus as certain anti-national, anti-government elements and the Joint Opposition tried to make out, but only a few requests, which the Government rejected. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
