Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky today temporarily lifted the travel ban imposed on MP Namal Rajapaksa till December 31, 2017, and permitted him to travel abroad.

The suspect requested to travel to Hanoi, Vietnam to represent Sri Lankan Lawyers Football Team at the ASIA Lawyers’ Football Tournament to be held between March 23a and 26, 2017.

The travel ban was imposed on him over the two cases filed under the Money Laundering Act on Namal Rajapaksa and five others, for purchasing shares of Hello Corp allegedly from ill-gotten funds.

According to prosecution, The Attorney General would file indictments in high court immediately on the all suspects.

Based on the suspicious transactions revealed during the investigation, the FCID had earlier filed two separate cases against the suspects for obtaining Rs. 30 million from Havell Construction and Rs. 15 million from Boston Capital Company in the disguise of the services provided by NR Consultancy and Gowers Corporation, which are headed by Mr. Rajapaksa.
