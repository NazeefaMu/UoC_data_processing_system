Former Jetliners’ frontman Ishan Baha was recently in Australia to launch ‘A Heritage of Song’ the second in a series comprising two books. The launch took place at the Hungarian Community Hall in Wantirna and was organised by Derrick Junkeer and Dallas Achilles. The Master of Ceremonies for the afternoon was radio and tv personality Ryle Joseph Moldrich.  


Many former Sri Lankan singers and musicians who have migrated to Australia were present and many of them performed at the concert, rekindling memories of the good old days.
