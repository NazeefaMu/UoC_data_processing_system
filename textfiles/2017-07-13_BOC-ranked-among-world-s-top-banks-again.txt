Bank of Ceylon has yet again reaffirmed its position among the top 1000 banks in the world with the country rank No.1 according to the ‘The Banker’ U.K. Magazine July 2017 issue. 
Being the only bank to continuously top the list among Sri Lankan banks, BOC without any doubt can boast of its financial and operational strength which is considered to have accounted for this achievement.
The first and the only Sri Lankan single business entity to earn Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs.25.3 billion for 2015 and PBT 31.6 billion for 2016, BOC challenged its own record continuing its quest to strive for exceptional performance in all areas of banking. 
BOC’s financial KPIs indicate a strong financial performance that has shown steadfast growth since 2015, with ROA standing at 1.9 percent, ROE at 28.3 percent, CAR at 11.6 percent for the year 2016. 
For the stipulated year, the bank managed to maintain a 42 percent cost to income ratio portraying its ability to manage cost whilst improving business volumes. Since achieving a Rs.1 trillion asset base in 2012 the bank achieved two more significant milestones recently. Despite many pressures that prevailed due to high interest rates, challenging economic environment and regulatory pressure on capital, the trust and loyalty that was placed on the brand BOC paved way to surpass Rs.1 trillion in deposits in 2015 and Rs. 1 trillion advances in 2016 as the first Sri Lankan bank to do so. 
The bank’s asset value now exceeds Rs. 1.6 trillion and is the highest asset base owned by a single business entity in the country. 
Currently the Bank of Ceylon is the only Sri Lankan bank to own ‘a trillion triplet’ in the balance sheet.
