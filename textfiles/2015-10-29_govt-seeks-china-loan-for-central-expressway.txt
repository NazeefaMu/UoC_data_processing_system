	The government has sought a loan arrangement with China to construct the first phase of the Colombo –Kandy expressway commonly called the Central Highway, a Minister said.
	The concessionary loan will be obtained from Export and Import Bank of China.
	Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Daily Mirror that the highway would be constructed in three phases, and the second one would be funded by Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, he said the financial arrangement had not been made with anyone for the final phase of the highway.
	“The Central Highway is very important. It will open up the entire country improving access all the major towns and cities,” he said.
	The Minister said the United National Party (UNP) initially planned to construct this expressway during 2002/2004 tenure, but the next successive government did not proceed with it.
	“Instead, that government concentrated on the southern expressway. Kandy is the second largest city. Therefore, fast connectivity between Colombo and Kandy is very important,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
