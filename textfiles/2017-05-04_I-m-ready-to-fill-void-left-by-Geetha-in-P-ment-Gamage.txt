Former minister Piyasena Gamage said yesterday that if MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is forced to relinquish her seat in Parliament, it was he that should be appointed to fill the post from the Galle District.

Addressing a media briefing yesterday, he said the post should be offered to the person who is next on the list. “I’m next in the list. If I am given the chance, I will never refuse it. However, I’m not in a hurry,” Mr. Gamage said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
