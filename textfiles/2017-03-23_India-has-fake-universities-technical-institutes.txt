New Delhi (Hindustan Times), Mar 21, 2017 -   Delhi is the fake Capital with 66 colleges -- the highest for any state in India – offering engineering and other technical courses without the regulator’s permission. There are 279 such technical institutes in the country.   


Simply put, these schools don’t have the authority to grant degrees. Education certificates issued by such colleges are nothing but a piece of paper.   


The Capital also has seven of the country’s 23 fake universities, the University Grants Commission has said.   


In an annual review, the UGC and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) last month put out a list of such fake institutes on their websites, warning students ahead of the new academic session that kicks in next month.   


Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharasthra also have a sizable number of fake technical institutes.
