A group of Cabinet Ministers representing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will meet President Maithripala Sirisena today and request him to remove Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the post of co-Cabinet spokesman, it is learnt.

These ministers met at the residence of Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera the other day. In his place, they are going to propose that Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa be appointed to the post. Mr. Yapa held this post during the time of the previous government.

Those who were at the meeting included Ministers John Seneviratne, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Dilan Perera.

Dr. Senaratne and Mr. Seneviratne locked horns over remarks made at a Cabinet briefing that Minister Sarath Fonseka would be assigned to deal with emergency situations triggered by trade union actions. Dr. Senaratne cited this as a decision by the Cabinet whereas Mr. Seneviratne denied the fact. This led to a verbal clash between the two in public.(Kelum Bandara)
