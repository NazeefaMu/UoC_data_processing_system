J’pura Hospital filled with dengue patients


	

The Director of the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital today said the hospital has stopped admitting dengue patients for the time being due to the lack of bed spaces in the ward.

Dr. Susitha Senaratne said the hospital has the capacity to treat 460 fever patients including dengue patients and as of now all beds are occupied.

However, he said the hospital will admit new patients when and as in-house patients are being discharged.

“We cannot simply admit patients when we don’t have enough facilities for them. That’s why admitting of dengue patients was put on hold. However, we will take patients in as and when the other patients are being discharged,” he told Daily Mirror.
