President will enact Sampanthan Constitution: Keheliya


	

President Maithripala Sirisena is attempting to enact a ‘Sampanthan Constitution’ by cancelling the first three clauses in the First Chapter of the current Constitution, joint opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella claimed today.

Addressing a news conference, he said the new Constitution was based by the proposals submitted by the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan as a condition for the TNA’s support to President Maithripala Sirisena at the 2015 presidential election.

“These proposals pose a threat to the unitary character of the country. The subcommittee report on constitutional reforms, including those between the centre and the periphery, calls for the alteration of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd clauses,” the MP claimed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
