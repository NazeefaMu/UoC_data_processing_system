The Joint Opposition yesterday said that the Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill which was recently passed in Parliament was an unconventional Bill.

Joint opposition member MP Dullas Alahapperuma told a news conference that this could be regarded as completely a new Bill even though the government had claimed it to be an amendment Bill.

He said that this newly formed Bill had been introduced as an amendment one by including new sections to it in order to avoid the legal proceedings. “This Bill was presented in Parliament in a very irresponsible manner. We have requested for a discussion in Parliament to sort out the complications with regard to the Bill, but it was of no use,” he added.

He said that the LG Elections Amendments Bill had contained several technical errors and added that it had been subjected to many political issues.

He also said this Bill would nullify the powers to hold interim polls. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
