Politico to pay for his secretary’s sins


	

A prominent politician from the upcountry has become very unpopular among his constituents because of tolerating the antics of his amorous personal secretary, they say.




This personal secretary well known for his weakness for the fair sex had on a number of occasions sought sexual favours from young attractive women who had visited his office. He is said to be corrupt too. It has come to light that he had misappropriated part of a stock of cement bags made available to the politician concerned for distribution among the poor in the area.


People in the area say that the politician has turned a deaf ear to the complaints that they have made against his personal secretary. And they vow to teach the politician a lesson come the next general polls.
