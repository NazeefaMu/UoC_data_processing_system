SriLankan airlines has introduced a series of measures to mitigate inconvenience to its valued passengers from the closure of the Cochin International Airport due to flooding.

Cochin Airport authorities yesterday announced they were extending the airport’s closure until August 26, a statement said.

Accordingly SriLankan is offering passengers booked to travel from Cochin to Colombo and onward destinations, the option of departing from Trivandrum or any other destination in South India served by SriLankan, at no extra charge. In addition, passengers booked to fly from Colombo to Cochin may fly to Trivandrum or any other destination in South India served by SriLankan, at no extra charge.

Sri Lanka’s national carrier acted immediately to temporarily increase its capacity between Trivandrum and Colombo to cater to the expected requirement. Passengers who were awaiting flights when the airport was closed down on August 15 were provided hotel accommodation and those who agreed were rerouted to Trivandrum.
