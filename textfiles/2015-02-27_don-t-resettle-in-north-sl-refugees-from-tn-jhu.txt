The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it would oppose any move to resettle the Tamils who fled to India during the 1983 insurrection, on the basis that this matter was settled through an agreement signed with J.N. Dixit.
JHU national organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said according to the agreement, India had agreed to grant Indian Citizenship to the Tamils who fled to India while the Sri Lankan Government had agreed to grant Sri Lankan Citizenship to Tamils of Indian origin and added that the agreement would be breeched if the refugees were resettled.
“TNA parliamentarian Suresh Premachandran has said Tamil refugees living in India should be resettled in Sri Lanka but such a move will be a breach of the agreement signed in 1986,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
