The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is fighting hard for the opposition leader's post so that they could get the new Constitution passed in Parliament, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said yesterday.

MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena told a news conference that the TNA had even written to the European Union and the United Nation asking them to intervene so that it could get the opposition leader's post.

“The TNA wants to return to the time when the opposition was an ally of the government in parliament so they can get the draft of the new Constitution approved,” he said.

The MP said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had accepted former president Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader.

However, the Speaker is yet a give a final ruling on the opposition leader's post because the TNA Leader who previously held the post, had opposed it.

The MP said the new opposition which is led by Mr. Rajapaksa was stronger and would not allow the new Constitution to be approved as long as it included detrimental clauses. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
