I would still pick flowers and china in White House, says Hillary Clinton

US: Democratic White House hopeful Hillary Clinton on Saturday said that as president she would probably still pick out the dinnerware and flowers for state occasions and send her husband, former President Bill Clinton, on special missions.
When asked during a Democratic candidates debate whether it was time to change the role of the president's spouse, the former first lady suggested the roles of both primary residents of the White House might be adjusted should she win the November 2016 election.
"With respect to my own husband, I am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that," said Clinton, the front-runner for her party's nomination.
"But I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have for special missions, for advice," she added.

Former First Lady Hillary Clinton suggested the roles of both primary residents of the White House might be adjusted should she win the November 2016 election.
Hillary Clinton played a major role in helping shape policy during her husband's 1993-2001 presidency, including an attempted overhaul of the nation's healthcare system.
The "flowers and china" moment drew wide attention on social media - including criticism of the moderators for moving away from foreign and domestic policy issues to ask the question.
"They definitely wouldn't have had the gall to ask about flowers and china patterns if the leading candidate on stage was a man," tweeted. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential aspirant Hillary Clinton today slammed Donald Trump's recent comments about banning Muslim immigrants, saying the Republican frontrunner was "becoming ISIS's best recruiter".
"He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists," she said.
She said that "it was not in America's interest to react with this kind of fear and respond to this sort of bigotry."
Trump, 69, was among the top issue being debated at the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire. Other Republican candidates hardly figured in the debate, thus reflecting that all of them consider him as their main rival.
"I worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the US and literally around the world that there is a 'clash of civilisations,' that there is some kind of Western plot or even 'war against Islam,' which then I believe fans the flames of radicalisation," she alleged.
Slamming the billionaire presidential hopeful for his anti-Muslim rhetoric including his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the US, Mrs Clinton said the first line of defence against radicalisation is in Muslim-American community.
"Donald Trump has a great capacity to use bluster and bigotry to inflame people and to make think there are easy answers to very complex questions," she said.
"We need to be united against the threats that we face. We need to have everybody in our country focused on watching what happens and reporting it if it's suspicious, reporting what you hear. Making sure that Muslim Americans don't feel left out or marginalised at the very moment when we need their help," she said.
Mrs Clinton asserted that the Muslim community needs to be befriended not demonised.
"We must work more closely with Muslim-American communities. I met with a group of Muslim-Americans this past week to hear from them about what they're doing to try to stop radicalisation. They will be our early warning signal. That's why we need to work with them, not demonize them, as the Republicans have been doing," Mrs Clinton said.
