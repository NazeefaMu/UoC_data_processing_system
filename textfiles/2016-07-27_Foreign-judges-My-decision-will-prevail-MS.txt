Amid different shades of opinion being expressed on the involvement of foreign judges in the proposed judicial mechanism to inquire into allegations of human rights and accountability issues, President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have said his decision would prevail at the end.

At a meeting with Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs in the joint opposition, Kandy District MP Keheliya Rambukwella pointed out that though President Sirisena was opposed to foreign judges, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said something different.

“There are different voices in the government. We do not know whose views are to be believed,” he said.

A United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution adopted on October 1, 2015, called for the setting up of a judicial mechanism made up of foreign judges.

The President said he held talks with foreign leaders and UN Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein. He said he had taken a stand on this matter and it won't be changed at any cost but however, he declined to outline his decision on the matter. (Kelum Bandara)
