President Maithripala Sirisena should stop former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran from interfering in State decision-making to ensure the credibility of the Special Presidential Commission to be appointed to investigate the CB bond issue, the joint opposition said today.

It said otherwise, it would only seen as a ploy to consume time.

“Mr. Mahendran is a frequent member of the Prime Minister's delegation when travelling abroad. He also takes part at Finance Ministry meetings. The President should stop Mr. Mahendran from attending these meetings so as to ensure the credibility and the impartiality of the SPC. Otherwise, people will get the notion that he is not guilty and that is why he is still engaged in State decision-making,” former MP G.L. Peiris told a news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
