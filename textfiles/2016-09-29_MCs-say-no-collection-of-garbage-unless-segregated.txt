All Municipal Councils in the country have decided to refrain from collecting garbage from November 1 unless they were segregated, the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry said today.

The ministry said the decision would affect all residences, shops, schools, hospitals and state institutions.

The decision was taken during a discussion held with all Municipal Commissioners and other officials last morning with the participation of Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha and Ministry Secretary Kamal Padmasiri.

“Disposed waste should be segregated under three categories as biodegradable waste, non-biodegradable waste and plastic or glass. Some of the Municipal Councils are already collecting segregated garbage,” the ministry stated.

During the discussions, the Municipal Commissioners pointed out that Municipal Councils had to face various difficulties with waste management due to irregular waste disposal.

Minister Musthapha said that steps would be taken to strengthen the Environmental Police to strictly implement the law against individuals who dispose waste on roadsides. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
