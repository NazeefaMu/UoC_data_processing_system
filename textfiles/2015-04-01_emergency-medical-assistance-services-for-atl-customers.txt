As part of its promise to make insurance open to all, Amãna Takaful (ATL) recently partnered with Falck Sri Lanka to provide its individual medical insurance policyholders with access to world-class emergency medical services (EMS). As part of the strategic partnership, all of Amãna Takaful’s ‘Hale & Hearty’ and ‘KruthaGuna’ policyholders will be entitled to free pre-hospital emergency care, provided by Falck Sri Lanka. 
Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, Falck is the largest multinational ambulance service provider in the world, operating 1800 ambulances in 47 countries and responding to two million emergency calls each year. Falck is revolutionizing the healthcare system and the company’s EMS has evolved from a simple system that merely provides emergency transportation to one that delivers timely transport combined with high-quality medical treatment and care throughout a patient’s journey to the hospital. Now all ‘Hale & Hearty’ and ‘KruthaGuna’ policyholders will be provided with added peace of mind, as they will have free access to emergency medical services in Colombo and its suburbs. 
Commenting on the partnership Amãna Takaful PLC Chief Executive Officer Fazal Ghaffoor stated, “We are proud to partner Falck Sri Lanka as part of our ongoing effort to provide our customers with completely hassle-free insurance solutions. Our partnership with Falck is both new and unique in the industry and extends beyond merely providing a benefit, to meeting an important need in society. 
Since a medical emergency requirement can occur at any time, this service will ensure that ATL’s ‘Hale & Hearty’ and ‘KruthaGuna’ policyholders and their family members can benefit from Falck Sri Lanka’s high-quality EMS at any time, at zero cost.” 
Falck Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Jens Paul Madsen stated, “Falck is truly honoured to partner with Amãna Takaful, a renowned insurance provider in Sri Lanka. We value ATL’s commitment to strengthening the medical insurance offering in Sri Lanka and this partnership will also play a crucial role in creating awareness about the importance of EMS. From our experience world over, we are of the view that pre-hospital emergency services have a lot of scope in Sri Lanka because they are able to deliver a high level of care to those in need.”
Regardless of where they are in Colombo and its suburbs, now ATL’s ‘Hale & Hearty’ and ‘KruthaGuna’ policyholders will have access to prompt and reliable emergency medical services. The ambulance services provided by Falck will ensure that policyholders are taken care of in their most critical time of need. It is widely recognized that most cases of injury are aggravated because of the manner in which injured patients are transported to hospitals. 
As part of its vision to serve the entire Western Province by March 2015, Falck has expanded its services from a head office in Ratmalana to EMS stations in Nawala, Wattala and Negombo. The expansion allows Falck to be more accessible and provide timely care. Falck aims to respond to medical emergencies within Colombo and its immediate suburbs as well as Negombo within 15 minutes from when an emergency call is made.
‘Hale & Hearty’ is a unique hospitalization cover which is designed to suit the medical requirements of both individuals and families. Customers can select schemes that provide an annual cover of Rs.100,000 upwards per individual, based on their specific needs. Besides the standard benefits that are offered as part of the medical policy ‘Hale & Hearty’ pays back the cost incurred due to the usage of an ambulance for hospitalization due to accidents or sickness.  
The policy also operates on a cashless claims settlement basis, so when facing unforeseen medical circumstances, policyholders can focus on obtaining proper care for themselves and their loved ones, whilst ATL attends to the financial burden. Additionally, policyholders can also benefit from cashless facilities at over 20 leading hospitals across Sri Lanka. 
‘KruthaGuna’ is the only hospitalization scheme in Sri Lanka that is designed for senior citizens and covers pre-existing ailments (from the second year onwards). ‘KruthaGuna’ policyholders are also provided with a special grant to purchase wheelchairs and fund their home nursing needs. The policy is offered on a reimbursement basis and customers can select from three schemes starting with an annual cover of Rs.100,000 per annum, per individual.
