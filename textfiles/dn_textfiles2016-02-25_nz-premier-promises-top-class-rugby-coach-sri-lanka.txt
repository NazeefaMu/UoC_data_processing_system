NZ Premier promises top class rugby coach for Sri Lanka

New Zealand Premier John Key yesterday promised to send a top-class rugby coach to assist the Sri Lankan national team.
Key, currently in Sri Lanka had made the promise following a request from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister for Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando during a luncheon hosted by the Prime Minister at Temple Trees yesterday.
"Key promised to ask current All Blacks rugby coach Steve Hansen to coach our national side once he steps down," Fernando said.
New Zealand head coach, Steve Hansen steered the All Blacks to their historic 2015 Rugby World Cup triumph and has announced his intentions to step down shortly.
"If Hansen declines Key promised to explore other alternatives," Fernando added.
