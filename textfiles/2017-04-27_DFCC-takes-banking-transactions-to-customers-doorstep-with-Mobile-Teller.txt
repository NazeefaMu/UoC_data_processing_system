Sustaining its momentum to offer technology-backed convenience to customers, DFCC Bank re-launches ‘Mobile Teller’, a digital banking service owned and operated by DFCC Bank and developed by SYNAPSYS. 
This doorstep banking service is offered by a staff representative, who accepts real time cash deposits via a mobile device. This offers customers the option of completing cash deposits at their preferred location provided it’s within a 10 km radius from the branch that offers the service. 
It’s simple to use and does not require any registration process apart from informing the bank branch of the requirement at a prearranged time.  
The Mobile Teller is operated via an app which is loaded on a bank owned mobile phone. The transaction is captured electronically and shared with the customer immediately. Besides this, the customer can also check account balances off this device with ease. The innovative service has already been deployed at DFCC’s Dambulla, Balangoda and Rathnapura branches, and now with the re-launch, is expected to be rapidly expanded across majority of the branch network.   Commenting on the re-launch of this innovative digital service, Arjun Fernando, CEO, DFCC Bank said, “The bank has re-launched the Mobile Teller service after considering the enhanced convenience it offers customers. We are a bank that understands the evolving needs of customers and seek ways of enabling them to conduct banking transactions at their doorsteps. 
“The bank is continuously innovating new financial solutions in keeping with its core value of customer centricity and our main objective is to offer seamless convenience when we introduce or enhance products 
and services.”
