Teeming with wit

He's the street artist they call the 'French Banksy', his provocative, epic murals appearing overnight, as if from nowhere. From the Paris banlieues where he grew up to New York and Shanghai, JR has a mission - to make us see those we have made invisible
Little more than 10 years ago, the Parisian photographer JR was what's usually called a vandal. He pasted things illegally in the street. Did you have a revelation at some stage, I ask him, when you thought, "Ah, this is art"?




"No. At the time, there was not street art," he says. "There was no Banksy. It's not the kind of thing you said you wanted to be when you're older."
What? A criminal?
"Exactly."
JR still pastes things in the street; it's just that the things have got bigger. And the world has an expanded idea of what's vandalism and what's art. JR's canvases are now tower blocks, whole buildings, entire streets. His scale is epic, monumental. He turned the separation wall between Israel and Palestine into a giant gallery of faces - Palestinians on the Israeli side, Israelis on the Palestinian side, though no one could tell. He transformed a huge favela in Brazil into a vast artwork in which he literally gave the town eyes, and he displayed a pregnant refugee on the point of giving birth on half a mile of the Seine embankment in the solidly bourgeois Ile Saint-Louis.
He's usually described as a street artist and given that he's from Paris, and started out spray-painting walls and has the semi-anonymity of those two initials (his real name has never been made public), "the French Banksy" is a description that tends to follow him around. But whereas Banksy is furtive, stealthy, inward, JR couldn't be more expansive. He works with a large team of people across two continents, collaborates constantly, and communicates - via Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and the walls of dozens of cities around the world - relentlessly.
He has a knack for making the invisible - people, usually, the poor, the marginalised, the forgotten - visible. It's a sort of magic trick, I realise, making people appear, making us take notice, although it's David Blaine, the American street magician, who is actually the one who points this out to me. Blaine is known for his feats of endurance that exist somewhere at the edge of art and magic and madness - he once spent 44 days in a Plexiglass box suspended above the Thames - and he's a friend of JR's.
"JR sees things from a different perspective," Blaine tells me. "He pasted this figure of a person, hundreds of metres long, on the sidewalk at Fifth Avenue and Madison and everybody was walking over it and nobody saw it until it was photographed from above. It was completely invisible but suddenly seen by everyone. The way he's using his art has made me think about magic in a very deep and personal way." When I meet JR, it's just a few weeks since Europe's refugee crisis has finally hit the top of the political agenda propelled by the heartbreaking image of a small dead boy on a beach. And it strikes me that it's a real-life example of exactly what JR has spent the past 10 years trying to do. It's all about trying to get people to take notice of the people we spend most of our lives failing to see, or maybe, more accurately, trying to avoid seeing. JR's work has been to find a strange angle or a previously hidden corner and bring them to us. He shows us them at massive scale, or across landscapes, or just in some new or surprising or beautiful way we weren't expecting.
JR used to be one of those people.
A banlieue kid. Half Arab - his father is Tunisian - he grew up on the wrong side of the Périphérique, the ring-road that separates the bourgeois quartiers of central Paris from the places where it houses its large immigrant population: in huge concrete cités or public housing projects. It was in one of these, Les Bosquets, that JR came to take photographs 12 years ago and set in train the sequence of events that's led him to where he is today.
It was in the same suburb that the riots kicked off exactly a decade ago, the riots that swept through the banlieues and then the rest of France over a period of weeks and saw running battles with the police and more than 10,000 vehicles destroyed.
And when I meet him, he's back in the neighbourhood with a film called Les Bosquets. Even by JR's standards, the project is a stretch. As a concept, it's bordering on hallucinatory: a classical ballet performed in a housing estate reimagining the events of the 2005 riots. It's just 17 minutes long and, in the blasted concrete wastelands, mixes first-hand video footage of the riots with ballet and modern street dance he has choreographed himself. -The Guardian
