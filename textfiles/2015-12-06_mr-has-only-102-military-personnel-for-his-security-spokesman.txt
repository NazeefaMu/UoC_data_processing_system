While claiming that 500 soldiers had not been assigned to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at all as reported, his spokesman said that Mr. Rajapaksa was in need for  500 more military personnel for his security as his life was in danger, instead of current strength of 102.
Spokesman Rohan Weliwita said Rajapaksa only had 102 military personnel for his private security at the moment, a number that needed to be increased to 500 with the release of LTTE detainees, who have not been rehabilitated, last month by the government.
Of the 102 soldiers, 80 were engaged in field duties while the remaining 22 were assigned to administrative duties.
When asked if President Maithripala Sirisena had ordered the immediate withdrawal of 500 personnel from the former President’s security team, Weliwita said 500 soldiers had not been assigned to Rajapaksa at all.
“These are false rumours spread by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Mr. Rajapaksa was not assigned such a team to begin with,” he said.
Thirty one ex-LTTE detainees were released by Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya last month on strict bail conditions following the approval of the Attorney General’s Department.
“At present there are two former presidents in the country. One of is Mr. Rajapaksa, who defeated the LTTE and other is former president Chandrika Kumaratunga. There is no threat on her as she did not defeat the LTTE,” Weliwita said.
A request to assign more soldiers for the Former President’s security team had already been made to the government, the Spokesman said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
