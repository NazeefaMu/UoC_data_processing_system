The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is to launch an indefinite strike in all hospitals island-wide beginning from May 15 demanding the nationalization of SAITM, the private medical college in Malabe.

The Executive member of the Association Dr. Nalinda Herath said the indefinite strike most probably would be from May 15.

He stated that the GMOA's executive meeting would meet tomorrow in Colombo to decide on the date.

The association has given the final warning about the indefinite strike to the government through the token strike on Friday, he added.

"The executive committee will decide on the date for commencement of the indefinite strike as government had not responded favourably on association's trade union actions taken so far", he said.

Dr. Herath expressed the confidence of support of number of other trade unions for their strike.(Dayaseeli Liyanage)
