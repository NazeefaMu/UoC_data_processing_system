Colombo University on an environmental mission
	
On April 14 (2017), when the man-made Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed killing 31 people, the entire nation mourned. Environment experts aired their views on what to do and what not to do. Everybody blamed the politicians and as usual it became a political issue, with various parties being subject to blame. Compensation was paid and temporary solutions were found by moving residents from affected areas to a safer place. Meanwhile long term plans were discussed in Parliament to shift the garbage dump from Meethotamulla to Muthurajawela and Puttalam. Unfortunately the decision-makers hadnt considered the impact on the environment when dumping garbage at Muthurajawela. Garbage shouldnt be dumped at Muthurajawela for the sake of the environment. 
Floods in the South
Before dust the settled in Muthurajawela another calamity took place. This time the nature played havoc by causing continuous rains for three days. The rains led to floods, mainly in the South. Apart from the 202 deaths, the damage to properties and livelihood exceeded a couple of billion rupees. The entire country rallied round to support the victims. The corporate sector, the media and religious leaders played huge roles. One notable event was highlighted in the process. The students of the Jaffna University collected school books and visited the South, distributing them among the schoolchildren whose books were taken away by the floods. We shouldnt forget that the mental wounds which were created by the war havent healed. These acts of kindness and generosity will be remembered for a long time. The Sri Lanka Army in Jaffna, under the leadership of Major General Mahes Senanayake (present Army Commander), played a huge role in organizing the travel of the undergrads from Jaffna to the South. 
Dengue epidemic
Generally health issues crop up after a flood. This time the dengue has so far killed 350 people. More than 100,000 people have suffered from dengue. Unless quick action is taken, the number of deaths will rise. The dengue mosquitoes are flying all over the island and now this disease has become a national issue and is considered an epidemic. Given this situation the academic staff of the Department of Zoology and Environment Sciences of the University of Colombo, headed by Prof. Wipula Yapa and Prof. Mayuri Wijesinghewith, the blessings of the Vice Chancellor Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake and the Dean of the Science Faculty Prof. K. R. R. Mahanama, initiated a shramadanaya (A campaign where participants provide their services free) at the university premises on the 27th July 2017. Those who participated not only cleaned the premises, but also took an initiative to counter dengue with the use of medicinal plants. They were able to create an awareness on how the improper disposal of polythene and plastic can aid the spread of dengue. The entire Faculty of Science, the University of Colombo and School of Computing (UCSC) supported the shramadanaya. 
Shramadanaya and BEEZ
Prof. Mayuri Wijesinghe, who organised the shramadanaya, received the support of all the students. Charuni Pathmeswaran was the link between the academic staff and the students. The Vice Chancellor provided a huge boost by deciding to close the Science Faculty at 1.00 pm so that students could take part in the shramadanaya. Its rarely that the Science Faculty halts lectures unless its absolutely necessary. The newly elected student body of Base for Enthusiasts of Environment Sciences and Zoology (BEEZ) under the leadership of Amayaa Wijesinghe (President) sprung into action. They had obtained the medicinal plants for a symbolic tree planting session and also organised a specially designed picture postcard to carry the message Say No to Polythene. One star class hotel was kind enough to provide refreshments for all (300) participants. Kavinda De Zoysa, an Alumnus of the University of Colombo, donated plants while Sampath Bank sponsored the event. 
Say no to polythene
Prof. Yapa who is the brainchild of the initiative Say No to Polythene is heading the awareness campaign. Through this initiative he hopes to reduce the use of polythene and plastic. He has had several discussions with like-minded people to find answers to how a reduction can be made in the use of polythene and plastic. He is of the opinion that all super markets should charge a reasonable price from the customers for Silisili Bags (Polythene bags) to discourage the use of polythene. For supermarkets to implement this the Government must intervene. Otherwise it wont happen due to various reasons. At this very moment Prof. Yapa is conducting a research on how to produce a somewhat stronger paper bag at a low cost to replace polythene bags. He is also earmarking bank branch networks to promote the concept Say No to Polythene among customers. 
Medicinal Plants to Counter Dengue
The initiative taken to counter Dengue by using Natures Friend-the plants- is the brainchild of Prof. Deepthi Wickremasinghe. Wickremesinghe had discussions with Prof. Yapa to make a joint effort with the view of countering Dengue. Prof. Wickremasinghe has collected several scientific data and statistics from programmes initiated by the leading organizations in other parts of the world on mosquitoes and Dengue. Her findings have made others become aware of the importance of the local plants such as Daspethiya (Marigolds), Pangiri (Citronella), Sera (Lemon Grass), Heen Maduruthala (Holy Basil), Kuppamania (Catnip) etc. During the discussions she made it a point that these plants not only have the potential to repel mosquitoes, but also can contribute to the Green Cover (even in the small way) and add value to the landscape (specially the use of Daspethiya). 
Green University
The Vice Chancellor during his address to the students thanked Prof. Yapa, the academic staff and BEEZ for initiating such an important event (Say No to Polythene and Counter Dengue) and requested students to get more involved in University activities mainly for the benefit of the environment. He reminded the students how he spent forty years with the University of Colombo-first as a student, afterwards as a lecturer and now as the Vice Chancellor. He said that his goal is to turn the University of Colombo in to a Green University by the year 2020. He has already started working towards realizing that goal. He requested students to protect the nature and the environment and help make the country a better place for future generations to live in. Prof. Mahanama, the Dean of the Science Faculty, in his address elaborated on the future plans of the university for the benefit of students. He requested them to obtain the maximum benefits from the facilities provided and work towards the betterment of the society. He also said that plans were being made to build three buildings to provide students with more facilities. He assured that none of the buildings will have a harmful effect on the environment.


Prof. Yapa in his speech thanked the Vice Chancellor and the Dean for playing an active part in the shramadanaya. He also thanked the academic staff and the students of the Science Faculty for extending their fullest cooperation to make the event a success. He highlighted the activities of the BEEZ, which is turning itself in to a beehive of activity. He also said that there are several environmental programmes in the pipeline and that they will be commenced within the next few months. He paid a tribute to AdeZ Sri Lanka (Link Children to the Nature) for joining hands with this shramadanaya campaign and requested them to continue the good work in the future too. 
Mission of the Professors
Its amazing to see how three university professors (Prof. Yapa, Prof. Mayuri and Prof. Deepthi) have taken initiatives to counter Dengue at low cost. Any person in Sri Lanka can implement these programmes in any part of the country. Sadly these professors arent prestigious award winners hence they wont grab media attention. This writer humbly request the media (TV and Print) to interview them so that more information can be obtained from the learned professors for the benefit of the general public. Prof. Wijesinghe set up the momentum for the entire university by bringing together all the students and other members of the faculty body towards a worthy cause. Prof. Wickremesinghe has already started her campaign with the students using medicinal plants. They hope to plant trees in 50 schools in the Colombo District. Prof. Yapa launched his campaign Say No to Polythene with a specially designed picture postcard. The first card was presented to the Vice Chancellor just before the shramadanaya. Whoever who buys a card will pledge to reduce the consumption of polythene. All proceeds from the sale of cards will go to implement the green programmes, organised by the BEEZ. 
The University of Colombo is one of the best or perhaps the best university in the country. The students are given the freedom to implement programmes under the guidance of a lecturer without compromising on their studies. Despite loads to study, the undergrads of the University of Colombo are committed to complete their mission. However, for this they need the support from all quarters. Any long journey has to start with the first step. Say No to Polythene started in July this year. As President Kennedy once said, It may take one day, one year or one hundred years to complete, but the main thing is to start. Forty years ago, when we were youth, practically every youth smoked cigarettes for fun, but it is not so now. They are aware of the repercussions. There is also a political will to stop smoking and the authorities have specified the penalty if a citizen is caught smoking in public. Polythene consumption can be reduced by educating the general public, but Government support is a must. 
Save the nature and environment
If we dont act now and save the environment, we will be forced to learn lessons on damaging the environment by paying a heavy price. Global warming has come to stay. No one needs to mention that its an unwelcome guest. We arent that blind not to observe the repercussions of climate change and global warming. Danger signals are already present and as adults we have a moral duty to work towards saving the environment. If we fail in our attempts the future generation will curse us for not protecting the nature and the environment. The time has come to give back what we owe Mother Lanka. All the polythene and plastic that we have used so far and what we are going to use in the future will remain for centuries (except for biodegradable ones) though our average lifespan is between 70-75 years. How can we justify what we have done to the environment by using polythene and plastic At least now there is some hope due to the awareness initiated by the University of Colombo. It should not be their mission only, but ours too.

Don't see any fault with AG's Dept: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that he did not like the Attorney General's Department being criticized by anyone and those who criticize must leave alone the AGs Department to work in an independent and stress free environment.
I dont see any oversight or mistake in the performance of the AGs Department", President Sirisena stressed.
President Sirisena told the Daily Mirror that there were lapses in filing charges against corrupt politicians and officials of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime but no one talked about what would have happened if there was no regime change in 2015.
He said Sri Lanka has been offered a grace period of two years from March 2017 by the UNHRC to fulfil the undertakings of the resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka in Geneva.
While reiterating that there will be no international judges or lawyers in a domestic inquiry on the alleged violation of the International Humanitarian Law (IHL), President Sirisena said it is premature to talk about a domestic inquiry now.
Commenting on the formation of the UNP  SLFP led Yahapalana Government and criticism on the government now by certain political groups, President Sirisena said, "When the two parties agreed to form a unity government in 2015, all approved it. So, why they criticized it now What would have been the outcome if both parties did not agree to this" he asked.
Commenting on the setting up of the National Economic Council (NEC), President Sirisena said it was established after consulting the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, the IMF and top professionals in trade and finance.
On the SAITM issue, President Sirisena said it has been over-politicized and beyond any quick remedy.
A discussion has been called by him among vice chancellors of all universities, deans of all medical faculties, the GMOA and officials of the higher education Ministry today to find a long lasting solution. In late 2014 all political parties affiliated to the UPFA vehemently protested against President Rajapaksa's decision not to go for a Presidential poll two years prematurely. I told him not to do it in writing. But he did not listen and declared an elections. He did that because he could not face the hostile attitude of the global community, the west in particular and the impending economic crisis," President Sirisena stressed.
If there was no regime change in 2015, the global community, the US and EU would have imposed trade embargoes against Sri Lanka and political and military leaders would have taken before International Criminal Court for war crimes. The Yahapalana Government was able to defuse that negative impact on Sri Lanka and no country or international agency now talk about Sri Lankas war crimes and electric chair. The entire international community is friendly and respects Sri Lanka now. As a result of this positive global atmosphere, Sri Lanka has been able to regain GSP+ and remove fish export ban to the EU, President Sirisena stressed.
"Though we have made a steady progress in the international arena, we have failed to put an end to corruption and waste" President Sirisena said. (By Sandun A Jayasekera)

From cooperatives, for cooperatives: SDB bank reaches 20-year milestone
	
Starting off with humble beginnings as an institution to help uplift the rural masses, Sanasa Development Bank PLC (SDB bank) has grown from strength to strength and today dares to aim greater heights.
Striving to grow keeping the Micro and SME sector at the core of its focus, SDB bank pledges to continue its commitment to the deserving segment despite its massive growth drive which would call for focus in new market segments.
As a bank that was established by cooperatives for cooperatives, today it stands firm largely due to its personal touch with customers.
As the bank gears up to embark on its journey towards the next decades, SDB bank Chief Operating Officer Kumar Mayadunne sat down with Mirror Business to share the entitys journey, current status, and future focus.
Following are excerpts from the interview:

BY Shabiya Ali Ahlam
Reaching the 20 year mark, how has SDB bank progressed since its establishment
This bank was started 20 years ago when the leader of the Sanasa movement founded the institution. The seed capital came fromthe grassroots.
When you are a cooperative bank you come under the supervision of the cooperative department .We fall into the category of LSBs.
We then wanted to grow but the bank saw the obvious limitations in doing up the capital. However we became a listed bank and fell under the supervision of the Central Bank (CBSL). There have been a lot of regulatory requirements in this period and we havemet expectations.
We started off as a very small bank, but we have seen the growth in the last two decades. We have a balance sheet of nearly Rs. 70 billion and we want to reach the Rs. 100 billion in the next two years. One would have never thought we would become to the size we are now. Much thanks to the regulators we have reached this stage.
Why do you attribute much of your progress to the regulator
Being regulated means you need to fulfill the mandatory requirements which push growth. Its either do it or leave, and we have been focusing on the former. It is in that context the progress is attributed.
There have been a couple of threats as well, such as the drive for consolidation that was announced few years ago. We were to either merge with a bigger bank or expand. We stood firm on being a single bank and put forward a plan to the CBSL on how we would continue to remain in that status. That was approved and here we are charting that course.


Our focus to the cooperative sector will not change. We are moving into international best practices and these are proven methods and projects. We have got the support and assistance of international experts due to the agreement with IFC. We have identified our three segments very clearly, towards customer value proposition.

Where do you opine SDB bank stands amongst other local banks
We most certainly stand out due to our area of focus. Ambitious as we are, we are currently in the midst of taking a quantum leap and have embarked on a QuantumLeap Project.
When small it is easy to control, learn and correct mistakes if any. It wont be so for long. With the quantum leap, our risk management is being completely reviewed now. We are simply getting ready for the future. We are gearing up to face challenges we might face in a few years time.
How has the bank diversified its client portfolio/segment to keep up with competition
In the past we were only catering to microfinance, where we became some years back the worlds best Micro-Finance bank. We catered to the grassroots level. Now things have changed as the microfinance space has elevated in the country and the need is for more SME funding.
Our focus to the cooperative sector will not change. We are moving into international best practices and these are proven methods and projects. We have got the support and assistance of international experts due to the agreement with IFC. We have identified our three segments very clearly, towards customer value proposition. Very clearly our segments are cooperatives, retail, and SMEs. So any customer will fall into any of these categories.
SDB bank caters much to the SME sector, a high risk category, which when it comes to numbers does not appeal to many financial institutions. Tell us about that. How has it in terms of recovery
The future of the country depends on SMEs and that is where growth is since participation is very high. They are people with a vision and with low overheads. What is noteworthy in this segment is their commitment to meet obligations. That is clear. Unless they have bad business ethics, but the majority is not that.
We are seeing a more brighter future for the SMEs. For all the banks the cake is getting smaller and smaller. And this is a good segment since it is highly represented. I would say that our experience in catering to this segment is having a low Non Performing Loan (NPL) rate.
It is high risk but it all depends on how you manage them. I must stress that it is only certain sectors within this segment that is high risk. But even those sectors we cannot ignore and stay away since they are important.
We are able to manage low NPL rates because of our experience in catering to this market. I must add that another reason as to why we are able to greatly cater to the SME sector is that we pay much emphasis on the personal touch with our customers.
Where ever we go we are in touch with the Sanasa societies, so we know better about our customers and potential customers.
We will be expanding further our SME business soon. SDB will be opening SME centers around the country to uplift tis group. Through that, we are confident we will be able to manage the sector much better than we already are.

We are remodeling the bank operations. We are more into sales focus, where also more emphasis will be given to sales and marketing. In short we will be centralizing the operations.In that change of focus credit centralization is key for which we have formed a credit assessment unit in Maharagama.

What is your view of the regulatory environment Is it facilitating enough to boost the sector and inturn the economy
The CBSL is very supportive. They understand our culture. We are a bank with a cooperative division. We were formed by that segment so we cannot forget about them or leave them behind. We owe it to the founders of this bank.
Personally I feel that the state has to pay more attention to the cooperative sector. They are doing a silent service to the national economy. They are the one most in need and are going on without being a burden to the government.
The government has to intervene. There needs to be a more proactive support to guide and bring them on to a correct path in terms of business operations. The attitude should be positive towards them. And that would help us in many ways since some discipline would be brought in.
What changes would you like to see in the environment Any improvements that would help facilitate the drive of SDB bank
We are seeing industry developments where numbers are getting better. The CBSL is positively supporting the banking sector. We can see their desire to help and put up
the numbers.
We have had regulatory support right from the beginning. We as a bank cannot expect anything more. I must stress that there has been fair play. They cannot be serving us with different spoons. If they did that, we will fall

The customer we had 20 years ago is not what we have today. The needs change. The newer generation wants convenience, and we are on track in catering to that in terms of facilitating SMS, mobile and internet banking

out from the competition and we will not be aggressive in our drive. They want more and proper controls, and that we find encouraging. It pushes our staff to be better.

What is the outlook for the bank in the medium and long term

We have a vision in becoming a commercial bank but before getting there we have a lot of work. Processes have to be changed and uplifted. Our people have to be more skilled. Automation is a must as customer needs will change.

The customer we had 20 years ago is not what we have today. The needs change. The newer generation wants convenience, and we are on track in catering to that in terms of facilitating SMS, mobile and internet banking.

We also have to look at our own systems now. Our own cards, even credit cards as we go on. Such plans are in the pipeline.

We are remodeling the bank operations. We are more into sales focus, where also more emphasis will be given to sales and marketing. In short we will be centralizing the operations.

In that change of focus credit centralization is key for which we have formed a credit assessment unit in Maharagama. We will soon be able to finalize loans within two to three days.

The entire restructuring will be finalized by end of December this year.

What new would we be seeing from SDB bank

We are investing with a futuristic vision, so there will be a lot of new that will be seen from SDB bank. Our existing branch network will be extended island wide. We have 93 branches currently and by 2020 we want to have 120. In the rural areas we are well represented so we have a good reach there. We want to increase our presence in the Western province. We are looking to support more upcoming businesses and Western Province is a hub. We aim to reap the benefits of that growth.

Our ultimate target is to be a commercial bank and we are well on track towards that.

We are well-geared both strategically and operationally to undertake the next phase of our journey. We have become a more focused business, striving for long-term, responsible growth that will combine profitability with the nations development. We have already laid a solid foundation built on upgraded products, cutting edge technology, an efficient delivery base and a good capital base to move forward on an upward trajectory.

Finally I must stress that our workforce across all levels have being our main pillar for the position we want today. Without their dedication and loyalty, we would not be what we are today nor would we be able to confidently take a leap forward.

Gammanpila goes to SC against 20A
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today filed a petition against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution in the Supreme Court (SC), thus becoming the first faction to challenge the piece of legislation in the SC.
Party leader and MP Udaya Gammanpila said they requested the SC that the 20A should not only be passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament but also receive the consent of the public at a referendum.
"The Constitution clearly says a referendum should be held if presidential elections or the general election is being postponed. Though it doesnt mention about the provincial council elections, people practice their franchise through elections. Therefore, the Constitution says any amendment related to people's franchise should receive the consent of the people at a referendum," he told journalists after filing the petition in SC.
He also said the current amendment was impractical. The MP said they were against the amendment based on political and constitutional factors and therefore, requested the SC to order the government to hold a referendum before passing the amendment. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Man discovers wife was married three times before
	
She was a beautiful woman of 28 and definitely not shy as she used to watch porn regularly in her younger days. She had married a youth from Colombo when she was only 17. As a result of this marriage that took place in 2005 she got pregnant with her first child.
However, her first marriage only lasted two years. When her husband went abroad for employment she got into a romantic affair with a youth from the village and married him in 2007. This was her second marriage. She was careful to take precautions so as not to get pregnant again.This marriage ended in three years.
She got married for the third time in 2010 and that marriage also ended within a short period of 3 years.
One day she was at a semi-government institution where she met one of the officers there. He was enamoured with her beauty and wished he could have her for his wife. He put this suggestion to her and much to his surprise she consented.
They registered their marriage in 2014 but he did not know that she had been married three times before as she hid the fact from him. Although they had a baby together their marriage started to suffer and all was not well. They were always quarrelling as a result and her husband also started to receive news of her previous infidelities and her previous marriages.
He went to the police, taking with him her previous three marriage certificates and lodged a complaint about his wife. He was told to commence legal proceedings against her for breaking laws pertaining to polygamy. (By D.G. Sugathapala)

MR responsible for predicament SLFP is in: SB
	
It was ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is responsible for the present predicament of the SLFP because he did not agree to nominate former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the August 2015 election, Minister S.B.Dissanayaka charged.
Minister Dissanayaka addressing the media at his office said that if the former President had done so the party would have won more 113 seats and a SLFP government under President Maithripala Sirisena could have been formed.
He added the SLFP Parliamentary Group, provincial leaders and other party stalwarts had wanted President Sirisena to nominate former Speaker Rajapaksa as the SLFP Prime Ministerial candidate at the August 2015 general election because he did not have any allegations of corruption, malpractices or crimes levelled against him.
Even President Sirisena was agreeable to the suggestion but former President Rajapaksa protested vehemently and we lost the election to the UNP, Minister Dissanayaka stressed.
On the other hand, UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe could have easily instructed President Sirisena to dissolve Parliament after victory at the January 8 Presidential poll and easily won the general election as well with a big margin utilising the election victory euphoria and formed a strong UNP government single-handedly as well.
The SLFP would not have won more than 60 seats if he had done so, but in a magnanimous gesture and show of Statesmanship, Mr. Wickremesinghe agreed with President Sirisena to form the 100-day Unity Government with the SLFP, he said. (By Sandun A Jayasekera)

Not concerned about no-faith motion: Rajitha
	
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna yesterday said that he was not in the least concerned about the no-confidence motion to be brought against him by the joint opposition as there were no basis to the allegations levelled against him.
Addressing a brief news conference, he said that the JO had brought a no-confidence motion against him for the sake of bringing one and the accusations placed against him in the motion were baseless.
Im happy that a group of crooks came up with the idea of a no-confidence motion against me. They think I will resign from my ministerial portfolio before the motion is passed in Parliament. Even if they bring ten such motions against me, Im confident that they would be defeated with ease because I have not been involved in any fraud. The irony is that those who aspire to sack me are the ones facing corruption charges and have no genuineness, Minister Senaratna said.
He said that the members in JO were at logger-heads with him for revealing their real image in public. I challenge them to pass this motion with a majority in Parliament, he added. (By Sheain Fernandopulle and pic by Damith Wickramasinghe)

Some 50,000 slums that were identified within the Colombo City limits, and at least half of them would be removed by year 2020, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Participating at a food festival at The Pettah Floating Market, the minister said around 10,000 new houses would be distributed among the people that would be built without state funding.
It is also the government's responsibility to provide houses for the people living in Colombo. As it gives houses to people in the north and east, to plantation workers; it is also their duty to provide a shelter to people in Colombo. We request the President to develop Colombo before thinking the countrys other places, he said.
He said Rs.864 billion had been spent on Hambantota development, while another Rs.377 billion on Kandy highway. But to build houses in Colombo or renovate its roads, no investments have been made by the government so far.
Therefore, Minister Champika requested the government to invest on Colombo to develop its infrastructure before going to develop the rural areas. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

US trains SL Customs to better screen dangerous cargo
	
The US Department of States Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) Programmetrained 33 Sri Lankan Customs officials in risk management of cargo from August 21to August 25.
Issuing a statement, the US Embassy said today that the training was conducted in Colombo and coordinated by EXBS.
Participants learned how to identify high-risk shipments and improve cargo targeting capabilities through the use of document analysis. Customs organizations utilize finite resources to screen cargo entering, transiting, and exiting their borders and the workshop provided the participants with concrete ways to assess the potential risk cargo may pose to national security and public safety. They can now better screen shipments by identifying those that require a physical inspection, it said.
It said the EXBS aims to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the transfer of conventional weapons that threaten regional peace and stability. 
The EXBS programmecomprises a wide range of nonproliferation strategic trade control assistance programs, from licensing and legal/regulatory technical assistance to provision of equipment and training for seaport, border control and law enforcement officials, the statement said.

Will defeat no-faith motion against Rajitha: Ravi K
	
Former Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake today said they would defeat the no-confidence motion brought against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne by the Joint Opposition MPs.
Addressing a news briefing organised by the UNP backbenchers, MP Karunanayake said they would show that they have faith in Minister Senaratne.
Today, the JO is making a joke out of no-faith motions. The latest motion had been signed by 39 thieves and handed over to the Speaker.We vehemently condemn this motion as this is an attempt to obstruct the achievements of the Yahapalanaya, he said.
He said as someone who has experienced no-faith motions, he came forward with other MPs to prevent no-faith motions being brought against others ministers.
He said the government was able to change the habit of legislators looting the public and to take the country forward.
Minister Senaratne committed immensely to bring the government to power. He is someone who speaks courageously. Therefore, a group of opposition MPs who are against these developments had brought a no-faith motion. We completely reject this, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
