The Elections Department yesterday introduced an SMS service-2343-for the general public to lodge complaints related to election law violations.
Introducing the new service at the Department, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said they have deployed separate officers to look into the complaints and then to reply to them. “Today (15) we will try our best to immediately respond to complaints after 10 pm. However, we will continue the service till Tuesday,” he said.
He said joint mobile teams of the department and police would be deployed to look into the complaints received and requested the people to be specific and especially to mention the exact location where the violation had taken place.
“This is a small attempt of introducing cyber technology to the department. We will move forward with the new technology. We should use e-mails instead of papers,” he said.
Mr. Deshapriya said people could send their complaints to the sms number 2343 after typing EC (space) EV (space) Name of the District (space) and then the complaint. He said complaints could be lodged in English, Sinhala or Tamil.
