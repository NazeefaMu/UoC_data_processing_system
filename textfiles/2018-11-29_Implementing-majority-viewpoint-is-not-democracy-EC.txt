Implementing majority viewpoint is not democracy: EC


	

Implementing the viewpoint of the majority is not what we call democracy but democracy is to implement the views of the majority in such a way that it would not prejudice the minority, Election Commission (EC) Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.

He said this at the Galle District Secretariat today.

“We cannot call it democracy if the views of the majority are implemented at the cost of the minority viewpoint. Real democracy prevails only when minority rights are protected,” Mr. Deshapriya said.

He said the essence of true democracy is the franchise which should be carefully used.

“The elections should be carried out in a peaceful atmosphere without violating the franchise of the people. We often witness the franchise of the people being violated and misused,” Mr. Deshapriya said. 

“I request everybody to respect the views of others and to act in a peaceful manner without violating the rights of others,” he added.
