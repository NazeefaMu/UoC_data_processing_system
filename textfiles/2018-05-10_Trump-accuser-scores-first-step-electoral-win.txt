AFP, 09th MAY, 2018-A woman who is among some 20 who have accused US President Donald Trump of sexual harassment won a Democratic primary vote for a seat in the Ohio state legislature on Tuesday night, news reports said.   If she wins the election in November, Rachel Crooks, 35, who ran unopposed, will become the first Trump accuser to hold elected office.  


Her allegation against Trump dates back to 2006, when she was a 22-year-old receptionist at Bayrock Group, a real estate development firm located in Trump Tower in New York.  


Crooks, who first made the allegations public before the 2016 elections, said she introduced herself to Trump one day when she saw him standing near the elevators.  


She said Trump then kissed her on one cheek, then the other, and talked to her between kisses.   
He also asked her where she was from, she said, or if she wanted to be a model.  


He would not let go of her hand and then began kissing her on the lips, she said, according to the Washington Post.  
Trump has denied her claims.
