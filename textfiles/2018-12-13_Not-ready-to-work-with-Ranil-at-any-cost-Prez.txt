In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling today, President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have told the parliamentary group of the UPFA that he is not ready to work with UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe at any cost.

After the court ruling was announced, the group met with the President. At this meeting, it decided not to be party to any national unity government with the UNP hereafter.

A party source said that if any of their members join hands with the UNP, it could not be construed as a party decision but an individual decision on the part of this member. (Kelum Bandara)
