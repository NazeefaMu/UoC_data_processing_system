A No-Confidence Motion (NCM) would be brought against IGP Pujith Jayasundera to get him removed over his alleged involvement in the alleged assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena and ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Joint Opposition (JO) said today.

JO Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said they had yesterday requested the Speaker to convene the Parliament next week instead of in two more weeks, to discuss the alleged assassination plot, the IGP and also the current economic affairs.

Meanwhile, MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena accused it was the nature of the United National Party (UNP) to assassinate leaders with the help of the Police as it could not win elections.

“With the help of the Police, the UNP politicians assassinated one of its leaders in the past. It was not the LTTE that killed him. President Premadasa was about to reveal those, who was behind this assassination but he was killed on May Day. Had he revealed this plot, half of Police and political higher-ups would have been ended up in jail,” he said.

He said the same set of events were taking place today and said the JO had no confidence in the investigations into IGP Pujith Jayasundera over his alleged involvement.

“The IGP is parading with DIG Nalaka Silva, who is also involved in the alleged plot, all over the countryside,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
