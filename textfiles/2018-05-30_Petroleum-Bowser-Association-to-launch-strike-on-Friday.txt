The Ceylon Petroleum Private Bowser Owners Association (CPPBOA) today warned that it would suspend transportation of fuel from CPC storage sites from Friday if authorities failed to increase payment for transportation by 12.5 per cent.

Secretary of the Association Shantha Silva said that subsequent to the recent fuel hike their association had requested the CPC increase their payments.

“We have approached the CPC Distribution Manager, the CPC Chairman, Minister, President and Prime Minister regarding the payment. The President considered the matter and requested that we wait for a favourable reply, he also directed the Ministry to submit a report,” Silva said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
