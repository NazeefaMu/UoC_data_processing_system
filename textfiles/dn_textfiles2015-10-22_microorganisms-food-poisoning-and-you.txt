Microorganisms, Food poisoning and You

The current food trend of most of the people is to buy pre-prepared ready-to eat convenience foods and dine out in restaurants and cafes and there is a growing demand for foods of animal origin. Though it gives many new choices to busy life styles, now it has possibly create a greater risk of food poisoning.
Food Poisoning is a general term used to describe illness caused by all types of food-borne microorganisms. Food poisoning and food infection are different, although the symptoms are similar. Food Infection is caused by eating foods containing certain type of live bacteria. Once the contaminated food is consumed, the bacteria themselves continue to grow, usually in the intestine and illness can result.
To prevent such illnesses, understanding about the bacteria that cause food poisoning is essential.
Food poisoning is of two types. Food intoxication is caused by eating food that contains a toxin or poison due to bacterial growth in the food. The bacteria that produced and excreted the toxic waste products to the food may be killed, but the toxin that they produced remains on the food causing the illness or digestive upset to occur. Toxin-mediated infection is caused by consuming food contaminated by organisms that produce toxins only after they have been ingested into the body.
There are lot of microorganisms associated with food poisoning. Staphylococcus aureus produces a heat stable toxin which grow for several hours in foods such as chicken pot pie or cream filling. The growth of Clostridium botulinum and production of its toxin is effected by the Ph of the canned food. All fruits, vegetables and meats carry this microorganism, but because of their acidic nature, fruits will not permit its growth. Meats and most vegetables are not acid foods and will support its growth. Clostridium perfringens grows in warm food like beef and produces toxins. It also causes a food infection by continuing to grow and producing toxins in the intestinal track. Camphylobacter jejuni is a bacteria causes Campylobacteriosis is commonly found in the intestinal tracts of healthy animals (especially chickens) and in untreated surface water. Bacteria called Salmonella causes food infection Salmonellosis when foods containing bacteria are consumed. Though Escherichia coli live peacefully in the gut, helping keep the growth of more harmful microorganisms, one of its strain causes a distinctive and sometimes deadly diseases.
Food poisoning microorganisms are often present naturally in food but usually only in small numbers. However, if the appropriate conditions are given, their numbers can be increased very rapidly. This is where the food poisoning becomes a problem. In order for an outbreak of food borne disease to occur certain conditions must exist.
The microorganisms or its toxin must be present in the food and it should suitable for the organism’s growth. The conditions of warmth, moisture and pH must be suitable for the orgnaism’s growth. Sufficient time must be given for the organism to grow and multiply. There must be enough of the microorganisms or their toxin present to cause illness. Food must be consumed. So it is vitally important that we do not given these bacteria the right living environment where they can grow and multiply quickly. Then only the food poisoning can be avoided.
Bacteria grow on and in some types of food such as meat, dairy products including milk, cheese, yoghurt and prepared salads, cooked pasta and cut fruit salads more easily than others. Other than that any food type which provides a suitable habitat for microorganisms can easily get effected.
If a person eats food contaminated by pathogenic bacteria, it may lead to extreme illness (possibly even death), acute vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, and stomach cramps. Different levels of sickness may be caused by pathognic bacteria depending upon the type and number of pathogenic bacteria present and the risk type of person (high-risk people include the unwell, young, old and pregnant mothers).
Food may be contaminated due to poor handling, storage and poor personal hygiene by those preparing and serving food. As food poisoning bacteria are everywhere in the soil, in water, on animals and people and on the things people touch and use, it is possible for many foods to contain or be contaminated with these bacteria from the start. Even if food is free of these bacteria, it can still be contaminated during food storage and food preparation. So that good peronal hygiene practices, proper handling and storage of food before and after preparation and keeping foods at temperatures that inhibits the growth of bacteria can also be effective.
