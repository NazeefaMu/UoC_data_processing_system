He accepts the denial true to Diyawanna tradition


	



 

The one who presided over the Diyawanna council during the previous regime had recently received a very important telephone call. 

 


The caller was a purohita, the namesake of his more illustrious younger sibling who too is hailing from Giruwapattu. 


The purohita had rung up the elderly politico to convey his denial of a certain controversial public statement attributed to him by the former council chair’s other sibling who once handled the country’s defense establishment.  After making this denial, the purohita charged that another member of the clan had spread the statement attributed to him.


The elderly politico who was taken aback by this accusation asked the purohita to identify the member of his clan who gave wings to the statement. The he gave the name of a young member of the same family. 


Then the former council chair had quietly settled the issue saying: “The young man you named never told me anything about the statement attributed to you.  


But several others who spoke to us told us that you made that controversial statement. Now that you are saying you never made the remarks attributed to you, I am prepared to accept your denial. So the matter ends there!”
