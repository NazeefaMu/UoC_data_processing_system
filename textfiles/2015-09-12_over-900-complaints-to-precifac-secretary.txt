The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption as Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had received 900 complaints with regard to frauds and acts of corruption while 250 of them had been forwarded to the investigation unit for reference, its secretary Lacille De Silva said yesterday.
Mr. De Silva said 50 complaints out of the 250, which had been referred to the commission’s investigation unit, were being investigated.
He requested the people to forward their complaints with regards to frauds and corruption that occurred between 2010 and 2015 to the Secretary, PRESIFAC, Colombo -07.
He said the commission had been conducting investigations into these cases for the past three months and that it was not an easy task to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption when the relevant officials do not cooperate with the officials of the investigation team.
“Our investigation officials have to get over many obstacles to get to the facts when investigating allegations of fraud and corruption as the relevant officials are hesitant when asked to cooperate with them just as in the case where an army official was found to have lied before the commission when giving evidence,” he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)
