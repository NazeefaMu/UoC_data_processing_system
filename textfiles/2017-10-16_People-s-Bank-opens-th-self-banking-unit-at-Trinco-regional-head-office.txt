Marking a milestone in its 56 years long history, People’s Bank recently opened its 100th self-banking unit in the People’s Bank Trincomalee regional head office premises.


The self-banking unit is equipped with two automatic teller machines (ATMs), a cash deposit machine (CDM) and a kiosk for making utility payments. This unit will provide an efficient banking service to the customers in the locality, offering a convenient banking experience 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. 


People’s Bank also launched a self-banking unit at the Trincomalee central bus stand premises on the same day. 


People’s Bank Chairman Hemasiri Fernando, Senior Deputy General Manager Banking Operations Boniface Silva, Deputy General Manager Banking Support Services Mahinda Premanath, Assistant General Manager Channel Management and ATM Operations Krishantha Gunaratne, Trincomalee Regional Manager R. Ravikaran and Trincomalee Branch Manager N. Premkumar, the staff of People’s Bank and a large number of customers were present at the occasion. 


In conjunction with the digitalization programme, which aims to provide ultimate convenience in banking, People’s Bank established its first self-banking unit at the People’s Bank head office premises last December. Thereafter, People’s Bank established a number of self- banking units in various parts of the island and intends to rapidly expand the service to remaining areas.
