The police officers stationed in the North are reportedly nonplussed and at a loss as to how they are to carry out the orders issued by Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara they should at least build one house each to be donated to people in the area.

Northern Province Senior DIG Roshan Fernando has taken initiative to instruct the police personnel under his command about request made by the IGP.

Already, housing construction has been undertaken in most areas of the country for the benefit of needy people. At the moment, 13 houses have been constructed in the area coming under the Vavuniya Police Division and 12 in the Mannar Police Division.

The Kilinochchi Police Division has constructed one house and the Mullaitivu Division another. The Northern Province DIG has expressed displeasure that no such work has been undertaken by the Police Divisions in Jaffna and Kankesanthurai.

All the 53 police stations have been ordered to complete at least one house each before December 31, 2018.

However, police sources in the North said they were in a dilemma as to how money could be raised to implement such housing projects. They said this could even lead police officers to solicit bribes from unlawful business operators such as timber racketeers and sand miners to build houses within the stipulated time.(Kelum Bandara)
