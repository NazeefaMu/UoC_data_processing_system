The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday said a national front would be launched with regard to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe by making the political parties of the country aware of the matter.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing that they have discussed the matter with the Joint Opposition members including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) during recent days.

“We have already written to President Maithripala Sirisena on the effects of the ruling directing the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register SAITM's MBBS graduates. We have also written to the general secretaries of the SLFP and UNP on the matter,” he said.

He said the GMOA had conducted several discussions with state university students, parents and several unions including the Inter University Students’ Federation (IUSF).

He said the reason behind this open discussion of the matter was Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s irresponsible behaviour and his SAITM-biased stand; “Our aim is to create a strong force against the SAITM and secure the patients' lives as well as the medical field. We are taking every possible step to do so,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
