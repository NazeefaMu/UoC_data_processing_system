The Japanese firm which was to be given the contract to carry out the third stage of the Central Expressway is said to have withdrawn, thus compelling the government to search for another construction company.

The expressway is to be constructed in three stages with the contract for the first stage from Kadawata to Mirigama awarded to a Chinese company and the second stage to Kurunegala via Potuhera awarded to a local contractor.

Under the third stage, the expressway will stretch from Potuhera to Kandy.

When asked about the progress made into the work on the third stage, Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said a new contractor would be found after the Japanese contractor withdrew after five months of negotiation.

“There are proposals from several companies. We will finalize the contractual process in due course,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
