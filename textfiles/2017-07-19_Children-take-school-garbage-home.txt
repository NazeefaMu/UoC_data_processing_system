Children take school garbage home


	



 

The garbage disposal in the city has become an explosive issue. However, a super-school in the city – one close to Borella – has hit upon a novel method of disposing of the school garbage.

 


The task of removing the waste collected in the class room has been assigned to the children themselves!  Children are placed on a roster for the purpose and every child is required to collect the day’s garbage in a bag when his turn on the roster comes and take it home after school for disposal. 
Children of this school carrying garbage bags along with their school bags are drawing objections and caustic remarks from school van drivers and bus conductors these days, they say.


“The solution to the garbage problem found by the school has aggravated our garbage problem at home,” a highly concerned parent said.  “It’s pity even supposed to be educated people are also resorting to patchwork solutions,” he added.
