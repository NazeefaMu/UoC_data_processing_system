Import tax increased to control numbers


	

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said, at a media briefing yesterday, that there were one million three wheelers registered in the country. He said the import tax on them was increased in order to control their numbers.

With the young people, on completing of their studies, wanting to earn money by operating three wheeler taxis, there seemed to be a dearth of young people for developmental activities in the country.

Last year alone there had been 90,000 vehicles, including three wheelers, brought into the country.

Though the tax had been increased earlier, vehicle imports had increased by 55%, he said.

The importation of vehicles should be governed by a national policy and, until the road system is improved, the importation should be discouraged, he said. (Jayantha Samarakoon)
