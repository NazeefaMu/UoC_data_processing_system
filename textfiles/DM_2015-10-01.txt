AIA rolls out Pensions Month this October
	
AIA is rolling out Pensions Month this October and asks how big is your pensions funding gap Most Sri Lankans dont know how much they will actually need at retirement, nor have they really thought about it. This is a mistake that could cost dearly, as in life you dont get to go back and start again. 
A significant gap exists, between the level of retirement income people are set to receive after retirement and the level of income they will actually need. The reasons range from increasing life expectancy, over confidence in or not contributing enough to existing savings plans, to not having any plans at all.
AIA Head of Marketing Suren Perera commented, Most people dont really have an idea how big a pension pot they will need when they retire but the hard truth is that retirement comes before you know it and more often than not, we are not ready for it. As a responsible company, our mission is to make sure that Sri Lankans are retirement ready and the only way to do so is to help them close the pensions gap - by educating people that you need to start saving earlier, start planning younger. 
Remember, the younger you are, the more time you have to build up a suitable fund to afford the lifestyle you desire at retirement. Your future is in your hands and you can make it comfortable.
AIA will take this message around the country, to educate everyone on the importance of bridging this pensions gap. Led by a dedicated team of wealth planners, the initiative will engage and educate customers and the public across the country.
AIA will launch a unique online retirement income calculator on October 8, the National Pensioners Day. This personalised calculator will open your eyes to the amount you will need for the retirement you desire and provide you with advice to get there. You can visit the AIA website on www.aialife.com.lk and have a go.

Fitch assigns A(lka) rating to HNB Grameen Finance
	
		 		 
		 
			
Fitch Ratings has today assigned HNB Grameen Finance Limited (HGL) a national long-term rating of A(lka) with a stable outlook.
HGLs rating reflects Fitchs expectation of support from its parent, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB; AA-(lka)/Stable). This view is based on HNBs majority shareholding (51 percent), its involvement in the strategic direction of HGL through board representation and the common HNB brand.
The two-notch differential reflects HGLs limited role in the group. HGL is mainly engaged in the provision of microfinance, which is not a significant product for HNB as it accounted for 2.7 percent of the banks loan book at end-June 2015. Furthermore, there is limited operational and management integration of the entities.
HNB acquired 51 percent of HGL in November 2014 as part of a financial-sector consolidation programme. The bank rebranded the finance company and now has four seats on HGLs board, including the chairmanship.
HGL obtained a licence to operate as a finance company in 2010. It accounted for just 1.2 percent of the Licensed Finance Company sectors assets at end-March 2015.

Implementing UNHRC recommendations problematic: Nimal Siripala
	
	The implementation of the UNHRC, recommendations including the establishment of a war crimes tribunal, would create many legal issues in the countrys judicial system, as a new Constitution and a referendum would be required to implement the recommendations, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) said today.
	The SLFP's senior vice president, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the highest court in Sri Lanka was the Supreme Court and there was no hybrid court in Sri Lankas judicial system.
	The UNHRC report says that Sri Lanka needs to adopt feasibility legislation, specific legislation to facilitate a hybrid court mandated to probe war crimes committed by security forces personnel. We will need to change our Constitution in order to make room for a hybrid court, and we cant make these happen overnight, he said at a media briefing.
	The minister also said the UNHRC had further recommended that new legislation should be enacted to criminalise war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and enforced disappearances, and said new laws would have to be enacted by parliament in order to criminalise these subjects.
	According to our law, if a new law was passed, we cant apply that law to deal with what was done in the past. Therefore, if we are to introduce new laws and then to probe war crimes which were committed in the past, we will have to have a referendum to get the people's approval, he said; adding that passing new laws and changing the Constitution were not simple procedures and many problems would would arise when attempts were made to do so.
	He said the final position of the SLFP on the subject was not yet to decided as the special committee appointed by the party was still carefully perusing the contents of the final report adopted by the UNHRC.
	The minister thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for his achievements at the United Nations and said the delegation had been successful in watering down the resolution to some extent. However, our final stance on the resolution will be made public soon, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

After he was disharged by Court he made this revelation. He also said, On Wednesday the 16th four policemen came to my home. They were not in uniform. There was a friend of mine with me at that time. They took me and my friend with the laptop in a three wheeler saying they were taking us to record a statement. At the police station I was separated from my friend and taken to the back of the police station and forced to kneel. Then they beat me saying arent you the ones who committed this crime My mother was not allowed to see me and I was not given any dinner. They continued to beat me. Then they removed my clothes and began to examine me, an ASP also joined in and took photos of me in the nude
He said that he continued to deny the charge and say they were innocent of the crime. "They threatened to kill me, Later they took us to court and we were remanded in the Negombo Prison," he said. He said he was not involved in the crime and there were no photos of Seya on his laptop.

She said she was grateful to the attorneys, the class teacher, other teachers at the school and the media for helping to get her son released. "After my son was taken into custody by the police most people looked at us differently, and some looked at my son as though he were a beast. When my son was on remand our relatives helped me a lot. They shared my grief on hearing about the assault by the police, it is my firm wish to educate my son, therefore I appeal to everyone not to treat my son like a criminal," she said.(Tharindu Jayawardene and Tony Karunanayake)

	The new resolution on Sri Lanka that was submitted to the UNHRC last Thursday, was adopted without a vote a short while ago, as part of the proceedings of 40th meeting of the UNHR Councils ongoing 30th session.
	The resolution A/HRC/30/L.29, titled Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka was submitted before the Council last Thursday following a series of negotiations between the Sri Lankan delegation and the Core Group sponsors to which included delegations from Albania, Australia, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, UK, Northern Ireland and the US.
	Meanwhile, the resolution also enjoyed the support of 25 more additional co-sponsors.
	It was submitted last Thursday about five hours behind schedule, due to setbacks that resulted from prolonged negotiations over its language, as objections were raised against certain paragraphs and wording included in the draft text by the Sri Lankan delegation.
	However, eventually Sri Lanka decided to co-sponsor the resolution once a consensus was reached over its content.
	The resolution while welcoming the governments recognition an accountability process to uphold the rule of law, affirms the importance of having independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by personnel known for integrity and impartiality and has further noted the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the Special Counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers, and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
	The resolution has also recognised the need for accountability and reconciliation process for the violations and abuses committed by the LTTE as highlighted in the recently released OISL (OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka) report.
	Moreover, it has called for the OHCHR to continue to monitor Sri Lankas progress in the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes linked to reconciliation, accountability, and human rights and calls for the High Commissioners Office to present an oral update to the UNHRC at its 32nd session as well as a comprehensive report followed by discussion on the implementation of the present resolution at its 34th session.
