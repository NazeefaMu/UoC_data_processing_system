The employees of an august assembly are said to be dining champagne-style in high-end hotels in the city thanks to a series of US-sponsored seminars being held for them these days.

 


These employees call it a day after attending a one-hour lecture followed by an amusement programme which includes a few games, they say. 


Employees say that they are having a good time thanks to the generosity of the US government.
