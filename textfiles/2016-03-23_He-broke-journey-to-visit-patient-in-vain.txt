A large number of friends and well-wishers have already visited the purohita now convalescing following bypass heart surgery at a reputed hospital in Singapore. Numerous members from Diyawanna and provincial councils had been among those visitors. 

 


The purohita had happily chatted with all these callers and thanked them for visiting him.
Meanwhile, a certain high up who made it to the Western council from Kaduwela area while on his way to China decided to break journey to pay a visit to the purohita hospitalized in Singapore. 


This provincial high up called at the Singapore hospital in question and sent a ‘chit’ to the purohita expressing his wish to see him. The provincial man shortly afterwards got back the ‘chit’ through a messenger and a legend written on it said:  The patient regrets he cannot meet the visitor.  


The highly dejected provincial politico had left the hospital blaming himself for his own stupidity, they say.
