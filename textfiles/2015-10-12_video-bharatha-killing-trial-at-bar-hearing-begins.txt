	Former UPFA Parliamentarian Duminda Silva and eleven other accused were indicted by the Attorney General under 17 charges for unlawful assembly, causing the murders of former Parliamentarian Bharatha Lakshaman Premachandra and three others and for committing serious injuries to Mr. Premachandra’s official body guard Rajapurage Gamini on October 8, 2011 at Walpola in Mulleriyawa.
