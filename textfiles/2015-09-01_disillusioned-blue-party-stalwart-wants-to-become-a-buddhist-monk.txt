Disillusioned Blue party stalwart wants to become a Buddhist monk!


	

A group of disillusioned Betel leaf stalwarts have taken a collective vow not to face the hustings again in their lifetime, they say. 
The bearded red firebrand who became a docile follower of the deposed strongman and several others who made their Diyawanna debut in 1989 belong to this group.
A Blue stalwart who contested in Wayamba alongside the deposed strongman, apparently the most disillusioned of this group poured out his heart to several confidants of his.
“I will never contest again,” he was saying. “I would rather get myself ordained a monk. Tell the new Boss to do us justice while he could.”
