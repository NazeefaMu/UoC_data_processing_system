Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s nomination to contest the general election benefited the United National Party (UNP), Minister John Amaratunga said today.
He said many SLFP front-liner including ministers had decided to join the UNP but had missed out on the nominations because by that time the list of candidates had been finalised.
The minister told a media briefing at the UNP headquarters, Sirikotha that President Maithripala Sirisena’s decision to satisfy the SLFP by giving nomination to the former president has directly and indirectly benefited the UNP.
“Some say the President thought it better for the SLFP if Mr. Rajapaksa was allowed to contest the election while some say he will not be allowed to contest elections though given nominations. We don’t care whether Mr. Rajapaksa contests or does not contest because either way the UNP will be benefitted,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
