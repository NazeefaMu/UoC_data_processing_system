Former minister and UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday false allegations had been levelled against him by the same government which they formed.

"Is this the Good Governance? The same government, which we formed, treated me like a terrorist," he said.

He told parliament that the same economic stalwarts who steered the country towards a negative economy in 2000 during the Chandrika Kumaratunge’s government are running the country today and added that they have been allowed to easily ruin the economy which the present government developed.

“The officials of the finance ministry did not discuss at least once with me as to how did I managed the economy as the former finance minister,” said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
