Condemning the assault on Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Malaysia Ibrahim Ansar, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament today it was Malaysian Tamils of Indian origin responsible for the incident.

Making his remarks in response to a question by Joint Opposition’s Parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane, the Prime Minister said perpetrators were not Sri Lankans by any means.

He said those persons were members linked to a South India based political party called Naam Thamilar. He said that this party, lobbied internationally to refer Sri Lanka to an international war crimes tribunal.

However, the Prime Minister said the Government would dispatch a delegation to Malaysia to engage with them and brief them on measures being taken here for reconciliation among different ethnicities.

"A war crimes tribunal is not our intention. We have to brief them. We will send a team to South India as well," he said.

"We condemn the assault on the High Commissioner. Soon after the incident, I instructed the Acting Foreign Affairs Minister to summon the Malaysian Envoy and register our protest. The Malaysian Government is bound to give protection,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan Government has sought a full report on the incident.

Referring to the security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said the Government would take the responsibility to give security and other entitled facilities. However, he said security personnel with fire arms could not be sent from Sri Lanka when travelling abroad.

"That is up for the host country. When I went to Singapore recently, two security personnel were with me. But, they are not allowed to carry weapons," he said.

He said the facilities entitled to a former President were accorded, when Mr. Rajapaksa was visiting South Korea and Japan.

Quoting a press statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Malaysia, he said the Malaysian authorities regretted the incident, and assured to cooperate with the Sri Lankan mission to avoid repetition of such problems in future. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
