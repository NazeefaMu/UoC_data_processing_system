UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday called the opposition MPs including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who accused him of insulting Supreme Court judges for a public debate.

Mr. Ramanayake was responding to the allegation made by the opposition MPs that he had insulted judicial offices using his parliamentary privileges.

The MPs last week complained to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that Mr. Ramanayake was insulting the Supreme Court judges. The MPs said Mr. Ramanayake should not have been allowed to insult the judges.

“Speaker should look into this matter,” Former President Rajapaksa said while questioning as to where the Parliament would end up if the MPs used their privileges to insult others.

“Those who are accusing me of insulting the judicial officers are the very same people who insulted judges when they were ruling the country. These MPs insulted Former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake. Judgments were decided upon at Temple Trees during that time,” Mr. Ramanayake said.

“ I am challenging these MPs for a public debate and I will prove my allegations during this debate,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
