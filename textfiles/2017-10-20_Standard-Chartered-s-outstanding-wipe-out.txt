Standard Chartered’s outstanding wipe out


	

Standard Chartered once again brings to its credit cardholders a one-of-a-kind proposition – the freedom to shop and to be one of the lucky winners to have the bank pay off the outstanding balance on the credit card.


All Standard Chartered credit cardholders have the prospect of having the ‘outstanding’ on their credit card wiped out up to a maximum of a million rupees when they spend a minimum of LKR25,000 a month on retail purchases with the card. The campaign will run from 1st September to 31st December 2017, generously including a high-spend holiday season. A lucky winner will be chosen each month and have his or her balance wiped out or reduced by a million rupees.


Standard Chartered Sri Lanka Retail Banking Head Bingumal Thewarathanthri said: “At Standard Chartered we are constantly looking for better and more innovative ways in which to delight our clients and reward them for their valued patronage. The bank’s credit card propositions cater to a wide range of lifestyle choices and all of our cardholders are eligible to stand a chance to win this outstanding offer. In April this year Standard Chartered refreshed the offering on its co-branded credit card with Arpico by taking away up to a maximum of ten thousand rupees of the total bill the first time new card holders swiped at any of the Arpico stores. This great opportunity which is available to existing and new cardholders alike on all of our cards is yet another unique wipe out campaign which we hope will prove to be an extremely welcome one.”


Standard Chartered’s credit cardholders must note that to be eligible for the draw on the wipe out campaign credit cards must have a minimum spend of LKR25,000 per month on retail purchases. Retail purchases exclude cash withdrawals, balance transfers, loans on card, fees, interest payments, and charges levied by the bank. The winner will be selected by the bank in accordance with its internal processes and the decision of the bank in this regard will be final. 


The winner in a particular month will be informed by the 20th of the following month and the reimbursement will be reflected in the card account at end of the notification month.
