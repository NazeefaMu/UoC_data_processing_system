The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is to complain to foreign embassies about Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne’s inability to find a solution to the dengue outbreak in the country which had now reached epidemic proportions.

Addressing a press briefing, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said if the present government was unable to control Minister Senaratne the GMOA would have to request the international community to intervene to save the country’s health service.

Dr. Aluthge said Minister Senaratne’s actions has violated the norms of the medical education and had resulted in dengue now increasing to epidemic proportions.“The negligence shown by the minister and the authorities had helped in increasing the mosquito density in almost all the districts," he said. According to the Parasitologist’s report this hyper-epidemic situation would prevail for another two months,” he said.

He also said the Health Ministry had so far ignored announcing the dengue patients’ count to the respective area medical officers which is an important step of controlling the situation.

Dr. Aluthge also said there was a lack of facilities to conduct the ‘NS1 Antigen’ test that allows rapid detection on the first day of fever to ascertain if a patient has Dengue.

Therefore, he urged the authorities to take all possible measures to control the situation or the GMOA would reveal the true situation to the entire world for the benefit of patients. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
