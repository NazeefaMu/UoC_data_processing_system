The joint opposition yesterday said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should resign from his post without further tarnishing the dignity of the Parliament.

Joint opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena told a news conference that the Parliament has now been in an unfortunate state and added that State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe had stated in Parliament that Speaker Jayasuriya was a biased person.

He said that the joint opposition had said the same facts some years back and now a government minister had also said it.

“Speaker Jayasuriya has admitted that there are few shortcomings on his part in the process of presenting the Bill to increase the number of female representatives in Provincial Councils in Parliament,” he said.

“It is Speaker Jayasuriya’s responsibility to resign from his post if he, himself has admitted it and government ministers are also saying the same fact that he is a biased person as well as the opposition political parties,” he added.

Meanwhile, joint opposition member Prof. G.L. Peiris said that they would personally file cases claiming compensation against the police officials who were engaged in arresting parties attached to the opposition with no legal basis. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
