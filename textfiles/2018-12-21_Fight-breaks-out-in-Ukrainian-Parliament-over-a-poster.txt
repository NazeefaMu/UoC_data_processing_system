A fight broke out in Ukrainian Parliament after a bill was passed demanding that the Ukrainian Orthodox Church explicitly indicate its link to the Moscow Patriarchate in its name, the Independent reported this morning.

In total, 240 politicians voted in favour of the draft law, which resulted in punches being thrown.

Bloc Party member, Nestor Shufrych removed a poster which labelled politician Viktor Medvedchuk “Putin's agent.”

Opposition party member, Yuriy Bereza then punched him in the face, before other members piled in.  

Speaker Andriy Parubiy called for a break following the bust-up.
