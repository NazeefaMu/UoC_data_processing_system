Singer Finance (Lanka) PLC, a subsidiary of Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC, launched its credit card recently. Singer Finance created history as the first non-banking financial institution in the country to launch an internationally accepted credit card. 
Unveiled at an internal ceremony, the new Singer credit card will now be available to customers.
The new credit card powered by VISA will be accepted at all local and international merchants and ATM locations.  
“Offering a credit card is a logical extension of our activities, as Singer has been in consumer finance in Sri Lanka since 1877. We plan to effectively and aggressively roll out the card through Singer Finance’s 19 regional branches and among Singer Sri Lanka’s immense customer base and our distribution network of 410 branches,” stated Singer Group Chief Executive Officer Asoka Pieris. 
As a pioneering non-banking financial institution, Singer Finance continuously improves in offering innovative financial products aligned with on-going development of the group’s strategy. Singer Finance firmly believes this product will help uplift the lifestyle of its customers. The new credit card will also serve to empower the masses as a means of conducting transactions.
“Singer Finance has recorded marked growth in recent years and has played a key role in the growth of the dynamic financial system in the country. It is a momentous occasion as Singer Finance is the first licensed financial company to be granted a licence from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to issue a credit card,” said Singer Finance Chief Executive Officer Shantha Wijeweera.
