As the maximum temperature had been exceeded by 2-3 Celsius points in most parts of the island, the Meteorological Department has issued a notice requesting the public to refrain from exerting themselves in broad daylight.

With the heat rising with exertion of the body, the present climatic condition does not provide the opportunity to reduce such body heat. “Therefore, it is advisable to refrain from exerting in broad daylight,” it said.

The Department says that the absence of inter-monsoon rains and the change of wind patterns had affected the environment to experience immense heat these days. (Diana Udayangani)
