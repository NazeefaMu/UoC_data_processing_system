Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is reported to have told President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that political hostility would be detrimental to achieve the Yahapalana (good governance) objectives of the government.

A meeting had taken place at a location in Colombo at a special request by the Speaker. The Speaker had explained to both the leaders that excessive political hostility displayed in the election platforms could become a hindrance to achieve Yahalapana objectives.

“Hon. President, Hon.Prime Minister, I am making a request. There is no politics here. As the Speaker, I am independent. I see that the orators from both the parties relentlessly expressing their views in political platforms. We have a plan of work to be achieved. We have to fulfil the objectives of late Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera. The economy has become unstable due to certain political speeches. There is fear in the minds of investors. The Stock Exchange can collapse. Investors think the country will turn unstable after the election. The international community, that got close to us recently, is facing a problem over this. Such problems will not be good for the country. I am humbly making a request for both of you to limit your hostility in the political stage. It is the need of the moment,” the Speaker said.

Political sources said that both the leaders cordially agreed with the request by the Speaker. (Ranjan Kasthuri)
