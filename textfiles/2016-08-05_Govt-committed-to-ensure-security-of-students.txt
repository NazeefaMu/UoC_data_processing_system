President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday that the government was fully committed to ensuring the security of the students of Jaffna university.

He said so when the Vice Chancellor, lecturers and a group of parents of students of Jaffna university met him last afternoon at the presidential secretariat.

A lengthy discussion on the recent clashes at Jaffna University and the security of the students was held, and the steps that had to be taken were discussed.

Vice chancellor, Wasanmthi Arasarathnam said that all precautionary steps had been taken to avoid a repetition within the university.

President Sirisena said that the government took full responsibility for the security of the students and that the police and security sections had been instructed to act with restraint in incidents of this nature.

Danujana, the secretary of the students' association of Jaffna University said that the discussions were very fruitful and that all parties had agreed to resume the sessions without any delay. He also said that politicising this incident was never encouraged by them and it was their wish that all students continue their studies in a brotherly fashion as in the past.

Sisidaran, the president of the students' association said that he appreciated very much the opportunity given by the president to meet him and discuss this matter. He said a minor incident had been blown up to create disunity among the students. The students' association would continue to encourage the friendly relationship that existed among the students and never leave room for any repetition of such incidents, he said. He appealed to all the students to return to the University and resume their studies early.
