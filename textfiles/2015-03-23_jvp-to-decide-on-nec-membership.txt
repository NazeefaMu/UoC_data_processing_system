The leader of the JVP Anura Kumara Dissanayake today said that they would make a decision whether to remain in the National Executive Committee (NEC) consequent to the formation of the National Government.
Addressing a news conference at the JVP Headquarters, Dissanayake said the number of Cabinet Ministers was more than the promise given during the Presidential Poll and that a decision was to be taken whether they could remain in the Executive Committee at this level.
He said that he was going to question the way Nimal Siripala de Silva acted as the Opposition leader when several SLFP members had joined the National Government. (Yohan Perera and Sanath Desmond)
