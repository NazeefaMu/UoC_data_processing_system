The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has said it will investigate an incident where a private company had using a helicopter air-dropped packets of tea in Pannipitiya yesterday resulting in the frightened residents complaining to the CAA.

“The company was only permitted to distribute leaflets and not any objects by the air. They had clearly committed an offence. There was the possibility people being hurt,” CAA Director General and CEO H.M.C. Nimalsiri said.

Meanwhile, the National Movement for Consumer Right’s Protection (NMCRP) yesterday complained to the CAA in writing with regard to this incident where a company had carried out a sales promotion campaign risking the lives of people.

NMCRP Chairman Ranjith Vithanage said the company had airdropped its products using a helicopter in Pannipitiya though the CAA had only permitted this company to distribute leaflets. It is illegal to distribute food items in such a manner. It can cause harm to the people and the environment. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Kalathma Jayawardhane)
