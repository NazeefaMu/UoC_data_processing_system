Ample time for Constitution: PM
	
There was ample time for the preparation of a draft for the new Constitution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
The Prime Minister made this remark at a function held in Hatton to distribute land title deeds for the plantation community last morning.
"Some are talking about a draft of the new Constitution. No draft for the new Constitution has been prepared as at today. There is ample time to prepare the draft of the Constitution," the Prime Minister said.
He said suitable sections of the interim report submitted by the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly will be selected and included in the draft of the new Constitution.
"The interim report has no legal validity. Unfortunately, the media is also harping about it saying the Government is going to divide the country," he said.
"All parties have agreed on the Aekiya Raajya (Unitary State). The UNP, the SLFP and even the TNA have welcomed a Unitary State. Sri Lankan people had come together to secure an undivided country, while some in Spain and in Iraq are striving for a division. They have even got into conflict. Sri Lankan people had however given a mandate for reconciliation," the Prime Minister said.
He said people elected Maithripala Sirisena in 2015 to bring reconciliation in the country and added that the UNP and the SLFP formed a Unity Government for the same purpose.
"We, therefore, will have to bring in reconciliation through the new Constitution," he added.
Referring to the plantation community he said some of them got citizenship under the Sirima-Shasthri Pact, while others got it later together with the franchise.
"You were a community with citizenship of this country and for a franchise. However, you did not have ownership of land. Now, you will get ownership of land from today," he said.
Minister of Lands Gayantha Karunathilaka said the intention of the Government was to make the estate community a dynamic group of people.
"The Government does not want to see the future generations of the estate community becoming labourers like their ancestors," the Minister said. (Yohan Perera and Sudath H. M. Hewa)

GMOA skeptical on Govts stand on SAITM
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today remained skeptical about the latest stand taken by the government regarding South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) also known as the Malabe private medical college.
The government announced that it had decided to abolish the SAITM and convert it into a not for profit institution coming under the University Grants Commission (UGC).
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told Daily Mirror his association welcomed the decision to abolish the SAITM . However, he added that the GMOA need further clarification on the proposed step to make it a not for profit institute.
The governments decision to abolish the SAITM can be regarded as a positive step in the battle against SAITM by various parties and individuals. It is clear that the government has accepted our stance on the SAITM with this decision, he said.
He said that it was doubtful what kind of authority would govern the SAITM with this new announcement. He added that it was also questionable as to what extent the required standards in medical education would be met. He said there was no clarity as to how clinical training would be provided to students through the institution that had been proposed.
He said that a reasonable solution should be found to facilitate the students who studied at the SAITM and those who passed out from it. 'We need further a space for discussion in regard to the next steps that need to be taken," he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Not fooled by 'misleading' decision on SAITM: IUSF
	
The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) today said that the decision taken by the government regarding the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) was a mere eyewash and they would not fall for it.
IUSF Acting Convenor Mangala Maddumage told Daily Mirror that they were completely against the decision to abolish the SAITM and convert it into a not for profit institute coming under the University Grants Commission (UGC).
Our demand was to abolish the SAITM. Privatization of free education should be stopped immediately as well. Even though what was announced by the government was that it would abolish the SAITM, it also mentioned that its management would be changed. Therefore, it is evident that only the management of the SAITM would change, he added.
He said that this could be considered another attempt by the government cheat the public over the SAITM issue and added that they would take stern action and would continue their struggle against the SAITM and the privatization of free education.
He also said the government's only goal at the moment was to continue to market free education in the country through this decision. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

SAITM abolished
	
The Government today announced that the controversial medical faculty of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) would be abolished and the assets, liabilities, staff and the students of the medical college would be entrusted to a new non-governmental and not for profit degree awarding institution.
The Government Information Department in a statement said that the new degree awarding institution would be established according to the minimum standards for medical education and training that were yet to be promulgated.
The suspension of enrollment of students to the SAITM medical faculty by a letter issued by the Secretary to the Ministry of Higher Education on September 15 would continue until the new institution was established, the statement said.
It stated that the current shareholders of the SAITM should not be involved in the ownership or management of the new management of the new institution and Dr. Neville Fernando and his family, who currently own and manage the SAITM, were expected to cooperate in this regard.
In case the income exceeds the expenditure of the proposed new institution, the excess income would be spent on development of the institution and research activities or for awarding scholarships without sharing it among the shareholders, Government Information department said.
The statement said that the students from low-income families, who wished join the new institution would be assisted by the Government by way of concessionary loans through financial institutions to cover their class fees.
Negotiations are underway between the Government and several non-governmental and not for profit parties on the new non for profit institution, it added.
The Government also said that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should resolve the problems faced by SAITM students, who have already completed the degree course of the SAITM medical college, based on the ruling of the Supreme Court on the case currently pending in the court.

SL cricket team arrives in Lahore amid tight security
	
The Sri Lankan cricket team arrived at Lahore's Allama Iqbal International Airport in the early hours of Sunday to play the the final Twenty20 international match at a heavily-guarded Gaddafi Stadium.
According to Pakistan DawnNews the team received a warm welcome in the city and was escorted to the hotel amid tight security.
Sri Lankan Captain Thishara Perera expressed joy upon his arrival in Pakistan and said that his team would try and give their best on the field today.
Pakistan Skipper Sarfraz Ahmad, in a video message, thanked the Sri Lankan team for returning to Pakistan and told fans to expect great cricketing spirit from both sides in tonight's showdown, DawnNews said.
Several Sri Lanka players still opted out of playing in Pakistan. Regular captain Upul Tharanga, Lasith Malinga, Niroshan Dickwella, Suranga Lakmal and Akila Dananjaya all pulled out.
Cricket-starved fans have bought tickets in large numbers to witness Sunday's match despite the series already being won by Pakistan.
What's important to me is that we are hosting an international match and show the world that it's safe to play in Pakistan, said Ghulam Abbas, a college student. I think after the West Indies tour, the doors of international cricket will be wide open in Pakistan.
Security plans for the third T20 match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been finalised, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Lahore Haider Ashraf told DawnNews on Saturday.
"The security officials are trying their best to ensure that the match is played in a secure environment," he said. "All institutions, as well as the Sri Lankan squad, are satisfied with the security arrangements."
The traffic plan has been laid out ahead of the match and four points have been marked for parking for spectators, which include Punjab University hostel and Liberty LDA Parking Plaza. More than two thousand traffic wardens have been appointed for duty.
Vehicles will not be allowed to pass from Ferozepur Road to Liberty Chowk. The route from Muslim Town Mor to Kalma Chowk will also be closed for traffic. M.M. Alam Road, however, will be open for all kinds of traffic.
Several thousand security officials have been deployed on duty with armed military personnel around the stadium and on the route of team busses to the stadium.
Hundreds of security cameras have also been installed to keep a close watch on the movement of spectators.
A "dispersal plan" has also been laid out, CTO Lahore Rai Ejaz said. Once the match is over, fans will leave Gaddafi Stadium through shuttle services.
"This is not just a cricket match, it is a matter of Pakistan's honour," the DIG maintained.
He advised the residents of Lahore to avoid visiting Liberty Market unless they have "some important business or wish to watch the match".
"We have tried our best to ensure that residents do not face problems regarding traffic this time," Ejaz claimed.
