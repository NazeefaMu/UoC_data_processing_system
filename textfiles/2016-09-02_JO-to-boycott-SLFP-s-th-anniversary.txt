JO to boycott SLFP’s 65th anniversary


	

The joint opposition said today it had unanimously decided to boycott the 65th anniversary celebrations of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) to be held in Kurunegala on September 04.

JO MP Dullas Alahapperuma said their decision was based on three main reasons including the SLFP’s servitude to the United National Party (UNP).

“Our boycott is also to oppose some of the SLFP politicians who are making false allegations against former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.  Through our boycott we are attempting to take the SLFP on to the correct path,” he said.

Meanwhile, the JO celebrated the SLFP’s 65th anniversary today by cutting a cake at the ‘Nelum Pedessa’ office in Battaramulla in the presence of Mr. Alahapperuma, MPs Bandula Gunawardana, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Prasanna Ranatunga. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
