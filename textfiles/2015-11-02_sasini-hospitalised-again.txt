HNDA student Sasini Sandeepani who was beaten by a policeman during a protest at Ward Place had been admitted to the National Hospital again on Sunday afternoon because of constant head pains.
She underwent a CT scanning on Sunday night and the doctors had assured the scan was normal. “But, the doctors are keeping me overnight since I’m experiencing heavy head pains. They will discharge me after the observations of Judicial Medical Officer, Colombo on Tuesday,” Sandeepani told the Daily Mirror.
Sandeepani, who was undergoing treatment at the National Hospital following the attack, was earlier discharged on Friday by doctors and she complained that they had discharged her despite her constant head pains. (Piyumi Fonseka)
