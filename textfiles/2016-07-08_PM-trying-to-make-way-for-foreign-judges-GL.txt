PM trying to make way for foreign judges: GL


	

In the wake of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe calling for the Speaker to overrule a Supreme Court ruling, former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris said it looked like an attempt to make way for the appointment of foreign judges to try war crimes against the armed forces.

In the Singarasa case the SC held that the judicial power of the Republic could only be exercised by courts and tribunals set up under the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

Referring to this direction, Mr. Peiris said this power could not be alienated to others.

"That is contrary to both the law and the spirit of the Constitution. It is preposterous to use Parliament and the powers of the Speaker to overturn a judgment. That is a binding judicial ruling," he said. "This is sinister in view of the current controversy with regard to the appointment of foreign judges to try war crimes against armed forces."

Referring to the Paragraph nine of the report on Sri Lanka by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Peiris said it advocated the involvement of international judicial personnel.

"This looks like entirely import attempt to pave the way to do something which is contrary to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, which is prohibited by the Supreme Court," he said. (Kelum Bandara)
