Assault on bus driver; Media presented only one-sided story: Kasun


	

Southern Provincial Councillor M.K. Kasun, who is under remand custody over the alleged assault on a bus driver, making a special speech at the Southern Council meeting on Tuesday said that the media had presented only one side of the story that had misleadingly portrayed him as an underworld figure.

After arriving at Tuesday’s council meeting with Prison security officers, he said the people ought to question whether a firearm had been given to him by the Council for his protection, or to be locked up in a safe.

The Councillor, who appeared very emotional while speaking, said he was glad that a number of his fellow Councillors had agreed with his views.
Councillor Kasun said of the incident:

“I was returning from Malabe to Colombo that day. The car park at Odel is located on the ground floor. My vehicle was heading towards the ground floor when I heard someone honking his horn. I noticed it was from the vehicle behind mine, and so I went forward and stopped the vehicle.”

“The driver of a bus which had just alighted approached me from the right. The conductor approached from the left, where my wife was seated. He asked me why I had driven forward and assaulted me. I was injured, later requiring four stitches on my lip. I could not do anything to defend myself, so I got out of my car and struck the driver.”

“Then, onlookers joined in and assaulted me with helmets and other items they could pick up from the site.”

Kasun said his wife could no longer witness the assault on her husband without intervening and took the gun given to him by the Provincial Council from the glove compartment of his car.

The Councillor stated: “This [weapon] was given to me [by the Council]. Instead of showing the entire incident, video footage only shows her carrying the weapon. We were remanded on charges of assault on the driver and for using a firearm. It’s important to question whether this weapon was given to keep locked in a safe, or for an emergency like this, which had arisen where my life was threatened?”

The Councillor claimed the bus which runs on route 177 between Kollupitiya and Kaduwela belongs to an underworld gang leader.

“My father was killed fifteen years ago within the Colombo High-Security Zone. My wife who was present during my incident took maximum steps to defend. Due to this, she is now suffering in remand. I’m asking for justice and call upon all to reveal the truth.”
At this point, Council Member Nalin Hewage (JVP) spoke.

Nalin Hewage (JVP): “Mr Chairman, five of us have not obtained firearms. Prior to this incident, we were unaware that firearms had been given to all the other members. Therefore, we request a list of the members, who have been provided with firearms as we five are the only unarmed, while the other fifty are armed.

“Why do peoples’ representatives require firearms? If there is an issue about security, get a security officer. Take back these firearms and set up a security system instead.”

The Chairman: “Firearms have been given by the Ministry of Defence only to Councillors on request and not to all individuals.

Nalin Hewage: “Why is there a need for firearms for certain council members? We [JVP members] too travel by buses.

Sampath Athukorale (UPFA): “The need for firearms exists in light of incidents from history because of certain people.”

Ashoka Danawansa (UNP): I have not obtained a firearm.

Discussion intensified as Hewage continued to state people’s representatives need not be armed and members of the Joint Opposition attempted to prevent him speaking further.

The Chairman postponed the session for fifteen minutes as he could no longer control the session. (D.G. Sugathapala and Sumathipala Diyagahage)
