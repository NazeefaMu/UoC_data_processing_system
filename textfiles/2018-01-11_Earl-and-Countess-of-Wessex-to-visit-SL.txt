Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex and the Countess of Wessex would visit Sri Lanka from January 31 to February 4 and represent Queen Elizabeth II at the 70th anniversary celebration of Sri Lanka’s independence, the British High Commission said today.

It said the Earl and Countess will travel to Colombo and other parts of Sri Lanka, celebrating the long-standing friendship between the two countries and shared interest in the Commonwealth, youth development and education.

“Their Royal Highnesses will meet participants in The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award and young Sri Lankans selected as Queen’s Young Leaders, an initiative to recognise and celebrate exceptional young people across the Commonwealth.  The Earl and Countess will also meet representatives of a number of projects advancing causes they support through their work, including  MENCAFEP, whose work to help differently-abled children and their families in Nuwara Eliya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa illustrates the close links between the people of Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom,” the High Commission said in a statement.

“As the United Kingdom looks forward to hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in April 2018, Their Royal Highnesses’ visit will highlight our countries’ shared ambition to ensure the Commonwealth is well-placed to help deliver a bright future for its Members’ citizens.

His Royal Highness The Prince Edward is the youngest child of Her Majesty The Queen and His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh.  The Earl and Countess support Her Majesty in her official duties and undertake many public engagements each year in support of a wide range of charities and non-governmental organisations,” it said.
