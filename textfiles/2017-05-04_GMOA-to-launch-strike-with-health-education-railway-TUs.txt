Several trade unions attached to the health, education and railway services are to go ahead with the planned 24-hour countrywide strike tomorrow over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) issue, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told a media briefing that about 160 trade unions would join hands with them to protest against the SAITM an added that some 30 trade unions of them would protest tomorrow.

“All state medical officers including ayurvedic doctors, dental and veterinary surgeons will be refraining from engaging in services from 8.00 am tomorrow to 8.00 am on Saturday. The workers attached to other trade unions will hold demonstrations and protests around the country,” he said.

He said that the GMOA was urging the government to immediately nationalize the SAITM and the government should refrain from entering into trade agreements with foreign countries such as the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) which may deprive Sri Lankans of job opportunities.

Railway Guards’ Association Secretary P.M.P. Peiris said the railway guards and drivers would also refrain from engaging in their services tomorrow against the SAITM and to oppose on the government’s proposal which could lead to a removal of the pension scheme.
