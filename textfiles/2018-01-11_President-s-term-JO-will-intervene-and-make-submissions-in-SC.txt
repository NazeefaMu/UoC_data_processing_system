The Joint Opposition will intervene and make submissions when the reference made by President Maithripala Sirisena to the Supreme Court regarding his term limit is taken up for consideration today before a five-judge bench.

President’s Counsel Manohara de Silva will make submissions on behalf of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris.

The reference by the President says: “Whether in terms of Provisions of the Constitution, I, as the person elected and succeeding to the office of President and having assumed such office in terms of Article 32(1) of the Constitution on January 9, 2015, have any impediment to continue in the office of President for a period of six years from January 9, 2015, the date on which the result of my election to the office of President was declared.”

Commenting on it, Prof. Peiris said the President clearly told the country that he agreed to reduce his term when the 19th Amendment was introduced.

“He said his wish was to reduce it to four years, not five years. He said his colleagues insisted that it should be five years. Reluctantly, he agreed to five years.

Also, the former Minister said the President gave a solemn pledge in front of the coffin of Ven. Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera to abolish the executive presidency. (Kelum Bandara)
