Making a very emotional speech, the Inspector General of Police Pujitha Jayasundara called on all policemen to try and win the hearts of the people at all costs, though they were being severely criticised by the latter.

Almost with tears in his eyes, the Police Chief said, "Nowadays, the police are badly needed. There is an increase in the criticism of the police and that means there is a need for the police."

He made these emotional remarks at a book launch held at the Police Department on Tuesday. The IGP also requested policemen not to lose their temper or take revenge from people.

“There is no war and extremism in the country now. People like to have freedom. They like to walk anywhere in the country and come back home without any harm. The people are requesting that type of freedom. That request has to be fulfilled for them by the Police Department, not by the grama niladhari, school teachers or doctors,” he said.

“The people of the country are still with us and we are trying to win those people's hearts. This is the message we are trying to spread in the country,” he said.
