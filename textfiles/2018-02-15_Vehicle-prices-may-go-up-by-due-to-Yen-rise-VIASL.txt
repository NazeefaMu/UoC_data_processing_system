The prices of imported vehicles were likely to increase by 10 percent because of the increase in the exchange rate of Japanese Yen, Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said yesterday.

VIASL Chairman Ranjan Peiris said the selling rate of a Japanese Yen was Rs.1.47.

“Therefore, a vehicle worth Rs.5 million will be increased by Rs. 500,000. This will only affect future vehicle imports,” he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
