Kithuruwan, Ramith in trouble after night brawl


	

The careers of promising cricketers Kithuruwan Vithanage and Ramith Rambukwella are in jeopardy with Sri Lanka Cricket pursuing disciplinary action against the duo over a breach of discipline.

Both are most likely to be withdrawn from the forthcoming Sri Lanka ‘A’ tour of England as Sri Lanka Cricket is serious about upholding discipline.

Former Test cricketer Vithanage known for his off-field frolics rather than on-field heroics was named in the Sri Lanka A limited over side while Rambukwella – the former Sri Lanka T20 player – was named for both limited over and 4-day series against English Lions.

However both Vithanage and Rambukwella face disciplinary hearing after a late night brawl at a leading hotel in Battaramulla recently.

“We are taking this issue very seriously. We will most likely withdraw them from the tour,” a top SLC official said on the condition of anonymity. “The disciplinary committee is currently pursuing the matter.”

After the alleged incident, Vithanage was rushed to a private hospital with injuries and missed few days of training ahead of the tour.

Vithanage had earlier been warned for a breach of discipline during a Test match in Galle while Rambukwella-- the son of former media minister Keheliya Rambukwella – was cautioned earlier for a disciplinary issue during an U-19 tournament in Colombo.

Vithanage – a left-handed batsman – has featured in 10 Tests and six ODIs for Sri Lanka in his short international career. Sri Lanka ‘A’ team led by Ashan Priyanjan will leave Sri Lanka on June 22 for the tour. (Champika Fernando)
