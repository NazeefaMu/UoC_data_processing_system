I have a suspicion about Gotabaya -- Hirunika


	

Government MP Hirunika Premachandra alleged todaythat former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa gave all forms of protection to the person convicted of the murder of her father Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra after the crime, and, therefore, she had her doubts about the incident .

“I cannot pinpoint anyone without evidence. Yet I have doubts because the killer received protection after the crime,” she said.

She was speaking to the media after the fifth year death commemoration of her father. She said former MP Duminda Silva, who was convicted of Premachandra's murder, had no deep-seated issues with her father to kill him.

She said her father’s stance on several illegal activities taking place in the Kolonnawa electorate had created differences between him and Mr. Silva. Her father had complained against the activities of the former parliamentarian which had led to a feud between the two.

“Government ministers paid their last respects to my father. Yet Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not attend the funeral. Instead, he visited Duminda Silva at Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital. Later arraignment were made to send him for treatment to Singapore,” she said.

She said the CID had initiated a fresh investigation and it was better to clear all doubts .
