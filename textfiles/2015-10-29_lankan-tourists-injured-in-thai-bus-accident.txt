Twenty-two people, mainly Sri Lankan tourists, were injured when their tour bus overturned into a ditch in Ratchaburi’s Photharam district in Thailand Thursday afternoon, Bangkok Post said.
The bus was returning from the Damnoen Saduak floating market when the driver lost control while overtaking another vehicle, careering into the ditch along Phetkasem Road in tambon Nong Pho, said Pol Lt Pradit Khongprem, a duty officer at Photharam police station, who was alerted around 2pm on Thursday.
Police and rescue workers found many tourists trapped in the overturned coach but all were rescued. The injured passengers, mostly Sri Lanka tourists, and injured Thai driver were rushed to Photharam Hospital, said police. There were 34 people on board.
Vorachot Kraisri, the driver of another tour bus, told police there were four coaches taking over 100 Sri Lankans to the floating market in Damnoen Saduak district. The buses were heading to Nakhon Pathom when the one driven by Boonma Nachaikham crashed.
Mr. Boonma, 38, tried to overtake a 10-wheeled truck and veered off the road, said Mr. Vorachot, whose bus was following immediately behind. Mr. Vorachot stopped to assist victims and alert police. Investigators planned to question Mr. Boonma.
Ratchaburi governor Surapol Sawaengsak rushed to the scene and ordered officials to take good care of the injured tourists. He arranged vans to take the unhurt tourists to their destination.
