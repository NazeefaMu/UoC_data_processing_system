Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga has been ruled out of the ninth edition of the IPL after the Mumbai Indians' medical team deemed him unfit for at least another four months.

The 32-year old had joined the squad on Friday to assess the condition of the knee injury, which kept him out of World T20.

Mumbai Indians are yet to make an official statement about the pacer’s availability, but a report on ESPNcricinfo said that the pacer will be out for another four months.

Mumbai Indians coach Ricky Ponting had confirmed, two days before the start of the IPL, that Malinga is likely to miss the first half of the tournament with the injury the pacer had sustained at the start of the Asia Cup.
