Buddhists must apologise to Muslims - Kiriella
	
House Leader Lakshman Kiriella today said that a resolution should be brought in parliament and Buddhists should apologise to the Muslims in connection with the violence in Digana and Teldeniya.
He told parliament that the state intelligence services had collapsed resulting in the violence in Digana and Teldeniya.
"This situation was created by some outsiders. Police were aware about the people who came there from other areas. Even we got to know about them. But the police higher-ups were kept in the dark about the impending violence," the minister said.
He said Buddhist and Muslim Religious leaders in the area had agreed to settle the matter amicably while businessmen of both communities had agreed to pay compensation to the victimised families but some people who had arrived from other areas had provoked the people and this led to a communal clash.
He said compensation would be paid to those affected and for damaged property. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Calls for Jared Kushner  to be fired
	

US, (Daily Mail), 5March 2018 - 
A high-ranking Democrat Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, spoke out on Sunday about the mounting allegations about Kushners family financial dealings in the Middle East, and implications that he used US foreign policy as a tool of personal retaliation.

The allegations date back to April of 2017, when Kushners father Charles met with Qatari Finance Minister Ali Sharif Al Emadi, according to the Intercept. At the meeting Charles sought a cash infusion from Qatars sovereign wealth fund for the Kushner familys 666 Fifth Avenue property in Manhattan but was rebuffed. 
The Fifth Avenue property is reportedly facing a $1.4billion in debt due in 2019. 
In May 2017, Kushner accompanied Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia in his first foreign trip as president. 
On the trip, the White House strongly backed Saudi Arabia in a blockade against regional rival Qatar,and sealing a $350billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. For many of us that follow the Middle East closely, we could not understand why the Trump administration was so firmly taking the Saudis side in this dispute between the Saudis, the Emiratis and the Qataris, because the United States has very important interests in Qatar, Murphy said on Sunday. 
The US maintains a key airbase in Qatar with over 11,000 personnel. If the reason that this administration put US troops at risk in Qatar was to protect the Kushners financial interests, then thats all the evidence you need to make some big changes in the White House, Murphy said. 
Special Counsel Robert Mueller has asked witnesses about Kushners attempts to secure financing for his familys real estate ventures, focusing specifically on his talks with people from Qatar and Turkey, as well as Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates, according to NBC News.

Children should stand like strong trees: Jayantha de Silva
	

Children should act with self-determination and unstinted courage and stand like strong trees without depending on others like creepers, said Jayantha de Silva, Western Provincial Councillor and founder of the Pragna Pradeepa concept. 
Addressing the divesting ceremony of Prefects of Borella Sri Dharmashrama Sri Saddhatissa Dhamma School, he said life does not continue in one style or pattern but undergoes trials and tribulations, slings and arrows of outrageous fortunes and many a challenge and that one must have a strong personality formed with learning and discipline to take up arms against the challenges.
My dear children, I advise you to be strong trees and not creepers. When a creeper entangling a tree is cut off by the people, it is very seldom that they cut down a tree bearing fruits. The tree felled will be used for timber. If you are well educated and disciplined to lead yourself along the right path, you will be able to face challenges in the complex society and guard yourself against any external force that attempts to puncture your career. Dhamma School is the nurture ground of ones personality where one would be inculcated with discipline and wisdom to lead ones life along the right path to success and to cushion the impact of adverse external forces to a great extent. Nowadays, many a man who excels in his abilities and scholarly pursuits and stands as an exponent of education is not well cultured or disciplined. Such men often end up in failures and come to grief.

My dear children, I advise you to be strong trees and not creepers. When a creeper entangling a tree is cut off by the people, it is very seldom that they cut down a tree bearing fruits
A specialist doctor knew to charge much higher channeling fees when compared to other doctors. But he is a casino-goer who wastes his substance in gambling. It is a clear indication that he is not disciplined and inculcated with the prerequisites of a decent lifestyle, although he has risen to the highest echelons of the society, to command recognition as a medical specialist and is fortunate to earn wealth and means. Therefore, candid opinion is that every child should continue Dhamma School education and I advise them to do so.
However, it is sad that many parents among us do not take an interest in sending their children to Dhamma Schools as in the case of providing private tuition. Children should be inculcated with a lifestyle cast in the mould of Dhamma and social values during their formative years or else the parents will be destined to end up in homes for the aged. The parents must send their children to the Dhamma School to lead them along the right path and to prevent them from being criminals who end up in prison, he said.

China to raise defence budget by 8.1% in 2018
	

China announced on Monday an 8.1 per cent defence budget increase for 2018. Beijing will spend 1.11 trillion yuan (US$175 billion) on its military, according to a budget report presented before the opening session of the annual National Peoples Congress.

China spent $151 billion on the Peoples Liberation Army last year, the second largest defence budget in the world but still four times less than the $603 billion US outlay, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank.
James Char, a military expert at Singapores Nanyang Technological University said ...We can expect that Chinas defence budget will continue to be subordinated to, and co-ordinated with, Chinas economic performance. It will likely not be over-militarised, he said.
The 8.1% increase is higher than last years announcement, when it upped military spending by 7% over the previous year. In straight dollar terms, US military spending far outweighs Chinas. The Pentagon has requested a budget of $686 billion in 2019, up $80 billion from 2017 according to a CNN report. Chinas budget announcement comes as President Xi Jinping, the commander in chief of the countrys armed forces, is seeking to expand his influence within the upper echelons of Chinas leadership with a change to the constitution to extend his term in office, possibly indefinitely and focuses on increasing both the sophistication and reach of the countrys military.
In his opening report to parliament, Mr Li said the army must be strong as stone in the face of profound changes in the national security environment. \

China warns Taiwan
	

BEIJING REUTERS March 5-China said on Monday that it would never tolerate any separatist schemes for self-ruled Taiwan and would safeguard Chinas territorial integrity with the aim of reunification with an island it considers its sacred territory. Premier Li Keqiang issued the warning in a speech at the opening of the annual session of Chinas parliament, his stern words coming amid mounting Chinese anger over a U.S. bill that seeks to raise official contacts between Washington and Taipei. 
On Friday, China said Taiwan would only get burnt if it sought to rely on foreigners, adding to the warnings from state media about the risk of war. 
The U.S. legislation, which only needs President Donald Trumps signature to become law, says it should be U.S. policy to allow officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan to meet their counterparts, permit high-level Taiwan officials to enter the United States under respectful conditions and meet U.S. officials. 
In his address to the assembly, Li said China would promote the peaceful growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait and advance Chinas peaceful reunification.

Duty-free car takes him for a ride
	

Most politicians seek a Diyawanna seat making a solemn vow to expend their time, money and energy for the wellbeing of the hoi-polloi and there is no actual need for them to get a duty-free vehicle every five years. And what these Diyawanna members do has now become an acceptable practice; they immediately sell their duty-free vehicle to some wealthy person for a hefty price with the promise to regularize the ownership transfer after five years given the five year-mandatory bar to selling the vehicle to a second party.

Following this practice, a certain politico of a main political party, now a purohita at state level had quietly sold his duty-free vehicle. However, when this unofficial owner of the vehicle called on the state purohita with necessary documents to get its ownership officially transferred to him, the latter had chased the man away after refusing to sign the papers. Now the poor man taken for a ride is reportedly consulting legal opinion in a desperate bid to legally hold on to the ownership of the vehicle, they say.

BEIRUT (REUTERS) March 5-Aid convoys reached a crossing point into Syrias eastern Ghouta on Monday, a witness said, bringing the first relief to the besieged enclave since one of the deadliest government assaults of the seven-year war began two weeks ago. 
A World Health Organization (WHO) official said government authorities had stripped most medical material from U.N. vehicles, preventing surgical kits, insulin, dialysis equipment and other supplies from reaching the enclave of 400,000 people. 
President Bashar al-Assad vowed on Sunday to continue a military push into the biggest remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus, saying the offensive did not contradict five-hour ceasefires arranged each day by his main ally Russia. 
A wider, full ceasefire backed by the U.N. Security Council has not come into effect during the campaign, which began with massive government air strikes two weeks ago and has continued in recent days with a ground assault.

German equality chief proposes changing national anthem
	

Germany, (Daily Mail), 4 March 2018 - A German equality official has proposed changing the countrys national anthem to make it more gender sensitive.
Equality commissioner Kristin Rose-Mhring has suggested removing a reference to the Fatherland from the lyrics of the German anthem while also dropping the word brotherly.
Under her proposals the word Vaterland, which appears in the first and last lines of the current anthem, would be replaced by Heimatland, meaning homeland. 
She suggested making the change on March 8, International Womens Day, according to the Bild am Sonntag. Rose-Mhring also proposed replacing another male-specific word, brotherly, with courageously. 
Why dont we make our national anthem gender sensitive, she said. It wouldnt hurt, would it
Austria and Canada have both removed gender-specific terms from their anthems in recent years, with Canada recently changing the words in all thy sons command to in all of us command.

GoSL-WVL ink MoU  to provide water  to Sarasalai North
	
From Left to Right: Ms. Selvarani Nicholas Pillai, Director of Planning, Eng. E. Jegatheesan, Regional Manager, NWSDB - Jaffna, Mr. Jeyald Antony Rasaratnam, Project Manager, CS-WASH, Mr. N. Vethanayahan, District Secretary, District Secretariat, Jaffna, Dr. Dhanan Senathirajah, National Director, World Vision Lanka (WVL), Mr. Clarence Sutharsan, Director-Corporate Partnerships, innovations and Public Engagement of WVL, Mr. Jeyald Rasaratnam, Project Manager CS-WASH.


The Jaffna District Secretariat, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) - Jaffna and World Vision Lanka (WVL) recently signed a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on a pipe-borne water provision project in Jaffna. 
The project will provide household level pipe-borne water to Sarasalai North  the Grama Niladhari (GN) division in Chavakachcheri, an area which has serious water-related concerns. The project will provide 88 households (nearly 350 individuals including 110 children) with water connections.
This endeavour is an extension of the already-existing initiative called the Civil Society-Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Project (CS WASH), which World Vision Lanka has been implementing since July 2014 in the Jaffna District. The project, which targets those who are facing difficulties to access these basic needs, is funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australia. The project so far has given access to safe drinking water and sanitation, and promoted hygiene practices among rural folks in the two DS divisions, namely Chavakachcheri and Chankanai.
The signatories to this MoU were N. Vethanayahan, District Secretary, District Secretariat Jaffna, Eng. E. Jegatheesan, Regional Manager, NWSDB - Jaffna and Dr. Dhanan Senathirajah, National Director, World Vision Lanka. The event was also attended by Selvarani Nicholas Pillai, Director of Planning, Jaffna District Secretariat, Clarence Sutharsan, Director-Corporate Partnerships, Innovations and Public Engagement of WVL and members of WVL management. Commenting on this programme, Mr. Vethanayahan said, World Vision is a good partner for us for development, rehabilitation and emergency response intervention. We are very happy about this partnership with World Vision and NWSDB  Jaffna.
Meanwhile, Dr. Senathirajah said, I am glad to note that this initiative is focused on an area which we term most vulnerable to water and sanitation needs. Sarasalai North GN is an area that has many water quality issues including salinity and contamination. Most of the people use common, unprotected wells. We are happy to be a part of a project that will bring pipe-borne water to their homes.
The total funding for this initiative is over Rs. 13 million, of which 75% will be from government agencies (District Secretariat  Jaffna and NWSDB - Jaffna) and the remainder from DFAT funding through World Vision Lanka. This signifies a joint implementation partnership between the Jaffna District Secretariat, the NWSDB - Jaffna and World Vision Lanka (WVL). WVL will play a facilitation and coordination role and work with the government agencies and WASH CBO to ensure fair beneficiary selection. It will also work directly with the Water Board on the execution of excavation and pipe-laying work and construction of champers. World Vision is a Christian, relief, development and advocacy organisation dedicated to working with children, families and communities to overcome poverty and injustice.

Inaction of law on time aggravated the situation: Champika
	
Inaction of Law and Order institutions had aggravated the recent clashes into chaos, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said today.
He said the chaos could have been prevented if the police or other relevant authorities had acted soon after the incidents were reported.
The Minister said law could have been enforced when the matter was being highlighted in the social media. However sufficient action were not taken to settle it, he said.
He said that an international mechanism was in place to defame war heroes and the Sinhalese to portray them as barbarians.
Further, he said that if anyone thinks that these incidents help to protect the Sinhalese ethnicity, it was a deception and it only can survive via unity.
Minister Ranawaka said anti-Muslim feeling were spreading in the world and no wonder the Sinhalese are also afraid of the increase of the Muslim population.
He said that an extremist Muslim group was creating an open threat not only to Sinhalese but also to Hindu, Christians and other religions all over the world.
Therefore, it is not strange that such a feeling occurred on the general Muslim community among the Sinhalese, he said.
He also said that during the LG election such extremist statements were seen circulating criticizing the Muslim women candidates, however the law was not enforced on such incidents.
He said the moderate Muslims secretly and privately condemn such statements but do not condemn publicly, therefore had encouraged extremism.
He added that law should be immediately enforced whenever extremism occurred in any ethnic group and it was the responsibility of all ethnic groups to commit towards defeating extremism. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

JO vows to move no-faith motion against PM
	
Joint opposition chief organizer and SLFP MO Dulles Alahapperuma said yesterday they would canvass for signatures from government and opposition MPs after the JO group meeting in Parliament at 10.00 a.m. today
We will do our best to hand over the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister this week. We may have to surmount various kinds of obstacles or various twists and turns in case it is passed in Parliament but we will go ahead no matter what until that happens,Mr. Alahapperuma said.
Meanwhile, State Minister Vasantha Senanayake said the discussions to remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from the UNP leadership was ongoing and in case continues to remain as party leader, a large number of backbenchers would support the no-confidence motion, which is to be moved in Parliament by the JO against Mr. Wickremesinghe.
I expect Mr. Wickremesinghe is matured enough to take stock of the situation and his predicament and take a prudent decision, he told Daily Mirror.
The state minister said their intention was not to move a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister but to replace him with and more suitable UNPer as the party leader.
However, he expressed confidence that the ongoing discussions within the UNP would be successful and Mr. Wickremesinghe would resign from the leadership willingly and on his own, he said.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said as far as he was aware the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was being moved based on the Central Bank bond scam and the failure to take legal action against those who were allegedly involved in various financial crimes, killings and other serious offences.
"It is quite clear that the Premier has neglected his responsibilities and pledges given to the people. Therefore, the JVP will take an appropriate decision on the no-confidence motion and it will be for the betterment of the country," he said.
UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the Central Committee of the SLFP would take a decision on the no-confidence motion if and when it was moved in Parliament.
We are not interested in the leadership dispute of the UNP as it is an internal matter. We also dont take decisions on comments made by various people about the premiership. The SLFP decision will be based on the merits of the move and how the removal of the Prime Minister will affect the country, the minister said.
He said the government was currently focused on apprehend and brought before the law all those who have been involved in various financial crimes under the previous regime and Yahapalana Government.
He added that one of the prime suspects of the Central Bank bond scam, former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran would be traced to where ever he was hiding and brought back to Sri Lanka to face the charges against him.
He cannot find a place to hide on the earth. Before long, our judiciary would move the Interpol to trace him and send him to Sri Lanka, Minister Amaraweera said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Though media reports said the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) obtained 44.65 per cent votes at the recent Local Government Election, it had actually received only 40 per cent votes, Jathika Hela Urumaya General Secretary and Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said media institutions had miscalculated the valid vote count as 11,069,417 but it should be corrected as 12,214,901 when it included the valid votes obtained by independent parties.
Minister Ranawaka said most of the media institutions had miscalculated the sum by taking into consideration only the valid votes received by the main parties including Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, United National Party (UNP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and Tamil National Alliance (TNA).
Therefore the Minister said the SLPP had obtained 40.66 per cent votes while the UNP had obtained 29.40 per cent.
He said both SLFP and UPFA had obtained a total of 12.38 per cent votes and JVP had obtained 5.8 per cent of the votes.
Therefore, he said though the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa speaks of forming a government he had only received 40 per cent votes but the UNP and SLFP unity government had obtained 42 percent votes at the LG elections.
He added that the parties that contested under the mark of Swan during the previous presidential election had received a total of 51 per cent votes at the recent LG election.
According to the results Minister Ranawaka said it was clear that the people had not moved away from the January 8, 2015 public mandate as such it is now essential to implement a national programme to unite the main two parties and take adequate actions to prevent clashes in other supporting parties.

On receiving complaints about the favoured treatment accorded to this particular inmate, high authorities had recently issued instructions that he be sent back to the cell set apart for him in the lodge.
However, the lucky inmate is reportedly continuing his stay in the hospital due to medical advice that he should be kept under a 24-hour observation of a physician.

Outside group has created violence: PM
	
The violence in Kandy was unleashed by a group people who had come from outside and not by the people in the area, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today.
"Buddhist and the Islamic clergy in Digana and Theldeniya were engaged in a dialogue to resolve the issue peacefully but a group of extremists who had come from outside were the culprits who were engaged in violence," he said speaking during an adjournment debate in the House on Monday's incidents in Kandy.
The Prime Minister said there had been some shortcomings in the maintenance of law and order during the incidents in Theldeniya and underscored the fact that action would be taken against the law enforcement officers who had failed to carry out their duty.
He told the House that arrangements would be made to provide compensation to those who were affected by the violence and that Cabinet had decided to impose a state of emergency and other laws for a period of seven days if needed.
The Prime Minister said he was making this statement to inform Parliament about the incidents that happened in Ampara and Digana during the past few days.
"A conflict had arisen after an argument over some foreign matter that had been found in the food bought by some persons who had come to have food at Cassim Hotel on D.S. Senanayake Street on February 26 night. Thereafter a riotous mob had damaged four Muslim shops and a Mosque. The moment this matter came to be known, police had taken necessary steps. But it had been reported to me that there had been certain lapses when enforcing the law. Therefore a separate inquiry is being carried out on this incident by the Batticaloa DIG on the instructions of the IGP.
Also, on February 22 a lorry driver who had come to the Karaliedda filling station in the Teldeniya police area around 2.00 a.m. had been assaulted by four Muslim youths who had come in a three wheeler. The assault victim had been admitted to the Kandy General Hospital and he died on March 3. The four suspects involved in this incident have been arrested and remanded.
"Secondly, an extremist group creating a riot on March 4 night had set fire to two shops, a Muslim shop and the adjoining shop in the Teldeniya police area. The police had taken immediate steps to bring the situation under control. The area had been secured through police mobile patrols, STF personnel and with additional police forces. Twenty four suspects involved in the incident were arrested immediately and remanded till March 19.
"In this situation, again an extremist group had created a riot on Monday and four shops and two mosques had been damaged. To prevent the situation from spreading a police curfew was declared in the Kandy administrative district till Tuesday morning while the police curfew is still continuing in Pallekele and Teldeniya police areas.
"Also a body of a 24-year-old person had been discovered inside a burnt shop in the Digana, Kengalle area. Investigations are being carried out in this regard and a team from the CID had also been sent there.
"The National Security Council met last evening. Necessary instructions were given to the police and the Service Chiefs to be ready to control any unrest and enforce the law against any acts of sabotage. I gave instructions by telephone throughout the night to peoples representatives, religious leaders, police and the Joint Chief of Staff.
"We as a government vehemently condemn all racist and violent acts. As a responsible government we cannot condone such unlawful and violent acts. All of us who have experienced a 30-year war know the value of peace, harmony and unity.
"It seems that certain sections that are greedy for power are planning various ploys and acts of sabotage and the disruption of normalcy. Their only trump card in arousing racism. Their only objective is to obtain power by creating violence in the country. It is clearly seen that false and misleading information creating hatred among communities is being spread using social media in an organized manner.
"A certain group has been spreading through social media over the last nine months that there is a threat to the Sinhalese from the Muslims. False statistics had been presented to that end. Some Muslim groups had responded to this. This group had spread racism through a long period of time. A tense situation had arisen due to this. The majority in this country are Sinhala Buddhists. As Sinhala Buddhists we will protect that heritage. There has been no damage to those rights or heritage. There is no threat. We will not allow such to happen.
"As Sri Lankans there are other races and religious communities living in this country. All races and religions have a right to engage in their cultural and religious activities. This is the Sri Lankan concept of D.S. Senanayake. We will protect it. Therefore we express our regrets over the damage caused to the Mosques.
"The government will not hesitate to take stern legal action against such organized acts of sabotage. I also wish to thank the Buddhist monks, Muslim Moulavis, area correspondents of the media and other persons who understood this situation and acted with restraint.
Also compensation would be paid to the deaths caused and property damaged in these unfortunate incidents. I would like to finally request from all citizens to act with restraint in a rational and intelligent manner without falling prey to traitors who try to fulfill their objectives through racism," the Prime Minister said.

Prez Sirisena should talk with Basil or Gota and reach an  agreement -Dr. Nalin de Silva
	
Im not a fan of Maithripala, he was used by the west and Indians against the Rajapaksas
	We asked GL, Dulles and Wimal to form a new party without contesting under the UPFA ticket for General Elections. But they didnt listen to us. They contested under the UPFA (betel leaf)
	The Joint Opposition now wants the SLFP MPs in the Government to withdraw. This is wrong as there are no SLFP MPs in parliament
	The Joint Opposition cant muster two-thirds for dissolution. They are only marking time till 2019/2020
	It isnt clear what this National Government is. The Prime Minister is also not clear about it


Dr. Nalin de Silva during an interview with the Daily mirror spoke about the current political situation in the country. Dr. de Silva has been a leading proponent of the Sinhala nationalist movement since the 1980s and been a critique of Western science and culture. Dr. de Silva has been noted for his strong push for the military defeat of the LTTE through his regular articles to the Sinhala and English newspapers through the 1990s till the ultimate ending of the war in 2009. In recent times and particularly after the defeat of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015,
Dr. de Silva in his almost daily writings on social media and the website kalaya.org has been one of the first to advocate the return of Mahinda Rajapaksa to national politics and the formation of a new party as early as April 2015. Most recently he was vocal that President Maitripala Sirisena and the Political camp led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should come together to remove Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Premiership. Excerpts of the interview follow:

Q :Why have you been advocating for a long time that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be brought back to politics
Soon after the defeat of Mahinda, I knew that he should be brought back. He is the most suitable person to lead the country during this period. We organized a conference to advocate that position. Unfortunately, nobody took us seriously at that time. At that time, the 19th Amendment wasnt there. We said that if Ranil Wickremesinghe was made the Prime Minister with 40 odd members, we should be able to bring back Mahinda. Even at that time, Mahinda had the majority in Parliament. He had the required majority. If they had moved a vote of no confidence, they could have won. 
Even at that time, the Rajapaksas had different ideas. I am fed up with this type of politics. Even at that time, the Rajapaksas did not want to remove Ranil. They were interested in removing President Maithripala Sirisena. The Rajapaksa rule, in the opinion of westerners and Indians, was against their views. They wanted a new constitution giving more powers to Tamil racist elements. They really wanted a confederation here. They wanted to remove Rajapaksa and bring Ranil. Maithripala was a puppet. People, including me, say that Maithripala should not have defected from the then Government. What made him to defect 
It was Basil Rajapaksa who was behind this. Most ministers were not in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa because of Basil Rajapaksa. If anybody is responsible for the defection, it is Basil. Ask Maithripala. People do not understand this. I wanted to bring back Mahinda. I knew that it was possible. Also in my opinion Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is not just a representative of the English, Anglican Christian culture. He is one of them. Even DOyly spoke Sinhala. 
Q :In the run up to the last General Elections too, you asked for the formation of a new party under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa. Why did you do it at that time
I knew at that time that Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was a dead party. So, I wanted them to form a new party. They did not listen to me at that time. In fact, I, along with a few others, went to meet Prof. G.L. Peiris at his residence. I met him, Dulles Alhapperuma, Wimal Weerawansa and a few others. We asked them to form a new party without contesting under the UPFA ticket. They did not listen to us. They contested under the UPFA (betel leaf) ticket. What happened If they had contested under a different party, Mahinda Rajapaksa could have even become the Prime Minister. If not, he could have become the Leader of the Opposition at least. Today, they cannot do anything. They are MPs as members of the UPFA. The Joint Opposition is not a recognized political party. They have 51 or more members. The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has only 16 members. Even then the Joint Opposition cant stake a claim for the post of Opposition Leader because they are UPFA MPs. Then, they are virtually members of the Government though they do not realize it. The speaker knows this. 
When the Prime Minister got the Secretary General of Parliament to read a resolution passed in September 2015, it said that the UNP, having obtained the majority of votes, had formed a National Government. The resolution said that Parliament could approve 48 Ministers and other numbers of non-Cabinet Ministers. 
The resolution said the UNP had formed the National Government as the party with the biggest majority. The problem is that the UNP is not represented in this Parliament. It is the United National Front (UNF) that is represented in Parliament. As far as Parliament and the Speaker are concerned, the UNP is not represented in Parliament. However, they continue to ignore that. 
Q :Yet, they all contested under the elephant symbol of the UNP. Then, how can you say that it is not recognized
The elephant is the symbol of the UNF. The symbol does not matter. It does not matter as long as the Elections Commission recognizes it. They contested as the UNF. Then, the UNP, even as a party, though not represented in the parliament, does not have a majority. It has only 82 members. If that is the case, the Prime Minister cannot say his party has the largest number of seats. This National Government has been illegal from the day it was formed. The opposition claims that there was an agreement between the UNP and the UPFA or SLFP. That is not clear. We do not still know whether the UNF (UNP) formed a so called National Government with the UPFA or the SLFP. The so called agreement is immaterial. The Constitution does not say there should be an agreement between the two or more parties concerned. Then, the argument of the Joint Opposition is also invalid. The Constitution only defines a National Government and states that such a National Government could have a cabinet consisting of more than 30 MPs with the approval of Parliament. The above mentioned resolution read by the Secretary of the Parliament received the approval of the Parliament to appoint a cabinet of 48 members. 
If it is a National Government comprising the UNP as the resolution says claiming that UNP has the most number of MPs then such a claim is wrong on many counts. The so called joint opposition does not speak about it as they also want to be recognized as a party. The UNP and SLFP may be recognized parties by the Elections Commission, but they are not represented in the Parliament. Whether they like it or not, the Joint Opposition is also part of this Government if the so called National Government is formed with the UPFA. If it is formed with the SLFP then there are other problems as the SLFP is not represented in the Parliament.
If the so called National Government has been formed by the UNF with the UPFA then there is some sense in asking the UPFA to withdraw from the Government, but in that case the joint opposition should realise that they are also withdrawing from the Government. More than that by asking the UPFA MPs to withdraw from the Government they are strengthening the hand of Wickremesinghe. Maithripala, if not impeached, will be a prisoner of Ranil. 
There was a talk by the joint opposition about a vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister over the Central Bank bond fraud. What has happened about it Nobody is talking about it. Instead of that, they now want to support Range Bandara if and when he moves a vote of no confidence. It is the Joint Opposition as a group of MPs that should take the leadership in bringing a motion of no confidence. They now want an election. 
How can you hold an election The President cannot dissolve Parliament until February, 2020. By that time, he would not be in presidency, most probably. There would be a different President at that time. I do not want to speculate on it. 
The only way to dissolve Parliament today is by bringing a resolution in Parliament to the effect that the House declares that it should be dissolved. For that, they need a two-thirds majority. The Joint Opposition talks about it without talking about the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister that can be passed with a simple majority. This is nothing, but humbug. The Joint Opposition cannot muster two-thirds for dissolution. 
Q :What do you think of the formation of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) since you have been advocating the formation of a new party 
The Party should have been formed before the 2015 General Elections. In February, it was able to get only 44.6 percent of votes with all these problems the country was facing. They claim it as a huge victory, though it is not. The Government is so unpopular. The cost of living is so high. There is the bond scam. With all that, the SLPP could not get more than 45 percent of votes. In the 2015 Presidential Elections Mahinda secured 48% of the vote. It has to be emphasized that I never advocated that the SLPP should form an alliance with Maithripala at the Local Government Elections. I am more concerned with the removal of Ranil as Prime Minister rather than capturing power of the local bodies. 
Having said that, one has to remember that President Sirisena got 13 percent. Of that, I would say three percent were from the UNP vote base. Some people who are disappointed with the UNP would have voted for him. The remaining ten percent is from the Sinhala nationalist camp. Some supporters of Mahinda/Basil want to believe that these votes are from Thondaman without realizing the latter contested separately. From Mahindas 45 percent, at least 40 are from the nationalist camp. The nationalists have at least 50 percent together. That is more than enough to form a Government on their own. Even if the joint opposition does not want to accept ministerial posts they can still be in the Government. As UPFA members they have no alternative. Why are they (Maithripala, Basil and Mahinda) ignoring the Sinhala nationalist camp Are they under foreign influence 
The Tamil parties are now in shambles. They did not get the necessary votes. There are problems. If the Sinhala people are united, the Tamil racist elements cannot do anything. They understand it more than the Sinhala people. In this game, Tamil racist elements have no say if 50 percent of the Sinhala nationalist votes remain intact. They realize it more than the Rajapaksas and Sirisena. 

How can you hold an election The President cannot dissolve Parliament until February, 2020. By that time, he would not be in presidency, most probably. There would be a different President at that time. I do not want to speculate on it
Q :In your view what should be done in the future under these circumstances
Get President Sirisena to talk with Basil Rajapaksa or Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and reach some agreement. They need to sign a document. That has to be done within the next few days. If they do not do it, that will be the end of the nationalist movement for some time. The Prime Minister will be powerful. Already, he is the Law and Order Minister, either for a temporary period or on a long term basis. Giving it to Minister Sarath Fonseka is equally harmful. They would destroy the Sinhala nationalist movement. Mr. Fonseka was the Army Commander. But, he is against the Rajapaksas. As a result, he is also against the nationalist movement. In a way he had betrayed the country on the white flag incident. 
Q :If that is the case who should take over as Prime Minister
I would go for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Different Rajapaksas have different mindsets. I am for Mahinda because he is the best person. If it is not Mahinda, somebody from the Joint Opposition should be appointed. If they are not ready for it, somebody from the Maithripala faction in the Government should be chosen. It could be anybody like Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara, Susil Premajayantha or S.B. Dissanayake. Definitely, it should not be Minister Duminda Dissanayake. 
Q :On the other hand there is an opinion that the stance taken by you is being racist and excludes the minorities. Your view
I am not a racist. I recognize that the Sinhala Buddhist culture should be given its due place. If that is racism all the western countries are racist. They have dominant Christian cultures in their countries. Please remember that I am not asking for a dominant place for the Sinhala Buddhiist culture. The Christian culture especially in its Anglican form is the dominant culture in the rest of the world as well. Our education is Christian. The Judiciary system, the Parliament and almost all the others are Christian. What is the place given for traditional (paramparika) medicine in Sri Lanka. There is not even a Vaidya Sabha even in the western format for traditional medicine. The list is long, and I have written on these during the past thirty five years or so. The English wanted to destroy the Sinhala Buddhist culture, but they failed. However, they have succeeded in weakening the Sinhala Buddhist culture. The English created Tamil racism and baptized it in 1833, which I have explained in An Analysis of Tamil Racism, in order to weaken if not destroy the Sinhala Buddhist culture. With Nandikadal, Tamil racism was defeated. A military solution is also a political solution. The Tamil racist problem created by the English has been solved. There is no need for further talks on this matter. Would Churchill have spoken to the Nazis after the so called second world war The Sinhala people are still fighting, albeit without the support of the politicians, to win back their lost rights. If you call it racism, then what do you call Christian hegemony throughout the world Please remember that it was the Sinhala people who protected the Muslims from the Portuguese Catholics, and settled them in the present Eastern Province, and protected the Catholics from the Dutch Reformists. 
Q :How do you see the present Constitution making process and where it is heading
If the present Prime Minister is allowed to get himself established by the Rajapaksas, he will get the new Constitution that would pave the way for a confederation hook or by crook. The Constitutional Assembly is a dangerous instrument that Ranil could make use of to establish the new constitution without presenting it to the Parliament citing the 1972 constitution as an example. He could even claim to be a follower of Bandaranaike policies by extending the Parliament for another five years. If that happens those who are preparing for 2019/2020 without removing Ranil Wickremesinghe from the Prime Minister post in 2018 will see the end of their politics.

Regional Cooperation, unity and stability key to the future PM
	
Regional Cooperation, unity and stability will be the way forward for Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister came up with this sentiment at the Meet the Prime Minister forum organized by the Organization for Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo last evening.
Sri Lanka is for regional cooperation however the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has not been successful in bringing regional cooperation but ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand are working towards bringing in cooperation among the nations of the Asian region and Sri Lanka should focus on it, the Prime Minister said.
India is looking for the possibility of having a land route from Thailand to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka should focus on that development as well. Actually Sri Lanka should look at how it could get connected to India. It should determine the alternatives. However it one must remember that there is a good sea route between the two countries at the moment, he said.
The Prime Minister said Sri Lanka should take full advantage of its human resources and its geographical resources. Indian Ocean is becoming an increasingly important region and there would be a market of two billion people from Asia to Spain which Sri Lanka could tap, he added.
Also he stressed reforms in the education system right from the schools to higher education institutions. Higher education institutions such as Harvard and Oxford are not state owned ones but they are not profit oriented and Sri Lanka will have to look at these and come up with an effective system of education. he said in this context.
At the same time, the Prime Minister said there have been shortcomings in the agriculture sector with the non availability of fertilizer and the fall of crops as a result of drought and floods. Sri Lankas economy would have grown by more than five percent if there was not drought and floods last year, the Prime Minister said.
He said the most important thing is stability and unity in the country as nothing could be achieved without these two elements. (Yohan Perera)

She is already on the go
	

A prospective mayor of a big city who had summoned the elected members of her party for a meeting at the official residence of a very high political authority the other day had taken the latter by surprise with an unusual imperious manner, they say.

It was obvious that the lady wanted to put all of us on notice, one candidate remarked while another complained that she had begun bossing them about even before assuming the duties of her office. 
Addressing the elected members, she had told them: Remember that you cant play about with me! I propose to give each member Rs.2 million for development work in your respective wards. You will have to do the work or get out!
Later the members had in hushed tones shared their wonderment at the change that had come over the onetime sweet soft-spoken lady, they say.

Stern action against personnel spreading violence, rumour-mongers: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena today assured stern action would be taken against anyone who spreads violence in the country and spreads rumours with the intention of provoking citizens.
Making a special statement over the inter-communal clashes reported in several places of the country, the President assured action against the elements which spread violence at a time when the government was taking measures to establish political stability, peace among communities and reconciliation in the country.
He also said stern action would be taken against those who breach peace and provoke citizens by spreading rumours and false news by various means, including social media platforms.
The President said necessary action has been taken after convening the National Security Council to discuss the prevailing situation.
A proper mechanism had been put in place to take further action after having discussions with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, everyone should act calm, maintaining law and order, he said.

Team appointed to monitor Army personnels social media platforms
	
In a bid to ensure army personnel were following regulations relating to the use of social media, the Army Commander appointed a team to monitor Army personnel on their social media platforms, the Army said.
They said the Army Commander appointed members from the Signal Corps for the team which will monitor social media platforms. Disciplinary action is to be taken against soldiers who have violated the guidelines set out by the military.
Army personnel had been previously given regulations to follow when using social media platforms over the years.
Regulations introduced over the years, state that information relating to national security, remarks and opinions about politicians and public officials, anything which could create racial or religious disharmony and commenting on such posts, revealing military ranks and identification information, photos in uniforms and military armaments in the background cannot be posted on media platforms. 
Since it was noted that some army personnel are not following the regulations, I decided to appoint the committee, Army Commander Lieutenant Mahesh Senanayake said.

Thambuttegama farmers Losing their calm  before the storm
	
People engaged in agriculture lament over proposed water supply project

TheDailymirror visited the farmer communities living in the left bank of the Rajanganaya reservoir. Several of them had had a meeting with the President to bring a solution for this matter. Speaking to theDailymirror, a few residents of the area along with farmers shared their thoughts. 

Given its fertile soil and greener pastures, the main occupation in the Anuradhapura District is farming. From paddy to banana, coconut and vegetables, these farmers generate income through fresh produce. However due to the recent drought conditions, these farmers couldnt get the best use of the Yala and Maha seasons. The Rajanganaya tank provides water to over 35,000 families and these farmers have so far worked during both seasons. The proposed water supply project is supposed to distribute water to three Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions including Thambuttegama, Galnewa and Thalawa. However, the farmers recently protested that this project will consume more water than estimated and it would affect farming. As a result of a protest staged on February 28, 60 farmers were arrested following a clash between the Policeand the protesters and 51 of them were released on bail yesterday.
In an attempt to shed light on this issue, theDailymirror recently visited Thambuttegama and spoke to some individuals including the Police and the farmers with the help of area resident Nilantha Ekanayake.

They attacked us first: Police B-report
According to the B-report submitted by the Police the people who protested ignored the court order produced by the Thambuttegama Magistrate. The protest was staged by farmers representing 64 farmer associations in the right and left banks of the Rajanganaya Dam. They began the protest on the Kala Oya Bridge and obstructed the main road. In order to limit any inconvenience caused to the public, the Police team diverted the traffic onto alternative routes. Therefore vehicles travelling from Anuradhapura to Kurunegala were diverted via Giribawa while vehicles moving from Kurunegala to Anuradhapura were diverted via Meegalawa. 
The report further states that the protesters then started moving towards the Police junction. When the Headquarter Inspector Priyantha and a team had gone to handover the court order to Rajanganaya Unified Farmers Association President Nihal Wanniarachchi, the protesters refused to accept it. They had said that in order to make an impact the protest had to be violent. They have further said that they will protest until someone in the Government sends a letter saying that the project has been stopped. In turn they surrounded us (the Police) and started attacking. From the attack, nine Police officers were injured while around 100 Police officers got involved to counter the attack. 
During this incident clauses 140, 146, 410, 314, 316, 315, 157, 332, 344 and 149 of the Penal Code had been violated. As a result 60 people were taken into custody and 15 were released on bail. 
This is a Government project implemented under proper procedures-Wanninayake
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Anuradhapura District Secretary R. M Wanninayake said that obtaining water from reservoirs for drinking purposes is not new to this area.
With the permission from the Department of Irrigation and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board, water is being extracted from reservoirs such as Thuruwila, Nuwara Wewa and Tissa Wewa. Therefore a similar proposal has been put forward in connection with the Rajanganaya reservoir as well.
People in areas such as Galnewa and Nochchiyagama dont have drinking water. Therefore this project was proposed to provide drinking water to these people. This isnt a private project or a bottled water project as mentioned in certain social media sites. This is a Government project which is being implemented under proper procedures. The construction part is being handled by a Chinese company. In Rajanganaya, close to 30,000 people are farmers. In addition to that other cultivations such as banana, coconut and various other vegetables too can be found. Hence it is the most fertile area in the Anuradhapura District. The main reason behind this protest is the fear that the farmers have that they would not have enough water to work with in their paddy fields if an equal amount of water is used for this project as well. But the NWSDB has affirmed that they will only extract the amount of water permitted by the Irrigation Department and this too will be in future.Wanninayake said. 
Wanninayake further said that only the initial stages of the project are currently being carried out. They are not extracting any water yet. The project will commence in 2021. In case of a drought the extraction of water will be controlled, so that farmers would not be affected. All these matters were discussed with the farmers, but they still havent understood the purpose behind the project. If these protesters staged a peaceful protest without inconveniencing the public, there wouldnt have been any issue, he continued. 
When asked if the project would commence, Wanninayake said that it had been suspended. The project hasnt commenced, so there was nothing to suspend anyway. The NWSDB also agreed to it and now we have requested from the authorities to re-inspect the amount of water to be extracted and educate the farmer communities in the lower banks about the project before commencing it. The reason for the low levels of water have no connection with any project, but they are due to the adverse drought conditions that have prevailed during the past few months. There are many ways in which water will be wasted such as when spill gates are opened. The NWSDB will go ahead with the project only with the approval of the irrigation department. This approval has already been given. We have to consider the problem of kidney disease and this is why we have implemented a project of this nature. In future, farmer communities will be informed once the project commences,said Wanninayake. 

Project at its tender evaluation stage
According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, the project proposal was passed through several authorities before receiving cabinet approval. Tenders were called at the time when Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Finance minister and loan agreements were signed in 2017. It has been estimated that in 2033 approximately 18,000 cubic metres of water would be utilised per day from Thambuttegama area by the population thats forecast. The project is expected to commence operations in 2021 and the water demand in Rajanganaya would be close to 44,000 cubic metres per day. Currently the project is in its tender evaluation stage.

It has been estimated that in 2033 approximately 18,000 cubic metres of water would be utilised per day from Thambuttegama area by the population thats forecast

The amount of water extracted for this project is negligible when compared to what is being utilised for farming practices.
There is no bottled water project as mentioned in certain media reports. This is a Government project aimed at providing a solution for the kidney disease problem inthe area.
People extract water from shallow wells and this project is expected to provide water to around 92,000 people.the source said. 
The source further said that 50% of the advance payments have been made on contract basis and the project is funded by the Chinese Development Bank. With this protest the project would be delayed and therefore we would have to pay more interest.
This is a huge loss to the country. Under this project it has also been proposed to minimize losses incurred due to distribution canals, the source added.

We need to protect this resource
-Amarasinghe
We dont have any issue with them over providing us with drinking water. The Rajanganaya area is quite fertile and the farmers work both during the Yala and Maha seasons. If such a project is commenced it would have a major impact on the farmers. There is a tank called Neelabamma. So why cant they take it there because that water anyway goes to the sea. Once the project is implemented the authorities would control the water in the tank and farmers would not have sufficient water to do their work. This is a resource which we need to protect, said Amarasinghe. 

Around 35,000 families depend on this tank
-Indika
Farmers in the right and left banks of the Rajanganaya tank utilise water from more than 86,000 acre-feet during both Yala and Maha seasons. Usually theres enough water in the Kala Oya, but with the recent drought conditions we dont have sufficient water for farming and other purposes. This time, water from 14,000 acre-feet have been utilised due to these conditions. On top of this if another drinking water project is started it will be a challenge to all farmers because they will give prominence to such a project. Around 35,000 families depend on this tank. Earlier a plan was drawn to obtain water from the Moragahakanda reservoir and sent it to Kala Wewa along Jaya Ganga to Kon Wewa and establish the purification system there. But the Rajanganaya tank is where water collects from Kala Wewa and provides water for the farmers to work during both seasons, said W. K Samitha Indika

Prez and PM should take immediate action
-Ranwala
People somehow find drinking water. Farming is important for us. To address the kidney problem filtered water is being distributed throughout the area. Every house has a filtering system and this problem is mainly in the Anuradhapura area. Certain Policemen were in civil and they kept attacking us. The project was initially proposed at Kon Wewa, but after they saw all the water at the Rajanganaya tank they shifted the project here. Therefore we urge the President and the Prime Minister to take immediate action. said Sanath Ranwala

They attacked me as well
-Pushpakumara
The Police attacked us first. They in fact attacked me as well. While we were in remand we didnt even get water to drink. Several others were treated quite inhumanely. The farmers sat on the road and were awaiting for an answer from the District secretary. This canal narrows as it proceeds further down and those people dont even have the water that we get. If this project becomes a reality they would suffer more than us. Only tea and rubber dont grow in these areas, but we have many plants which grow in the wet zone thanks to this tank, said Anuradha Pushpakumara.


We will continue to protest
-M. A Manjula
They want to draw water from the nearest source. We asked them to start this project from Neelabamma because water anyway flows to the sea. Since this project hasnt been implemented yet, we still have doubts. If no water fills the distribution canals, we would not have all the greenery that we see today. The prevailing drought is quite adverse at times and the only way of survival is this tank.We didnt want to get in to a fight at any point. Our main objective was to get down an official and find a solution to this problem. The Government didnt interfere at all. Since we didnt find a solution we went to the Thambuttegama junction. We asked them not to attack us. The media didnt show how we were attacked first. We will continue to protest until this project comes to a stop, said M. A Manjula President of the Saliyaraja Farmers Association.

The Govt. should treat farmers better
-Kaluarachchi
If this project is implemented farmers would lose water in close to 25,000 acre-feet. Therefore its turning out to be a bigger issue than we expected. As a result we staged this project and its unfair to commence such a project without educating the farmer communities. It is the farmers that provide rice to this country and the Government should be treating us better. said Wasantha Kaluarachchi

Tribute to Sdri Gnei Irfana Amit (Florine) Her untimely demise is a monumental loss
	
Saudari Florine was associated with WASLAM since our inauguration in 2010, first as vice-patron and then as Patron. She was a hands-on person who supported and encouraged us in all our projects. She walked the extra mile to garner donations and with her persuasive techniques never came back empty handed. She was the live wire of any event and kept the momentum going with her witty and active participation. She was a vibrant personality. When the music started she would take to the floor and her voice echoed in the sing a long. Her absence will be greatly felt by all of us.  Not only was Saudari Florine a prominent participant in all activities connected with the Malays but she was also of service to the community at large. Her untimely demise is a monumental loss to WASLAM and I am sure her absence will be felt by all the institutions she was closely connected with.
We extend our heartfelt condolence to her beloved husband, Laddie, to her children and to their families.
As Dr. Maya Angelou said Ive learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
Inna Lillaahi wa Inna Ilaihi Rajioon

Unrests due to inefficiency of Law and Order Minister : GL
	
Referring to the recent incidents in Digana, Ampara and Thambuttegama, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Head Prof. G.L. Peiris said today such incidents took place as there was no effective Minister for Law and Order portfolio.
Addressing a news conference, he said it was sad to say that President Maithripala Sirisena had been unable to appoint a Law and Order Minister, who would bear and accomplish responsibilities for the well-being of society.
Presidents ineffectiveness of being unable to appoint a proper Law and Order Minister clearly denotes the inefficiency of the Government that leads to spark off violent incidents, he said.
He said, it was the utmost responsibility of the President to appoint eligible Cabinet of Ministers who would be tasked with responsibilities, Prof. G.L. Peiris said.
Meanwhile, he said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was entirely responsible to the downfall of the economy that had negatively affected the sustainable growth of the country.
He added that the official visit of Premier Wickremesinghe to Singapore was a joke and of no use, because the investors were not willing to invest in Sri Lanka on account of the failure of the economy. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
