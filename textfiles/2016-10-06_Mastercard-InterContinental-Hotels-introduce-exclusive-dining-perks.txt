Mastercard announced a partnership with InterContinental Hotels & Resorts that seeks to cater to the needs of affluent cardholders in Asia Pacific by encouraging them to reconnect with their family.
As part of the Kids Dining Perks promotion, every child below the age of 12 can now enjoy complimentary dining with every paying adult when paying with a Platinum, World and World Elite Mastercard at 25 participating InterContinental Hotels & Resorts across Asia Pacific.
The new offer is part of Mastercard’s wider suite of exclusive premium products and services aimed at delivering superior value to cardholders, building on research that shows affluent consumers across Asia Pacific are not only increasing in numbers but are also travelling more.
InterContinental Hotels Group Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa Head of Luxury and Lifestyle Brand Marketing Bruce Ryde said, “This partnership with Mastercard is a great opportunity for InterContinental Hotels & Resorts to bring the art of fine dining as well as bespoke experiences for the affluent travellers and their young ones. We know that for our guests, luxury is a mindset and a way of experiencing life and we are glad guests will enjoy exclusive privileges and bespoke experiences.”
According to Mastercard Executive Vice President Global Products and Marketing Asia Pacific Julienne Loh, today’s landscape is seeing a shift in attitudes among affluent consumers who increasingly desire to spend more time with their loved ones.
“Growing time pressures are heightening affluent travellers’ desire for authentic and connected experiences. As a result, the definition of luxury has evolved; luxury now means spending meaningful time with their friends and families, building memories and experiences together.
The partnership with InterContinental Hotels & Resorts is a first that we are looking to roll out as part of an overall refresh of the Mastercard affluent value proposition, which is focused on appealing to their desires through exclusive privileges that are designed to cater to three passion pillars: travel, rewards and experiences and peace of mind.
Mastercard is tapping into these unique insights by building a compelling offer for cardholders that provides premium travel services, rewards and experiences to our cardholders. In essence, it enables sophisticated travel, made simple and stylish, allowing them to travel more and travel well,” Loh said.
