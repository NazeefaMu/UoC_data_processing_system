The five days of festivities will also consist of cultural shows being performed by the Sri Lanka Armed forces and Department of Culture and Sri Lanka Youth Council; their performances will range in music, traditional dances to modern choreography to cater to the variety of visitors at the venue.

The Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, Hon. John Amaratunga is keen to make this festive season a memorable one for the record number of visitors expected in the city this year. “After many years, the country is enjoying true freedom. This is the first festive season under the new government. I have been informed that many Sri Lankans domiciled abroad plan to take advantage of this and visit the country after many years. We want to make this a memorable visit for them and the thousands of tourists who will be travelling to the country,” said Minister Amaratunga.
Further the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Paddy Withana added “With the tourist arrivals on the increase we hope to create new avenues for travellers to enjoy the experience in Sri Lanka. Christmas is highly celebrated by people around the world with great enjoyment and this event will expose Sri Lanka as a destination for festivities. It will add value to the existing product offering of the country and showcase our country on par with other countries celebrating the season.”
All activities will take place at the Arcade Independence Square from 19th to 23rd December from 6.00 pm to 11.00pm. It will be inaugurated with a spectacle of fireworks which is expected to be a major attraction.
“Our objective is to position Sri Lanka as an upscale tourist destination and by organizing an event of this nature showcasing a glimpse of its varied attractions in one location while celebrating in a festive atmosphere would help achieve such aims" commented Mr. Malraj B.Kiriella – Director General of the SLTDA.
