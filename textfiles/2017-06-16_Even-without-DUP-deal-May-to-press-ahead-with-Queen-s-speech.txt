(Daily Mail, London), 15 June 2017 -   Theresa May will unveil a Queen’s Speech next Wednesday even if there is no formal deal with the DUP to prop her up in power.  


The new government’s legislative programme will be put forward two days later than originally planned in the wake of the dramatic election result.  


A senior Tory source said talks with the Northern Ireland party had been ‘positive’ and there was ‘broad agreement on the principles’ of the Speech - but nothing is yet set in stone.Indicating that Mrs May will press ahead even without an agreement, the Tory source said: ‘We are confident there is sufficient support across the House for the Queen’s Speech.’  


Meanwhile, Mrs May is today hosting Sinn Fein, the DUP and other parties at No10 in a bid to restore the Stormont assembly after its acrimonious collapse in January.Some Tories - including ex-PM John Major - have been alarmed that an arrangement with the DUP would harm the Good Friday Agreement by undermining the UK government’s claim to be impartial.
