Mulberry Residence to transform skylines of Colombo

Steradian Capital, a privately owned, real estate development and consultancy business, unveiled its plans for an affordable apartment complex, at a ceremony that was held at the Taj Samudra, Colombo recently.
Located in Colombo 09, Mulberry Residence, is the latest housing complex that is set to transform simplicity into quality and sustainability. The development of the apartment complex will be in collaboration with the Yanjian Group, one of the top 250 construction companies in the world. The construction period (including piling) will take 24 months; ensuring customers will enjoy a fast construction period, from conception to tangible living. Commenting on the specialty and the vision of the project, Hardy Jamaldeen, a Directorof Steradian Capital said, "We are delighted and privileged to have the Yanjian Group as our construction partner as they are responsible for some of Sri Lanka's greatest construction projects."
"Having understood that development is much more than creating homes, we at Steradian Capital are committed to working with local people and communities.
The vision for the project comes from our desire to improve the affordable and professional housing sector in Sri Lanka, as we have identified a need for it.
Therefore, we always try to handpick land parcels in areas of high density where there is a need to serve and improve the lives of the local community."
"Our main focus is Sri Lanka and we have in-depth knowledge and experience of the local market. Therefore we believe that there is a huge void in the market and less being done towards young professionals and aspiring families.
We also believe that our project actually serves a purpose and has an end user, as we consider it a joint venture between the developer and purchaser," said Archie Warman, a Director of Steradian Capital
