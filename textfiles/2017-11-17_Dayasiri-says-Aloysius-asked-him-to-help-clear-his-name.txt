Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara accused Arjun Aloysius, the owner of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) of having met him to ask for his assistance in clearing his name after it was associated with the bond scam.

Minister Jayasekara confirmed that Aloysius had in fact contacted him and met him at his office. He said the Perpetual owner had tried to plead his innocence."He said he was innocent. He asked me to help establish his innocence before the COPE. I declined to do so. I told him that the allegations against him were serious and that I could not help him," Jayasekara said.

The minister said he stood firm against the bond scam during the COPE proceedings. "The minutes of the meeting will clearly show this," he said. (Kelum Bandara)
