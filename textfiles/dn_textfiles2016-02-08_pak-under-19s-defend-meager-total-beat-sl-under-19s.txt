Pak Under 19s defend a meager total to beat SL Under 19s

 
Pakistan U19 after an excellent display with the ball finished on top of group B when they beat their Sri Lankan counterparts well defending a modest total. Though the result of this match did not make any difference to either team’s position into the next round of the tournament as both teams were already qualified to play in quarters, the position of being unbeaten puts a team high in morale.
After Sri Lankan bowlers restricted Pakistan to a total of 212 just under 49 overs, the target for their batsmen looked to be too easy, but Pakistan bowlers did something better with the ball than the Sri Lankan bowlers as they bowled out Sri Lanka for a total of 189 inside 47 overs to win the match by 23 runs.
The match, in the end became a comeback game for Pakistan as Sri Lanka at the time Kamindu Mendis and Vishad Randika were at the wicket were cruising along nicely, but once they departed Sri Lankan innings crumbled quicker than Pakistan innings collapsed.
In quarter finals, Sri Lanka will meet England whilst Pakistan clash with West Indies.
Pakistan U19 : 212 in 48.4 overs (Hasan Mohsin 86, Salman Fayyaz 33, Mohammed Umar 26, Thilan Nimesh 2/38, Wanindu Hasranga 2/30, Damitha Silva 2/41)
Sri Lanka U19 : 189 in 46.4 overs (Kamindu Mendis 68, Vishad Randika 46, Damitha Silva 21*, Shadad Khan 3/31)
