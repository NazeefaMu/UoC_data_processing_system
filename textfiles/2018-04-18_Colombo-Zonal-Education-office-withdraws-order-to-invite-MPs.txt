Colombo Zonal Education office withdraws order to invite MPs


	

The Colombo Zonal Education office has withdrawn an order it issued in February to Principals in Colombo schools demanding they pay due respect to Parliamentarians and PC members who attend special school functions.

In a letter dated February 20 sent to all schools in the Colombo Zonal Division, Zonal Education Director P.N. Silva ordered that parliamentarians and PC members, public representatives, be invited to special school functions.

The letter went a step further when it ordered the invitees, especially members of parliament, be ‘given due respect’ when they attended such events.

The order was revoked on April 9 following public criticism after it was released to the media. The revocation letter by Zonal Education Director Silva apologized for the inconvenience faced by principals.

A news story published by the Daily Mirror on March 25 revealed that the order was conveyed with a list of Provincial Councillors who represented the Colombo Zonal Education Development Structural Committee. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
