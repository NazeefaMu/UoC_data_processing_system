The number of trains operating from the Colombo Fort Railway Station would be increased by evening, Railways Additional General Manager Wijaya Samarasinghe said

Ten long-distance trains left the Colombo Fort Railway station this morning despite the ongoing strike by railway trade unions.

Samarasinghe said the trains left for Chilaw, Kandy, Maho, Rambukkana, Galle, Avissawella and Anuradhapura.

“Railway employees on contract are now reporting for railway operations,” he said.

Meanwhile, two trains with fuel carriages left for Kolonnawa and Katunayake this morning.

Eight trains were operational on main lines such as Chilaw, Puttalam, Matara, Galle, Rambukkana, Kandy, Mahawa, and Avissawella yesterday. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
