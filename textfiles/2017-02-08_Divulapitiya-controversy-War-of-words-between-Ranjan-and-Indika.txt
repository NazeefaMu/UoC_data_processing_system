Uncomplimentary language, allegations and counter allegations were the order of the day during the initial part of the parliamentary sessions yesterday when Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and joint opposition MP Indika Anuruddha were trading words on Divulapitiya incident.

It happened when the deputy minister rose to answer an oral question asked by the MP regarding the Divulapitiya electorate. The opposition MPs attempted to raise objections saying it is the Leader of the House, the Chief Government Whip or the subject minister who has to answer the question.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in his response said he had permitted the deputy minister to answer the question as per Standing Order 27. However Speaker Karu Jayasuriya overruled him and directed Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatilleke to answer the question.

Matters hotted up when the deputy minister attempted to explain saying the MP and his family were engaged in illegal sand mining in the area. "The whole of Divulapitiya has been destroyed because of illegal sand mining in the area," he said.

The MP then showed a letter written by deputy minister to Minister Kabir Hashim asking him for an an access road to a quarry. "The deputy minister has made this request on behalf of his henchmen who are engaged in a business of supplying rock stones for the port city project," he said.

Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera who joined in the verbal tussle said the document which was tabled by the MP should be sent to the government analyst because Mr. Ramanayake has denied signing any such letter.

The matter came up again when when Padma Udayashantha Gunasekera raised a supplementary question. Minister S.B. Dissanayake to whom the question was directed said the MP's question had nothing to do with the original question. "Learn to raise oral question in the proper manner he said while using an uncomplimentary word.

The MP raised the matter again a little later with Mr Ramanayake raising a point of order. This was despite repeated requests made by the Speaker that the two MPs should allow the proceedings to continue.

"Raising points of order has become a joke," the Speaker said. (Yohan Perera)
