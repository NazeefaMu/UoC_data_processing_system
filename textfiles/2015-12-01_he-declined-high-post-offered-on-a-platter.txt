This commander of an armed force soon after his retirement, was offered on a platter the post of the country’s envoy in a powerful country in Asia.
The war hero, after declining high office offered to him, accepted a top position in a private company. 
A friend of the ex-security chief intrigued by the latter’s refusal to accept a high post coveted by many decided to get his reason for doing so from the horse’s mouth and the war hero gave him a ready explanation: “We fought for several years to save this country,” he said. “But we had no peace after retirement.  We were driven from pillar to post for questioning.  Even if I served as a diplomat, one day I may have to face a similar situation. Therefore, I would rather live with peace of mind than wallow in the glory of a high post!”
