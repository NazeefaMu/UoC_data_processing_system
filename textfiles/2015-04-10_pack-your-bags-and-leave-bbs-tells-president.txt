Pack your bags and leave: BBS tells President


	

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) said today President Maithripala Sirisena should pack his bags and leave so as to allow a leader with a backbone to administer the country which was fast heading towards anarchy.
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera told a news conference that the people were confused about political situation which has become a mockery when considering the manner in which some of the politicians are behaving.
“The country needs a leader with a backbone and leadership qualities. Mr. Sirisena is a good person. But he is unable to administer the affairs of this country and neither has he been capable of fulfilling the elections promises he made. So we kindly request him to leave,” the Thera said.
He said even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was a better leader of the country because the decisions taken by President Sirisena had ended in confusion.
The Thera said the country’s current political status was foretold by the BBS several months ago and that the people were disappointed with the so-called change that was definitely destroying governance in Sri Lanka.
“This government has not given priority to Buddhism at ceremonies organised by the Government and we have noticed Buddhism and the Sinhala nation are under threat,” the Thera said.
BBS Chief Executive Officer Dilantha Vithanage who was also present at the media briefing, accused the Government of hatching a conspiracy by elements behind scene.
“The country is a mess. The Prime Minister says one thing while the President and the other leaders are saying something else. This is not what the public expected from the change. We request Mr. Sirisena to take responsibility for the allegations levelled at the government and allow someone else with a strong personality to be the leader,” he said.
Speaking on the incident where former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was hooted and jeered at a SLFP meeting, Gnanasara Thera expressed his sorrow at the embarrassment caused but said that was the result of her of performing the 3rd episode of what he described as “Ege Wairaya”.
