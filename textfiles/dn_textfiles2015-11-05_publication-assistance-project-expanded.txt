Publication assistance project expanded

The National Library and Documentation Services Board (NLDSB) has taken steps to expand the publication assistance project, the NLDSB in a press release said.
The release said financial assistance is provided to authors for their creations under this. Manuscripts of translations and children's and youth literary books are accepted. Any writer can submit their suitable manuscripts.
The manuscripts are selected through an independent and formal inspection. The NLDSB has taken steps to increase financial assistance to selected books.
The NLDSB has also removed the limit of the maximum five books an author can get financial assistance, the release said.
