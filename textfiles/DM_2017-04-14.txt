Lyca's village inaugurated without Rajinikanth, Vigneswaran
	
Days after Rajinikanth cancelled his trip to Sri Lanka to inaugurate a village following protests in Tamil Nadu, the village has been inaugurated on Wednesday, India Today reported. 
The village was developed by Lyca, the organisation which produces Rajiikanth's next film, for Sri Lankan Tamils affected by the war.
Lyca is owned by a Sri Lankan Tamil, and its village has as many as 400 houses. It also happens to be producing Rajinikanth's next film, Enthiran 2.0.
Rajinikanth along with North Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran and Opposition leader R. Sampanthan were supposed to attend the inauguration of the village.
But it wasn't to be as the veteran actor called off his visit following protests by several groups in India.
"Lyca is an organisation (which), though owned by a Sri Lankan Tamil, has former President Mahinda Rajapaksa involved in it, and we are against the same. We don't have a problem in Rajini visiting Sri Lanka, but we have a problem in him becoming the face of Lyca's agenda," said Thol Thirumavalavan, the leader of the Viduthalai Chiruththaigal Katchi (VCK).
According to India Today, North Province chief minister Vigneswaran, too cancelled his visit to the village at the last minute.
However, Opposition Leader Sampanthan was present for the inauguration.

Met Dept warns naval and fishing communities
	
The Meteorology Department today warned navel and fishing communities to be vigilant because of the possibility of sudden roughness of the sea associated with sudden increase of wind speed up to 70-80kmph.
Issuing a warning at 12.30 p.m. today for the next 24 hours, the department said the deep and shallow sea areas off the coast extending from Colombo to Trincomalee via Galle, Hambantota and Batticaloa could be rough due to the active cloudiness associated with a low level disturbance in the Bay of Bengal which is in the east of Sri Lanka.
Heavy showers can also be expected in these sea areas, it said.

South Asia vulnerable to Zika, Ebola-Experts
	
South Asian nations are vulnerable to emerging infectious diseases such as Zika and Ebola, and their level of preparedness is inadequate to protect public health, The Hindustan Times reported quoting a new health analysis.
An analysis as part of a collection of 12 analyses on health in South Asia published in British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that inadequate surveillance and uneven health system capacity may accelerate the spread of the emerging infectious diseases in the region. The region is already burdened by diseases like tuberculosis, HIV and malaria.
Examining the vulnerability to emerging and growing infectious disease threats and the capacity to respond to outbreaks, the analysis finds the level of preparedness is inadequate to protect public health, it said.
The analysis also pointed out that although sporadic cases of dengue infection were seen in many South Asian countries in the 1960s, regular epidemics only occurred in the early 1990s in India and Sri Lanka.
In India and Sri Lanka, by around 40 years of age 90-95% of adults have been infected with the dengue virus, while 41% have been infected with chikungunya, the analysis found.
It said while noting that anthrax is endemic in large parts of South Asia, that in the border areas of India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, poor vaccination and surveillance have been accompanied by increasing anthrax cases, which prompted Bangladesh to announce a red alert in 2010.
Noting that rabies remains endemic in eight countries in South East Asia, with 1.4 billion people at risk, the authors in the analysis said that the region contributes about 45% of global rabies deaths, while the rhetoric on elimination continues to grow.
Brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, and a range of food-borne diseases contribute to the morbidity and mortality attributable to zoonotic infections but are struggling to gain the attention of policymakers in the subcontinent, despite it resulting in 150 million illnesses, 175,000 deaths, and 12 million disability-adjusted life years, the analysis said.
The analysis found that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus A/H5N1, which was introduced to the subcontinent in 2005 through wild birds, has since become endemic across large parts of northeast India and Bangladesh, across porous international borders.
South Asia is defined by the World Bank as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and is home to a quarter of the worlds population.(Hindustan Times)

Taiwan streamline visa for SL, other countries
	
Taiwan will streamline the visa application process for visitors from Southeast Asian and South Asian countries including Sri Lanka, the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Taiwan has said on Wednesday.
According to Focus Taiwan News Channel, the country will expand visa privileges for visitors from Thailand, Brunei and the Philippines.
The decision to make travel to Taiwan easier for citizens from those nations, which came after a cross-agency meeting two days earlier, aims to promote the country's "New Southbound Policy," the ministry has said in a statement.
Taiwan will grant visitors from India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos visa-free treatment on a "conditional" basis, it said.
They will be able to apply for a travel permit through the website of the Ministry of the Interior if they have been issued a visa by Taiwan within the past 10 years, it said.
Citizens from Sri Lanka and Bhutan will also be allowed to apply for a tourist visa to Taiwan, the ministry said.
Businesspeople from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Pakistan will be able to apply for an e-visa to Taiwan if they obtain recommendations from branch offices of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council in those countries, it added.
The new measures come after Taiwan streamlined the visa process for visitors from Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states and India last August.
The measures have boosted visits to Taiwan and there have been few cases of visa violations, the government said, leading it to further streamline the visa process to promote tourism and business ties with the region.

## Title: There could be alien life on one of Saturn's moons-NASA

There could be alien life on one of Saturn's moons-NASA
	
Alien life could exist within our solar system as NASA reveals Saturn's moon Enceladus has all of the ingredients for life after discovery of hydrogen gas, the Daily Mail reported a short while ago.
During a news briefing held today, NASA has announced the spacecraft Cassini had found hydrogen as a gas  the form needed to support single-celled organisms in the moons ocean.
This hydrogen is now said to be a potential source of chemical energy that could support microbes on the seafloor of Enceladus, the researchers revealed during the news briefing.
'We have made the first calorie count in an alien ocean. This is a major step in assessing the moon's habitability,' said Chris Glein, Cassini INMS team associate at the Southwest Research Institute.
The hydrogen, which shoots out of the moon in high-powered ice jets, is the final puzzle piece following the discovery of its liquid ocean and carbon dioxide.
It means Enceladus may have the same single-celled organisms which began life on Earth, or more complex life still.

This is the closest we've come, so far, to identifying a place with some of the ingredients needed for a habitable environment, said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate at Headquarters in Washington.
These results demonstrate the interconnected nature of NASA's science missions that are getting us closer to answering whether we are indeed alone or not.
Professor David Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University, said: We have now got all the ingredients we need to support life on Enceladus.
'If we can prove this place where life could exist really does have it, that would be a huge discovery.
Alien life was once only thought possible on habitable planets within the Goldilocks zone  far away enough from our sun not to be a fireball, but not so far as to be freezing.
Enceladus, a frozen moon almost 10 times as far from the sun as Earth, at 900 million miles, was one of the least likely candidates.
But in 2005 the unmanned Cassini spacecraft was orbiting Saturn when it picked up plumes of vapour coming from the tiger stripes, or deep fissures, in the moons surface.
This established that, while Enceladus is freezing on its surface, underneath is a liquid ocean.
The gravity from its parent planet pulls the moon out of shape, wherever it is closest, creating friction which heats the rock to 90C - enough to melt the ice into water.
Cassini, on its final mission before it runs out of fuel and is allowed to burn up its space, was sent diving deep into the jets.
After orbiting Saturn for 13 years, its grand finale mission will end in September when it is diverted to crash into Saturn.
Meanwhile, Dr. David Clements, astrophysicist at Imperial College London, said: This discovery does not mean that life exists on Enceladus, but it is a step on the way to that result.
He added: We need to know much more about the molecular species coming out of Enceladus and, ideally, that are inside it before we can make such claims.

US drops 'mother of all bombs' in Afghanistan killing 36 ISIS militants
	
Up to 36 suspected Islamic State militants were killed in Afghanistan when the US dropped the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat, the Guardian reported quoting the Afghan defence ministry on Friday.
To target a tunnel complex used by the ISISs Afghanistan affiliate, the US for the first time used what the military colloquially calls the mother of all bombs, the GBU-43/B.
Dawlat Waziri, an Afghan ministry spokesman said of Thursdays strike: No civilian has been hurt and only the base, which Daesh used to launch attacks in other parts of the province, was destroyed.
Designed for destroying underground targets but not itself a deep-earth penetrator weapon, the GBU-43/B has the explosive yield of more than 11 tons of TNT.
The massive bomb is dropped from air force planes and detonates before reaching the ground, resulting in an enormous blast radius. Only the Massive Ordnance Penetrator GBU-57, which has never been used in war, is a larger conventional weapon.
The psychological effect on survivors or observers is considered an added impact of the weapon.

Asked whether he had authorized the bombing, Donald Trump said: Everybody knows exactly what happened. What I do is I authorize my military. We have the greatest military in the world and theyve done a job as usual. We have given them total authorization and thats what theyre doing and frankly thats why theyve been so successful lately.
Did this bombing send a message to North Korea I dont know if this sends a message; it doesnt make any difference if it does or not, the president said. North Korea is a problem, the problem will be taken care of. He implied that China was working very hard on this issue.
Army Gen John W Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement that the GBU-43/B was the right munition to use against the Islamic State in Khorosan, or Isis-K.
The blast detonated at 7.32pm local time in the Achin district of the eastern province of Nangarhar, according to the US military.
Sarab, a local resident from Asadkhel in Achin, close to the mountain where the bomb targeted Isis tunnels, said he saw a giant flame before the blast made the ground shake. It was the biggest blast I have ever heard, he said.
Sarab added that the targeted area had recently been completely occupied by Isis fighters. There is no way that civilians were still living there, he said.
However, a parliamentarian from Nangarhar, Esmatullah Shinwari, said locals had told him one teacher and his young son had been killed.
One man, the MP recounted, had told him before the phone lines went down: I have grown up in the war, and I have heard different kinds of explosions through 30 years: suicide attacks, earthquakes different kinds of blasts. I have never heard anything like this.
Haji Ghalib Mujahed, a local veteran commander, said he felt tremors all the way to Bati Kot, a neighbouring district where he is now the administrative chief.
An American special forces soldier was killed last week in Achin while fighting Isis-K, but a US military spokesman in Kabul, Capt William Salvin, said there was absolutely no connection between that death and Thursdays bombing.
Nicholsons command said it took every precaution to avoid civilian casualties, without defining those steps, but gave no word on the impact to Afghan civilians
The military said it used the GBU-43/B to minimize the risk to Afghan and US forces fighting Isis-K in Achin.
Following the bombing, US and Afghan forces began clearing operations in the targeted area.
An Afghan army soldier told the Guardian, as he was driving toward the targeted area: The explosion felt like a big earthquake, even in the surrounding districts.
Trumps spokesman, Sean Spicer, said on Thursday the use of the GBU-43/B showed the US takes the fight against Isis very seriously and in order to defeat the group we must deny them operational space, which we did.
Describing the bombing at his regular White House press briefing, he told reporters: At around 7pm local time in Afghanistan last night the United States military used a GBU-43 weapon in Afghanistan. The GBU-43 is a large, powerful and accurately delivered weapon.
We targeted a system of tunnels and caves that Isis fighters used to move around freely, making it easier for them to target US military advisers and Afghan forces in the area.
He refused to answer further questions about the bomb at his regular press briefing, referring journalists to the Department of Defense.
