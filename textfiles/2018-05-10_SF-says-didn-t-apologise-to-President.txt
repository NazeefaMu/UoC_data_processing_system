Minister Sarath Fonseka today said he did not apologise to President Maithripala Sirisena but only met him to discuss about recent political issues.

A statement issued by the Ministry said Field Marshall Fonseka met both the President and the Prime Minister to discuss about the recent political issues based on a proposal made by the Premier.

“At the meeting, the President has said the prevailing issues could be discussed between him and the Minister in order to arrive at solutions instead of making statements about such issues to the media or at public meetings. Apart from this, no discussion was made with regard to any apology,” the statement said rejecting reports.
