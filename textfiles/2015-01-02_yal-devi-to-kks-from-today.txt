The Yal Devi express train travelled from Jaffna to Kankesanthurai (KKS) today after a lapse of 25 years, the Railway Department said.
Transport Minister Kumara Welgama inaugurated the train service this morning in the presence of Ministers Susil Premajayanth, Reginald Cooray, Douglas Devananda and Northern Province Governor.   
Sri Lanka Railway (SLR) Commercial Superintendent Sisira Kumara said the North-bound ‘Yal Devi’ train left for KKS linking the North and South by rail for first time since the train service was halted during the height of the armed conflict. “The service will be open for the public from tomorrow,” he said.
