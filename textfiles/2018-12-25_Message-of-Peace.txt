Message of Peace


	

By Jeannette Cabraal   

It was peace that pervaded the atmosphere that 
Holy ‘Night   
It was peace that encompassed Bethlehem’s plains and heights.   
It was the message of peace that the angels proclaimed   
“Peace on earth, goodwill to men.”   
Peace the hallmark of the Christ-child’s birth   
Which the world celebrates with enjoyment and mirth   
The message of peace unheeded, thwarted, lies   
What a return for the Godhead’s supreme sacrifice.   
That peace, which truly embodies the Christmas season   
Be accepted by man- endowed by God with will and reason   
That the message of peace be propagated, restored, world-wide   
Peace! The message of the Christ-child.
