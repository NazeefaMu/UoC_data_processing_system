It is seen that there is a huge need of reorganization of the LTTE in the North and East, State Minister of Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran claimed today addressing the 'Janapathi Nila Mehewara' event at the Weerasingham Hall in Jaffna.

She said that reports relating to traces of LTTE reorganizing are heard regularly as a result of the people in the North and the East not willing to discard the LTTE from their hearts.

“Now we remember how we lived before May 18, 2009. In the present conditions our main intention is to bring back the LTTE If we want to live, if we want to walk freely, if we need our children to attend schools and return back.,” she said.

She pointed out that a 6-year-old child had been raped and killed and now people feel why they appointed the present President into power.

She said that they had committed a lot to appoint the President and despite protecting the people he is working to protect party matters.

She also questioned the development carried out in the last three years in the North and East.

“We do not know what development they have done in our area. But I only thank the Government for one good thing and that is to release and return our lands to us. Other than that the Government had done nothing to us,” she said.

She also said being a minister in the present administration there is a limit that she can speak against their leader but had to cross the limit on some occasions. (Romesh Madushanka)
