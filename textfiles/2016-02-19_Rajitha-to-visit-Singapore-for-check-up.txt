Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne will leave for Singapore tonight for a medical checkup on medical advice, the minister’s spokesman said.  

The minister was earlier admitted to a private hospital in Colombo where the doctors had advised him a period of bed rest.

“However, the minister is scheduled to participate in a seminar in India on Monday and therefore it was advisable to visit a hospital in Singapore on the way to India,” spokesman Nipun Ekanayake said.

He said it was only a part of the minister’s regular medical check-up.
