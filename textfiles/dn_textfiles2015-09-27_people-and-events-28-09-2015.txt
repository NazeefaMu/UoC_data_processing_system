FR. JOE FERNANDO: PASSIONATE LIBERATOR OF THE POOR
Part one was published on September 14 :
The impact Fr. Joe Fernando has made in the field of socio-economic development, the integral growth of the poor and the efforts he has made for the establishment of a National Centre (SEDEC) cannot be fully understood without reference to his pioneering work in Negombo.
As an animator and enabler, he was able to achieve many good results for the uplift of the people, particularly of the socially marginalised, with the collaboration of a team of priests in the Negombo region. I had seen these priests coming to the presbytery (Mission House) at Sea Street practically every month to discuss matters relating to the lives of the people.
For 10 years (1958 -1968), the team led by Fr. Joe experimented and successfully carried pout some socio-pastoral programmes – catechetical, liturgical, youth apostolate, education, cooperatives, fisheries and community development.
It was the joint commitment of the priests led by Fr. Joe that was responsible for obtaining a Maha Vidyalaya (St. Peter’s Maha Vidyalaya) for Negombo. They were also able to promote youth apostolate among the rural young men and young women by establishing a Centre (Christu Nivasa) in Negombo.
The team was also able to persuade Sr. Good Counsel, the then Provincial Superior of the Good Shepherd Sisters, to start a Centre for life-education and training of the poor girls in Negombo and she responded by providing such a Centre at Hunupitiya.
It was Fr. Joe’s far-sighted vision that enabled him to invite the Salesians led by Fr. Henry Remery, S.D.B, by offering them about 12 acres belonging to the parish of Sea Street, Negombo at Ettukkal, with the consent of the fisher-community of the parish and the approval of Archbishop Thomas Cooray OMI, so that they could begin their service in Sri Lanka both to the Church and to the larger society, especially in the field of technical education of the youth including the ones of the parish of Sea Street.
The socio-pastoral praxis of the team of priests animated by Fr. Joe had repercussions in the other parishes of the Archdiocese. As a result the need for a Socio-pastoral Centre in Negombo became a strong felt need for better coordination and direction. But, Cardinal Thomas Cooray OMI, the then Archbishop of Colombo wanted Fr. Joe’s services extended to the entire Archdiocese.
However, the Catholic Bishops soon requested the Archbishop to extend the services of the Centre to their dioceses as well and make it a National Centre. It can be said that SEDEC, the social Economic development Centre, is a national organisation of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka that had evolved from the grassroots. It is a Centre for the development of the poor.
Leader with a viable vision
Fr. Joe is a visionary, a social engineer, an educator, a strategist and a devoted priest leader of the common people. He studied current issues and discussed with others who could stimulate him for further reflection and action. He has faith in the people and in their ability to become masters of their destiny given the suitable possibilities and opportunities. He believed that every human being has intrinsic dignity and is a child of God having the capacity to love. For him, people are not mere objects but decisional beings capable of living in open-ended relationships. That is why, not willing to dish out social theories or pre-fabricated development models, he would go to the people, bring them together for exchange of ideas and experiences, motivate them and plan with them and lead in the right path. He has not been a “do-gooder” and a talker but one who identified himself with the neglected ones. He knew that the love and care shown to the poor was shown to Jesus Christ Himself really present in them.
In the Negombo region, he had to face fearlessly the challenges posed by fish Mudalalis (businessmen),the Marxists and vested interests and rescue the poor from oppressive forces and offer opportunities for better physical quality of life and human development.
International Recognition
When Fr. Joe retired from his directorship of SEDEC in 1980, recognizing his thinking patterns and his sensitivity to the sufferings and hopes of the poor, Vatican officials soon gave him an assignment at Caritas Internationalis in Rome.
His promotion to such an important office should be seen as a progressive step of his faithfulness to his ministry of making the poor feel loved, valued and esteemed. It was in 1979 that he was conferred an honorary doctorate by Coady International Institute of St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Canada for his development work in Sri Lanka and in the previous year (1978) when he was named Vice-President of CIDSE, the International Body of Catholic Agencies, he became the first Asian and first Sri Lankan to hold that post.
