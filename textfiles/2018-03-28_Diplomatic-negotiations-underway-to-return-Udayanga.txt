Diplomatic negotiations are currently underway to return the former Sri Lankan Envoy to Russia and Ukraine Udayanga Weeratunga, Police Media Spokesman said today.

Former diplomat Weeratunga was arrested by Dubai Authorities following an investigation carried out by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID).

Mr. Weeratunga was previously detained at the Dubai Airport on February 04 and a group of local law enforcement authorities who went to bring him down had to return empty handed as there was only a blue warrant issued by the Interpol at that time on him.

Police Media Division announced on February 23 that the INTERPOL had issued a ‘Red Warrant' on Mr. Weeratunga, naming him as a fugitive wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
