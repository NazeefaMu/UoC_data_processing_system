Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa’s wife Pushpa and daughter Thejani have been summoned by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) today.

A spokesman for the commission said they were summoned by the commission to record a statement over an allegation of misusing flights carried out by the Air Force.

He said they had been asked to report to the commission over the same matter on May 4 and 5 but they did not make it as they were out of the country.

Pushpa Rajapaksa has been summoned this morning and her daughter Thejani in the afternoon.

Several people including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa also gave statements before the commission on previous occasions with regard to the same matter. (Ajith Siriwardana)
