“Some groups say that the government is trying to divide the country by betraying it. They say that Buddhism is going to lose its pole position due to the new constitution. They say the government is removing the military camps in the North. I kindly invite them to meet me and show me where these things are taking place”, President Maithripala Sirisena said.

The President was speaking at the inauguration of the project to renovate the ‘Vam Ivuru Ela’ in Minipe. The project is being carried out under the government’s programme to renovate the irrigation system built by the ancient kings of Sri Lanka. These irrigation system will be renovated, utilizing modern irrigation technology, he said.

President Sirisena said that the current government would build Sri Lanka into a strong, exemplary and great country by strengthening historical greatness which has been prevailing for thousands of years.

“Though some groups are criticizing the freedom and democracy prevailing in the country even while enjoying them, we will build the country by getting together with those who want to work for the country,” he said. “In their interviews to the media some people today give the impression that the government is going to collapse before the sunrise tomorrow. After an election of a government, everyone’s responsibility is not just to criticize the government but to support that government for the betterment of the country and the people.

“To build a strong economy we should strengthen the livelihoods of farmers and their economy," the President said.
