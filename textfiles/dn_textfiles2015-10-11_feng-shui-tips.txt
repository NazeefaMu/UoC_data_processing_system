Feng shui Tips

The ancient Chinese philosophy of feng shui advocates the use of plants to create harmony in the home. Experts translate good feng shui into the ‘ideal balance of energies in a home.’
Plants represent wood, the only one of the five elements (the others being earth, water, air and metal) that contains chi, energy or the life force. How does that translate into plants and their placement across the home? Feng shui recommends plants with more yin than yang in the bedroom (ferns and feathery herbs), along with hanging baskets and plants on windowsills.
Plants with broad, full leaves are ideal for the kitchen, while a small water body surrounded by a variety of plants creates the best balance of calm and energy in the living room. Lastly, never keep a cactus on your night table — it will lead to fitful sleep and bad dreams.
