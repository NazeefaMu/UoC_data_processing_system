With a proud heritage of over 40 years of being in business, Multi Finance PLC (MFPLC) has been a source of strength to businesses and entrepreneurs in the urban, rural and SME markets, playing a pivotal role in contributing to the growth of the Sri Lankan economy.


The company’s acquisition by rapidly expanding conglomerate Fairway Holdings in June 2017 has created greater potential for the company to expand with the existing customers as well as exploring untapped credit markets.


Fairway Holdings, the leading property developer in luxury vertical solutions, has rapidly ventured into multiple business areas including leisure, financial services, waste management, aviation, trading, bio technology and aquatic resources. A key feature of this diversification has been Fairway’s ability to attract and sustain some of the best industry specialists from relevant segments, which has paved the way for MFPLC to be steered by a strong new management.


Led by Chairman Kuvera de Zoysa, President’s Counsel, the new and equally dynamic board of directors of MFPLC counts over decades of professional experience in leading multinational corporations across a wide range of industries, with promising exponential growth for the company. 


The members of the board of directors also include Pushpike Jayasundera, who will serve as Executive Director/CEO, whilst Champika Attapattu will take on the role of Executive Director-Legal. 


Serving as Independent Non-Executive Directors are the following: Dr. Ravi Ajith Fernando, Imal Fonseka, Prasann Leanage, Shelton Pieris, K.D.P.C. Abeysekera and W.A. Lakshaman.


As a result of the acquisition, MFPLC has experienced a rapid evolution, attracting the industry’s best talent to join its corporate management and expanding its existing branch network. The team is well-resourced with highly qualified financial specialists to identify customer requirements and offer the most pragmatic financial solutions.


“At present, MFPLC is one of the few finance companies in the country offering specialized solutions across a service portfolio consisting of fixed deposits, savings, leasing, business loans, multi draft, pawning, microfinance, trader finance and more,” commented Multi Finance PLC Executive Director/CEO Pushpike Jayasundera.
“Under the visionary direction of Fairway Holdings, we are confident of strengthening our decade-long identity of reliability and look forward to enhancing shareholder value through financial stability, growth and specialized financial services in the coming years.”


MFPLC is a licensed finance company under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. MFPLC was established back in 1974 as a limited liability company in Kandy and re-registered under the 2007 Companies Act No.07 in 2009. It functions as a quoted company in the Colombo Stock Exchange.
