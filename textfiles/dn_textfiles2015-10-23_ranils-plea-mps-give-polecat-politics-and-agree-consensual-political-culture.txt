Ranil's plea to MPs: "Give up polecat politics and agree for consensual political culture"

The Parliamentary debate on the country's Human Rights record and the mechanism to probe the alleged war crimes was a moment of retrospection to come to terms with the past and open the doors for a harmonious future.
It signalled the Government's willingness to begin the much needed discourse on the uneasy topic which the previous government was digging in its heels. The debate carried a true sense of introspection and was a difficult step forward in mending the broken hearts of those in the North and the South.
However, it was never an easy task for the communal hardliners of both sides to break out of their cocoon and face up to the reality. On the other hand, it clearly exposed those who vociferously fan communal passions for their own political survival.
The adjournment motion pertaining to the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka was presented by UNP MP Ajith Mannaperuma. Two full dates had been allocated for the debate even excluding a lunch break. Providing materials for a constructive debate, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tabled the much awaited reports of 'Udalagama' and 'Paranagama' Presidential Commissions of Inquiry along with the OHCHR report in Parliament on Tuesday.
Findings of Paranagama Commission
These reports delved deeply into the alleged killings and disappearances of people during the last phase of war and several years before that. Both those Presidential Commissions were mandated during the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the pressure was surmounting to investigate over the alleged human rights violations and disappearances. However, the reports were not in public domain until they were presented in Parliament.
The findings of Paranagama Commission once again brought the brutalities committed by the LTTE to the limelight, and reiterated that the LTTE was responsible for the majority of killings of civilians during the final phase of the war. At the same time, the report also reversed the belief entrenched in the minds of the people in the South by the former Government that there had been 'zero civilian casualties' on the part of the Sri Lankan Army.
The commission also rejects the highly controversial estimation of 40,000 civilian deaths mentioned in the Darusman Report. Masrzuki Drusman was a member of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and worked along with Justice P. N. Bhagawati (former Chief justice of India) who headed the IIGEP. However in the same tenor the Paranagama Commission observes the Channel 4 documentary on war crimes and extra-judicial killings was "unlikely to be faked" and proposes an independent inquiry into it.
The Udalagama Commission was given 15 selected cases to investigate on the alleged serious violations of human rights. However, the Commission had only completed investigations into seven cases within the mandated period, as it had consumed much time to investigate on the case of killing 17 INGO aid workers in 2006 and the case of killing five youths in Trincomalee in 2006. There were altogether nine printed volumes tabled in Parliament, two pertaining to the Commission headed by retired High Court Judge Maxwell Paranagama, and seven pertaining to the Commission headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Nissanka Udalagama.
It was hard to imagine that the MPs had enough time to properly study these reports before the debate, rather than rushing through their pages. Moreover, the bundles of those documents tied up by a ribbon were seen untouched on the benches of some MPs even on the day of the debate.
UNHRC Resolution
Interestingly, the ethnic hardliners of both sides of the divide were on the same page with regard to the UNHRC Resolution. They plainly rejected it on the extremist grounds. It is said 'the communal extremism on one side breeds that of the other side'. The two provocative speeches of NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa and TNA MP Mavai Senathirajah proved it beyond doubt.
Weerawansa making a blistering speech castigated the Government for co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution stating it was an act of betrayal of the war heroes. He spoke with his usual pseudo-patriotic rhetoric to add more fuel to the anxieties of war heroes' families.
"There will be international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators to probe into war crimes. The war heroes will be tried before a hybrid court. Once the prisoners under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are freed, they will go before the court to give witnesses against war heroes", he narrated.
However, Weerawansa was roundly criticized for his rabid chauvinism by many who joined in the debate later. Minister Dilan Perera making a sharp criticism, stated a few in the UPFA was responsible was dragging the SLFP into an extreme communal line.
"The SLFP will never give way for communalism again. We are pursuing consensual politics as we want to find a lasting solution to the national question", he insisted.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne trod upon some uneasy revelations against the Sri Lankan Government forces made in the Paranagama Commission report involving the Channel 4 documentary and some alleged killings during the last phase of war. It indicated his readiness for a frank discussion which had been suppressed for six long years after the war. "Admit the bare truth that the UNHRC report and the resolution were watered down to a great extent. The domestic mechanism will be established within the powers of Sri Lankan judicial system," he stressed.
The standpoint of TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran with regard to the Geneva Resolution carried food for thought and his views on the subject deserved to be applauded. His voice no doubt represented the official stance of the TNA. The tenor of his speech indicated their readiness to get rid of narrow communal politics.
"The weakening of several clauses in the Resolution has hurt our feelings, but we support the Government for its full implementation.
The UNHRC report not only highlighted the crimes committed by the Government forces, but also the LTTE. Yet, we welcomed the entire report. We are ready to lead our people in that painful process of introspection to know the failures and crimes on the part of our own community.
This is a must if we are to move forward. Let's deal with the investigations justly, honestly and transparently", he appealed.
Amidst a very useful and constructive debate on the resolution the sittings had to be suspended abruptly for a few minutes, as the UPFA minor coalition partners led by MP Dinesh Gunawardena behaved aggressively attempting to grab the Mace and run. The reason was a dispute over time allocation for the speech of MP Weerawansa. Weerawansa, who was waiting for his turn, became impatient as he was not given the opportunity by the chair. Observing that the speeches allowed in the House so far reflected only favourable viewpoints to the Government, Weerawansa wanted his turn without further delay. He reminded that the debate was initially asked by them.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena making aggressive comments at this point rushed to the Mace.
The Deputy Sergeant-at-arms prevented him from grabbing the Mace, but Gunawardena violently pushed him and carried the Mace to the middle of the well leading to the suspension of the House. Minister Mangala Samaraweera was seen intervening to solve the matter while the sittings remained suspended. When the sittings resumed, Weerawansa was allowed to make his speech.
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa did not turn up during the first day of the adjournment debate, but he was expected on the next day. Rajapaksa was quick to react to the Geneva Resolution and asked the Government to reject it. Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardena, who was a vociferous critique of the Government, had to face a rather difficult time in Parliament this week as his very own words boomeranged back on him. He was asking for trouble when he called the Finance Minister by the name 'Karunanayake Ravindra Sandresh Ganeshan' with tainted intentions to insult him in communal line.
Even though Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella pointed out the mistake, Gunawardena was reluctant to accept it. Instead he challenged to resign from his Parliamentary seat if he was proven wrong. However, later on the same day the MP admitted that he was wrong. Yet, that remark alone was not enough to right the wrong.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake took arms against Gunawardena over this matter next day. He demanded that the MP should resign. As the pressure was building, Gunawardena attempted to extenuate himself by stating it was a human error and that he did not intend to insult anybody.
Kiriella demanded that MP Gunawardena must leave the Chamber at least for a short time keeping to his own words. The backbenches in the Government stood up and protested against Gunawardena's presence in the Chamber, and in return a few UPFA MPs in the Opposition too were standing and shouting at the Government members.
Opportunity to correct the past mistakes
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya after making numerous attempts to maintain the decorum of the House had no other choice but to suspend sittings abruptly for five minutes. However, the Speaker's frustration was seen when he mentioned that Rs 4.6 million of public money is spent on each sitting day, adding that Parliament should conduct properly giving priority for public business. Mr. Jayasuriya was emphatic that the time and money spent on sittings should be utilised in a meaningful manner without being wasted.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commencing the debate on the second day, made an earnest plea from all members not to hamper the golden opportunity to correct the past mistakes and clear the way forward for a better tomorrow.
His determination to solve the ethnic crisis was reiterated, while urging all members to put the old vituperative traditions in politics to rest at this crucial juncture and invited them to join together for a new consensual political culture. "I make only one request from you. Please give up the ugly 'polecat' politics.
The polecat is always in the dark. Likewise there are politicians who can never do politics in day light. Let us seek justice for all. Only a few Colombo based pseudo patriots and pro-LTTE diaspora are against this endeavour", he explained.
The Government in the meantime managed to pass a number of key financial legislations this week despite continuous uproar by a few regular noisemakers in Parliament belonging to the UPFA rebel group.
These included a number of financial bills the Government could not pass during its interim period as it did not command the majority in Parliament. The Resolution under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, which was defeated by the Opposition on April 7, also sailed through Parliament quite easily when it was presented last Tuesday.
