The government is holding discussions with several countries, including India and Pakistan, to strengthen Sri Lanka's military, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene informed Parliament yesterday.
Speaking during the Committee Stage debate on the 2016 Budget, Mr. Wijewardene said India was expected to provide two war ships to Sri Lanka, while talks had already begun with Pakistan to obtain new aircraft for the Air Force.
He said several other countries had also offered assistance to help Sri Lanka's military become on par with other advanced military forces in the world.
“Our government is committed to convert the Sri Lankan military into an advanced force, unlike the previous regime which used it to transport sand bags for night races,” Mr. Wijewardene said.
“We will not undermine the security of this country and we are fully committed to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he added.
He said plans were afoot to introduce a special benefit card system for security forces personnel that would allow them to obtain a number of goods and services at a special rate.
Commenting on the new Defence Headquarters being constructed in Pelawatte, Mr. Wijewardene said the first phase would be completed by January 2017, while the project would be fully completed in 2019.(Yohan Perera)
