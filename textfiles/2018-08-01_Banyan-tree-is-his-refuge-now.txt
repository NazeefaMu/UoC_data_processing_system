Two white-collar ones facing a disciplinary inquiry for alleged syphoning off fuel from a storage located in an area described as the ‘lungs of the district’ are reportedly worshipping a banyan tree planted in the premises of this establishment every morn and evening and praying that they are saved from their predicament.

 


The duo had reportedly been in the thick of fraudulent activity with the connivance of a once powerful politico and they have now begun seeking the intervention of supernatural powers to escape punishment as the politico is no longer able to help them, 
they say.
