They think it is a religious practice


	



 

A departmental head who is keen on making meditation part of the day’s schedule for all his employees has for a start ordered all staffers in his office to participate in a 15-minute meditation session every working day of the week. 

 


By the way, a minor employee who could not attend the meditation session was pulled up recently.
This departmental head has made it compulsory for even non- Buddhists for whom meditation is something foreign to participate in the meditation session which has become a daily feature. Some of these staffers have decided to file a HR case for being required to observe a religious practice which is alien to the religions they profess. Some high-ups in the department are said to be extending their moral support on the sly to the staffers set to challenge in courts the practice foisted on them, they say.
