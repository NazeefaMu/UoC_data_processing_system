The main purpose of the government in bringing a New Constitution is to divert the mindset of the people and repress the burning issues of the country, UPFA MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said yesterday.

Addressing a media briefing, he said that there were more significant issues to be addressed rather bringing a new Constitution and added that the government had totally neglected the mandate given by the people in 2015.

“We don’t say that the new Constitution is not topical. But the fact is that the government should show more keenness on the issues prevailing unsolved in the country. People charge that the cost of living is intolerable. Thus, more consideration should be given to the matters pertaining to the people,” Abeywardena stressed.

He proceeded to say that people are burdened with massive tax payments as a result of the Bond scam which plundered billions of rupees of people's money. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
