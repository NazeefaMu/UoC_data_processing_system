A Ministerial inquiry would be conducted against Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundera on several complaints received to the Law and Order Ministry regarding his conduct, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said today.

He told Parliament that the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara had ordered the Ministry Secretary to conduct the investigation against the IGP.

Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Bandara also said neither the President nor the Prime Minister had ordered the IGP Pujith Jayasundera to resign within two weeks as reported in the media.
