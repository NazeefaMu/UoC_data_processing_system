Hypocrisy in bureaucracy!


	



 

The main chair of a government department responsible for raking in the lion share of the government revenue had fallen vacant and an interview was held recently to select a candidate to fill the vacant post. 

 


The interview board set up to screen the candidates comprised two secretarial ones at the highest level. 


According to knowledgeable ones, of all candidates, the best qualified for the post was a senior female mandarin who had earlier functioned in the post in an acting capacity. However, the secretarial duo had selected another candidate who could not hold a candle to the female high-up.


Accounting for their decision for rejecting the female candidate, the duo who sat on the board had said that they did not want to select a person who maintained close ties with the previous regime. 


However, an informed source says that the explanation offered by the secretarial duo evokes more hilarity than scorn. For it is a well-known secret that this secretarial duo openly worked hard for the former strongman at the last big poll and in fact, they had been with him on the day of the poll and remained there until the wee hours of the following morning. “When it became quite clear their horse had lost the race, they had left the palace and lost no time in getting on board with the winning side,” the same source said.  “Hypocrisy at its worst!” he added.
