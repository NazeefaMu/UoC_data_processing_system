Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has requested Law Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake to submit a report to him on the way the police conducted the investigation of the abduction and killing of millionaire Mohamed Suleiman, sources said yesterday.

Sources from the Prime Minister’s office told Daily Mirror that the premier had told Mr. Ratnayake that the report should contain details explaining why the police failed to obtain any information regarding the victim before his body was recovered.

Also he had said the report should contain details of those who disrupted the protest march by ‘Vigilant’ group and the action taken against the person who caused the disruption. “This person was said to be a member of the 'Sinha le’ movement,” sources added. (Yohan Perera)
