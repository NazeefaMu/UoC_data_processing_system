Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL), a fully-owned subsidiary of the Bank of Ceylon, welcomed 2018 with Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and Islam religious observances to mark the dawn of the New Year. 


In addition to the main activities at its head office in Colombo, similar multi-religious ceremonies were held concurrently at all 49 branches of MBSL island-wide to celebrate the New Year.
The event at the MBSL head office was held under the patronage of its Chairman, Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa and Chief Executive Officer, Nishaman Karunapala. Religious leaders of the Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and Islam faiths who participated in the ceremonies conferred blessings on MBSL, all members of the staff, customers, country and the nation, and made a fervent wish that the 2018 New Year that dawned be replete with peace, happiness and fulfillment of hopes and aspirations.


MBSL Chairman, Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa stressed that the profound commitment of the staff is an invaluable input for the progress and greater good of MBSL and the country at large. The progress of MBSL Bank reflects positively on the whole banking and financial sector in the country and contributes to its forward movement, he said, while pointing out that such achievements ultimately translate into an impetus to Sri Lanka’s economy. While thanking the staff at all levels for their concerted efforts towards reaching set goals in 2017, Dr. Lokuhewa wished them the strength, courage and good health to achieve MBSL’s core objectives in 2018.


Chief Executive Officer, Nishaman Karunapala, expressing his views on the occasion said: “There is now intense competition in the banking and financial sector in the country. In this backdrop, there are many challenges that need to be overcome and many goals to be achieved in the 2018 New Year “In this context, I believe that we can emerge victorious if we work collectively towards a common goal with deep commitment and dedication. The most valuable factor in our company is our customers. Therefore, we should all resolve to provide a better customer centric banking and financial service in the New Year to ensure total customer satisfaction”, he added.
