Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake today asked in Parliament whether the removal of delimitation committee chairman Asoka Peiris from his post as Chairman of Lanka Mineral Sands (LMS) was an act of political victimization.

He said Mr Peiris found out about his removal LMS Chairman only after he returned after testifying about the company before the committee on public enterprises.

Mr. Dissanayake said Mr Peiris was an efficient and a capable public servant who was responsible for increasing the turnover of Lanka Mineral Sands to Rs.1,250 million in 2015 from Rs.285 million in 2015. He said the person who had succeeded Mr Peiris was one facing several allegations.

He also asked whether the government had decided to privatize Lanka Mineral Sands

Industries and Trade Minister Rishad Bathiudeen in his response said he would look into the removal of Mr Peiris. The minister also confirmed that Mr Peiris has been an efficient public servant and assured that Lanka Mineral Sands would not be privatized. (Yohan Perera)
