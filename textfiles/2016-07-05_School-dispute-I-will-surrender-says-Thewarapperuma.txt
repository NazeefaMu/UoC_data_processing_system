Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma, currently being treated at a private hospital in Colombo after his suicide fiasco, said today he would surrender to the police in connection with the dispute at the Primary school in Meegahathenna.

He said this when Daily Mirror contacted him after parents of the nine students, admitted to the Meegahathenna Primary school by the Deputy Minister, were arrested by the police on charges of unlawful assembly and illegal entry to the school.

Mr. Thewarapperuma rejected these charges and said, “When I and the parents entered the school, the Police OIC was also in the vicinity. We did not enter by force.”

He said the children were admitted school with the principal’s consent.

“I hope to surrender to the police today. I will forcibly discharge myself from hospital if the doctors refuse to do so,” he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
