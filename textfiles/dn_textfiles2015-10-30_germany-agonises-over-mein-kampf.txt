Germany agonises over 'Mein Kampf'

GERMANY: With only two months to go before the copyright of Hitler's "Mein Kampf" expires, debate is raging over whether the anti-Semitic manifesto should again be published in Germany, where all reprints have been halted since the defeat of the Nazis.
Authorities in the southern Bavaria region were handed the copyright by Allied forces after World War II. For seven decades, they have refused to allow it to be republished out of respect for victims of the Nazis and to prevent incitement of hatred.
But as "Mein Kampf" -- whose title means "My Struggle" -- falls into the public domain on January 1, differences have emerged over how it should be treated in future.
Some scholars want reprints of the original text to be allowed, saying they would serve to demystify the notorious 800-page document.
Others including Jewish groups want to maintain the ban, likening reprints to opening Pandora's box.
Historians at the Institute of Contemporary History of Munich (IFZ), meanwhile, have gone for the middle-ground -- producing an annotated version of the two-volume tome to be made available in bookstores in January. - AFP
