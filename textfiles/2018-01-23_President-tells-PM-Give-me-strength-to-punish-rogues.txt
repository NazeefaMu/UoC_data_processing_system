President Maithripala Sirisena on Monday made an appeal to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asking him to give him the strength without weakening him so that he could punish the fraudsters concerned.

He reminded that there was a saying that it was better to proceed with the lions after bending the head rather than go ahead with a pack of dogs.

Addressing a United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) election meeting in the city of Kandy, the President said: “ The supporters of G.L.Peiris’ party are highlighting about the appointment of the Bond commission on election platforms. They should know that this scam had taken place not only in 2015/2016 but also from the year 2008. The Supreme Court judges have mentioned it in the Commission report. Therefore, we are carrying out a practical inquiry. I am ready to face any threat when I am going to act against corruption. I got out of the then government against the family rule and frauds that existed at that time. The people know what happened after that.”

He added that the thieves and fraudsters should be punished at any cost and that he was making a request from Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe to imprison them. In order to do so, he requested that the necessary strength be given to him. (Nalaka Sanjeewa Dahanayaka)
