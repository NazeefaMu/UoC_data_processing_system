Euphonic Yoga is a beautiful amalgamation of Yoga with Indian classical music and dance, bringing together the three performing arts on the same stage. It is a concept that vitalizes and activates the stream of energy system flowing inside the human body, otherwise known as the Chakra system. This artistic arena shows the beauty of these seven Chakras merging in with their corresponding Ragas while dance illustrates Bhava. This concept is designed specially to help people to cope up with stress. It is also a merger effort to bring the Indian culture closer to the people in the most perceivable form. 


The organisers invite all. Entrance is free.
