The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today requested President Maithripala Sirisena to launch a comprehensive, impartial, and swift investigation into the death of the Chief Incumbent of the Kotte Sri Naga Viharaya Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
Ven. Sobitha Thera who was also the convener of the National Movement for a Free and Just Society passed away at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore on November 8.
However, the GMOA said it was difficult to come to a conclusion regarding the cause of the death since several suspicious circumstances had arisen how the prelate was treated in the country before he was flown to Singapore.
“Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera had been admitted to a private hospital in Colombo when he previously fell ill. He was keeping well after he was discharged from that hospital. He was not having a critical condition earlier. But, days after he had again fallen ill and had been admitted to another private hospital.
Unexpectedly, two germs that are possible to infect within a hospital environment have been discovered in the tissues of Thera’s lungs during investigations carried out by Asiri Hospitals Laboratory,” Dr. Naveen de Soyza, the Spokesman of GMOA said.
He said though some say the prelate had passed away as his illness worsened, the GMOA was of the view that something suspicious could have happened within the system where Sobitha Thera was treated.
Dr. Soyza urged the President to appoint a committee to probe the cause of the Prelate’s death.
“The committee should find how and where the germs, that were found in Sobitha Thera’s body, infected by questioning hospital staffs,” he said.
Meanwhile, Secretary of GMOA, Dr. Nalinda Herath said they heavily condemned the Chairman of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital in Malabe Dr. Neville Fernando’s move to sue the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Council Professor Carlo Fonseka, who recently made a statement to the media with regard to the late Sobitha Thera.
“Without trying to intimidate the persons who openly talk about the suspiciousness of the prelate’s death by suing them, they should also call the government to launch a thorough investigation in to the matter so that those who are responsible for the incident could be found,” Dr. Herath said.
He added that the civil organisations that worked with the late Sobitha Thera should raise their voice regarding this.
“The so-called civil organisations had been performing before the media when an issue with a governmental hospital was found, but now they are keeping silent,” Dr. Herath added. (Piyumi Fonseka)
