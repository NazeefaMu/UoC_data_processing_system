The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today it had allowed its district level branches to decide whether they need to extend Monday's token strike originally planed for four hours to 24 hours.

GMOA Additional Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that several district level branches were keen to extend the token strike to 24 hours.

“Our district level branches have requested us to extend this scheduled trade union action for 24 hours considering the prevailing situation. Therefore we have allowed them to decide on the duration of the token strike,” he said.

Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA's district level branches in the North Western Province had confirmed they would carry out the token strike to 24 hours.

“However, emergency treatment will be carried out without interruption during the token strike,” he said.

The GMOA had earlier warned it would resort to a countrywide token strike on Monday from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon over several demands including Wednesday's tear gassing of protesting university students. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
