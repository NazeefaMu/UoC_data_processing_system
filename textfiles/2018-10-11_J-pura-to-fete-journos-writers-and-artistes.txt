The University of Sri Jayewardenapura is slated to felicitate the journalists, writers and artistes among its alumni who have excelled in their respective fields at a gala awards ceremony to be held on October 17 at Waters Edge, commencing at 6pm. President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to grace the occasion as the chief guest.   

Some forty members of the university alumni are scheduled to receive awards at this event titled ‘Kalakara Abhinandana’. It is the third in an annual series.   

The University of Sri Jayewardenepura has a long history dating back to 1873 when the Vidyodaya Pirivena was established by the scholarly monk Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. It was established as a centre for learning.

In 1956, following the policy of promoting national languages and culture, it was decided to establish two new universities by conferring university status on the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara Pirivenas. Accordingly, the Vidyodaya University and Vidyalankara University Act No. 45 of 1958 established the universities at the Vidyodyaya Pirivena at Maligakanda and the Vidyalankara Pirivena at Kelaniya. Vidyodaya was thus reconstituted as the Vidyodaya University of Ceylon.   

Professor in Business Economics Sampath Amaratunge serves as the incumbent Vice Chancellor of the university.
