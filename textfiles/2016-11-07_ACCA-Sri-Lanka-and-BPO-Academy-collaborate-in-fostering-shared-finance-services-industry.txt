GBS environment.

Therefore, the ultimate aim of this partnership is to develop the accountancy and finance profession in the GBS sector in the country. With many  multinational and local companies establishing their GBS operations here and  with over 200,000 new jobs slated to be available in the sector by 2022, there is no better time for our young talents to build a successful and rewarding career in Sri Lanka’ s 
GBS industry”.

We look forward to working together with ACCA on the key initiatives identified in our partnership agreement and to utilize this strategic collaboration to ensure Sri Lanka’s feasibility and readiness to cater to an increased range of financial services under the GBS industry, and further solidify our position within the top most globally preferred locations for GBS.”
