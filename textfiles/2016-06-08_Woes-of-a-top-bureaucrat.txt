Woes of a top bureaucrat


	



 

A head of an institution responsible for raking in much revenue for the exchequer recently met a second rung political authority of the Ministry that directly supervises his institution at the Ministry premises itself.  Being old friends, they had a heart-to-heart after small talk.  The white collar bigwig who was in a highly depressed state of mind, decided to pour out his troubles to the political authority.  “Sir, you know that I functioned as the head of a number of departments,” he began. “Yes, I know what is your present problem?” the political authority queried.

 


“It’s not a case of having one single problem,” replied the white collar one. “I am confronted with an array of problems… What I am going to confide in you is something I haven’t even told my wife… If I am to carry out instructions coming from this Ministry any further, I may end up in Welikada sooner or later!”


The white collar one continued: “I get no order in writing. Some woman of dubious status would call me and ask me to do this and that and she would warn me that I may have to do my accounting to those above if I fail to comply. Believe me, Sir. All the orders I get through this woman are highly irregular…”


The political authority who was playing only a second fiddle knowing  that he was utterly helpless in the matter expressed his sympathies to the white collar friend.
