The Meteorology Department said today it was tracking a low-pressure area developing over Andaman Island, situated in the east of Sri Lanka which was likely to turn into a tropical depression affecting the Eastern and Northern regions of the country next week.

The Duty Meteorologist told Daily Mirror strong winds of up to 60 kmph may be experienced though there was the possibility of less rains over Sri Lanka.

The Met. Department said the atmospheric disturbances which develop into a low pressure area may later develop into a depression, a severe depression, a cyclone and later a severe cyclone.

Duty Meteorologist said the Department would be in a position to provide more information during the next few days.

Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society’s Disaster Management Centre said it too was tracking a possible storm that might impact the Eastern and Northern regions of Sri Lanka next week.

“Weather modules predict that the system may impact Southern India and brush through the Eastern and Northern Sri Lanka accompanied heavy rains and winds. However, these modules could change the trajectory monitoring as to how the system develops,” it said in its website yesterday.

Meanwhile, the Meteorology Department confirmed that the recent tropical storm, Ockhi was moving away from the island towards the Arabian Sea and located 750 km West of Colombo. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
