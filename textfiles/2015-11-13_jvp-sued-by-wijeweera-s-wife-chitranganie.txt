The JVP was asked to be present in the Commercial High Court on November 27 to inquire into a claim made by the late Rohana Wijeweera's wife Chitrnaganie that the JVP re-printed and published seven books written by Mr. Wijeweera.
The order was issued by Commercial High Court Judge Shiran Gunaratne yesterday.
In her petition filed in the Commercial High Court Ms. Wijeweera claimed that the JVP leadership had printed seven books titled, “Apa Mara Damuwada Apa Nagana Handa Sada Nomiyanu Etha”; “Demela Eelam Aragalaya Visanduma Kumakda”; “Ath Dakeem Kkihipayak”; “ Rata Hadana Ape prathipathiya”; “Ratu Octobaraye Padama” and "Vietnam Viplavaya Araksha Karamu”. They were to be distributed during the “Il Maha Viru Samaru” festival being held yesterday.
Ms. Wijeweera claimed that the JVP leadership had taken this arbitrary decision by violating the provisions of the Intellectual Property Act and as such to issue a permanent restraining order preventing the JVP from printing and distributing these books.
