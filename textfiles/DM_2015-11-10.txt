A suggestion to site his office where his heart is
	
This purohita is well known for his love for the environment and his great reverence for the ancient Buddhist shrines and devalayas. He is said to be spending more of his time visiting such sacred places than at public functions. He has also claimed that he had occasion to sight even devatas (deities) at some sacred places during his visits.
When the highest council of Yahapalanya met the other day, this purohita complained that he had yet to find a suitable place to open his office.
Then a high yahapalanaya authority told him that he could suggest an ideal place for him to set up his office.
Where the purohita eagerly asked the bigwig.
Either at Somawatiya or at Kebilitta Devalaya, replied the bigwig.
The purohita looked down bashfully as ripples of amusement passed through other purohitas.

AFC Microfinance celebrates 2nd year anniversary
	
		 		 
		 
			
Founded back in 1956, Alliance Finance Co PLC (AFC) has proved itself by establishing and maintaining an ethical business model for over five decades.
Guided by its prudent financial management through the triple bottom line principles, AFC stands tall and prominent in the finance industry making a significant contribution to the industry and the country.
When founding its newest Strategic Business Unit (SBU), AFC Micro Finance in 2013, its head Andrew Samuel had a challenge in his hands to rewrite the concept of micro finance, with the essence of humanity. Two years down the line, AFC Micro Finance has indeed changed the lives of the people it touches, most of whom are mainly very low or no income earners, by providing them with sustainable livelihoods, setting a benchmark in the microfinance industry.
Like protecting a seed which one plants, until it is fully grown into a strong tree, the pioneering initiative of AFC Micro Finance in the entire industry of micro financing ensures that it not only provides credit to an otherwise ignored part of society who are not considered credit worthy by a majority of financial institutions in the banking and non-banking sectors, it also ensures that the credit provided to them is used for sustainable growth and financial independence through its tailor-made entrepreneur development services (EDS).
Having come a long way from its inception, AFC Micro Finance boasts of a portfolio of over Rs.1.5 billion with over 46 branches located islandwide serving over 80,000 customers across 25 districts. From North to the South to East to the West the SBU, which is safely protected under the AFC umbrella, is geared to serve its people in any part of the country, including the war-torn North and East. Armed with a talented lot of individuals, who are mostly bilingual and speaking to the hearts and minds of the people they serve, is not a challenge for them.
The SBU now offers its valued customers eight different Micro products tailored to fit their needs. While Micro group-based loan scheme, Advanced Micro Finance loan product, SME loan, Micro leasing ,Micro personal loan, Micro pawning and Plantation loans and institutional loans consist of the eight products offered by AFC Micro Finance at present, the team continuously work on studying the market to further develop their products or tailor make new ones for their valued clientele.
While congratulating the Head of Micro Finance and his team for an excellent performance-driven two years, Deputy Chairman and Managing Director Romani De Silva stated, AFC Micro Finance has set the benchmark for the microfinance industry.
He further stated that he takes pride in the fact that AFC Micro Finance serves the underserved and strengthens the weak thus uplifting the dreariest parts of the community and contributing positively to the countrys development.
Alliance Finance Micro Finance Head and Chief Continuous Improvement Officer Andrew Samuel stated that he was indeed blessed to have the best of Micro Finance staff, with whom making the waves they had in this short time span of two years was possible.
He stated that his wish was to see the microfinance industry grow into one that was driven with humanity with a genuine want to serve the people. He stated that he was humbly proud of the fact that AFC Micro Finance within this short two-year timespan has proved that it is possible to do business with the heart and still earn dividends that can be justified on a balance sheet.

Video: Aung San Suu Kyi on track for landslide victory
	
Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi has told the BBC she believes her party has won a parliamentary majority, in her first interview since the historic elections.
Early results point to a sweeping victory for her National League for Democracy (NLD), but final official results will not be known for days. The election was seen as the most democratic in Myanmar for 25 years.
In an interview with the BBC's Fergal Keane, Ms Suu Kyi said the polls were not fair but "largely free".
She said there had been "areas of intimidation".
A quarter of Myanmar's 664 parliamentary seats are set aside for the army, and for the NLD to have the winning majority it will need at least two-thirds of the contested seats.
But Ms. Suu Kyi told the BBC that her party has surpassed that, and has won around 75%.
The military-backed Union Solidarity Development Party (USDP) has been in power in Myanmar since 2011 when the country began its transition from decades of military rule to a civilian government.

	Parking meters would be fixed along the Duplication and Galle Roads and all by-roads connecting the two main roads, the Colombo Municipality said yesterday.
	Tender for the pilot project had been awarded to a private company, which would conduct the project for the first time in Sri Lanka.
	Director (Traffics) Nihal Wickremaratne said the project, which was to install 125 parking meters along both roads was scheduled to begin in January.
	It will take about six months for the project to be completed. Funds would be collected manually for several months before we rely completely on the meters, he said.
	Currently, the Municipality has employed a number of attendants to collect funds at parking areas in the city.
	The new system would have facilities for motorists to pay by cash, card or other payment systems.
	Forty percent of the income would be given to the Municipality, while the company would take the 60 percent, he said.
	New charges for parking nor the total cost of the project had not been determined as yet, Wickremaratne said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

The process for releasing 30 ex-LTTEers detained in prisons countrywide will begin tomorrow, the Prisons Department said today.
Prisons Commissioner General Rohana Pushpakumara said the Attorney Generals Department had given the green light last week to release 30 of the 168 ex-LTTEers detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).
He said the AG is yet to submit the names of those to be released under this procedure.
Those detained for minor crimes will be released first, Mr. Pushpakumara said.
The detainees had begun another hunger strike recently demanding that they be release. Prisons officials said it was still continuing.
The ex-LTTE detainees launched a hunger strike at several prisons on October 12 and it was called off after an assurance given by the President to set up a mechanism to look into their demands.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

He is about to get his just deserts
	
This former Ministerial one from the South who made it to Diyawanna from the West was once a law unto himself. Taking undue advantage of his close ties to the former strongman, this politico used to abuse his powers with callous disdain for the law as well as for the social norms and values.
However, once his Boss fell from power, he turned against him.
The politico did not stop at vilifying his former mentor, but also threatened to take him to courts.
The intimates of the former strongman who had ignored the hostile conduct of this character have now decided to take tit-for-tat action against him, which they think would shut his big mouth for good.
These intimates of the former strongman have now begun collecting information about the wealth he had amassed while holding high office. Meanwhile, a member of a local body in the Kelaniya area has come to their help by providing them with documentary evidence relating to business ventures, large estates, buildings, lands and other property acquired by the politico with his ill-gotten lucre.
So filing a case against the politico with the authorities tasked with probing bribery and corruption is just a matter of course, they say.

The government member replied: Its no mistake. When that member (he mentions a name) was raised to purohita status, they had to find an extra seat on the government side. And they asked me to sit on the opposition side unofficially for a while to facilitate the new seating arrangement 
This is a hell of a change, a kind I have never heard of during my political career! exclaimed the opposition member.

Is navel the education sectors main concern: CTU
	
The Ceylon Teachers Union today lashed out at Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya over a statement he is alleged to have made that he would be issuing a dress code for lady teachers making it mandatory to wear their sarees above the navel.
According to the chief ministers statement which was carried by the media, schoolgirls will not be allowed to wear their dancing costumes below the navel.
Scoffing at the CMs statement, CTU President Joseph Stalin told Daily Mirror that it was up to the lady teachers to decide how to wear their sarees and not for the Chief Minister to dictate how it should be done.
We condemn this statement. It is an anachronistic proposal. We see nothing wrong with teachers wearing sarees below the belly button. It may be that there is something wrong with Mr. Devapriyas eye sight. We like to ask the Chief Minister whether the belly button is the main concern facing the education sector in the Western Province, he said.
Meanwhile, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said his ministry was not taking any decision on this matter because there was no valid reason to lay down rules or regulations on how teachers should wear their sarees.
He said it was the responsibility of lady teachers to wear their clothes in a manner which was not an insult or a slur on their profession. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Ms. Eknaligoda said the UN official asked her not to reveal anything to the media because there would be a public event about that.
The UN officials do not like me to reveal what was discussed or happened today. They said that they wanted to safeguard the visiting team. What we did was to tell them our grievances. They have got an opportunity to visit Sri Lanka since 1999. We should help them to carry out their duties, she said.
Ms. Eknaligoda said if she revealed the outcome of the meeting, she would find it difficult to work with them.
She said she had few issues with regard to her husbands case including that of private lawyers representing the army even though the Attorney General claimed that the army did not disturb the case.

It took several weeks for a senior Ministerial one hailing from Wayamba to find suitable space for his office. Once comfortably installed in office, he found to his annoyance that there were no chairs made available for his visitors. He sent for his Ministry secretary and asked him to see that at least four chairs were placed opposite his table for his visitors. And he was taken aback by the reply given by his secretary: Sir, I can of course, make the chairs available for your visitors. But it may take at least two to three months!
Nonsense! Unbelievable! Why do you want two to three months to supply four chairs!  An angry Ministerial one queried.
Excuse me, Sir, Ill explain, replied the secretary. We dont have extra chairs. So we have to purchase them. We have to follow the usual tender procedure in this regard. Calling for tenders and selecting the one quoting the lowest price take time
Utter nonsense! shouted the Ministerial one. What by tender procedure to buy four chairs!
Sir, you ought to be aware that a number of public officials who had to carry out orders from higher authorities without observing the stipulated procedures had to face Police inquiries or charges in courts. So, Sir, whatever we do should conform to rules and regulations. I am a poor man. I dont want to get into hot water and lose my old-age pension. Please dont misunderstand me the official was trying to explain his plight.
You do any damn thing you want, was the Ministers curt rejoinder.
The high official has already taken action to call for quotations for the purchase of four chairs, they say.

Pan Asia Bank positions as most understanding bank in Sri Lanka
	
Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, building on its forte of understanding the customers financial requirements better, recently launched its corporate campaign positioning the bank as The Most Understanding Bank in the country.
The corporate campaign could not have come at a better time as the bank celebrates 20 years of excellence in banking and also achieved many a milestones by recording over Rs.750 million post-tax profit and surpassed a key milestone, Rs.100 billion asset base by the end of the first nine months of 2015. 
At this crucial juncture, the banks Director/CEO Dimantha Seneviratne sat for an interview to explain the rationale behind the new corporate campaign, the phenomenal growth the bank saw during the recent past and his plans for the future.
As an experienced banker, Seneviratne also offered his insights on the areas that will drive the future of banking in Sri Lanka while adding a word of caution on potential risks the industry might encounter.    
    
Here are the excerpts.     Why did you think of positioning Pan Asia Bank as the The Most Understanding Bank
Throughout the past, Pan Asia Bank has been known in the market for our one-of-a kind-product range as we have continuously been at the forefront of innovation. This was possible because we have been very close to our customers and our ability to understand their needs. 
There could be many players in the market who serve a mass market but attending to each and every customer and consistently delivering a personalized service is critical.  
We, at Pan Asia Bank, can understand our customers better because our staff goes the extra mile to understand each customers specific requirement. In addition, as a dynamic bank, we have always been offering a speedy and a personalized service which has been a forte of ours.
This is why we thought of positioning our bank as The Most Understanding Bank, because we have been successful in identifying customer requirements and meeting them with innovative products and faster service consistently. So what we have done is effectively bringing the focus on to a brand promise which we are quite capable of delivering.
Promising is easy but delivery is challenging. How confident are you that the bank will be able to deliver its brand promise on a sustainable basis Does it not require many ingredients such as leadership, people, culture and technology
If you look at our technological advancements made this year, during the first quarter this year, we migrated to a sophisticated core-banking system. This was followed by the treasury system implemented in the second quarter. So, technologically we are now well placed to deliver enhanced service to our customers and our staff is now more familiar with the new system capabilities. Besides, we are working on relaunching a state-of-the-art Internet banking solution very soon for our retail, corporate and private banking clientele. 
Second, we have a young and dynamic staff force, which is being continuously trained to deliver a superior service to customers. For example, the entire staff of the bank, including customer servicing as well as support services, is now undergoing a comprehensive service quality training which helps us inculcate the customer-driven culture at all levels in the bank.
In line with that, we also started a train-the-trainer campaign where we train 100 internal trainers who will in turn bridge service quality gaps identified through customer surveys carried out on an ongoing basis. 
Furthermore, in a bid to create a value-driven culture, earlier this year, we took steps to introduce six core values, which are now inbuilt into the corporate DNA of the bank.
Simultaneously, our product portfolio has also taken a reshaping and there are a number of innovative products in the pipeline that will be launched in the near future. Apart from that, we will have a customized solution for every financial requirement of the customer.
As such, we are very confident of being able to deliver our brand promise on a sustainable basis.Do you think that the rural masses are aware of Pan Asia Bank and do you think this corporate campaign will enable you to take Pan Asia Bank to rural areas of Sri Lanka
Our main focus is on uplifting the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector and getting into the micro sector, which is scattered across the country. Our brand campaign targets all these people and is strong enough to reinforce Pan Asia Bank in the minds of all these people.
These customers need a financial partner who would stay with them irrespective of their ups and downs and a partner who can understand their pulse better. So, I am sure this corporate campaign reinforces the role we have played in holding their hands at the entrepreneurial stage till the time they grow into larger enterprises and conglomerates.
SMEs consist of 60 percent of our economy and 70 percent of our exports, and a vast majority of these enterprises are operating from outside the Western Province. This is why we have taken steps to strengthen our regional network. We are currently operating within seven major regions which cover the entire country.
If you look at our recent financial performance, the growth has come from all these regions and through this campaign we will continue to take Pan Asia Bank to these regions as we strongly believe in financial inclusion.
For instance, our groundbreaking product, Sammana has already reached all corners of the country and as a result, we command a leading market share in the pensioners loans market. Besides, our educational loan portfolio has grown mainly from the demand for such loans from other regions.Interestingly, your branding campaign coincides with the banks 20th anniversary. How do you plan to celebrate this landmark 
We plan to commemorate our 20 years in business, along with the communities that we serve. 
As part of our corporate social responsibility initiatives, we have already built a water purification plant in Thantirimale, a village located in Mahavilachchiya Divisional Secretariat in Anuradhapura, which has been severely affected by a chronic kidney disease due to lack of pure drinking water.
This initiative, we believe, will provide a lasting solution to the drinking water problems faced by the people in the area. Apart from this, our staff has contributed in many ways to uplift facilities in the village school which will be handed over to them soon.
Back home, we performed religious functions under all four major religions during the last week in October to commemorate 20 years of banking excellence and to bless our institution, past and present staff to achieve many more decades of success.
Besides, we also felicitated our long-serving staff members and recognized their contribution for the progress of the bank.Pan Asia Bank has also achieved a significant improvement in financial performance in the recent past. What are your reflections on this quantum leap in performance and how did you achieve it
We achieved a phenomenal growth in our balance sheet, particularly during the last 18 months, which expanded by as much as Rs.37 billion to cross Rs.100 billion key milestone.
Growth in our assets during the first nine months of 2015 alone is Rs.23.5 billion and if you put this in to perspective, this is a fivefold growth in just six years as the banks asset base by the end of FY 2009 was just under Rs.22 billion
Our first nine months after tax profit increased by 171 percent year-on-year to a record Rs.751 million.
This growth is sustainable and coming from all fronts and is coupled with improvements in other key performance indicators such as reduction in NPAs, improvement to cost income ratio and the improvement in ROE to around 20 percent.
Reflecting on how we did it - it all boils down to maximizing the existing resources. If you really look at it, we did not blindly invest in physical infrastructure such as branches; instead we took drastic measures to control unnecessary costs, consolidate on our investments already made, manage our asset portfolio in a better way and drive our deposit and asset growth, to name a few measures.
All our successes were driven by our people. We identified the hidden talents in our staff and took measures to increase their engagement and made them believe in themselves. Also, through skills identification, we placed the right people in the right places which enabled us to drive this growth. The bank continuously invests in staff training and development.
Hence, I am certain we can deliver far better results in the times to come and enable the bank to sustain this performance. 
Besides, our growth came from all sectors  retail, SME, corporate, treasury, trading, leasing and cards. Despite the above industry average growth in our loan book, we never compromised on our asset quality and we improved our asset quality as our gross and net non-performing loan ratios declined to 5.36 percent and 3.64 percent, respectively from 5.73 percent and 3.78 percent in December 2014. 
So, I attribute this performance to team effort and the direction the bank received from the board of directors. 
Looking at the economic landscape of the country, as a veteran banker, from where do you see the growth for the banking sector would come from going forward 
Going forward, the growth would mainly stem from the various sectors in the economy, mainly the export-related industries, tourism, logistics and IT/BPO as these sectors have been identified as the thrust sectors.
With the resumption of the GSP+, there will be renewed growth in our garment and textile industry and the related supply chain industries. Further, there are new bilateral trade pacts also in the offing and trade will be a key force driving the economy.
Export-led growth model has now become the top most national economic priority and therefore I believe the financial services sector will have opportunities to channel funds into these areas.
Apart from that, due to the renewed focus by the Central Bank on uplifting of the regional economies and improved road infrastructure, the growth will be spread across all provinces. Our regional managers have already taken steps to liaise with these regional centres of the Central Bank to identify and fund the needy sectors of the economy.
Further, the growth will also come from the emerging upper middle income class and the aspirational society that will require financial solutions to meet their growing investment and consumption needs.        
What kind of challenges do you foresee for the industry  
The recent free floating of the rupee, I believe, is a move in the right direction as it allows the demand and supply forces to determine the exchange rate. This provides opportunities for banks to manage our positions in a more rational way. At the same time, an error could prove to be costly; hence proper controls and risk management are required.
The thriving industries provide lucrative opportunities for banks to grow their lending book. However, we need to ensure that proper controls such as industry exposure limits and proper credit evaluation processes are in place to prevent an over exposure and consequent losses. 
An example is the current housing market. Financial institutions need to take a cautious approach in financing these projects and assess the risks involved, whilst there are ample opportunities in the offering.
Secondly, we also observe over lending to certain segments  particularly to microfinancing in some areas of the country which might lead to overheating as we have seen one household borrowing from several financial institutions. And to make the matters worse, these funds, which are intended for self-employment, can be utilized for consumption, leading to possible defaults.
Credit cards are an attractive source of credit for many customers and provide good offers and deals for customers. However, banks need to be responsible in their lending. At Pan Asia Bank, we charge only 19.75 percent on the outstanding balance on credit cards and facilitate balance transfers at rates as low as 15.75 percent which are among the lowest in the industry. 
We encourage customers to make use of this low rate of interest, invest responsibly and manage their finances better. Finally, what plans do you have for Pan Asia and where do you want to see your bank in five years
With all fundamentals now remaining strong, we will continue this growth momentum with much vigour playing a significant role in the financial services sector and the national economy.

Provincial head on war path takes on world organization
	
This Chief Ministerial one who once held a high position requiring poise, dignity and decorum has now turned a veritable rebel.
Of late, he has been making news by being at loggerheads not only with government authorities, but also with the leaders of his own political party. 
The latest row he has kicked up is with the authorities of the biggest world organization. The reason for the Chief Ministerial ones anger at the world organization, according to informed ones, is that they had turned down a request by him to appoint a close relative of his to a high executive position in the organization.
The Chief Ministerial one is said to have poured out his wrath on the representatives of the world body resident in the city and the latter had complained about it to the headquarters in New York. And the authorities there have reacted by sending a hard hitting missive to the Chief Ministerial one, they say.

Sampath e-Remittance facilitates expat workforces
	
Every year, a significant number of Sri Lankans migrate to foreign countries for employment, searching for better opportunities to build a better future for their loved ones. Many of these, employed in the Middle East, attend to the needs of their loved ones at home from the country of their employment, making sure that their hard work pays off well with a brighter future. In consequence, this expatriate workforce has been a great contributor to the economy of Sri Lanka with an estimated 1.7 million Sri Lankans employed abroad bringing in approximately US $ 7 billion a year. 
Sampath Remittances Senior Manager Kusal De Silva said, As a national bank, it is our bounden duty to give back to the expatriate workforces who not only strive effortlessly to be the breadwinner of the family but also greatly contribute to the economic welfare of Sri Lanka. Many of these individuals who migrate to foreign countries looking for financial stability often come from the blue collar category and are constantly faced with various challenges in trying to help their families live a better life. As such, Sampath e-Remittance was set up.
Sampath e-Remittance is a secure and instant online money transfer platform that enables the expat workforce to remit money to their families via Sampath Bank. This facility provides beneficiaries with the convenience of receiving money either over the counter with the submission of a PIN number sent to their mobile or by simply having the money credited into their Sampath account. In addition, Sampath e-Remittance has also introduced a unique service known as Mobile Cash, which enables beneficiaries to receive money with the simple process of entering their ID number and PIN number via Sampath ATM network.
Speaking on the concept of being more than just a bank, De Silva emphasized on the teams wholehearted dedication to ensure that the expat workforce and their families receive utmost welfare. He added on to say, Sampath e-Remittance officers work under a genuine and unscripted policy of not turning down any customer as they are dedicated to being all about the people. The team aspires to understand customers and provide them with utmost assistance, solutions and advice to further ease their difficulties and take them a step closer to achieving their goals and dreams in life.
Sampath Bank has constantly brought about offers that have provided customers with premium benefits and rewards. As such, Sampath e-Remittance launched a unique and successful promotion known as Sampath Cash Wasi, which is open to the expat workforces who use the Sampath e-Remittance facility. The significance of this promotion is that one lucky customer stands a chance of winning a grand cash prize of Rs.1 million while three other lucky winners will also be rewarded with a cash prize of Rs.100,000 each upon the completion of a grand raffle draw. Additionally, customers also stand a chance in winning prizes, which include household items such as televisions, Home Theatre Systems, washing machines, Hi-Fi Stereo Systems and refrigerators. 
Cash Wasi provides customers a good opportunity to win valuable cash prizes and electrical and household items. Cash Wasi saw tremendous success in the last two years that it brought about a doubled customer base. As a result, we decided to conduct the grand promotion for the third time this year. Winning these cash prizes is considered a great deal for expat workforce as this large sum of money can provide them with the much-needed lead to achieve some of their objectives for going abroad for employment, said Kusal.
Sampath e-Remittance has not only enriched the lives of its customers through innovative banking facilities, but has also successfully carried out initiatives to teach and educate customers on various methods that would help them save money in a sustainable manner as well as make financially-related decisions efficiently.
These initiatives together with Sampath Banks unwavering efforts to provide premium services and facilities coupled with innovative technology strongly justify De Silvas concluding statement - We are all about the people. We are all about the community. We understand their aspirations and problems. Therefore, we are dedicated to bearing the responsibility of taking care of our customers who greatly contribute to the country and deserve a prosperous future.

Video: Govt. should be headed by one leader: MR
	
	Former President Mahinda Rajapakse today said a government should be headed by one leader not by two leaders. Two leaders trying to administer one government was similar to using an ox and a buffalo to plough one field, he said.
	This will never work out. There was a similar incident during the state ploughing ceremony in Polonnaruwa recently, the former President said.
	Commenting on the affairs of the current government, Mr. Rajapakse said President Maithripala Sirisena should control the government completely or hand it over to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and join the opposition. 
	The former President made these comments when he visited the Hittetiya Rajamaha Vihara in Matara to pay his last respects to late Chief Incumbent of the temple Ven. Godagama Kirthisri Ariyajothi Chulalankara Thera. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

SL disconcerted over state of affairs in Maldives
	
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in a statement on the recent developments in the Maldives - of which some have impacted Sri Lanka  has expressed deep concern over Sri Lankan soil being used to initiate questionable action against political and social media activists.
Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about recent developments in the Maldives and events that have impacted on Sri Lanka, including the recent arrest of two Sri Lankan nationals in the Maldives, the questionable removal of a Maldivian social media activist who was in possession of a valid Sri Lankan visa, the stabbing of a Maldivian national in Sri Lanka, as well as the state of emergency that has been declared in the Maldives and the impeachment of the Vice-President, the statement issued by the MFA notes.
In the statement, the government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) has also expressed concern over the State of Emergency declared in the Maldives and its impacts on the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution of the Maldives. While urging the Government of the Maldives to uphold the commitments it has made GoSL has emphasized the importance for the Government of Maldives to recognize that dissent it an integral part to the effective functioning of a democracy.
It is in this context that the Government finds it deeply disturbing that Sri Lanka, a country which has always maintained the closest friendly relations with the Maldives is being used to initiate questionable action against political and social media activists, the MFA statement reads.
Furthermore, the GoSL has encouraged the Government of the Maldives to ensure that recent developments are not allowed to escalate into a source of regional instability.
Having endured similar challenges in its recent past, the new Sri Lankan Government is committed to the principles of democracy, good governance and the rule of law. . . Unlike the previous regime in Sri Lanka which silenced dissenting voices in the guise of fighting terrorism, the new administration is committed to the fundamentals of democracy, the statement reads while adding Sri Lanka hopes Maldives would take steps to end the state of emergency, initiate measures to respect and protect freedom of expression and ensure that recent developments will not reverse Maldives' hard-won democratic achievement.

SL ranked 8th in World Giving Index
	
Sri Lanka has moved up a notch and ranked at eighth place in the 2015 World Giving Index (WGI), the UK based Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) reports.
The index which looks at charitable behaviours of 145 countries including the tendency of helping strangers, donating money and volunteering was compiled by the CAF. Sri Lanka was ranked ninth last year.
Myanmar has been ranked first in the index followed by the US, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the UK. According to WGI, Burundi is the least charitable country followed by China, Yemen and Lithuania.
Sri Lanka has scored 60 percent in the sub category of helping a stranger and 48 per cent at volunteering time.
India has ranked 106th, Pakistan at 94th, Afghanistan at 84th, Nepal at 76th, Bhutan at 17th and Bangladesh at 95th places at the index.
Several notable findings of this years index include a rising trend in donating money and helping a stranger while volunteering has recorded a minor downturn. For the first time in six years, the World Giving Index has revealed that men are more likely to donate money than women.
Behaviour in a few very large countries has significantly impacted the numbers of people giving worldwide. Cultural and religious practices as well as disruptive events, are at the root of a number of big changes seen this year. Despite their highly developed economies, only five G20 countries are in this years Top 20, reminding us that economic prosperity does not automatically lead to a rise in generosity, the index report said.

SL sniper hired to kill President: Maldivian Police
	
	The 27-year-old Sri Lankan who was arrested on charges of conspiring to assassinate President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom with firearms was hired by some Maldivians to execute the operation, the Maldivian Police said in a statement.
	Investigations into the arrest are still ongoing under the surveillance of the Maldives Police Service in close collaboration with the Sri Lankan Police Force.
	In a raid carried out last week, the Maldivian Police and the Maldivian National Defence Force had uncovered a large hoard of explosives and weapons including automatic weapons concealed underwater off an uninhabited island in the Maldives.
	An AK T56 rifle with 126 bullets, a MP5 submachine with 43 bullets, two hand grenades, improvised explosive devices void of an initiation system, a sniper riflescope and primers were discovered during the raid in addition to a number of other weapons.
	The Maldivian High Commission in a recent statement said the Maldivian Ahmed Ashraf was declared a wanted person by the Maldivian Police and was arrested by the Sri Lankan Police on a request made to them by the Maldivian Government.
	The Maldivian was arrested and deported to the Maldives by the Sri Lanka authorities on November 2. It was also revealed that the suspect was not in possession of valid travel documents at the time the arrest had taken place.
	The Maldivian High Commission said as law enforcement agencies, the Maldivian Police and the Sri Lankan Police have maintained an excellent relationship with mutual understanding that is beneficial to both countries.
	It said the Memorandum of Understanding that was signed on January 22, 2014 between the Sri Lankan Police Force and the Maldivian Police Service had fostered and streamlined better cooperation between both countries, especially in areas of law enforcement which includes the arrests made on individuals suspected of terrorism offences.
	Sri Lanka suffered from the menace of terrorism for nearly three decades, and during that time, one frustration was that many countries harboured fugitives who had links with terrorist activities in Sri Lanka. The Maldives has always extended maximum cooperation to the Sri Lankan Government in apprehending individuals suspected of involvement in, or have links to, terrorist activities in Sri Lanka, the High Commission said.

Port City: Arjuna calls for report from Megapolis Ministry
	
The Ministry of Ports and Shipping has requested a feasibility study to determine the effects of the Port City on the Colombo Port.
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranatunga said they had requested the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development for the report as the project came under their purview.
Sand used during the initial stages of construction to reclaim the sea had washed into the port jetty after the project was halted earlier this year.
There is a possibility the sand would obstruct the shipping and the functions of the jetty would be disrupted as well, he said.
Ranatunga said the study would be completed in two weeks and said that they hoped to make a decision regarding the project soon.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) sources said the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report had been given to the Committee headed by the Prime Minister, which in turn had handed over the project to the Coast Conservation Department for further perusal.
The report would also be provided to other government institutions to look into technical issues.
However, the source said that they had not been informed of a feasibility report on the project.
The source said the Chinese company had been given permission to clear the sand blocking in the Beira Lake and protect the existing structure.
There has not been any construction since the project was halted in March this year. Close to 5,000 individuals have lost their jobs due to the project being halted, the source said. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

What he did, not cricket!
	
A wealthy city businessman recently threw a gala dinner party to promote a friend eyeing the highest chair of the body controlling the gentlemens game. The businessman who hosted the party himself had at one time occupied this coveted chair.
A number of officials from the countrywide clubs of the game had attended this party. The chair-hopeful hailing from a family with close ties to the game too had functioned for a long time as a key official of the controlling body, but was summarily removed some time ago.
They all hit the bottle and their spirits were soaring. Even the host was seen being quite liberal with the bottle. The aspirant to the chair of the national game thought it was apt time for him to take the floor.
Addressing the well-wishers present he waxed eloquent about his merits for the big job he was eyeing. And no sooner had he sat down, up on his feet was the businessman who was playing the host. It was obvious this worthy had taken a gulp too many.
Despite being unsteady on his feet, the host-businessman spoke in a steady tone: I must say that certain things my friend said are utter falsehoods.  The one aspiring to head the national body for the gentlemens game looked as if he were struck by a thunder clap.  
    
Another person in the party who got up made a bid to hold a brief for the ambitious candidate who received an unexpected beating from the host. However, the host businessman shouted him down. A commotion ensued and the party came to an abrupt end.
Meanwhile, reports say that a powerful government group is making behindthescene moves to install the son-in-law of a politician from the Gampaha area as the head of the body controlling the gentlemens game. An ex-banker, this son-in-law, they say, is a total stranger to the game.
