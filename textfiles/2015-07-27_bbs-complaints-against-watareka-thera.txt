BBS complains against Watareka Thera


	

The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Organization today complained to the police about the defamatory statement made on the National Flag by Ven. Watareka Vijitha Thera.
BBS executive director Dilantha Vithange said they had written to Police Chief N. K. Ilangakoon requesting him to arrest the monk for attempting to tarnish the country’s image.
“We urge the Police Chief to take immediate action against Vijitha Thera.  It looks like he is suffering from a distorted mentality and is attempting to acquire popularity and seems to be willing to go to any lengths, even to face imprisonment for this purpose,” he said.
Mr. Vithanage said the monk is violating the country’s Constitution and is providing support to foreign forces in order to destroy the country’s image.  
He noted that as a national organization they would accept and propose suggestions for the changes of the National Flag without distorting it.  
The Police confirmed having received a complaint from Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera and said they would investigate the matter. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda & Yoshitha Perera)
