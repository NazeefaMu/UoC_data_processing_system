May Day procession: Joint Opp. to proceed as planned


	

The joint opposition said today it would commence its May Day procession from Shalika Grounds in Narahenpita as planned despite the cancellation of the reservation of the Ground.

Joint opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardana said they had paid the due amount to Sri Lanka Transport Board to which the ground belongs and that the Police also had granted them permission to commence the procession there.

Mr. Gunawardana said some officials of the SLTB who did not know the political history had cancelled the reservation and said that those officials would have to change their decision soon.

Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP)’s Somaweera Chandrasiri said yesterday the ground was reserved on March 8 after making a payment of Rs.12, 500 to Sri Lanka Transport Board to which it belongs and that the joint opposition had decided to take legal action demanding Rs.20 million as compensation for this cancellation.
