Member of Parliament Jayampathi Wickramarathne today charged that he has been threatened with death by an anonymous caller if he fails to resign from the steering committee on Constitutional reforms.

“The caller threatened to kill me and my family members if I fail to give up the membership of the steering committee" the MP told Deputy Speaker.

“Threats cannot scare us as we are people who had been associated with the parties such as Lanka Samasamaja Party which had acted fearlessly on behalf of the country" he added.

Deputy Speaker Tilanga Sumathipala who responded said IGP will be called upon to conduct an investigation on the matter. (Yohan Perera)
