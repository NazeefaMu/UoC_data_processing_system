Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today that fabricated stories and statements made by various people had tarnished the image of MPs, Parliament and the country as a whole.

In a special statement he said the police had informed him that they had not questioned any personal security officer of any MP.

He also categorically stated that there were no lists of MPs or of any others who were alleged to have carried out any transaction with Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. owner Arjun Aloysius and as such requested the media and others to refrain from misleading the public.

“I request the media and everyone concerned not to make baseless allegations which goes into the extent of accusing respected members of civil society, accusing 118 MPs, later increasing it to 166, of having taken bribes,” the Speaker said.

He said the relevant institutions had informed him that there was no list containing names of any MPs and of others and that the police had informed him that it had not questioned any personal security officer of any MP.

“ I recall how the country went into flames after rumours were spread of potato curry containing contraceptives and like to state that today’s situation in the country is equally dangerous,” the Speaker said.

He said there was no necessity for any MP to produce affidavits to certify that they had not taken money and to make statements to the media.

The Speaker said he had asked Presidential Secretary Austin Fernando to send him all the sections of the presidential commission report and that he would do so when he returns from overseas.(Yohan Perera)
