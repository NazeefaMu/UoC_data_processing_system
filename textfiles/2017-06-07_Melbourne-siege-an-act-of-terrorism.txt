SYDNEY REUTERS June 6   
Australian police said on Tuesday they were treating a siege in Melbourne as an “act of terrorism” after a claim by Islamic State that one of its fighters was the gunman responsible.    Police on Monday killed in a shootout the man they said had held a woman hostage inside an apartment building in Melbourne. BBC reported shortly before 6pm, he appeared in the foyers of the hotel, firing shots at waiting tactical command officers heavily armed and wearing bullet-proof vests.  Three officers were struck by bullet fragments, one in the neck, while Khayre was fatally wounded during an exchange of ‘severe’ gunfire, ending the two-hour siege.   Islamic State said via its news agency, Amaq, that the attack was launched because of Australia’s membership in a U.S.-led coalition against the militant group.   


 “We are treating it as an act of terrorism,” Victoria state police Commissioner Graham Ashton told the Seven television network on Tuesday. “We believe this person was there with those sorts of intentions, albeit we don’t know whether it was something planned or something spontaneous at this stage.”
