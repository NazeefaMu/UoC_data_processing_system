Despite disruptions, the construction work of the Lotus Tower is scheduled to be completed by September 2017, the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) said yesterday.

TRCSL Director General Sunil S. Sirisena speaking to the Daily Mirror stated that the structure, when completed, would be the tallest building in South Asia.

However, the Director General pointed out that additional funds were required for the construction of the parking lot and shopping complex in the premises. He added that the mast of the tower was yet to be constructed, and the satellite cables and antennas were also to be installed.

“The Chinese government didn’t provide us with finances for such construction work, and therefore, we will have to utilize our resources,” he said.

The 350 metre tower due to be used for communication, observation and other leisure facilities, is expected to cost a total of US $ 104.3 million, sources said.(Darshana Sanjeewa and Yoshitha Perera)
