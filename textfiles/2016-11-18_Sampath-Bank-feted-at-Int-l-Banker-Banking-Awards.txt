Positioned as one of the leading private banks in Sri Lanka that outshines conventional customs of the banking industry, Sampath Bank was recently honoured for Best Innovation in Retail Banking 2016 and Best Commercial Bank of the Year Sri Lanka 2016, at the prestigious International Banker Banking Awards 2016 ceremony. 
Remarking on this recognition, Sampath Bank PLC Managing Director Nanda Fernando said, “Sampath Bank is honoured to have been recognized with two prestigious awards that acknowledge innovation and leadership in the areas of retail and commercial banking in Sri Lanka. We are continuously driven as a financial entity to focus on technological innovation which would enable us to present a convenient banking experience to our customers whilst going beyond the norms of the banking industry to continuously increase our proficiency in all capacities carried out by the bank.”
Since its inception, Sampath Bank has gained and maintained a prominent reputation for being one of the most innovative and progressive banks in Sri Lanka. Infusing new technology into various aspects of the business, Sampath Bank’s initiatives to spear-head online banking and introduce innovative banking solutions were highlighted with the Best Innovation in Retail Banking 2016 award. The award further commended Sampath bank for its initiatives and unwavering efforts to enhance customer-centricity with the use of technology-led solutions. This has in-turn enhanced the bank’s unique retail banking services, which continue to expand over an islandwide customer base. 
Similarly, Sampath Bank’s operations have continued to deliver outstanding results despite the many challenges that have been encountered. Achieving a record profit-after-tax growth and healthy return on equity for the year 2015, the Best Commercial Bank of the Year award highlights the bank’s success in financing projects that continues to trigger large-scale development in Sri Lanka, in addition to significant expansions of inward remittances, small and medium entrepreneur development and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives that have contributed to the development of the nation and the well-being of citizens.
