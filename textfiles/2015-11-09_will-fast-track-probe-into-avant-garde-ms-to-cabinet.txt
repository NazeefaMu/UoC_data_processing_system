President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are to decide within the next two days whether to pursue the Avant Garde Maritime Security Service case, it is learnt.
The President held a special Cabinet meeting to discuss this matter today after Ministers Patali Champika Ranawaka, Rajitha Senaratne and Arjuna Ranatunga called for the resignation of Law and Order Minister Tilak Marapana alleging that he was dilly dallying with the case.
Minister Marapana submitted his resignation from his portfolio this morning.
At the special Cabinet meeting, Dr. Senaratne said there was enough evidence against Avant Garde and former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
President Sirisena said he had not studied this matter in detail because it was a not subject that came under his purview but that he would discuss the new steps to be taken at a meeting with the Prime Minister and the investigating officials in the wake of the Law and Order Minister Marapana's resignation.
