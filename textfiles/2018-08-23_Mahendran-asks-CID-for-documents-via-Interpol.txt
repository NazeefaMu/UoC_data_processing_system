Senior Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara today told the court that the Central Bank's former governor Arjuna Mahendran, who is the first suspect in the magisterial inquiry into the bond scam had recently requested the CID to forward some of the documents on the investigation through Interpol.

This was revealed when Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne asked the prosecution what had happened with regard to the warrant issued on the first suspect.

SDSG Jayasundara initially said the prosecution had obtained a red notice against the suspect and was working on certain arrangements on this matter.

On being asked by the magistrate for a report on that matter without delay, the prosecution said it would make the necessary submission no sooner the process was finalised.

It said the suspect had requested for copies of the warrant and evidence against him from the CID via the Singapore Interpol.

SDSG Jayasundara informed the court that the Attorney General would look into the request and decide whether it was a legitimate demand.

When questioned by the magistrate about the whereabouts of the first suspect, SDSG Jayasundara confirmed that Arjuna Mahendran was residing in Singapore.

Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited owner Arjun Aloysius and CEO Kasun Palisena were re-remanded till August 30 on charges of aiding, abetting and conspiring with Mr. Mahendran to misappropriate Rs.688 million in public funds at the bond auction held on February 27, 2015.

They were also re-remanded till August 30 in connection with the parallel magisterial inquiry on deleting phone call data from the PTL voice recording system and fabricating evidence to the Bond Commission.

PTL's former chief dealer Nuwan Salgado and its IT executive Sachith Devathantri were earlier arrested in this connection and subsequently released on bail amid the prosecution expecting them to be named as crown witnesses in the inquiry. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
