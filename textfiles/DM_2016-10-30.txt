Australia plans to ban asylum seekers from ever visiting
	
Australia on Sunday announced plans to ratchet up its tough policy against refugees by banning any asylum seeker who attempts to reach its shores by boat from ever visiting the country.
A previous government introduced a policy on July 19, 2013, banning refugees who arrive by boat from Indonesian ports after that date from ever being resettled in Australia.
Under legislation to be introduced to Parliament next week, thousands of asylum seekers who have returned to their homelands in the Middle East, Africa and Asia would be banned for life from ever traveling to Australia as tourists, to do business or as an Australian's spouse, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said.
"You need the clearest of clear messages," Turnbull told reporters.
"This is a battle of will between the Australian people, represented by their government, and these criminal gangs of people smugglers. You should not under estimate the scale of the threat," he added.
Australia has paid the poor Pacific nations of Nauru and Papua New Guinea to keep asylum seekers in camps since the 2013 policy came into force.
The new policy would apply to all asylum seekers who have attempted to reach Australia since July 19, 2013.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said asylum seeker children would be exempt from the visa ban and he would have discretion to make exceptions for adults in cases where to do so was in the public interest.
More than 51,000 asylum seekers arrived in Australian waters by boat during the six years the former center-left Labor Party government was in power from 2007 until 2013. More than 20,000 arrived in 2013.
No boat smuggling operation has succeeded in delivering asylum seekers to Australia since July 2014 under Turnbull's conservative government. But human rights groups have accused Australia of abrogating its responsibilities to refugees as a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention.
Labor spokesman Brendan O'Conner said the opposition would have to read the legislation before deciding whether it would support it in the Senate where the government does not hold a majority of seats.
"With any legislation you want to look at it, see whether in fact it is fair and reasonable and is consistent with our own commitments internationally," O'Connor told Sky News Television.

Harsha: Ajiths suggestions not in COPE report
	
Despite all the COPE members agreed with MP Ajith P. Pereras suggestions that Perpetual Treasuries should be held responsible in the controversial Central Bank bond issue and the Police should conduct an investigation, the suggestions were not included in final COPE report, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva said today.
Speaking at a media briefing today, Dr. De Silva, who is also a member of the COPE said the suggestions were endorsed by all COPE members during the time the COPE Chairman MP Sunil Handunnetti walked out of the meeting.
The suggestions were also included in the draft of the report, he said.
The most important thing is that all members of COPE had agreed to all recommendations, he said while assuring that further action would be taken on the report.
We the UNP respect COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti, he said.
Responding to a question raised by the journalists as why Mr. Handunnetti walked out of the COPE meeting, Dr. De Silva said it was upto Mr. Handunnetti to answer that question.
I told Mr. Handunnetti to stay back but he did not heed to my request, he added.
He said the foot notes, which are included in the report of Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on the bond issue, only reflected the policy of issuing bonds and not the controversial transaction.
A section of COPE members placed their signatures to foot notes, which the report comprised while others did not agree.
Dr. De Silva said that the foot notes only denoted the methods under which bonds were issued.
These only contain as to whether the bonds were issued through Primary Dealers or directly and the percentage of both methods in the mixed policy that is followed since 2008, he said.
Further, he said there could be others who could be responsible for bond scams other than Arjuna Mahendran and Arjun Aloysius.
If you flash the torch you would be able see that there are some more, who are responsible, he said.
This, he said, could be found out if one examined the secondary market details. (Yohan Perera)

Labour will move to Hambantota: PM
	
There might be fundamental changes to economy, when the South is industrialised, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Saturday.
The Prime Minister made this remark at the Annual General Meeting of the Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association over the weekend.
When the Mattala Airport development plans get going, some may let off tea and move to other crops. Therefore there may be fundamental changes due to the industrialising of the South.
He said the government would have to look at the Tea Board, the Tea Research Institute and Tea Small Holders.
The present structure is inefficient. We have to bring the industry back into it. How do we train planters There is no college to train them, no diplomas. Tea must become an agribusiness for it to survive. Lets look at the radical changes once the budget is produced. In the short term you can expand the market but remember the long term measures should also come into focus, he said.
Going back to the topic of changes that might come up as a result of Southern Region Development he said there would be a migration of labour, especially towards Hambantota.
He said there was going to be a high competition for labour in all parts of the country.
When the Chinese and the Government implement the new public-private agreements for airport and the port, they are planning to start a large number of industrial estates on 15,000 acres.
Other types of industries will also come in as a result other than tea. We will promote high value tourism in the South. South will be connected to Mattala and the Katunayake Airports.
This means there is going to be a migration of labour. Tea smallholders and plantations will have to compete. Those who are working in the plantations may move down to Hambantota from Badulla. Smallholders may think it is better to go and work there and abandon plantations. How are you going to work with this cost factor I am going to ask you this when I summon you all, he added. .
When it comes to short term issues, especially with regard to tea industry, the Prime Minister said Sri Lanka would go into new markets.
Commodity market is down throughout the world. It is so in the case of oil. Saudi Arabia is slashing the salaries including domestic worker salaries. Chinese steel makers are driving European and Western steel makers out of business. Therefore all the commodity prices are coming down, he said.
It had also affected tea. We have other competitors whose prices have been more attractive than ours. Our focus has been in the Middle East and former Soviet Union (Russia and Ukraine). In 2002 we tried to push it more into Europe and to the other areas but it was not done.
The Russian economy is coming under pressure by the West. Ukraine is in a mess. Middle East is coming apart -be it Libya, Syria or Iraq. Our main markets have got affected. We are trying to get new markets namely, Turkey. But there was some new issues. We are talking with Iran, after the US lifted the sanctions, and with Pakistan, India and China. The population of China requires more tea. Let us try and expand where the markets are, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Six-inch wood removed from mans belly at Karapitiya
	
A six-inch piece of wood had been removed from a mans belly by the doctors at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital recently, the relatives of the patient said.
They said it was a matter of concern that the doctors in Matara Hospital, who provided treatment to the patient for about a week failed to detect the piece of wood in the patients belly, which the doctors in Karapitiya Teaching Hospital found within half-an-hour.
The patient, E.H. Dhanushka (22), sustained serious injuries when he fell on a fence and a wooden spike pierced his belly.
He had undergone treatment at the Matara hospital but he was transferred to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, when he developed complications.
Immediately after admission to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital the doctors performed urgent surgery during which a piece of the wooden spike was removed from his belly, Dhanushkas relatives said.
They said the doctors at the Matara Hospital only dressed the external injuries and when his condition did not improve, they had transferred him to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. (S. Glappatti)

SL could reach Upper Middle Income status: WB
	
If the policy reforms in the areas of fiscal operations, competitiveness and governance which the Government of Sri Lanka indicated as necessary, are successfully implemented it could help the country to reach Upper Middle Income status in the medium term, the World Bank said in a recent statement.
The World Bank said that Sri Lankas gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain flat this year compared to 2015, and will marginally improve to just above 5 percent in 2017 as more investments flow in.
Sri Lankas GDP growth to remain unchanged in 2016 and grow marginally over 5 percent in 2017 and beyond driven by public and private investment (including the resumption of postponed FDI), tourism and reduced negative impact on growth from commodity imports, it said in the report.
Sri Lankas GDP grew at 4.8 percent in 2015, amid uncertainty surrounding an election year and due to the change of the base year of calculations to 2010, slightly down from 4.9 percent growth experienced in 2014.
The World Bank said that past currency depreciations and the Value Added Tax (VAT) increase will impart upward pressure on inflation, despite lower global commodity prices.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow in 2016 with reduced imports and increased tourism, it added.
The World Bank added that to sustain growth above 5 percent, Sri Lanka needs to increase revenue collection, remove tax exemptions which benefit the rich and set up pro-poor safety nets, improve export competitiveness, and work towards refinancing debt which will mature starting from 2019.
It added that tightening global financial conditions could lead to capital outflows and make borrowing more expensive.
While the economy is unlikely to feel the direct impact of a slowdown in China and the Brexit, continued economic woes in the Middle East, the European Union and Russia could adversely affect Sri Lankan exports and remittances, the World Bank said.
