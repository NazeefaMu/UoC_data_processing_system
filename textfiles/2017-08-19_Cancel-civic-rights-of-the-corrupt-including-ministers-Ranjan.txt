President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe should work towards cancelling civic rights of all the corrupt persons including the ministers in the present government, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.

Deputy Minister Ramanayake said both president and Prime Minister should follow the example of their predecessor late Prime Minister S W R D Bandaranaike who tool a way the civic rights of some of his own ministers. “Late Prime Minister Bandaranaike took away the civic rights of several Ministers thorough Walter Talagodapitiya Commission and this government should also do the same,” he said.

“ It was only the government of Late Mr Bandaranaike which took proper action against the corrupt as none of the preceding governments including the government of Late J R Jayewardene, Premadasa, Chandrika Kumaratunga or former President Mahinda Rajapaksa take effective action on corruption,” he added.
