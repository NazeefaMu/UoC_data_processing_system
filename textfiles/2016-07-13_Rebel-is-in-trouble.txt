Top brass of a political party is busy carrying out a behind-the-scene operation to oust a chief purohita defying the edicts from the party leadership.

 


The party leadership has learnt that this chief purohita who had a sudden rise to high political office is also actively engaged in conspiracies and machinations with certain rival political parties and groupings.


The chief purohita said to be nursing leadership ambitions had fallen out with the party leader over giving prominence in the party to a young leading lawyer ever since the latter was given a Diyawanna seat through the national list. 


It is no longer a secret for the people in the North that the controversial chief purohita’s days are numbered as his political party has already groomed another legal expert as the party’s Chief ministerial candidate at the upcoming polls.
