Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara today said they would seek legal action against the organisers of cycle race events if any fatal accident occurred during the races because of backup vehicles.

SP Gunasekara said that several road accidents occur during the festive season due to the carelessness of the backup vehicles including motorcycles which travel alongside cyclists.

He requested the event organisers not to allow motorcycles to travel with cyclists in order to prevent accidents. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
