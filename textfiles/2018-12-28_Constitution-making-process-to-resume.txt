The government has decided to resume the Constitution-making process which had been at a standstill for a while as a result of the recent political crisis and prorogation of parliament.

The Parliament Steering Committee appointed to draft the new Constitution is scheduled to meet during the first parliamentary week in January. It will take up for discussion a report compiled by the experts' committee appointed to advise the Steering Committee on preparing the draft Constitution.

The Steering Committee consists of members of all the political parties in Parliament. (Kelum Bandara)
