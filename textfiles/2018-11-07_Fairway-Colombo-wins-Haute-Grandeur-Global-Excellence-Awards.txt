One of Colombo’s most favoured city hotels, Fairway Colombo was awarded the prestigious Haute Grandeur Global Excellence Awards under three categories; the Best Business Hotel in Sri Lanka, the Best New Hotel (less than 3 years) in Sri Lanka and the Best Activity Hotel in Sri Lanka. The gala award ceremony was held on 1st November at the Palazzo Versace, Dubai, UAE.

Over the past two years since inception, Fairway Colombo has evolved into being one of the most sought after business hotels, located in the center of Colombo. The ultra-high tech facilities, and reliable and efficient service have attracted business and leisure travelers alike. The hotel has also built a vibrant atmosphere in the Hospital Street, with its numerous events that are attracting large crowds of foreigners and locals alike.  

“Being awarded the Haute Grandeur Global Hotel Awards, which rewards outstanding hotel experiences, is truly a great achievement for us. From inception, we have focused on giving our guests the best of modern facilities combined with Sri Lankan hospitality so that they have a unique and memorable experience staying with us and visiting Sri Lanka. This accolade validates the fact that we are in the right path,” commented Mr Saman Perera, General Manager of Fairway Colombo.

Recognized as one of the most prestigious events on the luxury hospitality calendar, the Haute Grandeur Global Awards is an independent and unbiased initiative to honour excellent achievements in the hotel industry from a global perspective. Initiated in 2014, it recognizes exceptional contributions by outstanding hotels. The results are based on quality feedback from guests, rather than the quantity of vote. Each year, top luxury hospitality brands vie for the ultimate accolade in overall excellence. Only the best of the best is recognized for exceptional achievements and greatest contribution to the industry.

“The hospitality industry is highly competitive. Only those who constantly exceed attain prestige,” says Haute Grandeur Founder and President, Marinique de Wet. “Healthy competition is essential to inspire excellence because it ensures sustainability in the most prosperous industries – those that create jobs globally. Association with Haute Grandeur guarantees participating establishments status and distinction. We are proud to contribute to raising the standards of excellence in hospitality worldwide.”
Haute Grandeur Global Awards are recognized as a guaranteed golden stamp of excellence, with associated establishments perceived as the benchmark in the industry. By awarding only the most remarkable, Haute Grandeur inspires exceptional hotels, spas and restaurants to achieve even greater heights.
