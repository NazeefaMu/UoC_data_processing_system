Eclipses 3
A partial Solar eclipse will occur in the 3rd quarter of Aslisa constellation in the Zodiacal sign of Cancer (Makara) on Saturday August 11. 


The greatest eclipse will occur at 15.16 hours on August 11. It will be visible only from the Northernmost parts of the world. The 3rd eclipse for the year 2018, this is to come on the heels of the total Lunar eclipse that occurred on July 27/28. In fact, a Solar eclipse always occurs about two weeks before or after a Lunar eclipse; in this instance, after a Lunar eclipse.   


According to the ancient Indian Rishis it is inauspicious to start any important event in life or embark on any plan or program for that matter on the day of a Solar or Lunar eclipse and during the three days both preceding and following the day of the eclipse counting a total of seven days.


It is also the general opinion of the savants of Astrology that it is  inauspicious to commence any important event or plan during the running of either the Zodiacal sign or the constellation in which the eclipse occurs either on the day of the eclipse or within the seven days preceding or the following the day of the eclipse which add up to 15 days.
