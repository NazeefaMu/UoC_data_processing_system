Yahapalanaya? What nonsense; still a Banana republic


	



 

The Ocean University here had recently received a good number of scholarships for its students to pursue their studies in recognized universities in the world.

 


The political authority in charge of the subject had distributed these scholarships in a manner typical of a corrupt politician in a Banana republic like ours.


The political authority had offered one scholarship to his own son and a few to some white collar bigwigs at secretarial level. After distributing the scholarships in this arbitrary manner, he had told the official handling the subject: “Include my name too in the list. Because I wish to participate in the study tour which is a component of the scholarship.”


This scholarship distribution affair had leaked out to the media following a hard-hitting letter sent to the political authority by his team member at state level questioning the propriety of selecting political henchmen for scholarships which are really meant for deserving students.
