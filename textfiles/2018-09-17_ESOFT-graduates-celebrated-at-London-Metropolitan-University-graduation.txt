“Thisis one of the most significant moments of your life. Today, when you leave these premises, you go out into the world as a qualified individual with immense potential. However, as accomplished as you are academically, in today’s fast-moving world, there are other areas that you need to master in order to succeed. These are, of course, the all-important soft skills. Soft skills are qualities such as empathy, time management, creativity, communication and other similar attributes that can turn you into a well-rounded human being: the icing on the cake. I know ESOFT has already inculcated these skills in you to a great extent. I urge you to make it a point to further develop these skills as you step into the wider world of employment,” he said.
