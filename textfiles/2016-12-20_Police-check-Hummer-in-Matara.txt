Police check Hummer in Matara


	

The Matara Police today stopped an American-made Hummer Jeep said to have been driven by the son of a billionaire businessman because it had no registration number and when questioned the driver, he is reported to have produced the insurance certificate and a letter from the Department of Motor Traffic permitting the use of the vehicle.

He told the police he would ship it back to the US within three months.

Although it is a vehicle with a left-hand-drive, it had no such indication either on the front or the rear.

The vehicle was later released.(Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
