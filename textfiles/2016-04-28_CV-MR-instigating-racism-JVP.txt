The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) alleged today certain politicians in the North and South were instigating racism in the country to cover up their inefficiencies, as a shield to the rising protest against them and to suppress the burning issues.

JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva said racism in the north and south should be defeated as it was detrimental to the people in the north and the south.

“Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran is trying to instigate racism in the north by passing resolutions in the Northern Provincial Council, while former president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his group were trying to do it in the south. This does not yield any benefits to the people other than disadvantages to them,” he said.

Mr. Silva said the resolution, which proposed a federal system for the North and East would not find solutions to the issues of the Tamil people.

He said instigating racism in the past led to the 30-year war, which caused lot of damage to property and people.

He said that it was a disaster that bankrupt politicians, having failed to find solutions to peoples’ issues, were trying to seek blessings of the racism again.(Ajith Siriwardana)
