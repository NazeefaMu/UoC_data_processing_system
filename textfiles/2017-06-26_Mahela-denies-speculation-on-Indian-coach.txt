Former Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardane has denied speculation that he is looking for the role of head coach of the Indian team.

Mahela said in a twitter message that he was not looking at full-time positions right now.

“Flattered by speculation linking me to India coaching job but I am not looking at full-time positions right now. I am completely focused on current commitments with Mumbai Indians and Khulna,” he tweeted.

Jayawardene has worked as a batting consultant of the England team before he took Mumbai Indians to Indian Premier League (IPL) 10 title glory earlier this year.

This was his first season as a coach of the IPL franchise.
