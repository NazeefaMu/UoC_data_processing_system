2016 saw the birth of Oceanfront Condominiums, the brainchild of Mr. Harsha De Saram, Chairman and co-founder of International Construction Consortium (Pvt) Ltd. Upon witnessing the success of beachfront vacation condominiums in the coastal areas of Australia and Thailand, it was clear that this would soon become a very popular concept in Sri Lanka. 

Locked away for decades during the war, but now developing rapidly as undoubtedly the best beach in Sri Lanka, Nilaveli Beach was chosen for the first Oceanfront Condominiums development. 

With over 3 decades of experience constructing at the highest standards in Sri Lanka, ICC completed and handed over the 1st phase of condominiums to the owners in just 18 months. With the completion of the 2nd phase in June 2018, the 82 unit, Oceanfront Condominiums Nilaveli was proud to be the first beachfront vacation condominium to be completed in Sri Lanka. 

Oceanfront Condominiums also provides turn-key management of the customers' apartments by furnishing, advertising and renting right throughout the year. The recent east coast season saw occupancy rates exceed 90% during the peak months, exceeding all expectations and confirming the concept and the success of the project.

Building on the success of Nilaveli, ICC chose Galle, the largest city on the southern coast, and the center of beach tourism in Sri Lanka for the second development.  Enter through classically styledarchway, designed to celebrate the architecture of Galle, and step into the courtyard which features the secluded pool. Walk down to the beach or head into the apartment which features double height views of the ocean from the living rooms. International Construction Consortium brings reliability and peace of mind to your weekend getaway home.
