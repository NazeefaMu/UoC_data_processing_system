The Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed that there were no Sri Lankans among the injured in this morning's series of blasts and gunfire reported in Indonesian Capital, Jakarta.
“We have contacted local authorities in Jakarta. According to them, at the moment no reports have been received of any Sri Lankan being affected in the series of blasts. However, we will keep contacting them since it is difficult to determine nationalities of the injured as soon as such bomb blast takes place,” Foreign Ministry’s Spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said.
Foreign media reported that at least seven people had been killed including three policemen and four civilians. It said that a Dutch national and another foreigner were among the casualties. (Piyumi Fonseka)
