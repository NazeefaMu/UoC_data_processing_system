Twisting the law saw him in a twist!
	

A certain prominent member of the black-coated gentry has become a joke among his community following the discovery that he had in a recent court appearance argued hard to repudiate a certain legal proposition he himself had vindicated by quoting chapter and verse in a law book he had written.

Ripples of amusement had run through the courtroom, when another lawyer looking after the interests of a rival party to the case had quoted the very legal proposition contained in the legal experts book to substantiate the point he was making, they say.
A lawyer referring to this unusual instance quipped: Those who try to twist the law for the sake of a big fee, unwittingly twist themselves!

VIP assassination plot - IGP, CID clear SF of any involvement
	
UNP MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said today the Police and CID had cleared him from any involvement in the assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena.
He told parliament that IGP Pujith Jayasundara had informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in writing that no complaint had been lodged with the CID against MP Fonska on any involvement in a plot to assassinate the President or revealed such involvement during investigation carried out by the CID on the matter.
MP Fonseka read out the letter sent by the IGP to the Speaker and the letter sent by the Senior DIG of the CID to the IGP and requested that the two letters be tabled in parliament.
He said even though he was cleared from allegations, some media institutions with ploitical agendas were involved in slinging mud at him and requested the speaker to mediate to protect his privileges.
MP Fonseka had earlier requested the Speaker in writing that his privileges had been violated due to an allegation made by the President over an assassination plot and the Speaker had requested a report from the IGP on the matter. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Wholl be watchdog in Parliament - EDITORIAL
	

s Sri Lanka seemed to have sorted out a large share of its political crisis on December 20 (Thursday) by appointing a 29-member Cabinet, there still seems to be burning ashes under the fire caused by the political impasse with two individuals claiming that they hold the post of Opposition Leader.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by informing Parliament that he had accepted Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader gave hope to two sections of the citizenry. One is the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) whose members consider him to be a DemiGod who can achieve the unthinkable. The other section of the divide comprises those who have their thinking caps on and want to have an able politician who can play the role of watchdog in parliament. Many are of the opinion that Rajapaksa with his ever present vigil and gift of the gab would be the man to keep a check on the activities of the Government as the Leader of the Opposition.
But now Rajapaksa encounters a problem because some members of minority parties have posed the question whether the former Prime Minister is eligible to retain his parliamentary membership because he took membership of the SLPP while being a member of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. According to article 99 (13) of the Constitution a politician ceases to be an MP when he leaves a party and contests from another party. Rajapaksas critics say he did so by contesting the General Elections under the UPFA ticket. But a fact which is in Rajapaksas favour is that the UPFA is not a party and is an alliance. There are also claims that Rajapaksa never left the SLFP.
Going down memory lane to 2015 September the majority in Parliament warmly welcomed the appointment of Sampanthan as the Leader of the Opposition. At the time this appointment was made, Sampanthan was one of the most senior members of the parliament and much was expected of him. But he never rose to the stature that the post offers to whoever who posses it. For the record one time president J.R Jayewardene elevated the post of Leader of the Opposition to that of a Cabinet Minister. The opposition often opined that Sampanthan was not strong enough for the post and hardly aired his voice on matters which affected the country at large. He was mostly seen raising the issues which were of utmost importance only to the Tamil community.
Sampanthans major role in parliament as Opposition Leader came under scrutiny when he chose to vote against a no-confidence motion which was brought to remove Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe. The opposition questioned Sampanthans thinking because the stance he took then made it evident that he was trying to save Wickremesinghe. The rest of the opposition was furious and warned that they would agitate nationally and internationally for the removal of Sampanthan. The Joint Opposition wrote to the Speaker and wanted Sampanthan removed and added that if not a no-confidence motion would be brought against him. These are the memories we have of Sampanthan while he served as the Leader of the Opposition.
What has transpired now is that parliamentarians Lakshman Kirella, M.A. Sumanthiran and Rauf Hakeem have requested to have a Parliament Select Committee to inquire into the matter whether Rajapaksa still holds his parliamentary membership because there are opinions formed that he has flouted the Constitution by holding membership in two political parties.
While the battle continues whether Rajapaksa can start functioning as the Leader of the Opposition or whether Sampanthan can as his appointment affords is in a position to continue in this capacity. But there is a statement which Sampanthan made to the press regarding this issue which will stall all Sri Lankans in their tracks. Sampanthan has said that Sri Lanka has two opposition leaders and thereby carries the danger of being called a failed state. The last bit of this phrase which pertains Sri Lanka to a failed state is food for thought and must be considered above all else for posterity

Why civil society cannot be absolved
	

ll things considered, the 52-day government shot itself in the foot by assuming that populist legitimacy overrides constitutional legality. There are times when the one will supersede the other, but such times come about only if the government in power is so unpopular that a Restoration is called for. The truth is that the Ranil Wickremesinghe government did not covet enough unpopularity for it to be swept aside by a Rajapaksa Restoration. And the makers and of the latter Project let go of one constituent element that had a say in its downfall; the independence of the system. You can argue against the ruling of the Supreme Court, but theres no denying the fact that, for the first time in many years, it didnt tilt towards the man in power. 

"No one, at least no one with patriotic inclinations, will support any move aimed at abolishing the Presidency unless and until these needs are met"
Then again, the man in power isnt the man in power. Lakshman Kiriella and other members of the UNPs Royalist Regency may oppose Maithripala Sirisenas decision to keep certain Ministries under him, but they (begrudgingly) recognise his rights to such tokenistic powers. In other respects, Sirisena is powerless. Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriyas assertion about those powers being akin to a monarchs, read in this light, is plain nonsense on stilts. The 19th Amendment did impose checks on the man, whether or not such an act of robbing a man elected on a wide mandate, of his authority is desirable for another debate altogether. 
Personally (and I say this without any hesitation), I am for the Executive Presidency. But as with every power and privilege conferred on the ruler of a country it is, for the lack of a better way of putting it, a double edged sword. On the one hand it served its purpose during those heady war years when a separation of powers of the titles of the Head of State, the Head of Government and Commander of the Armed Forces would have been disastrous. On the other hand, with a series of unfortunate rulings that gave carte blanche to the president in the Rajapksa era and even before it, denigrated the idea of parliamentary supremacy and turned parliament into a spectacle. 

"I do not blame Ranil Wickremesinghe. Nor do I blame Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa. Nor do I blame the system."
Despite my prejudices against the institution, however, I will make one thing clear. In 2015 the mandate given by 6.2 million voters was to change the governance structures that had been in place since J.R. Jayewardenes presidency and had been exploited to bring about sweeping powers for and by Mahinda Rajapaksa. But such a mandate does not by itself exclude the Executive Presidency. 
This is not because past historical experience indicates clearly that other forms of governance in Sri Lanka have had their share of abuse(r)s. This is also because, given the penchant of politicians and of voters to change allegiances, an alternative to the Executive Presidency must satisfy the primary needs of a country: sovereignty of the country and sovereignty of the people. 

"A peoples sovereignty, on the other hand, rests fairly and squarely upon an institution to which lawmakers have been elected, not selected, and from which those lawmakers can be ejected"
No one, at least no one with patriotic inclinations, will support any move aimed at abolishing the Presidency unless and until these needs are met. There is a problem, however; a countrys sovereignty, in the populist sense of that term, is best served by a powerful Leviathan-like figure, the epitome of which, in Sri Lanka, was J.R. and Mahinda (and to a lesser extent, Premadasa). A peoples sovereignty, on the other hand, rests fairly and squarely upon an institution to which lawmakers have been elected, not selected, and from which those lawmakers can be ejected. There is then a clash, a contradiction, if not contradistinction, among the arms of the State which stand for these two sovereignties, the Executive and the Legislature. No, I am not suggesting here that people power (jana balaya) is at odds with nationalism. In fact far from it being so, be it in the West or the East, there are times when the two will coincide. But in the popular myth of yahapalanaya and democracy perpetuated by the present government, the two cannot be one and the same. 
And why Because in postcolonial societies like Sri Lanka, politicians look up to the ideal of a political ism over its reality even as the other part of the world occupied by the international community engage in doublespeak and both champion, say, human rights AND de-validate them by propping up dictatorships friendly to them. This is a tragedy because the political debate in postcolonial countries is dichotomised between the democrats and the populists. It is a dichotomy refracted by the Western media: those who win elections are portrayed as demagogues, and those in the Opposition are portrayed as democrats fighting for people who never voted them in! We saw this clearly in the 52-day Mahinda-Maithripala government. Shades of grey were abandoned, and in the rush to validate the ousted government, commentators and apologists (from the left and right) depicted the political scene as a battle between good and evil, light and darkness, decency and demagoguery, erudition and ignorance; in a word, between democrats and populists. As if demagogues cant be decent, as if the uneducated are worse than the educated, as if democrats cant be populists! 

"The yahapalanist discourse is hence in a shambles. It is dominated by intellectuals and artistes who project themselves as the superiors of politicians and ideologues"
The yahapalana discourse is based on these dichotomies and they are, far worse I should think, perpetuated by everyone. Amila Muthukutti in an article titled The Rise of Social Media and Fall of Mainstream Media makes the case for the Facebook generation and denigrates the lamestream media outlets which were in favour of the Rajapaksas. But with all due respect, there is nothing different between the one and the other; social media activists are just as blinded by political loyalties and good/bad binaries in the yahalapanist scheme of things as the traditional media are by its fawning to such binaries in the Rajapaksist scheme of things. 
I do not blame Ranil Wickremesinghe. Nor do I blame Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa. Nor do I blame the system. I blame the way everyone, including those who market themselves as neutral political players, has let the debate over such important issues as the Executive Presidency and good governance slip into a series of meaningless, simplistic, reductionist dichotomies. 
These dichotomies are what account for the popular myth, sustained predominantly by the young, but also the educated middle class, that the ousted government was the last real hope they could resort to. When arguments to the tune of, We arent for Ranil but we are for democracy are being made by activists who a) Didnt as much as open their mouths when the Central Bank was being robbed and b) Distinguish between the ideal and the man they inadvertently champion as the best candidate to make that ideal a reality, I can hence only laugh. 

"We used to believe, when we were small, that politicians were bad and the people who rebelled against them were good"
The yahapalanist discourse is hence in a shambles. It is dominated by intellectuals and artistes who project themselves as the superiors of politicians and ideologues. They are not. The case of Dambara Amila, Sarath Wijesuriya, and Gamini Viyangoda should make this evident for everyone and anyone. In that sense the discontent channelled by the actor, the playwright, and the intellectual over the past few weeks has been, for the most, a farce. Theres nothing to suggest, nothing substantive, that these purveyors of good governance are better representatives of the people than those we have elected. Theres nothing to bear out their low opinion of populism because their own programme for a better polity, despite the resonant phrase and the outbursts of self-righteous fury (remember Manuwarnas kalakanni Disneylanthaya), amounts to little. 
We used to believe, when we were small, that politicians were bad and the people who rebelled against them were good. But then the politicians were people once and people also have within themselves the tendency to enrich themselves. Unfortunately for us, though, the yahalapanaya debate, since 2015, has been dominated by this good/bad view. In this scheme of things, civil society, from intellectuals making grandiloquent claims for neoliberal compradores to good governance activists going mum over the actions of the government, has been given enough carte blanche. 

The Rise of Social Media and Fall of Mainstream Media makes the case for the Facebook generation and denigrates the lamestream media outlets which were in favour of the Rajapaksas"
Next week Ill explain why that good/bad rift that civil society has brought up between the people and their representatives is so simplistic that it has succeeded in concealing more insidious forms of power structures and hierarchies. For now Ill end with a contention: no amount of debate over the Executive Presidency, that most potent and hated symbol of the Rajapaksa Era (an era of darkness for those who have forgotten J.R. and Premadasa and Chandrika), will be constructive unless we look beyond the we-are-holier-than-them attitude of civil society activism.

## Title: Why hand fractures are treated by plastic surgeons

Why hand fractures are treated by plastic surgeons
	

Dr. Shashanka Rathnayake, Consultant Plastic and Reconstruction Surgeon attached to the Teaching Hospital, Kandy answers questions regarding hand fractures and how a plastic surgeon would handle such injuries.
Excerpts:
Q How can somebody suffer a hand fracture
There are several reasons for a hand fracture. The commonest reason is a fall on ground and landing on the hand or the fingers. In addition fractures do occur when a motor vehicle is involved in an accident. There can be a crush injury due to various mechanical appliances in industrial and domestic use. Often these hand fractures are neglected or not attended to.

Q What are the problems a patient is going to face when experiencing a hand fracture
A hand fracture is not deadly and will not progress to a cancer or a deadly disease. However, it will affect the function of the hand. If the injury is in the dominant hand the loss of function may affect the patients life significantly.The loss of hand function is due to two reasons. One is the fracture causing deformity. The other reason is the inappropriate treatment leading to stiffness and loss of function. Therefore one has to be aware that hand fractures can make you miserable if not treated properly.

Q How urgent is it to attend to a fractures in the hand
The fractures in the hand could be open or closed. An open fracture means there is a wound associated with the fracture and there is very high chance of bone infection. So those cases demand urgent attendance. The patient needs to be taken to an operating theatre for a wound wash out. Once the wound is attended to, the fixation of the fracture may not be urgent. It should be done properly. Repeated surgery or manipulations would lead to problems associated with wounds and poor healing of the fracture.
It is alright to attended to closed fractures or fractures without a wound after a couple of days. But the delay should not be lengthy as for a few weeks.

Q Do all fractures in the hand need surgical intervention
Not at all. Some of the un-displaced fractures can be managed without surgical intervention and only with splinting. When the fractures are displaced and angulated they should be attended to surgically and fixed to prevent deformity. The same applies with non healing of fractures.The surgical fixation of the hand fractures could be again done without making surgical incisions or without opening the fracture site and under x ray guidance during surgery. The other option is to open the fracture and then go for a fixation of the fracture.
The fixation of the fracture can be done with wires, screws and plates.

Q What is the best way of managing a fracture
The management plan of the fracture would depend on the extent of the damage. The fractures are going to heal spontaneously and in Western Medicine we do not prescribe any magic drug or local application which would expedite the healing process.The surgical intervention is to keep the fracture ends aligned and support the natural process of healing. Most of the fractures are going to heal if they are immobilised for an adequate period of time. However, if the immobilisation is too long, the hand may become totally stiff and may not function although the fracture is perfectly healed. Therefore the management should balance the bone healing and stiffening of the hand joints.
If the fracture can be rigidly fixed with screws and plates, the hand can be mobilised from the following day after surgery. Then the chance of hand becoming stiff is less. However, this way of managing fractures is costly and may not be available in many hospitals.
If the fracture is fixed semi rigidly with wires only, the mobilisation would be restricteda for sometime and the chances of the hand getting stiff is high.

Q Are you telling that using screws and plates for hand fractures is better always
I cannot say that and in fact, there are fractures which cannot be fixed with screws and plates and also the use of screws and plates may cause wound complications. The main problem with plating is the tendons getting adhered to the plate and restricting mobilisation. When the fixation occurs with screws only the problems are less. But we cannot do that with all fractures. However, the use of plates and screws produces better results although it is costly.

Q How long does a fractured hand take to heal 
Usually a hand fracture will be adequately healed and ready for mobilisation after 6 weeks. Anyway this does not mean that the hand can be used for heavy manual work after six weeks. One should not use the hand for heavy manual work for 10 to 12 weeks. It is always better to get advice from a hand surgeon before proceeding to normal work and if not a recurrence of the fracture would ensure the patient a miserable outcome.

Q What would you do if a fracture does not heal properly
The improper healing could be non healing or can be termed healing with a deformity. The non union during a fracture has to be explored and fixed with screws and plates with bone grafting.The deformed bone can be given the right shape with various surgical techniques and the fixation with screws and plates. These surgical procedure are technically demanding and could be done by a properly trained hand surgeon.

Q How can the fractured hand be protected till it heals
Traditionally, the hand fractures were immobilised with a protective plaster of paris splint. The problem with this plaster of paris splint is that it cannot be removed for washing the hand and it becomes very smelly after sometime. Therefore we use a plastic splint which can be removed and put back securely without jeopardizing the fracture. These splints should be made under the instructions of a hand surgeon. In the Teaching Hospital of Kandy we have trained therapists to do this kind of work maintaining international standards.

Q What is the role of a plastic surgeon during the management of a hand fracture
Traditionally, all the fractures were managed by indigenous physicians and no surgical intervention was described in Ayurvedic medicine. However, the common belief is that almost all these can be managed by Ayurvedic physicians. It is an unfortunate situation where most of the hand fractures are mismanaged and end up in deformity.
Then the other belief is orthopaedic surgeons could manage all the fractures. Obviously skull fractures are fixed by neurosurgeons and facial fractures are fixed by oral surgeons and plastic surgeons. Like wise in the developed world hand fractures are managed by plastic surgeons who have a special training in hand fracture management. In addition the hand fracture could be associated with damage to the other structures of the hand.
Since the injury to structures like tendons or nerves should be ideally handled by a plastic surgeon, it is always better for the patient to get the plastic surgeon to handle a hand fracture.In addition some of these fractures may be associated with some soft tissue loss and need a reconstructive procedure to cover the defect which could only be performed by a plastic surgeon. If somebody has read the series of articles published on hand surgery it would be more clearly understood.

Q Are these plates and screws used in hand fractures harmful to the body or should they be removed after sometime
This is again a misnomer. Leaving a plate and screws is not going to cause any harmful effect. Anyway if someone is worried we encourage removal after six months of surgery. However if the plate is causing problems like pain and tendon adhesions, it may be removed earlier; like in less than 6 months. When we use screws only for fixation, they do not cause any issue and can be left alone.

Will give up  nukes if US removes nuclear threat: N.Korea
	

N.Korea (Daily Mail), 20 December 2018 - North Korea says that it will never unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons unless the United States first removes what Pyongyang called a nuclear threat. 
The surprisingly blunt statement jars with Seouls rosier presentation of the North Korean position and could rattle the fragile trilateral diplomacy to defuse a nuclear crisis that last year had many fearing war.
The latest from North Korea comes as the United States and North Korea struggle over the sequencing of the denuclearization that Washington wants and the removal of international sanctions desired by Pyongyang.
North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.

A Christmas message: Live and let Live
	
The Daily Mirror of December 5 had a full page news feature titled, Violence among Youth where did we go wrong In it your columnist Kamanthi Wickremesinghe had listed several gruesome killings which had occurred between November 21 and November 25, involving youth. These included the death of a 19-year-old youth, by stabbing and the strangling of a 22-year-old girl by her lover. The latter incident the strangling had been witnessed by a group of youth who had videoed it and circulated it on social media. This was truly shocking  more so at this time of Christmas.
These incidents were referred to in a Sunday sermon at a church service I attended, where the priest bemoaned the loss of values in our present day society, particularly the respect for human life. These incidents are so shocking that society is compelled to wake up and to take note.
In our own land we have lived through many years of internecine violence. This violence both experienced and witnessed in our country and those elsewhere, given wide coverage in the electronic and print media has desensitized society to violence and killings and this I believe had adversely affected our youth.
In the DM article, two eminent persons, a university Professor of Criminology and a Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, were interviewed and their observations recorded. The former had correctly observed, We also see that the community doesnt seem to take any responsibility when crimes take place . society needs a revival . the family also dont consider social values. In school there is no value-based education system but more of an exam-oriented knowledge cultureBoth print and electronic media personnel need to be trained before reporting incidents relating to crime
The Consultant Psychiatrist too had wise words of advice to parents and to schools. He said, Parents need to have regular conversations with their children and discuss how to deal with situations without resorting to violence.
In addition to the role of the parents and schools, there is a third element not mentioned therein,  and that is the role by the various religions in the upbringing of our youth and the attendant imparting of ethical values. It is important to note that places of worship and religious leaders have a great responsibility today, to stress the value of life, particularly human life and the need to settle matters peacefully without resorting to violence. I could not find any reference to this third element, ie., the role of religion in the interview.
This is the season of Christmas, when the birth of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe to be the son of God is celebrated worldwide. It is appropriate to note that Jesus in his Sermon on the mount, reversed the former Judaic teaching of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth recorded in the Old Testament of the Bible. Jesus preached, but I say unto you that whosoever smite thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. (St. Mathews Gospel Ch.5  New Testament). It is known that Mahatma Gandhi, a Hindu, was greatly influenced by the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount
I believe that the four great religions in our land, teach the importance of living in peace and harmony, in society though most regrettably much violence has been done in the name of these very religions throughout history in many lands, by misguided people, misquoting and misinterpreting scripture. Even the saintly Mahatma was assassinated by a religious zealot. It is therefore very important that religious leaders of all faiths propagate the true teachings of their respective religions  particularly among our youth on living peacefully and righteously, in a spirit of live and let live. May this be a message for us all at this Christmas Season of Peace and Goodwill.
Our country was engulfed in political uncertainty and a breakdown in governance since October 26. We need to be thankful that a seven-Judge Supreme Court Bench delivered an historic judgement upholding the Rule of Law, and Accountability.
We pray that sanity and goodwill will prevail and that our leaders will act with responsibility and with integrity in the True spirit of Christmas.

## Title: Abolish the executive presidency or reduce its powers further

Abolish the executive presidency or reduce its powers further
	
The battle is not over yet: President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe greet each other after the latter was sworn in as prime minister on Sunday.

or forms of government, let fools contend; whatever is best administered is best, said Alexander Pope. The 18th century poets one-liner still rings true, in the context of ceaseless constitutional crises and ubiquitous debates over political reforms. No country is an exception. Even in Saudi Arabia, arguably the most rigid monarchy, political reform is a major demand of the dissidents. This was amply reported in news items on the recent killing of journalist and democracy activist Jamal Khashoggi.
In the United States, the call for political reforms is widespread. Hundreds of resolutions are proposed every congressional term to amend the US Constitution. It is said that from 1789 till January 3, 2017, about 11,699 measures have been proposed to amend the US Constitution.
In the United Kingdom, too, political reforms are an ongoing process; more so, after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. The nature of the union has undergone drastic change, with not only Northern Ireland, but also Scotland and Wales getting parliaments or assemblies of their own.
Although sacrosanct, constitutions should not be airtight. When the exigencies of the situation demand, constitutional changes need to be done. That is why constitution framers include provisions outlining the process to change or replace the constitution.
Going by the political undercurrents of the past 55 days, it appears that the crisis or the conflict President Maithripala Sirisena unleashed on October 26 is still not over. But it has rekindled the debate on the abolition of the executive presidency. Suddenly, there seems to be an urgent need to bring in more constitutional provisions to check the presidents excesses. The irony is that the United National Party, which introduced the executive presidency through a new constitution in 1978, is now calling for its abolition, while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has now become its main advocate though it earlier opposed the executive presidency on the basis that it would undermine the democratic structure of Sri Lankas post-independence government.
Against the backdrop of the Supreme Courts December 13 ruling that the Executive President had acted illegally and violated the constitution, lawmakers in parliament this week argued in favour of and against the executive presidency. Government and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna MPs urged that the executive presidency should be abolished, given the temptation of the Presidents to resort to undemocratic and unconstitutional measures. United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs insisted that it should be retained at least with enhanced checks and balances to ensure the territorial integrity of the country.

"Thanks to the 19th Amendment, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could withstand the presidential salvos against all odds, and defeat the constitutional coup"
The need of the hour, however, is to eliminate backdoor avenues and plug loopholes to avert constitutional dictatorship, the types of which was seen during the 52-day crisis created by President Sirisena -- and also during the presidency of Mahinda Rajapaksa, who, by introducing the 18th Amendment, suffocated the democratic spirit of the constitution. Sadly, the war-winning President Rajapaksa, who built his political career by promoting himself as a defender of human rights, especially during the 1988-89 era of terror, is now known the world over as a strongman  certainly not a flattering description. It is a term used by political analysts to describe a military or political figure who exercises far more influence over the government than the constitution permits. World history may not be kind to Sirisena and Rajapaksa. It will not enshrine their names as defenders of democracy, if they continue to be adamant in not seeing the virtues of democracy.
Prior to the adoption of the 1978 constitution, many a warning was sounded about the threats it could pose to democracy. A seasoned politician of yesteryear rightly said that he dreaded to think the consequences if a mentally unbalanced person became the President and was to enjoy the virtually unlimited and unchecked powers associated with the office.
The power the executive presidents wield is a trust the people place in them in terms of a social contract. But Sri Lankas executive presidents, from J.R. Jayewardene to Maithripala Sirisena, perhaps the only exception being D.B. Wijetunga, have abused that power, so much so that every succeeding president became a bigger tyrant than his or her predecessor. The problem is not over whether a constitution is good or bad, but whether the politicians who wield the power are good or bad. As this column has said before, a constitution, however good it is, can be bad in the hands of a bad leader, while a constitution, however bad it is, can be good in the hands of a good leader.
Sri Lankas 40-year tryst with the executive presidency, especially in the context of the current political crisis, is not a pleasant experience. Either it should be abolished or more checks and balances need to be introduced, so that there will be stability even when a cohabitation government is in power. The JVPs proposed 20th Amendment is indeed a step in the right direction.
Sri Lankas experiment with cohabitation governments paints a dismal picture. The fact that cohabitation governments have miserably failed is proof enough that our leaders are power-hungry. Rather than coming together for the benefit of the people and the country, our politicians are interested in enhancing their political power  and for this purpose, they have no qualms about abusing the constitutional powers and taking cover behind warped interpretations of the constitution.
Sri Lankas constitution is neither exclusively presidential, nor purely Westminster. It is a hybrid system which can, at times, bring about a cohabitation government.
Political cohabitation is a form of governmental arrangement between the executive president and a rival party prime minister.

"Suddenly, there seems to be an urgent need to bring in more constitutional provisions to check the presidents excesses"
In the absence of clear-cut constitutional provisions, cohabitation governments are usually associated with political backstabbing. In Sri Lanka, this was first witnessed in 2001, when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes UNP-controlled Parliament was dissolved by President Chandrika Kumaratunga before parliament completed its six-year term, though she had promised she would not do so as long as the UNP had the majority in Parliament. It happened again on October 26 this year, and we all know the political turmoil came after that. Thanks to the 19th Amendment, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe could withstand the presidential salvos against all odds, and defeat the constitutional coup. But the battle, it appears, is not yet over.
In recent decades, this country has seen disaster after disaster, natural and man-made, economic and political. On top of these problems, the political crisis the President has created has dealt a devastating blow to the economy. We do not need any more disasters. What we urgently need is development that will free us from the shackles of poverty and provide jobs for our youths. For this, we need to ensure political stability. Under the present constitution, cohabitation governments have proved a failure and cannot ensure that political stability. The 1978 constitution has not delivered political stability, though it was drafted and adopted for that purpose. We need to go for a new constitution that will make prime minister the head of government and the president, who will be appointed by Parliament or an electoral college, the head of state  like in India and Pakistan. We need a constitution that will promote development and that will contain provisions to solve the countrys ethnic issue through meaningful devolution of power.

Applied, didnt receive SLPP membership: Roshan
	
UPFA MP Roshan Ranasinghe yesterday said they have only applied for the membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) but they have not yet received the membership.
The issue of UPFA MPs joining the SLPP arose in parliament early this week as several MPs argued that MPs who obtained the SLPP membership are ineligible to retain their parliament seats.
Responding to criticisms, MP Ranasinghe said they have submitted applications to obtain membership from the SLPP but the party's secretary and national organiser had not given them membership as yet.
"They accepted our applications but did not give the membership as yet. We were elected to parliament from the UPFA. From that day, we continue to pay Rs. 3,000 monthly as membership subscription fee to the SLFP. These fees have been deducted from our November salaries as well, he told a news briefing.

## Title: Are you a mother with a Negative blood group

Are you a mother with a Negative blood group
	

The human body is a miracle. No scientist has been able to describe all of it, even though we have been advancing day by day with new aspects of science. There are millions and trillions of wonderful things, happening inside the body and they keep on changing as we grow older-depending on what milestones in life we pass and what requirements in life we are supposed to fulfill.
Pregnancy is another beautiful process which takes place in the body of a woman and the route followed as it goes on and changes happening inside are unbelievable at times. Not only lay people, but even health care professionals and scientists tend to be surprised by certain phenomenon related to pregnancy and birth and it is just amazing to see how each and everything has been maintained perfectly to carry out reproduction to create off-spring, thus ensuring the persistence of species.
Today in Health Capsule, we are discussing on one of those important topics related to pregnancy-Rh Isoimmunization and and we have obtained the expert advice of Dr. Suranga Hettipathirana, Consultant Gyaenocologist and Obstetrician. Blood covers about 7-8% of the weight of human body and it carries out various vital functions such as transporting oxygen and nutrients to our cells while clearing out waste products like carbon dioxide, ammonia etc., maintaining an effective immune system and a relatively constant body temperature. Blood is a highly specialized tissue, existing in the form of a fluid, composed of more than 4,000 different kinds of components and four of the most important ones include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma.
According to Dr. Hettipathirana, all cells- including the ones in blood have a mixture of factors known as antigens on their surfaces which are inherited. Antigens ensure and enable our immune system to identify bodys own cells from non-native or external invaders. When these foreign factors are recognised and differentiated from bodys own cells, they are destroyed by antibodies-the opponent factors which are also produced by the bodys immune system. Antigens are found on the surface of red blood cells where antibodies are found in plasma. All humans produce these blood components where there are no populational or regional differences yet their blood groups can be different depending on the hereditary presence or absence of the antigens A and B on the surfaces of RBCs.

ABO blood types
People with the antigen A on the surface of their RBCs have Blood group A and those with antigen B fall into blood group B. Individuals with AB blood group have both A and B antigens whereas people with type O blood have no antigens present. The antibody which acts against antigen A is called anti-A and is found in the plasma of people who do not carry antigen A on their own RBCs which include people with type O or type B blood. The antibody which acts against antigen B is called anti-B and found in those who do not carry antigen B in their RBCs which include people with type O or type A blood.
Rhesus factor is a protein found in red blood cells. Not all of us carry this factor and people who do are referred to as Rhesus positive and those who do not are referred to as Rhesus negative.
Example: A person with only antigen A and Rhesus factor will fall into blood group A POSITIVE.
Blood grouping can create trouble during pregnancyWhen an Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive Red blood cells, there is a chance for her to produce antibodies inside her body and this is what we call Rh isoimmunization. In fact, when an Rh negative mother gives birth to an Rh positive baby and blood mixes between them by any chance, mothers body will rapidly start producing antibodies (soldiers in our blood) against babys Rh antigens and red blood cells which carry them. Although this will not create any problem
to the mother, baby has a chance to face various unfavourable consequences which can even end up in death.That is why this topic is important to be addressed and created awareness on highlights Dr. Suranga.

Rh Isomimmunization
A babys Rh status is determined by the blood groups of mother and father. If the mother is Rh negative and the father is Rh positive, their baby has at least a 50% chance of being Rh positive. The good news is, this Rh isoimmunization will only take place if the babys Rh-positive blood enters the maternal blood circulation and gets exposed to maternal antibodies. Fortunately, the nature has created this phenomenon of pregnancy-- danger-free as much as possible where in most pregnancies, mothers and babys blood would not mix. However, this could take place during,

Miscarriage
	Induced abortion
	Traumatic deliveries include caesarean section
	Ectopic pregnancy
	Trauma during pregnancy
	Amniocentesis or other invasive testing procedures related to pregnancy which are not very common
	Manual removal of the placenta
	Still Births and intra uterine deaths
First exposure of babys blood to mothers blood (which is called Sensitization) wont create problems because the initial response would be very slow and antibodies wont be able to cross the placenta but the re-exposure, causing destruction of babys red blood cells can be really quick and lead to so much of trouble.

Consequencescan be fatal
During re-exposure, sensitized Rh negative mother will produce IgG anti-D (antibody) which crosses the placenta and attacks D-positive fetal red cells which are then destroyed in the fetal spleen.
	Result in red cell destruction, liver and spleen enlargement and many more complications in the fetus ultimately ending up with fetal heart and liver failure.
Tackling the problem isnt difficult at all with the right medical care. With the advances in diagnostic and therapeutic interventions you can definitely get yourself safeguarded from sensitization by following right medical advice.The real problem lies only if you are Rh negative and your husband is Rh positive.During the first doctor visit, make sure to get your blood group checked.If its negative they will do some other tests to see if you have already been exposed to Rh positive blood or not and the treatment will be based accordingly. Anti D immunoglobulin is given following any event with the potential of mixing of maternal and fetal blood. Soon after the delivery, make sure to get your babys blood group checked and if its positive another dose of anti D immunoglobulin will have to be taken.
Although the Government sector provides these injections only at potentially sensitising events and delivery, you can get preventive doses from the private sector at 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy.
While we, the health care professionals will look into taking care of you based on your situation, it is your responsibility to be aware that conditions like this take place in order to support at your best to carry out satisfactory preventive measures and early interventions underscored Dr. Hettipathirana.

Astrology and Rebirth Natal Chart, key to unlock  our past births
	

Part 3

According the classical astrological work, Phaladeepika by Sage Manthreshwara, the 9th House in an individuals Natal Chart holds the key to unlock ones past birth.
In fact, most Indian astrologers use the term, Purvapunyasthana to describe the 9th House in a horoscope.

Where born
If the 9th lord is debilitated or in an enemys House, ones previous birth was in a different country. If the 9th lord is exalted, the native in previous birth was brought up and lived in a high society of good people.
If the 9th lord is in his own House or in a friends House, the past life was in the same country as the native has been born in this lifetime.
If the 9th lord is Jupiter, the native was born and brought up in Aryavarta, in the region between the Himalayas and the Vindya mountains.
If the 9th lord is Venus or the Moon, the native was born in his previous lifetime near a Punyanadi (a good river) such as Kaveri.
If the 9th lord happens to be Mercury, the past birth happened near the Skshetras of Gods like Vishnu and Shiva (a reference to Shrirangam and Chitambaram in India)
If the 9th lord is Saturn, the person was born in a Mlechcha Desha outside Bharat Varsha. (in a land of barbarians or uncivilized people outside the part of ancient India
(Bharat Desh) called Bharat Varsha.
If the lord of the 9th House is Sun, the birth took place in a forest or a mountainous region.
If the lord of the 9th House is Mars, the person was born in a place where life is difficult.
The method to determine the kind of life in the past birth:
as expounded in Phaladeepika is as follows:
If the 9th lord is placed in a Prushyodaya Rashi (sign rising from the hind part)  a movable sign - the native was some plant in the previous birth.
If the 9th lord is placed in a Shirshayodaya Rashi (sign rising from the head)  the person was a living being like an animal or a human being.
If the 9th lord is placed in the sign of exaltation, or own sign or in a friends sign of the Lagna lord, the previous birth was that of a human being.
If the 9th lord is placed in a neutral sign of the Lagna lord, the previous birth was that of an animal.
If the 9th lord is placed in an enemy sign of the Lagna lord, the previous life was that of a bird.

Blood ties end where justice begins!
	

There is a young popular Diyawanna member who has been compelled to visit Aluthkade now and then for shooting off his mouth.

Whenever the young politico visits Aluthkade, an elderly physician highly respected by both the young and the old in his community would accompany him and scribes and videographers would mob them as they walk together towards the august complex.
The elderly physician would enjoy brief a chat with media personnel in the precincts of the august complex and turn back to his waiting car when the time is about to begin proceedings inside and the young politico would go inside the complex alone.
Some people who watch this scene describe it as a typical episode from a movie.

Decision taken to expedite forensic audit into bond scam
	
 At a meeting held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena today, a decision had been taken to expedite a forensic audit into the Central Bank bond scam, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said.
The meeting was held at the Presidential Secretariat to discuss the progress of the investigations launched into the bond scam.
In a statement, the PMD said a number of causes which had delayed the bond scam investigations were revealed at the meeting.
No charge sheet had been submitted against the suspects who had been remanded over the scam. When relevant Acts were being reformed to finalise legal action within a fixed time frame, the sectoral committee in parliament had obstructed the move. Though the bond commission had recommended to conduct a forensic audit, it has not been conducted. Accordingly, it was decided to file court cases within a fixed time frame, to conduct a forensic audit immediately and to discuss the progress of the investigations on a monthly basis, the statement said.
Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, Bribery Commission Director General Sarath Jayamanna, Senior DIG Ravi Senaviratne of the CID, acting Governor of Central Bank Nandalal Weerasinghe and other officials also attended the meeting.

Dispute over ministerial appointment of SF
	
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said yesterday that a dispute arose as to how Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, as a retired military officer, could work with President Maithripala Sirisena as the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.
Mr. Abeywardene told a media conference that Field Marshal Sarath Fonsekas name was included in the list of names which were sent to the President but there was an issue on how the President (who is the head of armed forces), and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka could work together in the Cabinet.
He said the matter could be sorted out as the Defence Secretary had already pointed out that Mr. Fonseka was only a retired military officer and could hold any other position in addition to the post of Field Marshal.
He said more ministers will be sworn in after President Maithripala Sirisena returns from an overseas tour which he intends to undertake shortly.
A 30 member Cabinet was sworn in initially to overcome the crisis which is pertaining to allocation of funds. Others will be sworn in later, he said.
It was also mentioned that legal advice would be sought on increasing the number of Ministers in the Cabinet.
However, the Minister said he was not aware of what happened with MP Palitha Range Bandara, who was not given a ministerial portfolio.
Mr. Range Bandaras name was also included in the list which was sent to the President but I am not aware as to why he was not appointed as a minister. However, we expect to resolve these matters soon, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Family in severe difficulties seeks help from generous donors
	
A family of five children living in Kitulakanda at Radawana are in a predicament because the familys 35-year-old bread winner D.K. Kumarsinghe (35) is seriously ill with intestinal cancer. 
The childrens mother, Wasantha Kumari said they had been struggling for survival for more than three years from the time her husband fell ill. The eldest in the family is an 18-year-old girl who left school recently and the others are aged 15, 10 and 8 with the youngest being a four-year-old girl. 
My husband maintained the family with the meagre income he earned as a coconut plucker and a manual labourer in the area. He developed a cancer in his anus and underwent a serious of surgical operations but without a permanent cure. Doctors in the Watupitiwala and Gampaha General Hospitals who examined him found his kidneys were badly affected. Despite his illness he continued to work because of economic constraints faced by the family particularly the childrens schooling. 
However, he was incapacitated when he met with an accident causing him to suffer from fractures in the lower and right upper and lower limbs. Currently he is bed-ridden leaving the family to the mercy of our neighbours who help us out of sympathy. Schooling of my three sons has come to a standstill because of the hardships we are facing. Meanwhile, our 10-year-old child is also suffering from a kidney ailment but I am not in a position to spend for his medical tests recommended by doctors. My husband is required to undergo another surgery. I have not been able to get my youngest daughter admitted to a pre-school becuase of the expenses. We are not entitled even to the Samurdhi allowance. Recently we were ejected from the house we lived in because of the arrears of rent and we shifted to another house. The present landlord has warned us not to run into arrears of rent, the childrens mother Wasantha Kumari said. 
She requested the public and civil society organizations to help provide treatment to her husband and their 10-year-old son and to spend for their schooling which the children urgently need. 
The Grama Niladhari of 390/c Kitulkanda division in Radawana has confirmed the sad plight of this family and recommended public relief.

He was about to make the decisive move when he learnt that a colleague from the same area, who had already somersaulted to the Green camp after sharing both rough and fair weather together with him for several years, had raised vehement objections to welcome him to the Green fold.

The colleague, already in the Green camp had lodging his protest told the Green leadership: By accepting him to the Green fold, you would be doing me a great injustice!
The Green pal who extended the invitation to the willing one is reportedly wondering now how he could open the door to the new pal without antagonizing the buddy already in the fold.

MR tells Ranil Govt. to be people-friendly
	
Opposition Leader Mahinda Rajapaksa today urged the government to be more people-friendly when taking economic decisions without blindly following the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Speaking during the debate on the Vote on Account, he said people were inconvenienced by the high cost of living and the tax burden.
"There are people who can't afford to a single meal a day as mentioned by the Cardinal in his Christmas message. The government should be people friendly. Don't try to do only what the IMF says. Countries fall in trouble by doing so," Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said when they took over the government, the businessmen were in a serious situation where some of them had shut down their industries leading to the loss of jobs.
"We should be sensitive to the needs of the people when taking decisions. It is not fair to fill the treasury by taxing the people all the time. Industries including the construction sector collapsed when this government took over in January, 2015. More than 500,000 people had lost their jobs during this time," Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said this situation needed to be changed and pointed out that was why they decided to provide relief to the people soon after they took over the government.
"We reduced fuel prices and the VAT. The fuel prices could have been reduced even earlier. A barrel of crude oil dropped to US$28 in the world market. But the then government had not reduced the fuel prices," Mr. Rajapaksa said and added that they did not take over the government in a political coup and asked the current government not to be too sure of their position when considering who were in the opposition.
"We are in the opposition now so don't be too sure of your seats in the government. We, as the opposition, and the peolle will rise against your anti-people actions at any time," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

Political Crisis drags  racism to the fore
	
Why an early election is the best option for all
A headline during the 2000 general election

Of the twin crises that engulfed the country for 51 days with the unseating of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and the replacing of him with Mahinda Rajapaksa on October 26, the Constitutional crisis has ended with Rajapaksas resignation as Prime minister on December 15 and the swearing of Wickremesinghe on the next day.
However, the political crisis that had overlain the Constitutional gridlock still continues. As an extension of it, the legality of Rajapaksas Parliamentary membership, as well as his newly gained Opposition leadership, have been challenged.
As the speech made by President Maithripala Sirisena at Wickremesinghes swearing-in ceremony on Sunday indicated many more clashes are to come between the Executive Presidency and the Parliament.
When Rajapaksa resigned as Prime Minister on December 15 the UNF leaders argued that he did not have a post to resign from as he had already been ousted from the Premier post on November 14 and 16, through two no-confidence motions.
The argument was logical. However, their leader, Wickremesinghe who claimed that his sacking from the post of Prime Minister was illegal and that he was still the Prime Minister was sworn in as Prime Minister on last Sunday. Why should a Prime Minister be sworn in for the same post again
Some time back, Junior Vikatan, a magazine published in Tamil Nadu carried a story about a divorce ceremony in the State. The magazine said that it was the first of the kind.
Likewise, for the first time in history, we witnessed a resignation ceremony last Saturday. Rajapaksa at a ceremony at his residence to sign his letter of resignation from the Premiership said he decided to resign as he couldnt go for a general election forthwith.
And he said that some people went before the court in the name of democracy to prevent a General Election being held. During his speech at Wickremesinghes swearing-in ceremony, President Sirisena too while giving vent to his anger and frustration over the Supreme Courts rejection of his decision to dissolve the Parliament, expressed the same view.
They were attempting to mislead the country and the world. Nobody went before the court to prevent a mid-term election, though an election would have been the result had the Supreme Court upheld the Presidents decision to dissolve the Parliament.
It was against that unconstitutional decision of the President that 13 Fundamental Rights petitions had been filed.
Besides, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), one of the petitioners had stated that they would bring in a motion in the House requesting the President to dissolve Parliament, once the Constitutional conundrum was resolved.
In fact, had the intention of the President and Rajapaksa been to go for an early election, the former should have dissolved Parliament straight away, without taking pains to unseat Wickremesinghe, appoint Rajapaksa the Prime Minister and to prorogue the Parliament.
Even then the same Constitutional and political quagmire would have engulfed the country, but his intention would have explicitly been seeking a fresh composition of the Parliament.
When Rajapaksa was appointed Prime Minister, neither he nor the President did say that they would go for a premature Parliamentary Election.
They did not utter a word about an immediate election during the prorogation period either. It was after they realized that Rajapaksa could not muster sufficient support to command the majority power in the House that they wanted a mid-term election.
President Sirisena had two objectives in this manoeuvre.
One was to get rid of the administration of Wickremesinghe who had been ignoring the President and was acting as he pleased in dealing with the affairs of the country.
Secondly, the President who feared a political comeback of Rajapaksa was craving for a patch up with Rajapaksa later, when the latters party swept the electorate at the February 10 Local Government Elections.
On the other hand, Rajapaksa was eagerly awaiting an opportunity to reverse the legal actions against some of the members of his family and several of his loyalists.
He wanted power at least for a short period for this purpose. This was clear by the transfer of a senior CID official who had been handling the cases against Rajapaksa loyalists, soon after Rajapaksa was appointed Premier.
The October 26 Constitutional coup was the tryst of those political as well as personal goals of the duo.
Rajapaksa during his speech at the resignation ceremony stated that the UNF has been a hostage of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).
In a practical sense, his argument was correct as the UNP Government has been installed on the crutches of the TNA which can pull the carpet under Wickremesinghes feet anytime.
A Tamil newspaper quoted the Deputy Chairman of Committees of the Parliament and the leader of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organisation (TELO), Selvam Adaikkalanathan as saying that TNA would topple the Government if the UNP leaders went back on their words with respect to the immediate issues affecting the
Tamil people.
However, Rajapaksas intention was not to point at the weakness of the Wickremesinghe Government but to bolster his support bank among the Sinhalese by highlighting the ethnic aspect of the nexus between the UNF and the TNA.
In other words, he was rousing racism among the Sinhalese.
However, it must be remembered that Rajapaksa solicited support for his recent Government from the TNA during a discussion he had with TNA leader R. Sampanthan.
Earlier the leaders of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led by Rajapaksa have been rousing racism among the Sinhalese by saying that the UNP was being controlled by the TNA, citing an incident in Parliament.
Both the main political parties who criticize Tamil and Muslim political parties for their ethnic politics demonise those minority parties when they attempt to engage in national politics, aligning with their rivals.
This has been going on for about six decades. UNP demonized the Banda- Chelva Agreement in 1957 and the SLFP did the same when the Dudley- Chelvanayakam Pact was signedin 1966.
A headline after the 2001 general election
The JVP described J.R. Jayewardene Government as JR-Thondaman Government, despite Soumyamoorthy Thondaman hanging on to a Government that had 140 out of 168 seats in Parliament.
In the 1990s and in 2000, the UNP had been accusing the Chandrika Kumaratunga Government that it was attempting to divide the country through various devolution schemes and the SLFP and the JVP were agog with an Ali-Koti Givisuma (Elephant-Tiger Pact) after 2000.
It must be remembered that Tissa Attanayake who crossed over to Mahinda Rajapaksa camp in 2014 was in hot water after producing a purported clandestine agreement between the Oppositions common candidate Maithripala Sirisena and TNA.
Now, again the Rajapaksa camp is harping on another secret agreement. Sheer shamelessness has been the common trait of these accusers of secret pacts.Despite the UNF having managed to form the Government again after 51 days, it is a highly volatile Government, firstly, due to its weak support base
in Parliament.
Secondly, now it has to work with an unpredictable and hostile President, who is constitutionally the head of the Cabinet, while openly teaming up
with the Opposition armed with nationalistic slogans.
The President also has started to toe the same nationalistic line.
SLPP and the two main parties in the government (UNF and the SLFP) received an almost equal number of votes at the February local government elections.
Given the fact that the SLFP has now teamed up with the SLPP, and with the possibility of economic issues further biting, the UNF would have to face a difficult situation at the next national level elections, despite the boost it gained through the recent Constitutional and political impasse. Therefore an early election would be better for the UNF as well.

Post of Opposition Leader: Speaker delays ruling
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today announced in Parliament that he had decided to delay his ruling on the post of Opposition Leader because of fresh submissions made by some MPs.
The Speaker was supposed to give a ruling on this matter today.
I have received written submission from some MPs calling for the appointment of a select committee to determine whether those who joined the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) can remain in Parliament as UPFA MPs and on the opposition leaders post.
I have received a letter from UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera on this matter. TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran also sent me a letter earlier and made a fresh submission and therefore I will have to go through all these documents before making a ruling, the Speaker said.

SriLankan fails to implement US$ 300mn strategic business plans
	
SriLankan Airlines management had assigned former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) S. A. Chandrasekara to formulate two business plans in 2008 and 2010 but none of the recommendations made through the business plans had been implemented, former CFO S. A. Chandrasekara informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into irregularities at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka yesterday.
S. A. Chandrasekara was appointed by one of the former SriLankan Chairmen, Nishantha Wickramasinghe, to formulate a strategic business plan for SriLankan within three months for four financial years in April 2010.
The witness informed the Commission that he had prepared a four year (2010/11-2014/15) business plan for USD 300 million. During his testimony, he informed that both business plans had focused on selling shares of SriLankan to earn profits and to avoid obtaining loans or sovereign guarantees from the General Treasury.
In the business plan, he also created separate subsidiaries with ground handling, catering and engineering so that these entities could enter into agreements with other institutions, enabling them to sell shares.
Ground handling, catering and engineering are profitable processes. For example, ground handling operations alone are worth at least USD 400 million and if we had issued shares for half its worth, USD 200 million, we could have paid off a lot of debt. Moreover, the fact that ground handling, catering and engineering is with SriLankan allows the covering up of losses incurred by the flight operation. I wanted to continue this operation without being a burden to the Treasury, Chandrasekara said.
Meanwhile, Yasantha Dissanayake, Head of Financial Management at SriLankan, told the PCoI that former CEO Manoj Gunawardena had informed him that the Chairman and the Treasury wanted Chandrasekeras plan to be reviewed by an international company.
SriLankan Airlines Management paid Rs.50.7 million to Via Capital Company in 2010 to evaluate the business plan formulated by Chandrasekera for Rs.750,000. The selected international company, Via Capital, then went through the business proposal formulated by Chandrasekara and came up with a new proposal, for five years, by May 2011.
They suggested a number of proposals including expanding the fleet to 23 aircraft - 9 narrow body and 14 wide-body. The total cost for this proposal was USD 510 million compared to USD 300 million in the plans created by Chandrasekara. (Yoshitha Perera)

## Title: The politics of Amendments

The politics of Amendments
	
	Constitutions do carry with them the politics of their drafting masters
	
	
	Its democracy thats used to KILL democracy
	
Is that ugly, unruly conflict over Was democracy brought back since going back to the pre-October 26 status quo
Democracy was the most cherished word during the past 50 plus days, along with the Constitution.
Reference to Constitutionality in every sense was important for Parliamentary proceedings to be conducted as usual. Thus democracy, the constitution and constitutionality of decisions made and steps were taken became important with Friday, October 26, Presidential decisions.
We were told through mainstream and social media and with protests in Colombo that we had to get back to democracy with Parliament functioning at whatever cost. The democracy we were told was about getting back to the pre-October 26 status quo.
It was this status quo all Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions to the Supreme Court prayed for. They prayed that the November 09 Gazette dissolving Parliament be ruled as null and void.
All arguments were based on the analysis of the nature, effect and meaning of Articles 33 (2) (c), 62 (2) and 70 as the SC ruling says, with 70(1) included.
It was thus about Presidents powers in Article 33 (2) that includes and specifies the power vested in the President to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament, but cannot be read outside the limitations laid down in Article 70(1).
The SC ruling explains:
By operation of the second paragraph of Article 70(1), the President cannot dissolve Parliament during the first four and a half years of its term unless he has been requested to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two thirds of the Members of Parliament [including those not present].
The Gazette dissolving Parliament and fixing parliamentary elections for 05 January 2019 was thus unanimously declared null and void.
The SC argued only on provisions that were written into the Constitution. They paid attention to Fundamental Rights enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution but were not expected to politically read the conflict.
What is hailed as an historic decision, is purely and technically a legal answer to the conflict, which in essence is a political conflict.
Politically, the conflict remains unresolved. Constitutions do carry with them the politics of its drafting masters.
The original Second Republican Constitution was drafted to be in line with Jayewardene Politics the UNP continues with.
The yet to be abolished Executive Presidency came with that politics.
Almost all Amendments to the Constitution came with ruling party politics.
The 04th Amendment required a Peoples Referendum after a two-thirds majority in Parliament, as it sought to postpone Parliamentary Elections till 04 August 1989.
Jayewardene manipulated the Referendum as well.
It was Sinhala Buddhist racist politics of Jayewardenes UNP Government that brought the 06th Amendment after the 1983 July massacre of Tamil people, which compelled TULF MPs to leave Parliament after August 1983.
It is also the 06th Amendment that is used in indicting MP Maheswaran over her statement about the LTTE.
12th Amendment was never enacted, also for political reasons.
The 14th Amendment was that which increased the Parliament from 168 to 225 MPs including a National List, that promised to have eminent personalities from different disciplines in Parliament.

"That leaves Sri Lanka without any serious alternatives discussed and peoples democracy strangled all along with Colombo middle class calls for democracy that does not mean anything to peoples lives."
The 18th Amendment not only scrapped the term limits of Presidency but also brought all Independent Commissions under the Presidents influence and allowed the President to attend Parliament and take part in its business with all powers and privileges of an MP except the right to vote.
The Parliament thus came to be manipulated by the Executive power, not the other way round.
This 18th Amendment was allowed without a Peoples Referendum by the SC bench chaired by Chief Justice Shiranee Bandaranayake.
Most other amendments were necessary to follow up pieces of law.
One or two like the 17A were due to longtime lobbying and social pressure.
Fundamentally, these amendments did not necessarily meet Peoples demands, requirements and aspirations. They necessarily met the political necessities of ruling party leaders.
Next was the (in)famous 19th Amendment.
All through the year 2014, the 19A was campaigned for by the Venerable Sobitha Thera and his group of supporters to abolish the Executive Presidency, explained as the root cause of all ills; mega corruption, nepotism, autocratic rule and everything else there should not be. The first compromise came with accepting a Common Candidate Sobitha Thera wanted to abolish the Executive Presidency and the Common Candidate the UNP wanted to defeat President Rajapaksa, as one and the same.
That compromise was written into Common Candidate Sirisenas election manifesto as:
The new Constitutional structure would be essentially an Executive allied with the Parliament through the Cabinet instead of the present autocratic Executive Presidential System. (Page 14)
The manifesto also said:
I will not touch any Constitutional Article that could be changed only with the approval at a Referendum. (ibid)Defeating Rajapaksa also required a Government that could stay put for a full term.
It meant the UNP Government with Wickremesinghe as PM installed in 2015 January as the smallest Minority Government in Parliamentary history with just 20 per cent of the MPs had to continue in power.
The required majority for the UNP Government was created on the strength of the new President voted in on UNP and minority votes.
His power to dole out Ministerial portfolios to MPs who actually opposed him at the Presidential elections and represented the party he defected from
to contest against Rajapaksa, held sway.
Collecting the majority for the 100-Day UNP rule, was a crude horse deal the Colombo social activists and the Anti-Rajapaksa lobby accepted with applause as democraticand Constitutional.
True to the election manifesto, there was no abolishing of the Executive Presidency. The leadership of the ruling UNP Government drafted and adopted it the way they wanted. There was no Referendum too.
People were no party to the 19A.
As stressed in these pages many times before, 19A was rushed through with no proper debate and with clauses included at the will of the UNP leadership.
It violated Article 23(1) of the Constitution that says: All laws and subordinate legislation shall be enacted or made and published in Sinhala and Tamil, together with a translation thereof in English.
Democracy was when Tamil MP Praba Ganesan was shouted down by PM Wickremesinghe for requesting a Tamil copy of a clause hurriedly introduced.
He was asked to use the English Copy. There were no Sampanthans or Sumanthirans to demand Tamil copies as a Constitutional Right and no JVP, JHU to demand Sinhala copies.
Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa too allowed its passage without insisting draft copies in all three languages.
The 19th Amendment the Colombo middle-class social activists embrace with pride was written into the Constitution in the most undemocratic, unconstitutional and in a fiercely dictatorial manner.
The UNP Government now continues for four and a half years, on the strength of Article 70(1) that does not allow dissolution of Parliament even if the Budget is defeated and a No Confidence Motion goes through.
Thats not all in 19A. It also allows ghost alliances as National Governments to be propped up to provide ministerial portfolios for MPs bought through horse deals though everyone was shouting hoarse against such horse deals after
October 26.
Once in the Constitution, 19A has to be respected for the sake of Democracy, irrespective of what politics there is. That is precisely why the crisis is yet not over.
That is why a stable Government is not possible and that is also why most nauseating and stinking proposals are made to include the worst corrupt in Cabinet portfolios and for cobbling up hilarious National Governments.
Proposals are made once again to install a national Government with the only SLMC MP in Parliament, who is neither the leader of the party nor its Secretary General. Even if it is dropped, it is yet crude politics of 19A that allows the Constitution to accept such hideous Governments on a resolution adopted in Parliament by a simple majority.
This is not condemned and opposed by urban middle-class saviours of democracy. Constitutional provisions adopted in the most undemocratic and unparliamentary manner written that way to allow deals and crossovers are democratic too when it suits the urban social activists and their funders.
Thus there is no loud opposition to Karunanayake who had to resign on the CBSL bond scam issue, coming back to the Cabinet either by these funded voices.
Bottom line is, all things undemocratic, corrupt and arrogantly autocratic are accepted and tolerated to showcase as saving democracy to keep Rajapaksa out.
That leaves the TNA discredited and condemned among the Northern Tamil polity, with all its promises to have a new Constitution before 31 December 2016 nowhere in the horizon and all daily issues of the ordinary Tamil People left completely ignored by the ITAK leadership.
The conflict that broke into the open on Friday, October 26 night gets dragged on, giving Rajapaksa yet another racist platform with a call to save the Sinhala Buddhist Unitary State.
That leaves Sri Lanka without any serious alternatives discussed and peoples democracy strangled all along with Colombo middle class calls for democracy that does not mean anything to peoples life.

Excerpts:
QProfessor, you were one of the petitioners who filed a case against the gazette issued by President Maithripala Sirisena dissolving Parliament. Was this case filed in your capacity as one of the three Election Commission Members or was it personal What was the reaction of the commission on your move
It was done in both capacities, but primarily as a Member of the Commission. This was reflected in the Petition. When I told Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, he simply shook my hand without saying anything. I interpreted it as a positive encouragement. My colleague Nalin Abeysekere has consistently maintained that we must never disagree in public even if we all do not agree. He therefore regards my action as unethical. I respect his position, but note that it does not leave room for wider debate on important issues and could lead to a tyranny of the majority. We moved from Election Commissioner to a Commission of three through the 19th Amendment so that we may have diversity of ideas.

"The Supreme Court found that period is four and a half years at a minimum. To ask that Government to go away is not only a violation of the peoples franchise, but also of our Constitution"
QWhat made you to file this petition
The Gazette ordering elections was surely misbegotten and unlawful. Not even the President has the authority to order something so brazenly illegal. If I had gone along with conducting the election, it would have been a betrayal of my office and the responsibilities that come with it. And how can I agree to acting against my conscience in doing something I saw as so clearly illegal
The Presidents reading of the Constitution as confirmed by court was selective. Article 33(2) (c) said the President had the power to dissolve Parliament. Article 62 (2) said the normal period of a Parliament is 5 years, but it may be dissolved sooner. Article 70 said any dissolution by the President can only be after the first four and a half years or after a resolution by 2/3 of members.
Instead of looking for a harmonious interpretation, the President looked only at the 33(2)(c) clause. It reminded me of Gods command to Abraham in Genesis 12.1: The LORD had said to Abram, Leave your native country, your relatives, and your fathers family, and go to the land that I will show you. Obviously leaving relatives did not mean leaving his wife. For, in another part of the Bible, Mark 10:7-9, Jesus says A man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. [] Therefore what God has joined together, let no man separate.
A harmonious reading of the Bible meant Abraham taking his wife with him. However, a free-church minister I know left his wife in Negombo and moved upcountry where he took a new wife, justifying his adultery based on Abrahams call from God to leave his kinsfolk to serve Him elsewhere.
Such was an obviously flawed, pathetic, self-serving interpretation offered by our President. It challenged the rule of law and challenged reason itself. I was duty-bound to challenge this scuttling of the Constitution.

	Many Tamils are disturbed over nothing having been done since August 2015 to solve our problems
	
	
	Any collaboration between the TNA and the UNP will be used by Tamil opponents of the TNA to say they are being played for suckers again
	
	
	The military occupation and colonisation of the little part of the country where we are safe during riots must stop
	
	
	Leaders lead and do not hide behind excuses
	
	
	Private lands under military occupation have no justification especially after we have eschewed military methods and have agreed to live in a united country
	
QFormer President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the SLPP are of the view that going for a General Election and giving the people the option to decide on a government is more democratic. Mr. Rajapaksa even went to the point of expressing that the Supreme Courts decision prevented an election. What is your opinion
They are spinning to keep their followers energised. That is politics. However, the people should be wise enough not to be so easily manipulated. The right to vote-in a Government flows from our primary law, the Constitution. It specifies when elections are to be held and for what period the newly elected Governments mandate is. The Supreme Court found that period is four and a half years at a minimum. To ask that Government to go away is not only a violation of the peoples franchise, but also of our Constitution. The right to franchise is like a drivers licence. It gives one the right to drive a car, but that right is circumscribed by laws such as on speed limits, driving on the left, etc. Like the court noted about the AGs claim on the Presidents unfettered power, there is usually no such thing as an unfettered right either  even the right to life has exceptions.

"The Gazette ordering elections was surely misbegotten and unlawful. Not even the President has the authority to order something so brazenly illegal. If I had gone along with conducting the election, it would have been a betrayal of my office and the responsibilities that come with it"
QNow that the main Tamil political collective the TNA has supported Ranil Wickremesinghe to prove its confidence on the premiership in the parliament, parties backing Mahinda Rajapaksa are initiating a propagandist campaign that the UNP is in a deal with the TNA. How would this affect the TNAs popularity among the Tamil community
The TNA is not a party but an alliance. It faces many internal tensions. That aside, there is nothing wrong with making deals. Even Mahinda Rajapaksa offered a deal to settle problems of the Tamils, but refused to set it down in print. Many Tamils are disturbed that nothing has been done since August 2015 to solve their problems. If there is a deal to solve the problems of the Tamils and given that it is honoured, I would jump up in joy. The TNA and Sampanthan face criticism that many deals like the BC pact, the Dudley-Chelva Pact, the District Council arrangement, the Thirteenth Amendment, and the Good Governance Commitment were reneged upon. The difference with the Good Governance Commitment is that it was to all Sri Lankans rather than just to Tamils. That fact gives me hope that something can be salvaged before Parliament runs out. Any collaboration between the TNA and the UNP would be used by Tamil opponents of the TNA to say they are being played for suckers again. The UNP therefore owes it to all Sri Lankans to honour its deals. Dishonouring these commitments will politically decapitate Sampanthan  leaving no one to negotiate with, and leading the way again to calls for separation and calls for a referendum like in Kosovo and East Timor.
QDo you think that the TNA engaging in national issues is a positive sign on the part of the Tamil people and other minority communities
Indeed so. As Sri Lankans we owe everything to Sri Lankas well-being and development. However, it does not stop there. The military occupation and colonisation of the little part of the country where we are safe during riots must stop. The merger of the North and East Provinces which can be simply done must be done to afford us a sense of security. The constitutional right to use Tamil in administration must not be denied. I have been to courts in the North several times and found the police prosecuting in Sinhalese in violation of the Constitution. The Government cannot so violate the constitution and demand that we sign an oath to uphold the Constitution. Tamils in court are forced to rely on lawyers for this reason and incur expenses. The police basically stop us on the A9, speak haughtily in Sinhalese and expect payment. The law, rather than protecting us, becomes a curse.

"The TNA is not a party but an alliance. It faces many internal tensions. That aside, there is nothing wrong with making deals. Even Mahinda Rajapaksa offered a deal to settle problems of the Tamils, but refused to set itdown in print"
QAs Tamil politics seems to be divided under separate leaderships, its looks like the TNA would not be able to secure more seats at a future election. How would this situation could affect the Tamil community
Not well. However, you must excuse me from saying more as a member of the Election Commission. I do, however, usually comment as in some of my comments above, because voter education and strengthening the right to franchise are part of our Commissions mandate.
QYou had told the media that the Tamil community is despondent in the manner in which the 2015 Government behaved and many of its promises given to the Tamil community werent fulfilled. You even said that it feels like the Tamils have been cheated again. What could have the Maithripala-Wickremesinghe Government done to avoid this situation
I have addressed this in part above. Even prior to undertaking a Constitutional revision, there is much that could have been done if there is true goodwill. For example, the full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment giving us our language rights, and police and land powers. Doing this would have given Tamils much of the assurance we need that this is truly one united law-abiding country. A part of that sense of safety we seek is in the temporary merger of the North and East. The Supreme Court judgment that demerged the provinces points to how a temporary merger could be effected again through agreement between provinces. There are political prisoners without trial for periods well beyond what any court would have sentenced them to if they had been tried and found guilty. Keeping them locked up shows that the Government is heartless and communal. This needs urgent rectification. Private lands under military occupation have no justification especially after we have eschewed military methods and have agreed to live in a united country. The delay in repealing the PTA is inexcusable. The attempt to replace it with a law that replicates some of its same draconian features shows the inherent racism of a Government always up to trickery. War criminals and necrophilliacs are not national heroes. They must be tried to show that Tamil lives are as important as those of any other.

"The merger of the North and East Provinces which can be simply done must be done to afford us a sense of security. The constitutional right to use Tamil in administration must not be denied. I have been to courts in the North several times and found the police prosecuting in Sinhalese"
QDont you think that in a backdrop where certain Sinhala nationality based political parties are using the ethnic issue as a trump card to gather Sinhala majority votes, it is hard for any liberal thinking Sinhala Government to survive in the vote game
There is some truth in that, but it is not the complete truth. Even after the 13th Amendment the UNP has won elections. I expect leadership from our politicians. I think Buddhists want respect for Buddhism and do not insist that it is superior to other religions. We also want that same respect for our religions. Unless you assume that the Sinhalese are unreasonable communalists  I dont  I am confident that communal objections can be overcome with reason. Leaders lead and do not hide behind excuses.
Q Once you unsuccessfully tried to promote education in the North by introducing an engineering faculty to the University of Jaffna. Dont you think now that the war is over Tamil academics and investors should visit the North and help education and development
I was chased off by threat of arrest. The then Government working through quislings made it difficult to do anything serious. They have put up an engineering faculty in Kilinochchi where standards are terrible. The university refused to employ me after I returned saying I am unqualified. They fear quality. Worse, they openly said that being a Christian I cannot be recruited. The University Grants Commission (UGC) even undermined my wifes appointment based on an illiterate UGC Circular by which after three years of processing her application, they said the advertisement was wrong so no recruitment may be made. The University Services Appeals Board declared that students have been deprived of two good academics. No one cares, not least the UGC.
So yes, there is scope for using service industries, particularly university education, to develop Jaffna. However, the system has to change for good academics to return. The UGC must stop hiding behind autonomy to allow unqualified favourites to staff our universities and endorsing religious discrimination.

Trump defends chaotic military pullout of Syria
	

President Donald Trump took to Twitter Thursday to defend his sudden announcement to pull U.S. troops out of Syria  and warned ISIS it was doomed! if the terror group hit at the U.S. 
Trump issued the warning just hours after proclaiming we have defeated ISIS in Syria. He also said Russian, Iranian, and Turkish forces who remain would continue to battle ISIS. Despite the presidents claim the military assesses thousands of ISIS fighters remain. 
In a barrage of tweets Trump also said the U.S. was getting NOTHING out of being in Syria, where last year the president ordered air strikes to respond to President Bashar al-Assads use of chemical weapons. 
The presidents pushback against critics comes after members of his own party blasted the sudden announcement he made Wednesday morning, disputed his claims that the U.S. had defeated ISIS, and warned regional powers Russia, Iran, and Turkey stood to gain at U.S. expense. 
Getting out of Syria was no surprise. Ive been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer, Trump wrote. Trump has called for getting out of Syria, including last spring, but his sudden Twitter announcement caught senior Pentagon officials off guard, along with senior lawmakers who are accustomed to getting briefed on major policy decisions and changes in the nations strategic posture and who must be consulted when troops are deployed. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday the U.S. decision to pull out was correct.
