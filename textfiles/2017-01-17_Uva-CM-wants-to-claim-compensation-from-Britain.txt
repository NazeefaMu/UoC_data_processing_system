Uva CM wants to claim compensation from Britain


	

Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake said yesterday he had decided to claim compensation from the British government for the damage caused to the Uva Province during the 1817-1818 rebellion.

He told the media that the loans granted by the World Bank should be set off against the damage caused.

“The proposal will be put forward to the Uva Provincial Council first. President Maithripala Sirisena cancelled the gazette notification by the British declaring 19 national heroes as traitors. More than 14,000 people of Uva had laid down their lives during the rebellion. Even though late in the day we must make an effort to claim compensation. The Uva Province devastated by the British still lags far behind other provinces because of the damage caused by them,” he said. (Palitha Ariyawansa)
