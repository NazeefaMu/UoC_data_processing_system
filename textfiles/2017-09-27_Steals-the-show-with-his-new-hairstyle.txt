Steals the show with his new hairstyle


	



There is a senior purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from an area of Wellassa fame. The electorate he nursed for decades rejected him at the last general polls. However, he could muster enough ‘manape’ to make it to Diyawanna.


This fast aging purohita with a penchant to look young created a mild stir in the council the other day when he appeared sporting a new hair style which, of course, made him look years younger!


The first one in the council to compliment the new look- purohita was the irresistible red party leader Anu. “O! a fine hairdo!” he exclaimed. The purohita’s JO colleagues were the next to express their pleasant surprise.  “Fine! Lovely! Maru! Shok!” were the complimentary epithets they used.   


Meanwhile, some members who appeared to have had given sober thought to the purohita’s new hairstyle said that the purohita was only   wearing a wig on advice given by a lovely one from the medical profession. Several others claimed that the new hairstyle has something to do with his recent visit to Tirupati Kovil in South India.
