Attorney Premanath Dolawatta appearing for Carlton Sports Network (CSN), in the money laundering case,said today the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) was obtaining legal recognition by seeking Court orders on the ongoing investigation.


“According to normal procedure, the FCID summons the suspects if they were required to give a statement on the allegations. But, now the FCID is seeking court orders to direct the suspects to give statements.

The motive is obvious. As we know the matter regarding the legal recognition of the FCID is being argued in the Supreme Court. By getting court orders to summon the suspects, the FCID will be able to use the court orders in future to show that the institute has worked in a legal manner,” he claimed.
