Union Assurance is constantly re-defining its service offerings and the ways in which it interacts with and gets feedback from its key stakeholders. 
In an effort to have closer interactions with its key customers, Union Assurance arranged a series of customer get-togethers during December 2016.  The main aim of organising this kind of events is to make it easier for customers to interact with Company representatives which will pave the way for the initiation of an even stronger customer-centric service going forward.
The first customer get-together took place on the 6th of December 2016 in Chilaw, followed by events in Polonnaruwa (16th December), Batticoloa (18th December), and Nikaweratiya (21st December). The opportunity to participate in these gatherings was opened up to all the Top Union Assurance customers from these areas.
