Convey decision to court: GMOA tells Govt.


	

Though the government has said that SAITM’s medical faculty will be abolished, it has not yet conveyed its decision to Court, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said the crisis would worsen if the government failed to inform court about its stance on this matter.

“If the decision is not conveyed, it might make an impact the court verdict on the case filed by a SAITM graduate requesting the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to provisionally register her,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
