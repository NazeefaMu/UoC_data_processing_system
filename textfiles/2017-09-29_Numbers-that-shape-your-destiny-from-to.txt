We in the previous article discussed the significance of numbers from 41 to 50 determined on the basis of their aggregate numerical value and vibrational or consonance value ascribed to name and date of birth value. 


In this article we propose to discuss the significance of Numbers from 51 to 60.

Number 51: This is a powerful number. The subject is endowed with boldness, drive, motivation and a spirit of adventure - the qualities that an officer in a security force is expected to possess.  The subject is capable of rising to a top position in the military.  But he has to encounter much hostility and opposition.  

Number 52:  This number does not promise good luck, because it can bring struggle and dissention. There would be many obstacles in the way of fulfillment.  Success is hard to come. Failures become the norm.   

Number 53:  This number indicates excessive suspicion and mistrust.  In the case of persons of virtue and learning, this ‘drawback’ would work to their advantage by giving them an increase in their discerning, discriminating and investigative powers.  But in the case of subjects lacking integrity, this trait would manifest in their acts of espionage, frauds etc.

Number 54: The subject is endowed with eloquence and the power of expression. He enjoys long life and good health.  His career becomes a great success.  He runs the risk of sustaining an injury on the leg.

 Number 55: This number signifies leadership. The subject is endowed with boundless energy and drive. Discerning and discriminating powers bring him success.  

Number 56:  This number indicates instability, transiency and inconsistency.  The subject falls victim to cheats and fraudsters.  He suffers due to trust placed in the unreliable members of the opposite sex. 

Number 57:  This number indicates sociability and pleasing manners.  The subject would achieve success due to persistent effort and perseverance. 

Number 58: This number signifies success in activity connected with health, hygiene and sanitation. However, the subject lacks firmness and consistency. 

Number 59:  The subject is involved in travels and communications.  He achieves success in financial endeavours, banking and commercial activity.  He has to resist the tendency to become unscrupulous.  

Number 60:  The number represents success.  The native is endowed with good judgment, resolution and skills to achieve success in legal and medical professions.  He possesses executive skills as well.  The subject has a cheerful demeanor and disposition.  If the subject is mediocre in intellect, he would display defiance to authority.
