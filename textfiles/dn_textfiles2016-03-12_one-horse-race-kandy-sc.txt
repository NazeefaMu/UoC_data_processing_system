One horse race for Kandy SC

It is going to be a one horse race when the defending champions Kandy Sports Club takes on CH and FC in the quarter finals of the Clifford Cup knock out rugby tournament match to be played a the Nittawela Rugby Stadium, Kandy today Secretary at 4.30 pm.
Kandy Sports Club who were unbeaten in the Dialog League will continue to carry on from where they left. They should have no difficulty in overcoming CH and FC playing in their home terrain and before their home crowd.
Last year Kandy Sports Club won both the League and the knock out tournaments after a lapse of three years. This year they will make a determined efforts to give a report performance.
Early this week there some doubts about the match and also the venue. It has been now confirmed that this match will be played today (Saturday) and the venue will be Nittawela.
In the name of neutral venue there is no point in playing this match at a venue outside Kandy as it will, deprive the spectators of witnessing club rugby as the expenses involved in travelling out of Kandy and the lack of public transport for the after the match could make the spectators thing twice before going for the match. If this takes place then the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union will be deprived of a good gate collection and the rugby fans of their entertainment and the match will be played before a deserted stands.
At its most there will be only two more club rugby matches in the hill capital and the officials should seriously think of playing these two matches in the city of Kandy and Nittawela be not necessarily the venue though it is an ideal one as the matches could be witnessed from close range and the security fence prevents the spectators from invading the playing area.
In the past the problem at Nittawela were a creation of armed combatants who pounced on unarmed and innocent spectators. Sine last yea this trend has been stopped and the matches are played peacefully.
