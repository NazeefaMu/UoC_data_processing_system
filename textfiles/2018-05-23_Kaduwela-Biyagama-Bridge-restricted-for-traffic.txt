The vehicular movements along the Kaduwela-Biyagama main bridge were restricted due to a high risk situation, Road Development Authority (RDA) today said.

RDA Project Engineer said the vehicular movements were restricted because of the soil erosion along the Kelani River Bank connecting to the bridge.

“However, one lane is open for vehicular movements,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Police requested motorists to use alternative routes to avoid traffic. (DS)
