PALESTRINA AND THE UPRISING OF CHURCH MUSIC

The fading period of Renaissance made a significant impact for the entry of Giovanni da Palestrina, destined to become the father of sacred and spiritual music of the church. This fusion of style and score, more of a preoccupation, was the time of reverent, lush choral works that awakened the church and so far evaded the interest of composers.
Thus began the seculiar counterparts to church music by masters of Madrigals producing contrapuntal settings of long lines on pastoral subjects.
A closer relationship between seculiar and church music was the cross-pollination that benefitted the development of both and musicians spread its concept through the Burgundian style of learning to all European composers. This development was the result of the royal patronage usurping the church as the most important in the influence of all churches, orthodox or otherwise. This took place in the middle of the fifteenth century and in 1416, Henry of England employed over thirty voices in the Chapel Royal while the Papal Chapel had only nine voices. This fascinating combination began opening its doors to composers' character in music.
Based on this background of new thinking, the stage was set for Giovanni da Palestrina's entry to the world of classical music. He was responsible for the uprising of church music; the spirituality therein that intrigued and amazed all Christian leaders who found the expression to voice what had been hidden within their souls. It was a true medium of bonding worshippers across Europe to their fold. This was in the background of sermons and preachings of priests being far below the attraction or reason for church-goers to continue their presence in prayer sessions or the bland choral singing of the day. The following two hundred years witnessed the invasion of compositions that led to the magnifying church music such as Schubert's AVE MARIA, Mozart's AVE VERNUM CORPUS and the poignant choral works written by several others. There was also the GERMAN REQUIEM scored by Brahms, Mendelssohn's ELIJAH (Rest in the Lord)' A different version of THE REQUIEM by Verdi along with Handel's HALLELUJAH chorus from the MESSAH made their powerful presence in the Church.
It was the iconic Palestrina that excelled in MASS, the elaborate choral setting of the principal ritual of the Roman Catholic Church. It was originally set for unaccompanied chorus like Palestrina's MISSA PAPAE MARCELLI which was an excellent example but later turned to solo, chorus and orchestra. The setting of the ordinary MASS was initiated by Palestrina himself.
Palestrina never related but went on to create extraordinary motets best known as church chorale compositions and set them to Bible text, usually found in Latin. They rested in elabrorate contrapuntal style and meant for three of four voices and unaccompanied. The important aspect of motet as Palestrina tried hard to reveal was that the counterpart of the secular madrigal and the Roman Catholic Church was equalant to the English Anthem.
Giovanni da Palestrina commenced his illustrious musical career as a boy chorister in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome and his first job as an organist at the Julian Chapel while being married with two sons. After dedicating a book of messes containing over a hundred for which Pope Julian III, he was rewarded with the place in the papal choire without the usual audition that caused a stir among his fellow choristers who noted that he did not have a good singing voice. Palestrina was dismissed on the grounds he was a married man by the new Pope, Paul V.
Palestrina who was determine to continue at the Vatican marked his time until a new Pope was named. Till then he was involved in a string of appointments with an offer from the Emporer Maximillan to be the maestro at the Royal Court in Vienna on an exorbitant fee. In no time Palestrina found his dream come true. He was appointed as maestro under the new Pope, Gregory XIII at the Julian Chapel until he died. When his wife and two sons died from the Plague and in desperation, he took decision of entering priesthood but was persuaded otherwise by a wealthy widow of a furrier combining music with real estate management. Palestrina realising he was no innovator other than in music, found himself tempted by the offer and in no time, prospered.
However, he devoted himself to meditation and studied religion as he began writng music for the Church in spiritual purity. Berlioz was one of his severe critics especially on his madrigals that are known as medieval lyrical poems but found nothing in contrapuntal style, generally designed for voices. The counterpart of the liturgical motet was not found in his madrigal and Berlioze further pointed out but acknowledged him as a writer of pure beauty sounds and could not write any other music. Yet, we find forceful expressions in his music that includes 250 motets, 60 sacred, 100 secular madrigals along with lamentations, psalms, litenies and masses.
He is universally accepted as the greatest composer of the Catholic Church and one of the finest masters of classical polyphonic writing. The Vatican used him during the Counter-Reformation when the Church was doing all it could to strike back at the Protestant Movement that called for music to avoid elaborate contrapuntal setting that tended to obscure the words. Palestrina knew exactly what the Vatica wanted which was an ethereal cloud of sound to fill St. Peter's this he achieved and perhaps rewarded because is it here that he was buried with his coffin displaying the epitaph MUSICAE PRINCEPS.
