Former Transport Minister and UPFA MP Kumara Welgama was granted bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate today over illegally paying Rs.3.2 million to the former Vice Chairman of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB).


He was released on a cash bail of Rs 25,000 and two sureties of Rs. 1 million by Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya.


The Magistrate didn’t sign the charge sheet against the MP today due to the preliminary objection raised by the Defence Counsel.  


Magistrate Pilapitiya said he would consider signing of the charge sheet after observing the appointment letter of the former SLTB Vice Chairman. The case was fixed for March 24. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
