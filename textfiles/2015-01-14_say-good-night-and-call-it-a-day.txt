Say good night and call it a day


	


	A scriptwriter was fine tuning a film script that had to be ready within a day or two. He had been working on it for quite some time. Since the shoot had been scheduled in three days, he was making last minute changes in consultation with the author of the story.

Most of the corrections were being done through ‘SMS’. The author, who lived far away, makes a suggestion about some dialogues of a character and the scriptwriter responds. Then he suggests another change. This had been going for some days especially in the nights which annoyed the scriptwriter’s wife.
“There should be some meaning to this. He sends you text messages. You respond and make the amendments and then he sends another message, you reply. There is no end to this. Remember you worked on this script till 4 am yesterday and now it’s almost 2 am. Your author should also understand that you are human,” she grumbled but the scriptwriter hinted that he was vulnerable.
“Even I feel so tired and sleepy but what can I do when the author wants the script and dialogues to be perfect? “
“Ok then listen, when he texts you next time, you reply and just say GOOD NIGHT at the end. That will make him realise it’s time to call it a day,” she suggested.
