Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka today directed IGP Pujith Jayasundera to submit a report within three days into the killing of a Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) officer in a shooting incident at Piliyandala Junction last night.

The minister had asked IGP why the PNB officers had carried out a raid without following laid down procedures.
Meanwhile, the IGP instructed Senior DIG Latheef to prepare the report.

One PNB officer was killed while another officer and three civilians were injured when armed motorcyclists shot at them during a raid carried out by the PNB. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
