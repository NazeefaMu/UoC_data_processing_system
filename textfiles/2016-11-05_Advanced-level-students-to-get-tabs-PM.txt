All students in the advanced level stream will get tabs while university students will be able to buy tabs on a concessionary rate soon, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

Speaking at the Asia Pacific conference of German Business in Hong Kong, he said Sri Lanka has embarked on building a digital economy.

"We have embarked on developing WiFi zones in the country. We are in need of engineers especially in the IT sector. We also need IT training institutions and have kept that sector open," the Prime Minister said.

He said the government is focusing on the manufacturing sector other than infrastructure development. “Earlier we focused on infrastructure development but now we have integrated the manufacturing sector together with infrastructure development," he said.
