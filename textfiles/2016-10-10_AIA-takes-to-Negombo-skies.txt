AIA takes to Negombo skies


	



The skies of Negombo ignited with energy as swarms of red AIA kites soared across the town, at the recently held AIA-in-town programme. 


The city, renowned for sand, sea and sails, was the seventh town visited by AIA for a 5 day programme of creating regional presence whilst engaging and connecting with its people. 


Amidst the business seminars and educational workshops, there was a host of fun-filled activities for children and adults alike. Most importantly all the activities focused on encouraging people to be wise and plan ahead about their futures, be it planning for retirement, the rising cost of education and health services or most importantly, the unforeseen loss of a breadwinner for the dependants.  


Many visitors to AIA’s event realised there was a wide gap between what they will most likely have and the amount they will actually need.  AIA is on 2310310 and has a host of solutions that can help, should you feel the same way.
