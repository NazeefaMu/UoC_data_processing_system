Casualties pile on for Windies

Casualties within the West Indies team continued to increase with wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin becoming the latest victim in the short-list.
"Ramdin is suffering from diarrhea and he returned to the team hotel," said West Indies media manager Phil Spooner yesterday.
"He didn't feel alright this morning and although he came to the ground he was feeling uneasy."
Ramdin was replaced by batsman Jermaine Blackwood with Andre Fletcher taking over the wicket-keeping gloves for the second ODI against Sri Lanka at the R Premadasa Stadium.
West Indies are without their captain Jason Holder for this game serving a one-match suspension for slow over rate in the first ODI.
West Indies have already lost the services of hard hitting fast-bowling all-rounder Andre Russell who is recovering from a strained stomach muscle which he suffered while bowling during the first ODI played at this venue on Sunday.
"Russell is getting better and we are trying to get him to play as a batsman in the next ODI," said Spooner.
In the light of these injuries and suspension West Indies made three changes to their side that lost the first ODI by one wicket.
Holder, Ramdin and Russell were replaced by Jermaine Blackwood, Jason Mohammad and Ravi Rampaul.
The third and final ODI is scheduled to be played at Pallekele on November 7.
