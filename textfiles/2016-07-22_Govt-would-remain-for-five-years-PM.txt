Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asserted yesterday in Parliament the current rule would serve for another five years under the concept of the national unity government.

The Prime Minister, making a statement to the House on the progress of his two-day visit to Singapore early this week, said nobody should have an iota of doubt about it.

"The present national unity government will remain for five more years. There is no doubt about it," he said.

While making his remarks on the projects outlined for the implementation during the period, he even invited Joint Opposition MP Geetha Kumarasinghe to join the government for the remaining period.

He said he would develop tourism zones in the south and asked Ms. Kumarasinghe, as an MP from the area, to join hands with the government.

"Whatever allegation is made, the President and I only intend to ensure a prosperous future for posterity," he said.

Commenting on his visit to Singapore and engagements with its leaders, he said he briefed them about his plan to develop Sri Lanka as a trading hub of the region and upgrade infrastructure in aviation, shipping, energy and communication.

"I briefed them about my plan to create one million job opportunities and a robust middle class. I also apprised them of the proposed Kandy, Colombo and Hambantota economic corridor, the Megapolis plan and the proposed tourism promotion zones in the southern province," he said.

The Prime Minister said investments exceeding 40 billion US Dollars were needed for the Megapolis project and another 10 billion US Dollars for the investments in the Hambantota economic zone.

"This is the largest economic development project in the region. I compare it to the Delhi- Mumbai economic zone," he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
