Cupidity and serendipity for a change!


	



 

The other day, several young Diyawanna members from the two main political strands were engaged in a gossip session in the council lobby. They were swapping banter and laughing merrily when a senior purohita walked past them. 

 


Meanwhile, a talkative one from the Colombo district winked at the passing purohita and muttered with a mischievous smile: “A lucky one!”


Intrigued by this cryptic remark, the others turned to him with a quizzical look.


Now that the passerby- purohita had disappeared, the Diyawanna member who made the remark, incidentally one from Kalutara area, explained: “He is one of the two cupids in the same age bracket who never miss a chance to make a pass at a cutie they happen to come across!”


“What do you know about the exploits of our cupids well past their sixties?” another member challenged. “There are two old guys, who would affectionately hold the hand of a young female, meeting even for the first time…” . He suddenly stopped talking on seeing one old cupid referred to earlier sauntering in their direction.
