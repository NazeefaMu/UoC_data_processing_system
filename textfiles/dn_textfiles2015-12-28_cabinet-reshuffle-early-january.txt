Cabinet reshuffle in early January?

The National Unity Government is exploring the possibility of its first Cabinet reshuffle in early January, highly placed political sources told the Daily News.
Under the Cabinet reshuffle, at least two top ministers are likely to be transferred out of their current ministries, they said. Contacted by the Daily News, a senior Cabinet minister said a Cabinet reshuffle was a matter between the President and the Prime Minister. "We, as ministers, are not privy to such discussions," he claimed.
However, sources close to the President and the Prime Minister said both leaders were of the same view about the matter.
There have been discussions about possible successors of the ministers who will be transferred out of their current positions, they added.
"There were some ministers whose conduct came under criticism from various parties for multiple reasons. Some even ran into problems with senior party officials.
Decisions made by some ministers had to be overturned by the President and the Prime Ministers, using their authority. This is one key reason behind the possible Cabinet reshuffle," authoritative government sources explained.
Meanwhile, four members of the 'joint opposition' formed by UPFA dissidents, are expected to join the National Unity Government in early January, accepting ministerial and deputy ministerial portfolios.
A UPFA spokesman said the defection of the four MPs would be heavy blow to the fledgeling 'joint opposition' formed to back former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's political campaign.
At least one of the defectors will receive a Cabinet portfolio from President Sirisena, SLFP sources said.
