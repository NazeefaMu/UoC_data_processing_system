For him they were minor incidents


	

An incident where a civilian was killed when an official firearm was turned on him triggered a big public outcry in the country recently. When a politico questioned an authority responsible for maintaining law and order about the incident, the latter had replied: “O! That was a minor incident.”




When the politico again questioned the law and order authority about a serious breach of peace committed by those who staged a protest against the killing, pat had come the authority’s reply: “That too was a minor incident!”


Irked by these perfunctory replies, the politico had remarked: “For you they are minor incidents! But they nearly set the entire country on fire!”
