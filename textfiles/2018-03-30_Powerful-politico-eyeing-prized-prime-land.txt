A leading politico is said to have taken the initiative to establish a pub on a park located close to a leading Buddhist Girls’ school, they say.

 


The park now being used as a playground by the children from homes in the neighborhood is said to be highly prized prime land which could be put to a much better use than as a park and the prominent politico who had realized its land value has planned to take it over with the intention of transferring its ownership to a sibling, informed ones say.
