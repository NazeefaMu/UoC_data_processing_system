The Kandana Police had caught a 17-year-old school girl, in uniform, driving a school van and had stopped the van and taken her into police custody yesterday (20).

The Traffic OIC of the Kandana Police had spotted the young school girl driving the vehicle and dropping off several students off at several schools in the area. He had followed the van and when she stopped to drop another batch of students off he had requested her to hand over her license and registration. When she admitted that she did not possess a valid driving license he had asked her to come along with her mother to the police station to collect the registration book of the vehicle, which he confiscated.
