Gampola Zahira College completed 75 (1942-2017) years of serving the nation through education. Gampola Zahira College has been one of the leading schools for many years not only in the Central Province, but also in the entire country. It has a proud history and has made a name in many fields.   

Gampola Zahira College was founded on 15th May 1942 by late T. B. Jayah with just 185 students and four teachers using a make shift hut. The start was small because of World War II. The bombing by the Japanese in Colombo forced T.B. Jayah to take some students from Colombo Zahira to Gampola. With the support of a few Muslim educationists and philanthropists, who were living in Gampola, he was able to establish a school in Gampola.   

At present this school has been transformed into one of the leading Institutions in the hill capital. This is a mixed school and offers an education in three mediums ( English, Sinhala and Tamil ). The population of the school is over 3000. All these successes have been  possible due to the untiring efforts of the school’s founders. Special mention must be made of the founder architect Dr. Al Haj Badi-Ud-Din Mahmud who was the Principal at the very early stage of the school. He later became the Minister of Education and took the school’s development into his hands. 

The school has planed many activities and projects to marks the 75th Anniversary. All these worthwhile projects will be held throughout 2018. The biggest event is the ‘Anniversary Walk’ which is scheduled for January 20 (Saturday) in Gampola. Students, teachers, parents and most importantly thousands of past pupils are eagerly awaiting to witness this event.   

The Past Pupils Association of the college was established in 1967. The association, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, has contributed immensely towards the development of the school. It has grown in numbers and many branches have been opened during the past 11 years. Gampola Zahira College Union in Colombo, Past Pupils Association Qatar and the Past Pupils Association UAE are some of the branches. Efforts are being taken to establish branches in Australia and UK too.   

“As members of the Past Pupils Association we have been an integral part of the college for the last 50 years and supported in the development activities of the college. The past few years have been marked with great progress. This is true with every field at the school.  The school has excelled academically, in sports and extracurricular activities and much has been done in terms of infrastructure development. The present principal A. L. Siraj, who assumed duties two years ago, is working very cordially with the Past Pupils Association, Parents and well wishers to develop the college’’ President of the Association Ameer Ahamed said.  

“It gives me great happiness to say that we have been able to produce good results so far at the Grade 5 scholarships, GCE O/L, GCE A/L exams. There have been achievements at football, cricket, netball, rugby and indoor games. A big thanks should go to our dedicated teachers, parents and most importantly the Past Pupils,” the school’s principal A. L. Siraj said.   

He also noted that due to these achievements the demand for admission to the school has increased by almost threefold. 

January 20th is going to be a day to remember for all Gampola Zahirians. They will flock together from all around the world to take part in the ‘Anniversary Walk’.  There will also be a fellowship which is organized at the college on the same day as the walk.  Arrangements have been made to have a sports meet for past pupils.
