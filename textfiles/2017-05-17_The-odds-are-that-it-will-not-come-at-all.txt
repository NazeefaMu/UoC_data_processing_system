The odds are that it will not come at all


	



 

The sensation created by the much talked about reshuffle of the pack that has been getting postponed for the last months is likely to end up as a damp squib, they say. 

 


 The Green party responsible for postponing the move has now virtually aborted it, they say. 
Government had for the last time vowed to carry out the reshuffle on the eve of the Vesak Poya.  However, the Green party had again put a spoke in the wheel. 


The Green party leadership had pointed out that now that they had already made seating arrangements in keeping with recognized protocol norms at the receptions to be accorded to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both at national level and local level, any changes in the top team at this stage would send the seating arrangements haywire and that would reflect on the national unity government. And this argument had done the trick at this time round and Number One is said to have again deferred the event indefinitely, they say.
