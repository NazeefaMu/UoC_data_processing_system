Next request will carry an international label!


	



 

Several political characters had been trying their best to persuade the onetime master willow-wielder Sanga to contest the upcoming big poll without success.

 


Greatly inspired by the recent case of another master willow wielder of another country winning high office, these characters have now redoubled their persuasive efforts to bring our master willow wielder to the centre-stage.  


However, in a move to discourage his self-appointed patrons, Sanga had posted a comment on his Facebook page vowing that he would never enter politics and that he had decided to dedicate his ‘second innings for the success of his family life.’


Nevertheless, the interested parties, instead of calling it quits had approached several foreign envoys based in Colombo for their backing.  Diplomats from a powerful Asian country and two European countries had been among those who had pledged their co-operation.


So, all present indications are that the next request to Sanga would be a very weighty one carrying an international label which is expected to produce the effect of a brainwash on him, they say.
