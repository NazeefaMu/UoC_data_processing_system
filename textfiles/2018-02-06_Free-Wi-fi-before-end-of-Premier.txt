Free Wi-fi before end of 2018: Premier


	

Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday vowed to provide free public Wi-fi facilities before the end of the year.

He said that the facility would be implemented in April for the first time and each village would be connected by the end of the year.

While addressing a United National Party (UNP) election rally in Puttalam he said operating a mobile phone without Wi-fi facility had become one of the biggest issues.

“Everyone has a smart phone but there is an issue with getting access to data. Once the facility is implemented every one can access the internet. We will see what will happen after giving free Wi-fi,” Premier Wickremesinghe said.

“Parents however do not like providing free Wi-fi for youth. Can’t imagine what the girls would do on free Wi-fi.

“We had been in the Opposition for ten years. Do we have to go back there? Do we need to create a ‘Pohottu’ era,” he said.

The Premier requested people who participated at the rally to vote for the UNP to continue the work after the election. (Chatruanga Samarawickrama)
