Kelani river pollution
Coca Cola pays Rs 132 m as compensation

The Coca Cola Company has paid approximately Rs 132 million to three government bodies as compensation for polluting the Kelani river.
The company paid Rs 131 million to the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWS&DB), Rs 1.5 million to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and Rs 177,000 to the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA).
An NWS&DB official confirmed the receipt of a cheque amounting to Rs 131 million from the Company as compensation for damages from oil contamination to the Kelani river, the main source of drinking water for the Colombo District, on August 17.
She said the incident caused heavy damage to the Ambatale Treatment Plant, adding that the repairs to it would be carried out from the compensation received.
CEA Chairman Prof. Lal Mervin Dharmasiri said it has received Rs 1.5 million to recover its expenses incurred for research and other activities carried out following the incident.
He noted the Environmental Protection License (EPL) issued to the Company’s bottling Plant at Biyagama was temporarily suspended following the incident, but, it was conditionally restored subject to implementation of the recommendations made by them.
Accordingly, the manufacturing operations at the plant were resumed on September 1. MEPA Chairman Ranjith Meegaswatte noted the company had been paid Rs 177,000 to recover its expenses to clean the water body after the leakage of diesel from a fuel pipe line of the company.
Heavy public protest was directed toward the Coca Cola Company following the oil contamination incident which inconvenienced the consumers of water in the metropolitan city. Water supply to the Colombo, Dehiwela, Mount Lavinia and Kotte Municipal Council areas were restricted on August 17 and 28 due to oil contamination in the Kelani River.
In a press statement following the issue, the Coca-Cola Company reaffirmed its commitment to the country and the consumers, and regretted the accident while assuring to take measures to prevent such an occurrence in the future.
