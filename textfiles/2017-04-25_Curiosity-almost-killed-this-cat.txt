Curiosity almost killed this cat


	



 

It was truly a political cat! This cat had been a familiar sight to journos covering the regular media briefings of a certain political party.

 


The cat would appear from nowhere at the usual venue when the briefing gets underway and would remain there attentively following the proceedings until they call it a day. 


Though the cat was a welcome distraction to the news people attending the briefing, the party organizers looked on this ‘uninvited observer’ as a nuisance. 


They had discussed several ways of getting rid of the cat including a few which were rather cruel and finally decided to lock up the cat in an adjoining room until the conclusion of the media briefing. 
The cat now forced to remain behind closed doors whenever a media briefing is held, does not screech or scratch as if it has resigned itself to the punishment, they say.
