Asian Alliance Insurance, that is part of the Softlogic Group, has strongly re-affirmed its reputation as the country’s most innovative and digitally savvy insurer, by unveiling new innovations aimed at significantly increasing customer convenience of both Life and Motor Insurance policyholders.
 
Motor insurance customers are now able to conveniently purchase Click2Claim Motor insurance online from Asian Alliance Insurance by simply filling out the relevant form online and making the payment. 
Payment mechanisms include payment by credit card but also include ‘cash against delivery’, where a company representative will call over at the customer’s residence or office to collect the payment, if that is the chosen mode of payment. The process of purchasing motor insurance has been made unbelievably easy and hassle-free, that can be executed 24X7 from any device including mobile phones, iPads and other similar devices, Laptops or Desktops, at any time of the day from any location.
The convenience of purchasing Click2Claim Motor insurance matches the convenience delivered by the product in   the event of an accident, as it enables customers to submit accident claims via the smartphone app and have the payment credited to their bank accounts within the same day (after approving the settlement amount). Click2Claim offers unparalleled benefits ideally suited to the hectic lifestyles of today’s customers by eliminating the need for waiting for assessors to visit etc. 
The newly introduced ‘Click4Life’ smartphone app enables Life insurance policyholders to handle many needs pertaining to their policies via their smartphones, thus acting in the capacity of a ‘digital insurance advisor’. Click4Life, which android users can easily install through the ‘play store’ and Apple users via iTunes, enables convenient payment of premiums at any time (thus reducing the possibility of policies lapsing) and intimation of hospitalization claims. 
Customers can also access their personal information and change contact details if required and in addition obtain a range of information on their policies including the type of the policy, terms, payment mode, commencement date and benefits. Various documents such as tax letters, surrender value certificates, embassy letters, premium summaries, payment history and bonus summaries can also be requested through the app. Customers can register for the App using their National Identity Card (NIC) numbers, following which an authentication is sent via SMS. The customer can access Click4Life using this password thereafter.
“These latest innovations reaffirm Asian Alliance Insurance’s strong commitment to continuously enhance customer convenience and flexibility via latest technology and the company’s status as the country’s pioneer in digital innovation in the insurance industry,” Asian Alliance Insurance PLC Managing Director, Iftikar Ahamed said. “Soon we wish to empower all customers to access and handle all types of insurance policies online, thereby improving cost-effectiveness in the long run and extending insurance products to even customers in the farthest parts of the country, whom the conventional ‘brick and motor’ channels may find it challenging to reach.”
“We feel that online insurance will grow exponentially in the coming years. Thus, Asian Alliance will continue to invest strongly in enhancing technology-related infrastructure and the growth that we have experienced, particularly in Life insurance, indicates that this strategy is already paying dividends,” 
Ahamed added. 
Besides the recent innovations, Asian Alliance Insurance was the country’s first insurer to enable intimation of motor insurance claims via a mobile app (with Click2Claim) and introduce self-service Insurance Kiosks for both Motor and Life policyholders, as well a ‘Drive Thru’ to enable customers to renew or obtain Motor insurance. The company also empowered its high-performing Sales Advisors to act as Field Underwriters (enabling high value policies to be offered with minimum underwriting requirements) and launched the ‘Asian Alliance Digital Academy’ – an online portal which offers various educational resources to those interested in insurance.
