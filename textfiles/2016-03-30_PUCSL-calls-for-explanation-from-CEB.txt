The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday called for explanations from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for announcing a schedule for power cuts without the approval of the PUCSL.

Sending a letter to the CEB, PUCSL Chairman Saliya Mathew said the CEB was required to obtain prior approval from the Commission for scheduled interruptions according to the Transmission and Bulk Supply Licence.

“However, it appears that the Transmission Licencee is scheduling and carrying out interruptions and therefore had violated and had not complied with the condition of the said Transmission and Bulk Supply Licence,” he said in the letter dated on March 29.

The PUCSL called for explanations from the CEB within a week from the date of the letter explaining the reason for violation and to fully abide and comply with the licence conditions in future.

The CEB on Monday announced a daily three-hour power cut from March 28 till March 31 and withdrew its statement, which included a detailed schedule of power cuts, soon after it was published on the CEB website.

Power and Energy Ministry Spokesman later said the announcement was a mistake and would be withdrawn soon. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
