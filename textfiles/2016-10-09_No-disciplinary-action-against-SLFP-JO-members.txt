Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Organizer Mahinda Amaraweera said the party leadership had no intention of taking disciplinary action against members who work with the Joint Opposition and organize meetings and gatherings against the current government. 

“We don’t really care about small meetings and gatherings organized by the Joint Opposition because it is a normal phenomenon seen in an opposition party. President Maithripala Sirisena and I will never leave room for members to divide the party or leave it,” Minister Samaraweera said at an event held in Angunkolapellessa today.


 He was of the opinion that reportedly the number of those flocking around the Joint Opposition was now decreasing.
