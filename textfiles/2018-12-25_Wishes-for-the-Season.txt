Wishes for the Season


	

 As we are celebrating the joy of Christmas and New Year, it is also important to know and understand the significance of celebrating festivals. It is a fact that Christmas is celebrated as the day of the birth of Jesus Christ into this world, yet it also symbolizes a very deeply significant truth of the spiritual life, birth of Jesus Christ reminds everyone a birth of divinity, the life of Jesus reminds a life of sacrifice and transformation, and His death reminds us a life of immortality. 


Jesus was born at a time when ignorance, superstition, greed, hatred and hypocrisy prevailed upon the land. Purity was forgotten, morality was neglected. Therefore birth of Christ brings a message from God, the Almighty about a world that existed long before the birth of Jesus Christ, a world which was created by God Himself, a world of Truth where there was total purity, peace and happiness experienced by the humanity. On the basis of creation and the nature of world cycle such a world has to be re-established by God Himself with the co-operation of own transformation with heavenly nature. Every festival is a call for finishing the difference of cast, creed, religion, language and nationality with the vision of brotherhood and to live a life of happiness and also to help other creation to live in peace.

Let us come together in bringing up such a world transformation where human beings, animals, plants and nature are in peace and serve each other to their best. Such transformation is only possible when we connect ourselves with the Almighty in His real form of light and might and empower the selves with Godly powers of purity, peace, love, truth and bliss, while worshipping not to forget to become worthy. 


Self-transformation of every one of us with intense spiritual efforts will definitely bring about world transformation. Anger becomes our great enemy to achieve targets, attachment destroys happiness, arrogance parts you from the rest of the world, greed makes life miserable, lust finishes all truth in life… let us strive hard to destroy them in the coming year and be blessed with all happiness in life.
