Govt. must counter CBK remarks: GL


	

Former External Affairs Minister G.L. Peiris said today the Government should counter the remarks allegedly made by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga that Sri Lanka’s armed forces personnel continued to sexually abuse war victims.

He said the remarks made by the ex-President, who heads the Office for National Unity & Reconciliation (ONUR), were of serious nature and could be used against Sri Lankan forces at the upcoming UNHRC session in Geneva. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
