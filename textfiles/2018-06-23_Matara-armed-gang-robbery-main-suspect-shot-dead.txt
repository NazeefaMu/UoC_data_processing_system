Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the suspect was taken to recover his hidden clothes bag at around 7.15 a. m today. 

“He attempted to hurl the hand grenade which was inside the bag and was injured when a police officer shot at him. The suspect, who was a resident of Veyangoda, succumbed to injuries after he was hospitalised,” SP Gunasekara said.
