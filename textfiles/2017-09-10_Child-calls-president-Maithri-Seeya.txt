Child calls president ‘Maithri Seeya’


	


A pleasant scene was witnessed by many at a public function attended by President Maithripala Sirisena this afternoon in Kawudulla, where a little girl that sprang from the crowd fondly approached the President by calling him “Maithri Seeya”. The child was first obstructed by the President’s bodyguards but was soon allowed to proceed when the President himself gestured at his guards ‘alright’. The little girl who jumped into the first citizen’s lap comfortably remained to be there ‘chit chatting’ with her new found friend until the programme was concluded.  Pix by K.G.Karunaratne
