It’s been a year, I don’t know how,

Where did the time go, please come back to us now 
 You’re always in our thoughts and in our hearts, 
 Wish we could go back to the start 
 An empty house, your empty chair, 
 Your loving presence, no longer there 
 Broken hearts, tears in our eyes, 
 A year gone without you, how did we get by 
 Happy memories in our mind, 
 But the day you left us, how much we have cried 
 The times we shared, the laughs we had together, 
 Things that we miss and always will remember 
 A beautiful soul, no one can compare, 
 Why did you leave us, why is life so unfair? 
 Missing your laugh that we will never hear again, 
Our worlds have changed, nothing has been the same 
 We miss that sweet smile on your face 
 And the warmth of your loving embrace 
 That’s all we have to hold on to, 
 Sweet memories that are of you 
 To have one last hug and one last kiss 
 That would be our greatest wish 
 And to have you here with us today, 
 Why did you leave your daughters this way? 
 A father’s touch, a father’s kiss, 
 A grieving daughter, you’re greatly missed. 
 There’s a place in our hearts no one can fill, 
 We miss you sweet GG and always will.
