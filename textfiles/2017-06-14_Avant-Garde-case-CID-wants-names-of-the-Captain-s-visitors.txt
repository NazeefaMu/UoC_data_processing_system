Avant Garde case: CID wants names of the Captain's visitors


	

The CID has sought Court approval to obtain the names including those of lawyers, who visited the Captain of Avant Garde while he was held in remand custody.

The Captain's attorney strongly objected to this request when it was taken up by Galle Chief Magistrate A. Nishantha Pieris.

He said there was no precedent for such a request.

The Judge instructed the CID officials to submit the Attorney General’s advice at the next hearing on August 24. Attorney A.P.G. Sarathchandra appeared for the ship's captain. (D.G. Unawatuna)
