The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it was dangerous to go for an election under a government which obtained power through unconstitutional means and stressed the need to rectify the present political crisis before going for a national election.

JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva told a news conference that the approval of a two-thirds majority in parliament should be obtained after rectifying this unconstitutional political coup before announcing an election.

“It is dangerous if someone goes for an election after obtaining power through unconstitutional means. If an election was announced under this unconstitutional government, it will be clearly construed as a part of this political coup," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
