NDB Wealth Islamic finance seminar in progress 

Expert financial planner – NDB Wealth – hosted an Islamic finance seminar for present and future investors to commemorate the recent visit of Mufti Shafique Jakhura, the highly respected Muslim legal authority, which oversees the NDB Wealth Islamic Money Plus Fund. 


Islamic finance is widely considered the fastest growing area of the global financial services sector.  
During his in-depth and informative presentation, titled ‘Islamic Economic Principles - Introduction and Practical Applications’, Jakhura educated the local investors about the history, principles and values of Islamic finance, touching upon areas such as introduction to Shariah, basic Islamic economic principles, fundamental Islamic commercial principles, history of Islamic finance and Current trends in Islamic finance, amongst others. This was later followed by opportunities for participants to interact with him, to get their specific questions answered, as well as refreshments and fellowship.


Commenting, NDB Wealth CEO Prabodha Samarasekera said, “The visit of the highly-respected Jakhura was an excellent opportunity to create awareness amongst present and future investors of the NDB Wealth Islamic Money Plus Fund, a money market fund, which is compliant with the Shariah principles. Additionally, this seminar also allowed NDB Wealth to outline the financial planning expertise available for investors planning to build their wealth while adhering to Shariah principles.”
An excellent alternative to a Mudarabah savings account or any Shariah compliant deposit, the NDB Wealth Islamic Money Plus Fund places its investor’s funds solely in Shariah compliant securities, which are continually monitored by an independent Shariah supervisory board.

As with all wealth funds from NDB Wealth, the income from this fund is also completely tax free in the hands of the investor, with the investor’s cash accessible to them at any time and no penalties or fees levied on early withdrawals.


“Our many new innovations, such the NDB Wealth Islamic Money Plus Fund, are excellent entry points for fledgling investors, which will introduce them to the many opportunities available once they partner with NDB Wealth. Importantly, we also offer the added benefit of our industry-leading expert financial planners who are able to provide their expertise as needed to continue to grow investments at later stages,” added Samarasekera.
