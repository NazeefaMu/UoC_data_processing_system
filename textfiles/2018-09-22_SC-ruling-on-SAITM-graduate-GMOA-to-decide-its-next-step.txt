The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said yesterday it would take decisive steps next week in connection with the Supreme Court upholding the Appeal Court ruling which had directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register MBBS graduates of SAITM.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that their counsel were currently studying the facts included in the judgment and that the GMOA’s emergency Central Committee which was scheduled to meet next week would decide on this matter.

“President Maithripala Sirisena said recently the government had solved the ‘SAITM garbage dump’. The government has decided to abolish SAITM owing to many defects of its standards. Even an Act was passed in Parliament securing the future of SAITM students. However, the situation has changed now,” he said.

He said they would further discuss these matters with President Sirisena. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
