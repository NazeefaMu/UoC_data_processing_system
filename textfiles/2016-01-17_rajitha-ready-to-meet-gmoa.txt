Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne today said he was ready to face the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) in Court if they decided to sue him over the Malabe Private Medical University.
The GMOA on Friday said that it would take legal action against Minister Senaratne and Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama for permitting the Private Medical University students to perform clinical training at government hospitals.
Minister Senaratne said the decision to allow the university's students to train at State hospitals was taken following Court order and that it was not a decision of him or ministry's secretary.
"We carried out a order given by the Court and there's nothing the GMOA or others can do about it. They attempted to involve in the case as a third party but it was rejected by the Court. If they want to take the matter into Court, let them do it. I'm ready to face them," he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
