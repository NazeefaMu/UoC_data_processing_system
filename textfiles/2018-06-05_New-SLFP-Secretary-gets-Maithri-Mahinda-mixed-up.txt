New SLFP Secretary gets Maithri, Mahinda mixed up


	

The newly appointed General Secretary of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Professor Rohana Lakshman Piyadasa, inadvertently referred to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the leader of his party in his maiden remarks to the press after assuming duties.

Interestingly, incumbent SLFP leader President Maithripala Sirisena was also present when Professor Piyadasa made these remarks.

It appeared to be a slip of the tongue as he corrected himself immediately.
