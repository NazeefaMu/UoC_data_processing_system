Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament today that the Supreme Court had held the Exchange Control Amendment Bill to be consistent with the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

He said the Supreme Court had recommended the rectification of some minor shortcomings.

Meanwhile, three petitions had been filed in the Supreme Court against the Bill.

The Bill sought to name the Central Bank as the agent of exchange control and to allow a person to use his or her foreign assets to pay for any transaction in or outside Sri Lanka.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
