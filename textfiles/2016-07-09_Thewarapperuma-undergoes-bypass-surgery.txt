Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma has undergone a bypass surgery at a private hospital in Colombo yesterday.

The Deputy Minister attempted to commit suicide on June 3 after he staged a hunger-strike outside the Meegahathenna Primary school in protest against the non-admission of 10 students to the school after which he was admitted to the Nagoda Hospital and later transferred to a private hospital in Colombo.

Mr. Thewarapperuma, who was arrested on charges of unlawful assembly and illegal entry to the school, was remanded and released on bail last Thursday.
