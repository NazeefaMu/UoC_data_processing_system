The joint opposition’s economic research unit yesterday urged the government to cancel the primary dealer licence of Perpetual Treasuries Limited allegedly connected to the Central Bank bond scam.

Addressing a media briefing, joint opposition member Prof. G.L. Peiris said the first step which would be taken after the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report was to cancel the primary dealer licence of this company as it had been proved that it was directly connected to the Central Bank bond scam.

Prof. Peiris also said it was surprising that Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy had complained to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) regarding the disclose of a secret document belonging to the Central Bank under the supervision of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

“Mr. Coomaraswamy has complained the CID to investigate this matter which had disclosed information related to the Central Bank bond sale scam. The government is attempting to find out those who had disclosed it instead of penalizing the wrongdoers,” he added.

Meanwhile, joint opposition MP Bandula Gunewardena said apparently there was a loss of Rs. 1, 000 billion incurred by the government from the Central Bank bond sale scam through the Perpetual Treasuries Limited which had being taken place between February 27, 2015 and March 2016.
