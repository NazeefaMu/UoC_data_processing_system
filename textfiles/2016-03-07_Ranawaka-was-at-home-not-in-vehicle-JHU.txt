The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today its General Secretary, and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka was not in his vehicle at the time of the Rajagiriya accident.

“Minister Ranawaka was at his official residence at the time of the accident,” Party National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said responding to a question at a news conference.

He said certain media institutions and MPs such as JHU breakaway Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa were attempting to tarnish the image of Minister Ranawaka by misusing the incident.

“These are the people who have cases against them at the CID and other courts. But today MP Gammanpila is holding news conferences displaying maps to depict how the incident had occurred. It appears he is the one who seems to be judging the incident today,” he said.   

Meanwhile, Legal consultant of the party, Tudor Perera claimed the two youths who met with the accident, had told the Police in their first statement that Minister was not in the vehicle.

He denied commenting further on the matter saying it was unethical to comment more since the Minister was yet to make a statement to the Police.

“The Police are still probing the accident and if a requirement arises, they will summon the Minister to record a statement,” he said.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
