Though frustrated, Sri Lankan fans still have to back the Cricket team and push them to work harder, former cricket Captain Mahela Jayawardena said today.

In a tweet, he said, “I can understand the frustration of all Sri Lankan fans and I am also one of you. We still have to back the team and push them to work harder,”

“Looking at all the social media jokes and criticism on the team. Yes, they played poorly but let’s not get personal. It’s a sports. More soul searching to do and find solutions. That’s the way forward,” he said.

Sri Lanka, who lost the opening match to Bangladesh by 137 runs in Dubai, was knocked out from the Asia Cup Series by Afghanistan on Monday.
