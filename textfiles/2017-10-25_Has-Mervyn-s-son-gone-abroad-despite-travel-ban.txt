The Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Ramanayke Weligodapitiya ordered the Colombo Crimes Division yesterday to inquire and report whether Malaka Manoj Silva son of former Minister Mervyn Silva had gone abroad violating the ban on foreign travel imposed on him by courts and thereby committed an act of contempt of courts.

Malaka Manoj Silva is the first suspect in the case of assault on a foreign couple at a Night Club in Bambalapitiya and when this case was called up for hearing yesterday, it was revealed that the suspect had gone abroad and photographs related to his visit had been released on his face book account through internet.
When this matter was brought to the notice of the courts by Attorney Shavendra Rodrigo who appeared for the aggrieved parties, the Magistrate issued this order accordingly.
Malaka Silva who was remanded on November 1, 2014 was later released on bail. (Nimanthi Ranasinghe)
