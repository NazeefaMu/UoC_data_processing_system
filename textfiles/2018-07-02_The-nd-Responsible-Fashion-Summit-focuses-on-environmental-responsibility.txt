There is greater need now in the world of fashion to redefine sustainability and to bring solutions that are relevant to the issues that the global fashion industry is facing. The Responsible Fashion Movement was set up in 2017 to do just that. It first defined the current need by identifying 08 impact areas that could be the base from where the solutions will flow. These impact areas will be the pillars of development or movement. One of the key objectives defined was that Knowledge will be converted into Action. So that through the action the solutions are visible. The Summit will take place on the 4th of July at Shangri-la Hotel Colombo at Lotus Ballroom at 9am.

To make the solutions visible a high level knowledge sharing platform was required and this became the birthplace for the Responsible Fashion Summit. This was the thought leadership arm of the movement. The first Responsible Fashion Summit was launched in March 2018. The focus of the first summit broadly was the societal impact and the environmental impact, with a theme ‘A New Normal’. This was the step the industry wanted to take in Sri Lanka and show it as the shining light in region by leading this inclusive movement for the bigger good of the environment.

"This is a defining Movement for Sri Lanka, Asia and Rest of the world, as our mandate for impact is unique and is very relevant to the global issues that the fashion supply chain is facing, and Sri Lanka is perfectly placed to take the lead in the region. " Says Ajai Vir Singh, Founder of The Responsible Fashion Movement
