DS Senanayake OBU motor rally on Saturday

The DS Senanayake Old Boys Union’s (OBU) much looked forward to fund raising motor rally will take place on Saturday, January 9.
The motor rally which was the first such motor sports event started by an Old Boys Association has been held annually since 2004 and is a much looked forward event in the school’s OBU calendar.
The rally run on the Time-Speed-Duration (TSD) format will witness about 60 vehicles starting out from the school premises along a specified route covering approximately 135km to conclude at the Laya Leisure Resort at Kukuleganga.
The event has grown in interest among the old boys and over the years has grown in numbers and standard with the event nearing a professional TSD rally.
Approximately 60 competitiors are expected to traverse a route covering gravel and tarmac roads suited for cars and jeeps along the scenic outskirts of major cities such as Homagama, Gelanigama, Mathugama and Bulathsinhala. Although the event is held as a competition, the focus is on fun and friendship.
With the growing standards of the event, the OBU has outsourced the conduct of the event to the Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC) this year. CMSC is the oldest motor sports club in Sri Lanka with experience in conducting one of the oldest rallies in the country and is affiliated to FIA, the international governing body for motor sports.
The drivers will be given their route instructions on a professional easy to understand tulip charts to navigate the course based on a time plan and have to check in at secret check points. The drivers will be awarded debit points for failure to observe the TSD instruction and the competitor with the least debit points will be declared the winner. The rally plotting team will register the drivers at checkpoints through a mobile QR (Quick-Response) code system that will relay the check-in time to the rally control in order to ensure speedy results processing and accuracy.
