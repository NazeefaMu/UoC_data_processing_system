A black one vents his fury on a white one


	



 

A Green stalwart having his political base in the city and now in the throes of a crisis castigated a very high state banking authority at a recent high-level party meeting, they say.

 


A large majority had not liked the attack on the high official whose integrity is considered above question, but they had silently suffered the harangue until a purohita hailing from a political family in the upcountry challenged the big man from the city. “Don’t criticize respectable people to cover up your own sins!” 


Later several members had endorsed what the upcountry purohita said and finding that he had incurred the displeasure of even the party heavyweights, the city politico now under a cloud wound up and sat down, they say.
