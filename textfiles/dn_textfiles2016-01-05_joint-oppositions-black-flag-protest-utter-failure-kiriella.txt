Joint Opposition's Black Flag protest an utter failure - Kiriella

The people of this country have given their verdict to the Joint Opposition who attempted to show the Government their protest by hoisting black flags.
Today, green flags were hoisted congratulating the Government," said Leader of the House/Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Minister Lakshman Kiriella. The minister expressed the following views at an inauguration of a few road projects in the Gampola area yesterday (3). The minister further said further: "This country at present has an ethical government. Under the 19th Amendment, the Judiciary is now independent. The Police and State Services are functioning without any political interference. Law and Democracy is operational. It is because of this type of a ruling system that a certain MP is against. He urged people of this country to raise black flags on January 1st.
The people of this country have given their verdict to the Joint Opposition who tried showing their protest to the Government by raising black flags. So, did the people raise any black flags? Not one black flag was raised. Finally, those who said that they would raise black flags went to Facebook to raise black flags. Even that was unsuccessful. Today, green flags were raised congratulating the Government, instead of the black flags. The Opposition has no news at all to giveaway these days. But there was a lot of news during the previous government's rule. White vans kidnapping people, officers being tied to trees, sentencing General Sarath Fonseka to jail and the killing of journalists were some of the the news headlines during the previous rule. But today, there are no such things.
Today the country has a free and peaceful environment. "Last week a group of journalists had told an Opposition MP that there were no news items to write and for him to call a press briefing and say something. Two MPs agreed to do so. But one MP backed out. The other MP finally had nothing to say as well." Today the country is following the 'Dasarajadharma Principle'. What we wish was to create a civilized country. What we wish was to create a country we could be proud of. Everything should not be measured with a price tag. The greatest victory we could bring to our country is to safeguard our democracy through law and justice." Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayarathna and many provincial politicians attended this event.
