Australia, (Daily Mail), 1 May 2018 - Australia’s oldest scientist plans to fly business class to Switzerland next week to end his life.   


Dr David Goodall, a former university lecturer from Western Australia, doesn’t have a terminal illness but says he regrets having reached the age of 104 as his quality of life continues to deteriorate.   
‘I greatly regret having reached that age,’ he told the ABC.   


‘I’m not happy. I want to die. It’s not sad particularly. What is sad is if one is prevented.   


‘If one chooses to kill oneself, then that should be fair enough. I don’t think anyone else should interfere.’Dr Goodall was born in London in 1914, and is an eminent botanist and ecologist.   


He came to Australia in 1948, taking up a lecturing position at the University of Melbourne.   
Dr Goodall celebrated his 104th birthday in early April and has since decided it is time to access voluntarily euthanasia in Switzerland.
