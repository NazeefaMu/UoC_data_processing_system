To encourage a culture of savings during the World Thrift Month, Cargills Bank has initiated a fixed deposit promotion campaign offering considerably higher interest rates and is offering interest rates of 8 percent for 12 months, 7.75 percent for six months and 7.5 percent for three months on fixed deposits during this period. The promotion ends on November 30, 2015.
“We, at Cargills Bank, strongly believe that fostering the habit of saving is essential and given the confidence and trust both in the bank and in the value offering, we see good prospects for customers to take advantage of these attractive rates,” said DGM Consumer Banking Lewie Diasz.
He further added that Cargills Bank has been persistent and passionate in instilling the savings habit and has been offering attractive rates to all Sri Lankans through widespread promotional campaigns to encourage the habit of saving for the future. This promotion during the Thrift Month reflects the bank’s care and commitment towards the larger community. 
The bank offers responsible and sustainable products including savings accounts, current accounts, children’s savings account, senior citizens accounts, foreign currency accounts, etc., and these products are designed to meet the customers’ needs and to provide financial solutions aimed at building long-term relationships cutting across age, class and gender, he said.
Cargills Bank Limited is a fully-fledged commercial bank and has three branches presently, located in Colpetty, Maitland Crescent and Old Moor Street and provides a range of services and products, including current and savings accounts, fixed deposits, trade services and treasury services.
With the aim of providing more convenience and ease to its customers Cargills Bank has added four more ATMs to its network within the Colombo suburbs. The four new ATMs are operational at Cargills Food City premises in Staples Street, Rajagiriya, Wattala and Katubedda. 
The bank’s philosophy is to establish itself as an inclusive bank providing value propositions to all customers across all segments and is now on a path to building a unique banking culture. Cargills Bank also offers personal and business, savings and current accounts, which provide added value to customers.
The Smart Saver savings account is tailored to offer attractive benefits to the account holder at higher interest rates whilst the Cargills Bank Salary Savings account provides employees of companies with added benefits.   
The bank has introduced a Home Loan product at an attractive interest rate of 9 percent p.a. This flexible loan provides funding to customers seeking to purchase or construct a house, purchase land, complete construction of a partially built house, renovate, modify or extend an existing house without undue delay and paper work.
Cargills Bank’s personal loan scheme has been devised to alleviate short-term financial constraints at an attractive rate of 9.5 percent.
Personal loans are for customers seeking to purchase household goods, furniture and fittings, meet wedding expenses, renovations or extensions to their homes or help them meet higher education costs.
The minimum loan amount is Rs.100,000 with a maximum of Rs.5 million capped at a maximum of  12 times the applicant’s salary. The maximum repayment period is five years and approval is subject to evaluation and terms and conditions. 
Cargills Bank is backed by strong shareholders whose companies’ brands, financial performance, market share and business foresight are recognized in their respective fields and provide strength and stature to Cargills Bank.  
The bank advocates responsible banking practices, supports individuals and organisations in achieving their financial goals whilst offering simplified banking solutions to customers supported by its dedicated staff, processes and systems and growing product range and services.
