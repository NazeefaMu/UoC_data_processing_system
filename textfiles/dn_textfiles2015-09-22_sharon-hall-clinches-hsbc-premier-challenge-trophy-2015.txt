Sharon Hall clinches HSBC Premier Challenge Trophy 2015

The flagship HSBC Premier Golf Tournament proved to be a thrilling and resounding success with over 100 golfers competing for the HSBC Premier Challenge Trophy at the scenic Victoria Golf and Country Resort in Kandy on Saturday, 12 September 2015.
Sharon Hall became the overall winner to clinch the HSBC Premier Challenge Trophy 2015 and also the overall winner in the C Division, Seniors and Ladies category with a score of 42 points.
Ken De Alwis was adjudged overall winner in the A and B Division with a score of 39 points
The overall winners were each presented with fully sponsored hospitality packages to witness the WGC HSBC Champions Tournament scheduled to take place at the Sheshan Golf Club in Shanghai, China from November 2-8. Winning this year's tournament, Sharon Hall stated "It was a fantastic experience playing at the HSBC Premier Golf Tournament in Kandy. The hospitality laid on by HSBC was world class. I'm really looking forward to witnessing the golf tournament in Shanghai."
Ken De Alwis, overall winner in the A&B Division, commenting on his experience, said, "I would like to thank HSBC for organizing the Golf tournament and for the wonderful hospitality extended, during and after the event. I am exited to be able to witness the WGC HSBC Champions Tournament in China and thank HSBC Colombo for this opportunity."
A unique feature this year was the introduction of 'foot golf' to Sri Lanka that has become a growing phenomenon globally combining football and golf. The pre-event 'kick 4 birdie' challenged participants to test if their kick was as good as their swing with a football instead of a golf ball. Priyanga Hapugalle became the winner having proved his skill and accuracy by kicking an 8.6 diameter football as opposed to a 1.6 diameter golf ball to win the pre event. Nilantha Bastian, Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management commented, "We are extremely pleased to have completed another successful HSBC Premier Golf tournament at the Victoria Golf and Country Resort that has been awarded the best golf course on the sub- continent by the Asian golfer monthly reader's poll since 2009. This year was particularly exciting as we were able to introduce a fresh dimension through a hybrid sport - foot golf, that is picking up momentum across the world and give participants a fresh experience of golf, which was much enjoyed. The tournament was equally competitive and exciting and we hope our winners this year , Sharon and Ken will continue to enjoy their experience further when they witness the WGC HSBC Champions Tournament in China alongside world renowned golfers."
HSBC Premier Golfers were also treated to special benefits on lodging, travel and Golf merchandise to make the experience even more rewarding.
The tournament was concluded with an entertainment packed awards ceremony followed by a colourful fireworks display, held at the Club premises.
