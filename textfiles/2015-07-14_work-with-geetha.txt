UPFA candidate Nishantha Muthuhettigama said today he was ready to cooperate with Southern Provincial Councillor Geetha Kumarasinghe and carry out his election campaign in a peaceful manner despite certain incidents which had happened in the past.
He said the decision to refuse nominations to some former MPs over allegations of involvement in drug trafficking and corruption was unfair because none of these allegations were proved in court.
“I disagree with the party decision to refuse nominations to some former MPs based on certain allegations. They are not guilty on the basis of having recorded a police statement,” he said.
When asked about nominations to ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mr. Muthuhettigama said it was the decisive factor in the UPFA’s victory at the General Election.
“It is a good decision by the party to field Mr. Rajapaksa and that will be the deciding factor for our victory,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
