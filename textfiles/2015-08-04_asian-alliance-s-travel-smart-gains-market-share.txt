 Asian Alliance Insurance’s ‘Travel Smart’ travel policy marks its first year milestone with an impressive 6,000 customers availing themselves of the travel insurance product since its launch in July 2014.
In celebration of the product’s success and in appreciation of their efforts, the external partners (travel agents), who contributed towards it, were hosted to the ‘Asian Alliance Travel Trail’ – a ‘Motor Fun Rally’ recently.  The rally that was designed to entertain and thrill participants commenced from the Asian Alliance office in Ward Place and concluded at Jetwing Blue – Negombo, at which 75 top travel agents were hosted to a superb party on the beach.
Asian Alliance Insurance’s travel insurance offers comprehensive cover for travellers from personal accident, personal liability, loss of baggage/passport, hijacking, cancellation of flights and enables reimbursement of medical expenses, among others.     
Further, Asian Alliance Insurance has extended its commitment to enhance customer convenience by employing technological advancements to its travel insurance products as well, enabling customers to purchase travel insurance online through ‘Alliance Travel Assist Insurance’. 
“While travel insurance is still very much an area in its inception for Asian Alliance Insurance, we are pleased with the considerable growth in numbers,” Asian Alliance General Insurance Director/CEO Ramal Jasinghe said.
“More importantly, we take pride in offering a service of high quality to our customers – which is reflected in the growth in figures – and in having brought about innovation in the local travel insurance space by employing technological advancements.”
Asian Alliance Insurance is part of the Softlogic group, which is recognized as one of Sri Lanka’s most diversified and fastest-growing conglomerates with interests in healthcare, retail, ICT, leisure, automobiles and financial services. Significant stakeholders in the company also include FMO and DEG that are rated ‘AAA’ Development Financial Institutions from the Netherlands and Germany, respectively.
