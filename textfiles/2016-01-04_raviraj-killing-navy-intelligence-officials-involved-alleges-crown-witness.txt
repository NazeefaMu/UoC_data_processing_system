While giving evidence relating to the inquiry on the killing of former TNA Jaffna District MP Nadaraja Raviraj led by the DSG, the crown witness of the inquiry, Sampath Prithiviraj, revealed that the alleged killing was planned by officials attached to the Navy intelligence office located in the Gangarama, Laundrywatta area at that time.
The witness was earlier a suspect in the incident and later turned a witness to the case.
He stated that he had served as a motor bike rider for special operations in Batticaloa, where he started connections with the suspect Palana Sami Suresh.
In 2006, after he had arrived in Colombo, he once again continued his relationship with ‘Sami’ and through him got to know Prasad Kumara, Charan, Wajira, Gamini Seneviratne, Fabian Royston Toussaint and other intelligence officials.
He further stated that the suspect, Sami, had taken him to the Navy Intelligence Office in Gangarama and introduced him to other officials.
On November 8, 2006, he was told by the suspect Sami that they had attempted to kill Mr. Raviraj but failed.
Then in November 10, 2006, he was summoned by the same suspect to attack some LTTE cadres.
The witness was asked to come to the Borella Cemetery junction in the morning in the motor bike which was provided by the suspects.
Then Prasad, Seneviratne, Wajira and three others had come to the place in two three-wheelers, while Sami, Charan and Toussaint had arrived in another three-wheeler.
He further stated in his statement that he was only asked to stay at the Martha Road junction and take the shooter and flee from the scene.
He stated the suspect ‘Seneviratne’ was with a black bag and waited until the former MP’s vehicle arrived.
Then the suspect Seneviratne came from the opposite side of Raviraj’s vehicle and shot Raviraj and his driver Lakshman and fled with the witness to the Navy Intelligence Office located in Laundrywatta on Gangarama road.
The witness further declared that he was unaware with the incident fully as he didn’t know about the victim until they finished the operation and came to the navy Intelligence office in Laundrywatta.
After the leading evidence in the non summary inquiry, the Deputy Solicitor General allowed for the cross examination.
The defense counsel requested for another date to cross examine the witness as they needed to peruse the statements of the witness and get advice from their clients.
Earlier, seven suspects, Palana Sami Suresh, Prasad Hettiarachchi, Gamini Seneviratne, Pradeep Chaminda, Sivakanth Vivekanandan, Fabian Royston Toussaint and Sampath Munasinghe were charged on five counts over the killing of Mr. Raviraj.
The Court had also on the last occasion fixed to hear the case in the absentia of three suspects of Palana Sami Suresh, Sivakanth Vivekanandan and Fabian Royston Toussaint under clause 148 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
Additional Magistrate Thilina Gamage put off further inquiry for January 13. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
