Police advise motorists to use alternative routes to Colombo and avoid the anticipated traffic congestion which could occur because of a protest march by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) today against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.

Police said the students might reach Lipton Circus via Colombo Fort along Baseline Road, and Maligawatta from Kelaniya, through Inguru Kade Junction from Wattala, along the High Level Road and through Havelock Junction from Nugegoda and Moratuwa.
