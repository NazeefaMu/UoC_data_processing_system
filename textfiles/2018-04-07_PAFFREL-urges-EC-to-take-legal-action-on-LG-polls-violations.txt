The People's Action for Free & Fair Elections (PAFFREL) yesterday urged the Election Commission (EC) to take legal action on reported election law violations during the last Local Government (LG) Elections.

PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi in a letter sent to the Chairman of the Election Commission Mahinda Deshapriya had stated that although due to immediate intervention of relevant authorities most of shortcomings were prevented it was appropriate to probe and take legal action over the complaints received.

It further said though the LG election ended as a comparatively free and fair election it had received several complaints over candidates who sealed the victory via inappropriate election campaigns.

“PAFFREL forwarded such complaints to the Election Commission. Accordingly we believe that the EC and Police also received complaints on election law violations. Therefore we request the commission to seek swift legal action over the received complaints,” he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
