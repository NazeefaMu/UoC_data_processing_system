It was a ruse to hold  back the upsurge!


	



 

While the uproar over Kala madam’s controversial statement was raging drowning all other issues in the country, a news story in a section of the Press that the Green boss had asked Number One to relieve the lady of her portfolio made headlines. 

 


Soon after this story had appeared, the offices of the Big Two had been bombarded with queries whether the story was true. 


The aides of Number One finding that there was no end to these queries had asked the latter whether he had received such a request. And the reply had been a firm ‘No’. When the interested parties inquired from Number Two, he too had denied having made such a request to Number One. 


It transpired later that the news story was a consummate fabrication concocted for political reasons. 
The fact that the much-maligned lady made a statement a few days later that she had sent in her resignation may, perhaps, have given a sense of much relief to whoever made up the story, 
they say.
