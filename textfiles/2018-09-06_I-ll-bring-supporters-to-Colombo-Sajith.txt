United National Party (UNP) Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa said today he would undertake the task of strengthening the party and bring 100,000 people to Galle Face Green for a rally if Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe approved of such a move.

He said this at a ceremony held at the UNP headquarters, Sirikotha to mark the 72nd anniversary of the party. He called for unity among party members if the party was to win the 2020 presidential and general elections to build the nation.

“What I predicted about the protest organised by the joint opposition on Wednesday has come true. I said the JO protest would be a feast with biriyani and alcohol,” he said.

Meanwhile, UNP Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake said the party should organise a mass rally and bring large crowds to Colombo.

“It is high time that the party recognised the value of backbenchers. We should build up the party before building the nation,” he said.(Yohan Perera)
