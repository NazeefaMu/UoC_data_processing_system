Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said today that in the wake of Police investigations ruling out any JHU involvement in the unrest in the Kandy district, the police should now reveal the political forces behind the violence.

He told a news conference that most of those arrested were identified as members of the Sri Lanka Podu jana Peramuna (SLPP) though the SLPP had blamed the JHU for the violence.

“Pro-Rajapaksa groups spread a rumour that the JHU was behind the Kandy riots. But the police investigations have revealed that none of the Buddhist monks or any other individuals with connections to the JHU were involved in the incident. Based on CCTV footage and other videos it were the pro-Rajapaksa groups involved in it,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
