Joint Opposition member MP Namal Rajapaksa yesterday in a tweet said President Maithripala Sirisena’s habit of betrayal had been proved once again during the voting of the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

MP Rajapaksa said President Sirisena had initially encouraged Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members to support the no-confidence motion and then backed away betraying both the SLFP and the United National Party (UNP).


#SriLanka President @MaithripalaS’s habit of betrayal proven again at #NoConfidenceMotionSL against Prime Minister @RW_UNP. First he encouraged SLFP members to support it and then backs off. He has betrayed both the SLFP & UNP.

He also tweeted that Minister Susil Premajayantha and other seniors of the SLFP had decided to take an ethical and firm stand supporting the no-confidence motion.

He added that they had given priority to the stability and future of the country.


Hon Minister Susil Premajayantha & seniors of @SLFreedomParty have opted to take an ethical & firm stand by supporting the #NoConfidenceMotion
It’s clear that they’ve given precedence to the stability and future of #SriLanka & #lka people over all else.
