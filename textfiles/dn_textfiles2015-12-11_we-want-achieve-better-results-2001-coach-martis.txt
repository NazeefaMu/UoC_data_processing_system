Sri Lanka squad leaves for Junior Rugby Asiad today
We want to achieve better results than in 2001 - coach Martis

Following threats of resignation by the coach and injuries to key players the Sri Lanka under 20 junior squad eventually put aside their plight and take wing to Singapore today to participate in the Junior Rugby Asiad which will be held from December 13-19.

Their opening match of the tournament is against Singapore on December 13 followed by Hong Kong on December 16 and Chinese Taipei on December 19.
The biggest setback to the team led by ex-Isipathana captain and burly number 8 Omalka Gunaratne is the absence from the line-up of Royal College number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya who will miss the tour due a serious knee injury he suffered during a practice match against Police SC at Police Park last week,
"Supun is a big loss for our national under 20 team, because he's one of the best players who read the game well according to the situation," head coach Sanath Martis told the Daily News. "Supun has played his heart out for his school Royal College and national team. When you play a sport in the nature of rugby injuries are always bound to come your way sooner or later. Nothing can really stop that. I hope he will recover fast and I expect to see him play soon."
Martis defended his decision to pitting the national junior team against an 'A' division club side like Police ahead of an important tournament which led to a few players suffering injuries.
"Remember 21 out of 35 players who are in this under 20 national side are contracted to clubs like Navy, CR and FC, Police and Havelocks, so they have already tasted club rugby standards because they are in it," said Martis.
"If the present Royal College team is capable of facing the senior national rugby team in practice matches, why can't this under 20 national team face a club side like Police? What's wrong with that?
"I had arranged to play practice matches with club sides like CR and FC and Havelocks in the past four days but unfortunately had to cancel them due to poor ground conditions due to the heavy rains, otherwise without any hesitation I would have gone ahead and played them."
Talking of the team's chances in the Asiad, Martis said, "I will not underestimate Chinese Taipei. A couple of years back at Havelock Park we lost to them in the same junior rugby Asiad. They are a competitive team, but this time we are ready for them. We want to perform better than the team under Jeevan (Gunathilaka) in 2001."
Under ex-Thomian captain Jeevan Gunathilaka, the Sri Lanka team qualified for the Junior World Rugby Trophy by ending runner-up at the Junior Asiad held in Sri Lanka in 2001.
However to qualify for the World Rugby under 20 in Harare, Zimbabwe in April-May, Omalka Gunaratne's team will have to emerge champions at the Junior Asiad.
