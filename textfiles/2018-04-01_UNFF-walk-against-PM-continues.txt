UNFF walk against PM continues


	

The walk organised by United National Freedom Front, that set off from Kandy on Saturday (31) demanding Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to resign was resumed this morning from the Mawanella town.

The General Secretary of the party and former UNP Provincial Councilor Maithri Gunaratne, who was arrested by the Kadugannawa Police with two shotguns, at Pilimatalawa yesterday told the media that the flag posts, which they carried, had been seized on Saturday by the Police on the charge of possessing clubs.

However, he was released on bail by the Kandy Magistrate after he produced copies of the licences for the two shotguns.

He said that the UNFF would not be deterred by any action to suppress its campaign. (Saman Vijaya Hemmathagama)
