Nations Trust Bank American Express recently conducted a very special programme that would let one platinum cardmember and companion experience the thrills of Dubai, the hospitality of Tokyo, the excitement of London, the wonders of Australia and the hustle and bustle of New York all in one incredible trip all-expense paid. 


Gold and Blue cardmembers were also eligible for the promotion with the winning Gold cardmember receiving an all-expense paid trip for two to Singapore, Dubai and London, while the winning Blue Cardmember received an all-expense paid trip for two to Singapore and Dubai. The glamorous holiday packages include airfare, accommodation, dining, sightseeing, transfers and an expense allowance.


Cardmembers were able to enter the draw by meeting minimum usage thresholds during the promotion period with Blue Cardmembers needing to swipe Rs. 75,000or more, Gold Cardmembers being required to swipe Rs. 150,000 or more and Platinum cardmembers having to swipe Rs. 300,000 or more. Each multiple of the usage threshold gave Ccardmembers an additional entry and increased their chances of winning. The rewards were handed over to the winners at an awards ceremony held at Nations Trust Bank’s Millennium Branch. The promotion was organized in collaboration with Findmyfare.


Saliya Senanayake speaking about the chances of Platinum cardmembers winning said, “Surely, memories will be made on this trip that will last a lifetime and we look forward to the experience. I am grateful for having been lucky enough to win this prize.”

Speaking about the promotion, Niluka Gunatilake, Head of Cards said, “A Nations Trust Bank American Express Card is like a key to an exclusive, discerning lifestyle. All our cardmembers indulge in sophisticated lifestyle choices and with this promotion we wanted to let lucky cardmembers truly unlock the amazing privileges that come with an American Express membership. This is possibly one of the greatestprogrammes we have organized to date and the main reason we organize programmes like this is to reward our Cardmembers for their loyalty with American Express. I think we ticked all the boxes with this promotion and I’m sure the winning Cardmembers and their companions feel more than rewarded. Still, I’m sure the actual trip will make them feel even more on top of the world than they do now. On behalf of the team I’d like to wish each of our winners Bon Voyage!”
