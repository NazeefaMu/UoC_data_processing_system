The post-lunch session will feature a segment where the two CEOs of BSE and PSX will share their experiences and transformational strategies of their exchanges with the SAFE member exchange representatives and the CEOs of the member firms of the CSE.

The event will strengthen cooperation among our exchanges and create opportunity for cross-border investment linkages. Collaboration of our fellow exchanges will play a vital role in accelerating economic integration in South Asia going forward.”
