He didn’t bargain for  the reception he got


	

A purohita who tried to buy freshwater prawns at an unreasonably low price at a well-known prawn market was booed away by the fishermen, they say.




 The purohita who was on his way to his home town had his helicopter land on the bund of the prawn breeding lake and made it to the nearby prawn market. On finding that the prawns were being sold for Rs.1,200 a kilo, the purohita had told them that he was prepared to buy the entire haul on sale for Rs.600 a kilo. 


Reacting with anger to the purohita’s unreasonable bargain, the fishermen had berated him with a liberal use of obscenities. 


Finding that the fishermen turning increasingly hostile, the security guards had hastily escorted the purohita back to the helicopter. The fishermen had kept on hooting and hurling abuse at the purohita until the helicopter took off the ground, they say.
