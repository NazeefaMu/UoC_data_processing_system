North-East monsoonal conditions are gradually setting in over the country, the Department of Meteorology said today.

A Met Department forecast light showers in the Eastern and Uva Provinces and in the Hambantota District.
It said showers or thundershowers were expected in a few places in the Southern, Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces after 2.00 p.m while fairly strong winds were expected at some places, particularly in the Western, Central and Uva provinces.

“Thundershowers accompanied by temporary localized strong winds can be expected. The people are requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning,” the Met Dept said. (Yohan Perera)
