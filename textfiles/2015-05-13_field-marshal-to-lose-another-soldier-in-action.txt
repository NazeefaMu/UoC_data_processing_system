Field Marshal to lose another soldier in action?


	


	
	Several politicos elected to various councils on the Field Marshal’s party ticket now and then pole-vaulted to greener pastures – some joined the Green party and some others the Betel Leaf party. One prominent member from among the remaining few is reportedly poised to follow suit.

This member representing the ‘Flame’ in an important council had recently called on a VVIP at his residence to seek the membership of the Blue party. Of course, earlier he had sent out feelers to the Green party and failed to get the greenlight and he had to settle for the second best, they say.
So it would  be no surprise, if this ‘provincial ‘ politico, who often doubles as a media personality entered the fray in the Colombo district at the coming general election from the Blue party list.
