Officials of the Bribery Commission arrested two more customs officers connected to the case where Rs. 125 million was solicited from a spare- part businessman in Panchikawatta.  


The two customs Superintendents were arrested at the Customs Headquarters this morning, Bribery Commission Director (Investigations) SSP Priyantha Chandrasiri said.  


Three customs officials were arrested last October by the Bribery Commission during a raid, where Rs. 125 million, was being exchanged between the three officers and the businessman.  


The customs officials had first solicited Rs. 150 million, to release imported spare parts worth Rs. 1.5 billion without any duty payment, but the bribe was then brought down to Rs. 125 million.


The customs officials arrested in October, and released on bail in December, have been banned from travelling abroad and were asked to report to the Bribery Commission on the last Sunday of each month.  (Darshana Sanjeewa)
