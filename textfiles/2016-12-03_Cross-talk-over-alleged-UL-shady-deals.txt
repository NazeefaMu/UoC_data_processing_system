Cross talk over alleged UL shady deals


	

The government and the joint opposition yesterday made allegations against each other on alleged shady deals involving the national carrier SriLankan Airlines during the past and the present regimes in Parliament yesterday.

Joint opposition MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage alleged the lease agreement on the A250 aircraft acquisition had been cancelled without the approval of the board of directors of the national carrier.
State Enterprises Development Deputy Minister Eran Wickramarathne and subject minister Kabir Hashim denounced this claim and said the board of Directors had approved the move.

Both the Minister and the deputy said the carrier had been running at a loss because of business decisions made during the last regime.

“The carrier had lost Rs. 132 billion in 2014," he said the previous regime had even ordered a VIP kit in one of the aircraft. He said the deal to request the aircraft was signed at the residence of former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa during the last regime. (Yohan Perera)
