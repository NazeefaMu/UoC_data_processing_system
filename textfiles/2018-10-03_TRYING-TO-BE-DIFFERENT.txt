TRYING TO BE DIFFERENT!!!


	



 



The tremendous pace at which development is progressing is incredible!!! Not a single stone is left unturned; they are going all out not just to impress but to start gaining much needed political mileage!!! Today, Birth, Marriage and Death Certificates can be obtained within minutes; Special Committees have been established to resolve payment issues, a massive programme is being carried out to renovate 1,000 tanks and Ministers are insisting that farmer insurance be given priority!!! Over Rs. 12 billion has been set aside for drought mitigation efforts and one wonders from where all these billions have suddenly surfaced!!!

 

 



 



Prison People

Moving on to the Scales of Justice, we find a daily trial has been set for Gamini Senarath and others, happily it has not been postponed as was done in most cases!!! However, Rangajeewa has been granted bail for allegedly killing 27 prisoners, with bail set at Rs. 100,000/- and two sureties of Rs. 200,000/- each!!! We can only hope that he too does not take off somewhere!!! They have not yet got down to the most basic essential of confiscating the passports of these criminals!!! The Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan is still languishing in jail and compelled to remain there until his revision application is considered!!!


 



Price and protests

Many protests are being voiced on price hikes, particularly the ones that hit the common man!!! Apparently, efforts are being made to look into unfair price hikes, but the private bus fare hike of Rs. 12/- remains unchanged and train fares will also go up!!! Likewise, a chew of betel is up by Rs. 10/- and the fuel and gas price hike remain unchanged, with Southern Provincial Councilors staging a ‘colourful carrying protest’!!! Strangely, Health and Education are to get Rs. 290 billion in 2019, with Defence, slotted to get the highest allocation!!! With the critical depreciation of the Rupee, where in the world are all these billions coming from??? We wonder!!!

 


 



 

Puswedilla

The tragic loss of lives in accidents is horrendous, most of which are due to carelessness and negligence of rules and regulations!!! It is so sad that children are orphaned, women widowed, whole families wiped out sometimes and all tragedies that could have been averted through a little caution and respect for law and order!!! Even animals like the poor elephants are prey to these ruthless reckless drivers who are totally unmindful of whom or what they kill or what they destroy!!! WHY ARENT WE LEVYING STRINGENT FINES FOR CARELESS DRIVING???

 

 



 

IGP woes

It seems like our IGP does not know which God to tell; apparently, he is burning holes not incense in all the Devales, Kovils and Temples; worshipping at old ones, laying foundations for new ones while the circus goes on!!! Considering the crime rate in the country, the plots and schemes to assassinate, which have turned out to be other ‘Puswedillas’ like the Janabalaya, we cannot actually blame the man for seeking divine assistance!!! Mr IGP, Difficulties in your life do not come to destroy you, but to help you realize your hidden potential; let difficulties know that YOU ARE DIFFICULT!!! When the going gets tough, the tough get going, didn’t you know???

 

 

 



Curbing imports

Whoever suggested that the further import of cars be banned should be given a Gold Medal!!! It may not be possible to impose a total ban, but let them at least levy a heavier duty on imported cars!!! After all, aren’t the Ministers themselves saying that LUXURIES SHOULD BE POSTPONED??? If this were ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED, WE COULD REDUCE THE DEATH TOLL ON OUR ROADS, AND THE NEVER ENDING TRAFFIC SNARLS!!! ABOUT TIME THE AUTHORITIES TOOK DEFINITE ACTION ON THIS!!!

 


 



No one is exempt

Today I want to share something with you that I received and is well worth sharing!!! It is an evaluation of life, we come across the story of Formula 1 Michael Schumacher; when his story is studied as an athlete, we see that he was Winner of the Grand Prix in 1991, Seven times World Champion of Formula 1; his being was infused with happiness but one fateful day his destiny completely changed due to an accident!!! Today, this star with only 44 kilos of weight is struggling to survive since December 2013!!! His wife has started selling their goods to cover the expenses involved to keep him alive in a special room adapted in his house, where he lies like a vegetable!!! The question is ‘Who is better than Who?’ Life can take directions never imagined and amazingly everything can change in an instant!!! No one. And I mean no one is exempt from anything; what is more, Money, Titles, Fame, Success and Power are of no use in any of these circumstances!!! WE ARE ALL THE SAME, SO WHY THE PRIDE, WHY MAKE CLAIMS, WHY THE ARROGANCE, WHY SO MUCH ATTACHMENT TO MATERIAL GOODS??? ALL WE HAVE IS THE DAY, TODAY, SO LET US LIVE IT WITH PASSION AND ENJOY OURSELVES, DOING GOOD, SERVING OTHERS!!! We need to stop creating problems, to stop claiming insignificant things and always avoid everything that ‘takes our lives!!!” We need to be careful not to lose someone who loves us and accepts us as we are!!!

Like in the game of chess, in the end, both the King and the Pawn are kept in the same box!!! Isn’t it worth examining what we have and have not done??? We are born with nothing, we die with nothing, but the sad thing is in real life, in the interval between life and death; we fight for what we did not bring and even more for what we will not take!!! So all you politicians and millionaires especially, think about living more, loving more, giving more and grabbing less!!! It is a very interesting reflection!!!
