Addressing the media at the weekly cabinet briefing, he said the proposal had been made by the President Maithripala Sirisena to issue an order by the relevant Minister under the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act. No 25 of 1991, and to assign the authority of implementing this process to the TRCSL.

“It has been observed that there are a large number of active SIM cards issued by various mobile phone service providers that were issued without proper documentation or identity of their subscribers,” he said.
