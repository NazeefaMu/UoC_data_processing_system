Reiterating its status of excellence across diverse capacities in the banking industry, Sampath Bank was recognized with four prestigious accolades at the CMO Asia Awards Ceremony held recently at Pan Pacific, Marina Square, Singapore. 


The bank was commended across four distinct categories presented by CMO Asia – an independent organisation dedicated to high level knowledge exchange through leadership and networking amongst brand decision-makers across industry segments. 


Setting a benchmark across multiple banking disciplines, the nation-minded bank was honoured with the award for ‘The Best Bank in Private Sector’ at the Asia Banking, Financial Services and Insurance Awards. As Sampath Bank continues to create value for its customers, stakeholders, the country and its citizens, this award signified the bank for its 360 degree approach to sustainability in addition to its outstanding financial and non-financial performances, stakeholder management, corporate governance and risk management.
The bank’s 360-degree approach highlights a robust association between Sampath Bank’s corporate strategy, governance and commitment to a sustainable economy. Evident in their diverse range of reports, Sampath Bank was awarded with the ‘Best Sustainability Report’ at the Asia Sustainability Excellence Awards. This accolade applauded Sampath Bank for its comprehensive reporting standards in suitability philosophy, stakeholder management, economic contributions and corporate governance. 


Furthermore, the seventh CMO Asia Awards for Excellence and Branding awarded Sampath Bank with the accolade for ‘Excellence in Branding and Marketing’, commending the bank’s exceptional strategy that transcends innovation and craft. The award further distinguished Sampath Bank for its exemplary marketing strategies, product responsibilities and effective marketing communication that complement the bank’s unique portfolio of tailor-made solutions which support the needs of diverse customers and stakeholders alike. 
Whilst customer-centricity and stakeholder interests remain a core segment of the bank’s operating system, Sampath Bank maintains valued HR practices that balance all stakeholder interests. This approach to upholding a unique culture with instilled values such as team work, integrity, transparency, etc., earned Sampath Bank the award for ‘Talent Management’ at the seventh Asia Best Employer Brand Awards. With a dynamic team of professionals and leaders, the award famed Sampath Bank for its HR policies and practices, which have evolved on the premise of creating a professional and considerate culture, focusing on talent acquisition, alignment and retention. 
“Over the 29 years of operation in the banking industry of Sri Lanka, Sampath Bank has significantly transformed into a sturdier banking institution that serves an array of stakeholders with distinct financial services. With the success of Sampath Bank, we continue to look for means to make our operations more sustainable as we believe efficient management methods will enable us to maintain long-term industry leadership,” said Sampath Bank PLC Senior Deputy General Manager Consumer Bank Tharaka Ranwala.
