Sanasa Development Bank PLC (SDB) recently unveiled its new logo as an important aspect of its restructuring programme. 
The bank has taken several measures recently to make important changes within the institution in order to provide a wider range of services to the public. The bank has pointed out that this step was taken in order to better reflect its new corporate identity and that as a result, the operations of the bank would be further strengthened.
Although the logo is changed as an external change, the bank emphasises that there is no change whatsoever in the registered name and that one of the main reasons for the introduction of the new logo was the current listing of its shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange. 
SDB, which up to now has been established as a skilled financial bank, will from now position itself as a skilled, small and medium entrepreneur bank. For this purpose, it has joined hands with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which is the private sector arm of the World Bank. In conjunction with this programme, there will be several new value additions to the bank’s operations and services.
SDB has for long been dedicated to providing financial services to Sri Lankan consumers. SDB can be identified as one which introduced a new dimension to the country’s banking sector by providing services such as skill loan facilities, specially for rural communities that experienced difficulty in obtaining financial services through traditional banking facilities. 
While the bank has provided a lifeline for thousands of people to achieve economic prosperity through 19 years of providing a unique service, it can also be identified broadly as a major contributor to the country’s economy. The fame and recognition it has received as a bank that has pioneered assistance to the public towards progress, is proof of SDB’s mission and its success.
Explaining the purpose of the changes, SDB Chairperson Samadani Kiriwandeniya said, “These new changes have been introduced with a view to carrying forward our mission in a more orderly manner. The change of the logo is also one such step. With this transformation, we will be widening the scope and efficiency of the services extended to the public so far. We will also be opening our doors to afford opportunities for those who have not yet transacted business with us. Our aim is to make a sustained contribution to the economic development of the country while consolidating the unique identity of the bank.”
Under the corporate restructuring programme, sectors such as cooperative banking, consumer banking and small and medium-scale entrepreneur solutions will receive greater emphasis. The bank’s network of branches will be actively involved in this new programme.
“We were able to win the confidence of the people of Sri Lanka through some very important services provided over a long time,” said SDB General Manager/CEO Nimal Hapuarachchi. 
“It gives us great satisfaction to have been able to make sustained progress as a bank that made a real change in the very competitive financial services sector. I believe that we could step forward on another unique journey through a fast-tracked strategic programme of work that will add new technology and further develop our operations. It will also be a step that opens up several new professional opportunities for our staff,” Hapuarachchi added.
