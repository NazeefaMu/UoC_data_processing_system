Tissot wins four exceptional prizes

Tissot has being awarded four exceptional prizes at the International Timing Competition.
The first prize for both the brand new Chronograph – Enterprise category and for the Classic – Enterprisecategory for which it also won second and third place.
The winners were announced at the Espace Horloger Vallée de Joux. The competition rewards precision, perfection and expertise in the watchmaking arena, specifically in the domain of contemporary mechanical timing.
The winning movements were determined after scientific, technical and cultural procedures that were carried out in official certified laboratories of Besançon’s Observatory and by the Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres (Swiss Official Controlling of Timing) in Le Locle.
They were exposed to particularly tough magnetic fields and shocks at the Haute Ecole Arc in le Locle. The jury then revealed the great winners of the Enterprise categories – Chronographe, Classic and Tourbillons.
Tissot was honored to also receive the first, second and third place for the Enterprise – Classic category.
The winner was a Tissot T-Complication (908 pts), which also won the first and second place in 2013. This demonstrates the consistency of quality of the Tissot products.
Since the foundation of the comptoir Tissot, the quality and precision of its watches have been recognized and rewarded thanks to these types of competitions.
