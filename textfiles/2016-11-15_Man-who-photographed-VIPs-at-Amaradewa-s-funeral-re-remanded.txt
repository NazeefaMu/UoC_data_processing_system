The suspect who was arrested for suspicious behavior and impersonation of a journalist at the funeral of veteran musician W.D. Amaradeva at Independence Square, where the President and other VIPs were present, was re-remanded till November 17 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate today.

The Magistrate directed the prison authority to produce the suspect before a Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) for a psychological test and submit the report to the court soon.

According to the prosecution, the suspect had behaved suspiciously by photographing the VIPs continuously while pretending to be a journalist.

Police officers attached to the President’s Security Division (PSD) had apprehended the suspect at the funeral and handed him over to the Cinnamon Gardens Police. The case was later taken over by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD).

The suspect, Sapumal Devinda Kumara, a resident of Kotahena, was later interrogated under Police custody for three days.

CCD informed the court that the police could not uncover the suspect’s connection to any terrorist activities.

The CCD also informed the court that the suspect’s conversations over the phone were being investigated. The inquiry was initiated upon a complaint lodged by the PSD. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
