Discretion is the best part of valour


	



 

There was an informal minor debate in the House lobby the other day. Several members from both sides of the great divide expressed their candid views on the subject of the debate: The case against the second son of the former strongman. 

 


Some of them berated the Police. Some blamed the government. There were some who took up the position that anyone found to have committed an offence should be taken to task irrespective of his or her status. 


As the debate was raging, a purohita of Cabinet rank holding a portfolio relevant to the South of the country looked on quietly. Irked by the deafening silence on the part of the purohita, an opposition stalwart challenged him to say his piece for or against the lawsuit instituted against the once highly pampered kid now down and out. 


“Malli, I can’t condone the action taken against the boy,” the purohita opened up at length. “I am not happy about the situation our former boss is placed in either. I would be only inviting trouble if I were to speak out about these matters.  So keeping mum is good for my health…” The purohita sloped off after voicing his viewpoint.
