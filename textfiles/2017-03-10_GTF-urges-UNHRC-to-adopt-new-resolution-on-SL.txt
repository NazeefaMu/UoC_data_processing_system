While welcoming the UN Human Rights High Commissioner’s latest report on Sri Lanka, the Global Tamil Forum (GTF) urged the UN Human Rights Council to adopt a new resolution on the country.

Issuing a statement on Thursday, the GTF commended High Commissioner Zeid al-Hussein and his office for their forthright and thorough assessment, and concur with their observation that ‘stronger, tangible results needed to be forthcoming without further delay to prevent any further dissipation of hard-earned trust.’

“While acknowledging the Sri Lankan Government’s constructive engagement with the United Nations’ human rights mechanisms, the report was emphatic that the ‘fulfilment of transitional justice commitments has been worryingly slow and the structures set up and measures taken were inadequate to ensure real progress,’ it said.

It said the report was categorical that the Government has not moved fast enough with tangible measures that would immensely help build confidence among victims and the Tamil community.

The GTF said the report analysed a number of emblematic cases involving security forces with no decisive progress to-date and reiterated the High Commissioner’s view that ‘international participation in accountability mechanisms remains a necessary guarantee for the independence, credibility and impartiality of the process and an integral part of the commitments of the Government under the Human Rights Council resolution.

“It is in this light that we are dismayed and reject the statements from the Sri Lankan leaders, including a recent statement from Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that argues participation of international judges would require constitutional amendments with approval from country wide referendum. The High Commissioner’s assertion that unclear and contradictory messages on transitional justice mechanisms by the President, the Prime Minister, and various members of the cabinet need to be acted upon with utmost seriousness,” it said.
