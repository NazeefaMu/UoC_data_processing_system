In a strange turn of events a 30-year-old woman in a complaint to the police has said her 'husband' with whom she had been living for the past eight years was after all a woman and not a man.
The complainant told police that she had been deserted by her paramour after she had a child by him several years before she met the suspect through a marriage proposal published in a newspaper. She said her 'husband' was a mason by profession and after marriage they lived in a rented house in Colombo.
However, she said was unable to pinpoint the pretender's sex though they lived under one roof for more than eight years. She told the police that the suspect was always attired as a male and had never allowed her to touch 'his' body, leave alone having sex with 'him'.
Recently she returned to her village in Weligama with her child and lived at her parental home. It was when she did not receive any money or heard from her 'husband' that she was prompted to complain to the Weligama police. She told the police that on several occasions she had noticed her 'husband’ behaving in a suspicious manner. Police referred the pretender to the Weligama District Hospital for a medical examination after which the medical officer had confirmed that the suspect was a woman.
Police said the suspect would be produced in the Matara Magistrate's Court on charges of having cheated an unsuspecting woman by marrying her on the pretext of being a man, making a false declaration to the marriage registrar, possessing a forged National Identity Card and a forged driving licence.(Sunil Dharmabandu Silva)
