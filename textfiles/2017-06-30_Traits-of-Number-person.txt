Every religion or philosophy in the world is based on three fundamentals or principles.


 

 

First let us consider things both abstract and tangible represented by Number 3.  Some of them are creativity, children, happiness, expansion, expression, art, diversification, sociability, communication, jealousy, pride, inspiration, trinity and triangle. 

 

What Number 3 represents and whys and wherefores for it
Number 3 represents the above with reason.  We propose to give a few examples:  Number 1 represents male and Number 2 female. The union of these numbers is children.  The union of the two numbers on the other hand leads to creativity. Every religion or philosophy in the world is based on three fundamentals or principles. The entire philosophy of the Buddha is based on the principles of Dukkha (Suffering), Anitya (Impermanence), and Anatma (Soullessness). Father, Son and Holy Spirit are the trinity that underpins Christianity. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva form the trinity in Hinduism. Number 3 represents the triangle formed with the three laterals force, matter and consciousness. 

 

Characteristics Number 3 persons represent
People represented by Number 3 are dynamic and creative.  However, they lack organizing ability.  They possess mental keenness and capacity for good judgment. 


They are religious and orthodox in outlook. They are good conversationalists with winning manners. 
Number 3 people are both creative and innovative and very often their skills blossom more by accident than by design, thanks to the inspiration and help from another person. 


Number 3 people are ambitious and very often reach high positions.  They are sticklers for discipline.  They are methodical in their work and love neatness and symmetry. They are equal to any formidable task and responsibility sits easy on them. 


Number 3 people hate subordinate positions but once tasked with a responsibility they would carry it out with commitment.  They are good communicators capable of putting across their message to others very effectively.

 

Influence of Jupiter at birth
If Jupiter is weak at the time of birth, a Number 3 person would manifest the weak qualities the Number 3 represents: laziness, pessimism and extravagance.


A Number 3 person would command the qualities that the Number 3 represents in full measure if Jupiter is strong at the time of birth or was born on a Thursday between December 16 and January 14 or March 15 and April 13 or if born in the hour of Jupiter.
