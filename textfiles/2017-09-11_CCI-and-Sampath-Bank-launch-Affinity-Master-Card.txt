The Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI), as the apex representative body of the construction industry stake holders, together with Sampath Bank PLC launched the CCI branded Affinity Master Card at a ceremony following their Annual General Meeting on the 07th September at Galle Face Hotel.
This Affinity Master Credit Card is issued exclusively to the members of the CCI. With Corporate member entities this privilege will be extended to their senior management as well. The holders of this card will be entitled to all the benefits of the Sampath Master Platinum Credit Card.


The CCI Affinity Master Card holders would have additional benefits and discounts upon selected construction materials and various other services as well as products, arranged by the CCI through its network of member companies and well-wishers.


This initiative by the Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka is bound to be an additional boon to its membership, and in time to come very well be a prized possession to the holder.
