AR Rahman’s Colombo Concert postponed


	

Music sensation 'Isai Puyal' AR Rahman’s Colombo concert scheduled for April 23 has been postponed indefinitely following protests from anti-Sri Lanka groups and posters being stuck outside his Chennai residence, Indian media reported.

However, the organisers say that the postponing has nothing to do with the posters.
The composer recently performed 3 shows back-to-back in Chennai and for the first time in Madurai and Coimbatore.

The grand show in Colombo was to witness AR Rahman and nineteen of India’s best male and female artists on one stage, for the first time in Sri Lanka.

In the past few days, posters were put up outside the Chennai residence of Rahman, asking him how he can shake hands with the government which is accused of killing Tamils.

When The News Minute contacted the organisers HALS Studios, they said that the reasons cited for postponing are rumors and it is only due to the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holidays, because of which there are administrative and logistical difficulties, that the show was postponed.

Rahman has announced his next Concert in Malaysia on May 4, 2016.
