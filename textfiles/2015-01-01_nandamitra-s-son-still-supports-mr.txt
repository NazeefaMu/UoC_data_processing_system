Deputy Minister Nandimithra Ekanayake’s son Chinthana Ekanayake, who is a Central Provincial Councillor, said he would remain with the SLFP and support President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“I won’t leave the SLFP. I love my father but I don’t approve of his decision to support Mr. Sirisena,” he said.
Minister Ekanayake quit the Government this morning and pledged his support to Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
