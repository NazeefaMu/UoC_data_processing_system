Digambaram, Thondaman in verbal spat over parking of vehicle

A tense situation arose when Minister P. Digambaram and MP Arumugam Thondaman met each other when both ministers visited landslide victims in the Kotmale area.
Eye - witnesses said a heated verbal battle arose between the two politicians after MP Thondaman parked his vehicle blocking Minister Digambaram's vehicle on Saturday afternoon.
After blocking Digambaram's vehicle, Thondaman had said his vehicle could not be moved due to a technical fault.
However, Digambaram said Thondaman was deliberately blocking his path in an attempt to prevent him from visiting landslide victims.
Police officers who were present at the location had to intervene to settle the matter between the two politicians who are widely known among political circles as rivals.
