Adey, Madhu Madam Enawaa  a BOOK Launch with a Difference
	
Walking back and forth under the intense heat around the huge National Museum complex established by Gregory exactly 140 years ago, searching for its Auditorium was somewhat strenuous for a septuagenarian. I was perplexed for a moment why of all the auditoriums in Colombo City, the organisers selected this venue.
Language learning concepts, an innovative idea by Madhubhashini Dissanayake Ratnayake was to be launched in printed format titled, Grammar through Literature and a memoir - A Thousand-Voiced Choir. As per the news release the specified hours were from 2 pm to 5 pm. It was when I was inside the spacious newly-furnished modern auditorium which I guess could accommodate more than 400 people, that I realized she had chosen the correct venue. 
Madhubashini, who won The Gratiaen Award for her first novel, I Have Something to Tell You, in 2011, preceded by two short listings in 2002 and 2004, preferred to begin the event in the afternoons drowsy hour that stretched till 5 pm. However, the author ensured the occasion which was open to the public to be an overwhelmingly entertaining and educative one without a single dull or boring moment. Two students of the Sri Jayawardenepura University who learn English from Madhu madam at its English Language Teaching unit, [which the VC said would be elevated to the status of a Department soon], amply demonstrated their unreserved and heartfelt gratitude to the English teacher par excellence using the opportunity accorded to them by her. They released all their accumulated energies at their disposal. Adey.., Madhu Madam or AdeySir enawaa according to one of them, is an affectionate involuntary expression by the students on sighting a good teacher approaching or passing by.
A new language is a new life. If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart as well
	It take years to put pen to paper in writing a book and months to design, edit, proofread, lay out, and released for printing which usually is the end of a long strenuous journey
Usually at book launches a couple of experts deliver boring theoretic sermons which are invariably lackluster and drab and are described as keynote addresses. [once at a famous venue for Book launches, a confused guest speaker after arriving late commenced his talk about a book written by a different author; it was later revealed that he was supposed to deliver the key note for it at the same venue on the previous week, but did not attend] The audience at the museums auditorium on Saturday 23 was given an unforgettable experience by the lady who successfully read for her Masters in creative writing on a Fulbright assignment with NY University. Language is a biological instinct: babies are born with the abilitythey dont learn to develop speech. Creativity is a biological instinct too; it could be developed by learning the intricacies only by a conflict - free mind. 
There wasnt the usual specialist Master of Ceremonies, the void was filled by Dr Sujeewa Hettiarachchi, a senior lecturer and the authors former pupil, who conducted the almost three-and-a-half-hour programme withabsolute competence. 
A common lament at every campus according to well known writer Professor Liyanage Amarakeerthi from Peradeniya universitys Sinhala Language faculty was Manngnang subject ekata ennema lassana madamlane. I wanted to inquire from islands number one authority on Sinhalese terminology, expressions and the colloquial, Professor J B Dissanayake, the father of Madhubashini madam for the meaning of the term Manngnang at the end of the programme, but the busy academic who allowed his three-year old daughter to click one letter on his typewriter, while pleading, thaththa mata eka akurak, was too busy talking about more important things with his former students who are now senior academics.
Liyanage expounded a psychological drawback in our students. He said, a student weak in the language is always a bit hesitant to go before a good-looking female teacher feeling uneasy and nervous, therefore he continued, English is Mangnang and worse Madhu Madam is beautiful.. He went on to add that it was Madhu nangi and few others who helped him to break the shackles of foreign language anxiety, or xenoglossophobia. He too suffered from the feeling of worry, nervousness and apprehension experienced in learning or using English in his undergraduate days. Amarakeerthi, amply displayed the quality of the huge personality within him when the modest man swiftly related his past, how he struggled to overcome the barriers, and repaying his debt to Madhu nangiwho always encouraged him as did with all her students, commanding You can; please do it.
Chief Guest, Professor Sampath Amaratunge, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, the tri-linguist, who used many interesting anecdotes related to learning Japanese language in Tokyo was the most hilarious of all who spoke at the meeting. With no English signs or labels that are seen around in our remotest villages, and with all the Xs, Ys and Zs converse strictly in their own language only, our academic had a trying time for the first few months until he mastered the foreign language in six months - the deadline fixed by his professor which reminded me of the famous Japanese sayings, A new language is a new life. If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language that goes to his heart as well.
The scholar used his creative skills to drive a point to the vast student population; instead of sermonizing with theories or talking directly he related his personal experiences, a creative approach. Reaching the academy by foot from his dormitory, he made it a point to talk to every single Japanese person he met on the way, often repeating the same inquiry again and again, whats your name, your pets name etc to repeat the questionnaire effortlessly on the very next day as well. A lesson on how one could learn to speak a foreign language.
Vishaka Nanayakkara, Head of the Decision Science Department of Moratuwa University who was the Director of the HETC Project at that time commented on the memoir. 
It takes years to put pen to paper in writing a book and months to design, edit, proofread, lay out, and released for printing which usually is the end of a long strenuous journey. The non-traditional grammar book that uses a novella and the classic poems of English literature written by the author, the Head and Senior Lecturer of the English Language Teaching Unit of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Ms. Madhubashini Dissanayake Ratnayake should be highly commended for her splendid work in writing the books and organizing the launch. 
Let me speak the truth; the organisers disappointed me when Madhu madams husband Pradeep Ratnayake, the maestro of the Sitar, who was also described as Ravi Shankar of Sri Lanka by the Guest of Honour, Ms. Parvathi Nagasundaram, former Head of the Department of English, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, was clad only in his formal dress, sans his musical attire, walked in with their two daughters indicating that a scintillating sitar recital like the one that mesmerized me when she launched her Gratiaen Award winning novel a few years ago at Sri Lanka Foundation Institutes auditorium was not in the cards for the day; though in fact the whole affair was a combination of entertainmentand knowledge. 
But I soon realized that the teacher had other ideas on a diversion when a well deserved opportunity was given to the students choir to sing the golden oldie, By the river of Babylon made based on the spiritual that was sung by the Jewish people in exile following the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC, changing into Sinhala version of Clarence singing alternatively with Kandukaraye seethaley, meedumthira ya-kere gewamu api jeewithe reverberating universitys ELTU Choirs rendition with three more songs. 
Sans politicians to decorate the head table, it was a memorable evening away from political jargon that pollute the environment day in day out. 
Thank you Madhu Madam.

Birthday Wishes Why all roses bloom for Ilica: Lankas sweetest social flower
	
Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne, a colourful personality in Sri Lankas social and media circles, celebrates her birthday today, September 28. A prolific writer and author whose articles, almost always, have been vivid portrayals of statesmen, literary giants and colourful personalities, 
Viewed from any angle, she has emerged a winner in life - and portrayed qualities we all desire and dream of in another human being  love, concern and an unshaken friendship especially in the darkest hours
-By Ranee Mohamed
They call her Ilica, the name her father bestowed upon her at birth. And also Malkanthi, to add a flower touch to that bundle of a bud that saw light decades ago on a September night. Today, when the mood swings her, she wraps herself with a name of her own choosing  Kamalka  an amalgamation of all her names  knowing, no doubt, that whatever name a rose is called, she smells as sweet.
It was the 1980s and young journalists of the SUN and WEEKEND newspapers were creating their best in the face of heavy competition  with each writer, being more pronounced than the other. 
Ilika Malkanthi Karunaratne, that time belonged to the category of senior writers- an established journalist, writing her vivid portrayals, profiles and news features. 
Viewed at from any angle, she is a winner. Born in the midst of esteem, class and the clink of silver spoons Ilica, rose with poise, naturally, unaffected by the prominence, eminence and power around her.
Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne, writer, author, and social icon is a doctors daughter- a daughter instilled with compassion, love and care for all living beings around her.
Her father Professor C.C. de Silva was Sri Lankas first Professor of Paediatrics. A medical professor of that era who went to University College, London and put Sri Lanka on the international map and enjoyed national and international fame. With enough reason to be proud,his daughter Ilika has always remained down to earth. Her dealings with fellow humans have always been endearing.
Known to never leave a friend in time of distress, Ilika has always won the race in this stage called life.
Ilica is the daughter of Irene de Silva. Ilika, who married UNP MP Chandra Karunaratne, has three children Kishan, Anjali and Nirupa.
Her concern and philanthropy spring from great beginnings. She descends from great philanthropists as Sir Charles Henry de Soysa, Sir Henry De Mel, Bishops Lakdasa De Mel and Harold De Soysa. 
Known to never leave a friend in time of distress, Ilika has always won the race in this stage called life. For she has always been the one to reach out in times of distress, never to leave your side till she sees you stand tall again.
She speaks with love about her dear friends  a warm and solid network of beautiful bondings that have enriched her life with happiness, laughter and experiences that only those special friendships can bestow upon us. 
Ilica Karunaratne speaks of personalities who have had an intense impact on her life, names that remain etched in her heart and life. They are J.R. Jayewardene, Dudley Senanayake, Nalini Wickremesinghe, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Lalith Athulathmudali. 
Having written about a plethora of subjects, Ilica Karunaratne knows the happenings in the country and in the city of Colombo  inside and out.
Her charming demeanour and warm smile however can be the soft exterior for the vast knowledge of hard facts that she has gathered in her extensive traverse of the journalistic arena.
Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne is a personality of substance. Her well-styled clothes have always been in good taste, soft colours, warm hues and mysterious dark designs have always been chosen to suit the appropriate time of day and occasion. Driven by the deep dress sense, the etiquette and the understanding and acceptance,Ilika has left behind a trail of colourful and mystique memories.

I have felt the full force of her friendship as she stood by me during a time when I ceased to write. She has urged coaxed, encouraged and ardently recommended me - and spurred me to rise like the Phoenix. She was always there to raise both her hands to applaud successes. She has been an inspiring breeze that blew, I know from her most sincere heart. 
Lucky are they who enjoy her friendship, luckier are they who realise its depth,if ever misfortune dare strikes -and to find, in her deep and unfathomable well of kindness, compassion and altruistic generosity, the ground spring of hope. Keeping true to the name her father baptized her in Anglian waters. Ilica: the goddess of the earth. And Malkanthi, the fragrant flower of a thousand petals.

CCD probes harassing of Myanmar refugees, court orders to obtain TV footage
	
Acting IGP C. D. Wickremaratne today directed the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) to investigate the incident in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday in which a group of protesters had allegedly harassed the group of 31 Myanmar refugees.
Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the police also obtained a court order from the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court to obtain unedited footage of the incident from the Television Channels.
A tense situation was prevailed when a group led by Buddhist monks stormed a United Nations-run safe house in Mt. Lavinia for Rohingya refugees demanding they be sent back to Myanmar.
Later, the Police transferred the refugees,17 children, 7 women and 7 men, to the Boossa Detention Centre for their safety.
A Sri Lanka Coast Guard Vessel on routine patrol duty in the seas off Kankesanthurai intercepted the fishing boat and took the refugees into custody on April 30.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Committee for delimitation of new electorates
	
In the aftermath of the enactment of legislation to change the electoral system for Provincial Council elections, the government will appoint a committee on Monday to work on the delimitation of new electorates for the purpose, a Minister said today.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha held a top level meeting with the officials of the Elections Commission on Wednesday to work out modalities for this purpose.
The Minister told Daily Mirror that a five-member committee would be appointed to work in the creation of new electorates for the purpose.
President Maithripala Sirisena will recommend names for this committee. Also, three members currently serving in the National Delimitation Commission will be assigned to this special committee.
The new Act, introduced by the government, provides for conducting the elections to the PCs under a mix of the Proportional Representation and the First Past the Post Systems. The members will be elected in equal proportion under each system.
The Minister said the process would be completed by March, next year. (Kelum Bandara)

Constable storms into superior's office brandishing gun
	
Chaos reigned at the Maragahahena Police Station on Tuesday (26) when a angry Police Constable (PC) burst into the office of his superior with his official weapon in hand shouting filth, police sources revealed.
However other police officers on duty came in to the OICs room to help to bring the situation under control. They were able to wrestle the weapon from the grasp of the enraged PC.
The trouble began at about 6.30 p.m when the PC entered the OIC's office and let off some steam before leaving the police station on his motorcycle.
The PC, who had served in the traffic unit earlier, was later transferred due to a disciplinary matter. Since then he had not been on good terms with the OIC, a fact that he did not try to hide from his colleagues.
After the OIC I.P. Chandana Vidanage had been compelled to report his bad behaviour to ASP G.J. Nandana which had led to the PC losing his cool and storming into his superior's room to confront him. Apparently at the time the incident took place several civilians too were present.
There was no sign of the PC who had taken off in a huff as of yesterday(27), a senior police officer said. (Bimal Shyaman Jayasinghe)

## Title: Continuing public interest will establish RTI
## Section: News Features

Continuing public interest will establish RTI
	
The International Day for Universal Access to Information is celebrated globally today (September 28)
It will be timely to point out on this special day that Sri Lanka, with a blossoming Right to Information Act in hand, stands at a crucial juncture in totally achieving the challenging criteria of universal access to information.
The Sri Lankan Right to Information (RTI) Act received high recognition regionally and internationally. The Global RTI Rating, a program initiated by the Centre for Law and Democracy and Access Info Europe ranked Sri Lankan RTI law on the ninth place in September 2016. As of date Sri Lanka has been elevated to the third position in the Global Indicator. Sri Lanka is ranked as having the strongest RTI law among the countries that newly implemented this law.
The RTI Act is expected to change the culture of secrecy and promote transparency and accountability of thepublic service.
Right to Information underwent a long debate in Sri Lanka until it came in to force on February 03, 2017 as the Right to Information Act. The Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) was a part of this endeavour seeing the many ups and downs of the advocacy campaign. Right to Information came in for serious consideration on the national agenda following the Colombo Declaration for Media Freedom and Social Responsibility in 1998.
We at the SLPI, concerned in securing Good Governance and Freedom of Expression, accelerated our public awareness campaigns as the advocating of the Right to Information (RTI) Bill resurfaced with the change of Governments in January 2015.
The RTI Bill was passed with amendments in Parliament on June 24, 2016 and became a law when the Speaker of the Parliament signed the Act on August 4, 2016. The RTI Act No. 12 of 2016 came in to effect on February 03, 2017.
The highest number of inquiries (38) received was from Gampaha district placing Colombo at the second place with 36 inquiries. Out of the balance 212 inquiries, 176 were from outstation areas covering all the provinces of the country.
In the current context, the Media Ministry, in terms of the Act, is the nodal institute responsible for effective implementation of the RTI. Yet, the SLPI recognized the urgent need of public awareness as well as a public response monitoring system running in parallel to theGovernment mechanism.
The new law received a most favourable response from the democracy loving public. However there were allegations about a lacuna in public awareness campaigns. In this backdrop SLPI launched a pilot project acting as a facilitator for the public to utilize the new law.
From the day that Act came in to force, the helpline established by the Sri Lanka Press Institute (SLPI) received 286 calls from the public. Within the first two weeks the data indicated a peak in the number of calls that surprisingly nosedived within the second week. Yet within two days of that, the trend started to rise gradually leading to a sharp increase as we entered thethird week.
Despite negative speculations on public awareness, the SLPI observed that the majority of the inquiries were from citizens living out of Colombo. The highest number of inquiries (38) received was from Gampaha district placing Colombo at the second place with 36 inquiries. Out of the balance 212 inquiries, 176 were from outstation areas covering all the provinces of the country. The remaining 36 callers were not willing to disclose their areas of residence.
For evaluation purposes, the SLPI team observed inquiries relating to five key issues  Education, Infrastructure, Health, Employment and RTI.
The highest number of inquiries (115) was on issues relating to infrastructure with the majority seeking information on road development. This suggested that people were most concerned about regional development with questions about the involvement of local government authorities. Interest in road development was probably due to the attention the subject received in the sphere of rural development in the recent past. There were numerous allegations of bribery against local authorities, particularly directed at politicians accused of malpractices in rural road development projects. There were several inquiries on irrigation schemes and garbage collection as well.
The second largest group of callers inquired about the RTI and its processes.
The education sector was the third largest area of public interest according to this data, with the majority of inquiries relating to school admission. This being a controversial matter in many parts of the country with paucity of information on the methods adopted, many people were keen to gather information on the subject. A few inquiries were on teacher transfer criteria, pension delays of education service personnel and information on examinations and assessment methods were received.
Surprisingly there were no inquiries on the health sector during this one month period.
Apart from these we observed that there were a significant number of inquiries on matters relating to vehicle registration.
The majority of callers had learnt about the RTI through the media - the print media
in particular.
Analysing the total data, it was evident that majority were keen on information relating to activities implemented through local authorities for the reason that a lot of the work affecting peoples lives is done through these authorities.
These observations were made during the initial stages of the implementation of the Act. It can be said that it is natural for the public to show a high level of interest at this stage. Longer observation is necessary to clearly understand public interest in RTI. The core factor in the successful implementation of the RTI Act is public engagement. The more people use this tool, the more improvement in accountability and transparency of the Public sector and its services to the country and citizens will be seen.
The momentum of public enthusiasm observed during the initial stages must be sustained. In implementing a public helpline, SLPI observed the need of a supporting network to encourage citizens to properly utilize their Right to Information. The nodal ministry and the RTI Commission must ensure the proper implementation of the Act. Keeping the peoples enthusiasm alive will be the responsibility of activists, civil society, and professional organizations and politicians representing the public.

First abolish SAITM without reference to alternatives: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said that the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) should be abolished as the initial solution to this issue without referring to any other alternatives.
While referring to the Medical Faculty Deans discussion on transferring SAITM to Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza said that a solution should be given to the students in the SAITM secondarily following the abolish of the SAITM.
The abolishing of SAITM and the transferring of the SAITM to SLIIT are two different issues. As the initial step, the SAITM should be abolished. There is no other solution. Secondarily, a fair solution should be given to students in the SAITM. The related authorities should have to get this as two different issues, he added.
He also said that transferring of the SAITM to SLIIT or establishment of private medical college in the SLIIT should have to be discussed in a separate forum and added that the related authorities to the SAITM issue should have focus on the disputed issue.
He said that the GMOA would take stern actions by protesting of the SAITM issue even in the future if they would not be provided with a justifiable solution at the earliest by the authorities.
Meanwhile, GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge reiterated the fact in a news conference that a presidential commission should be established to investigate on the issues relating to SAITM and the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH). (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

50 fishermen leaves for SL to salvage released boats
	
A 50-member fishermen team from Tamil Nadu has left for Sri Lanka to salvage seven of the 42 fishing boats released by the island nation.
They sailed from Mandapam Coast Guard Station on Wednesday morning and were likely to reach Karainagar by evening, fisheries officials said. The entire salvage mission is coordinated with the support of Indian high commission in Jaffna and the Sri Lankan navy.
The team sailing in seven fishing trawlers will tow seven boats which are anchored at the Karainagar naval base in Sri Lanka.
Since February 2015, Sri Lankan naval agencies have confiscated more than 180 fishing crafts, which sailed from Tamil Nadu and Karaikal in the Union territory of Puducherry, on charges of poaching in the territorial waters of the island nation.
In August, Sri Lanka released 42 boats belonging Tamil Nadu and Karaikal fishermen. On August 17, a nine-member team of fishermen leaders and a boat mechanic along with fisheries officials travelled to Sri Lanka by flight and visited the jetties where these boats were moored. The team took stock of the condition of the released boats and assessed the methods to bring them back.
Out of the 42 boats, 36 could be towed back to the country, said B Jesuraja, a fishermen leader at Rameswaram who was part of nine-member team that visited Sri Lanka in August.
In first phase, seven boats - six from Rameswaram and one from Mandapam - will be salvaged. "Our team will tie the boats with trawlers and tow them back here. Once they return, we will take out repair works. Each boat may require at least Rs 3 to Rs 4 lakh to be seaworthy again," Jesuraja stated. (Times of India)

Fmr. CJ Silva files a petition in SC
	
Former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva today filed fundamental rights violation petition challenging the enactment of Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill.
He takes Attorney General, the Speaker as well as the Chairman and members of the Elections Commission to target charging that at the Committee Stage all the operative Clauses of the published Bill and passed at the Second Reading are deleted and entirely new set of provisions that purport to be a replacement of the gamut of the Principal Enactment is introduced.
He also indicts the Attorney General has purported to examine the Constitutionality of these provisions smuggled in behind the back of the sovereign People amounting to an act of deception.
He alleges that the Attorney General conveniently washes his hands off from the proceedings at the Committee Stage and passes its responsibility to the Speaker who presided as the Chairman of the Committee.
He incriminates the Speaker of the Parliament that the Bill published in the gazette, placed on Order Paper of the Parliament and passed by Parliament at the Second Reading was mutilated by the deletion of all the operative Clauses at Committee Stage and that copious additions being substantial amendments to the Principal Enactment.
He contends that these amendments should have been published as a new Bill in compliance with Article 78(1) of the Constitution to notify the People being the repositories of legislative power as to its content to enable any person to challenge the Constitutionality of the Bill.
He maintains that any certification by the Speaker in respect of the provisions smuggled in at Committee Stage is ultra vires and Ab initio void. And amounts to an abdication of the executive duty imposed on him to function as an effective check on the exercise of legislative power by Parliament and constitutes an infringement /imminent infringement of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the people including the right to protection of law.
He accuses the Chairman of the Election Commission that any failure on the part of the Election Commission to hold any election promptly as and when it is due is a denial of the franchise which constitutes the sovereignty of the people.
He also accuses the Chairman and the members of the Election Commission that it has the dubious record of not holding any election from its inception.
He faults at the Election Commission that wide ranging amendments were sought to be made to the Provincial Councils Elections Act of 1988 changing the entire scheme of elections to create a confusion in respect of the applicable law relating to Provincial Council Elections and thereby provide a handle to the Election Commission which has so far worked hand in glove with the government to postpone elections to Local Authorities.

Gateway College and HNB partner to launch Smart Pay card for students
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) announced a breakthrough partnership with Gateway College to introduce HNB Smart Pay, a revolutionary new proprietary card that will completely streamline payments and attendance recording for the school.
Through the new partnership, each student at Gateway College from year 5 to year 13, will be provided with a Smart card that will be capable of serving both as a school identity card for recording and monitoring of attendance and as a key to a cashless payment system within the school, enabling students to quickly and conveniently pay school fees and carry out other transactions at authorized locations in the school including the school canteen and bookshop.
Notably, the card  which leverages Near-field Communication (NFC) technology for greater user convenience - will also allow students to make payments at selected partner outlets including Hameedias, enabling students to routinely benefit from the convenience of cashless payments even for such tasks as purchasing of school uniforms.
Commenting on the significance of the new partnership, Gateway Chairman, Dr. Harsha Alles said: We are confident that the launchof this new student card will immensely benefit the child, the parent and the school to enhance the systems and processes to prepare themselves for the technological advances in the future.
Another key feature of the Smart Pay card from HNB for schools is the improved visibility that parents gain into their childrens spending. A parent now need only load the amount of money needed for the card, meaning that students will no longer be required to carry cash with them. This will provide even greater security for the child, and provide parents with greater peace of mind, while HNB will send out SMS alerts to parents whenever the card is used for any time of transaction.
HNB is very pleased to introduce the convenience of our Smart Pay card to Gateway College. In todays increasingly fast-paced world, the creative and strategic use of technology can have far- reaching positive implications. With this launch, we aim to empowerstudents to understand the power of a well-developed savings habit and also to raise their awareness and help them to gain familiarity with a cashless payment eco-system. Utilizing these tools, we look forward to partnering with these students in their journey towards a more stable and secure financial future, HNB Managing Director/CEO, Jonathan Alles stated.
The joint initiative between the two reputed organisations was made possible through the specialized expertise developed by both Gateway and HNB in their own spheres of activity. Hatton National Bank through its innovative technological background andsubstantial customer centre network was able to introduce the initiative to the network of Gateway Colleges. Similarly, Gateway, through its use of an in-house School Management System, School Online (SOL) was able to rapidly integrate the facilities offered by the SmartCard to achieve their goal of converting the school a paperless environment.

Govt. making mistakes on rules and regulations
	
The Joint Opposition today charged that the government was committing several mistakes in the rules and regulations with regard to the elections, in an attempt of postponing elections.
JO Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena told a news conference that the government was influencing on the democracy as well as the election procedure of the country even though they had come to power to serve the country with good-governance.
He also urged the government to hold the elections as per the Constitution.
We have gone to the Supreme Court with regard to the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court has decided that it is necessary to go for a referendum to get the amendment approved, he added.
He said however, the government had discreetly included thirty one amendments to the Act on increasing women representation in Parliament and added that such an anti-democratic procedure had never taken place in Parliament after the period of former president J. R. Jayawardene.
While viewing the JOs disappointment on Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, MP Gunawardena said the Speaker had not considered their issues even after raising them in Parliament.
He had let the governments move of not holding elections as well. Parliament was suspended by him for three and half hours because there was not a two thirds majority to get this Act approved. I have never witnessed such a Speaker throughout the past years in Parliament. Do not make a mockery out of the democracy prevailing in the country, he added.
He said that only the Joint Opposition was standing by the people to protect democracy of the country. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Govt. will take over burned Myanmar land
	
REUTERS, 27 September, 2017 - Myanmars government will manage the redevelopment of villages torched during violence in Rakhine state that has sent nearly half a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, a minister was reported on Wednesday as saying.
The plan for the redevelopment of areas destroyed by fires, which the government has blamed on Rohingya insurgents, is likely to raise concern about the prospects for the return of the 480,000 refugees, and compound fears of ethnic cleansing.

IASL President and MSF Chairman reveal role of insurance industry
	
Following the declaration of September 1 as the National Insurance Day and with the Insurance Awareness Month well underway, Insurance Association of Sri Lanka President (IASL) Deepthi Lokuarachchi and Marketing and Sales Forum (MSF) Chairman Hashra Weerawardena were keen to express their ideas and opinions on certain aspects of the industry that will play a crucial role in ensuring that one day every citizen of the country will enjoy the security of insurance.
On the topic of the importance of need analysis, Lokuarachchi stated, It is an imperative requirement as it ensures that the plan that is proposed to the prospective customer will match the needs and requirements of his/her life.
Lokuarachchi also explained the manner in which the insurance advisors can convince the policyholders to keep their policies active.
Once the need is met, the insurance companies must continue to emphasize the value of maintaining a policy and paying premium so that in the case of an eventuality the desired purpose of the policy can be achieved. The payment of the premium will also enable the dependents to benefit from the life policy in case of an unfortunate event in the life of the assured. The continuation of the way of life even in this eventuality is the reason why a person would get a life insurance policy in the first place.
Premium payments and savings are synonymous in insurance. The life insurance premium includes the premium charged for the risk element and savings the component of the life policy, said Lokuarachchi, when asked the difference between life insurance premium paymentand savings.
The IASL President also went on to explain that the payment of premiums could be considered to some extent as a means of compulsory savings in a life insurance policy. However, he added that there are charges associated in the provision of life cover, which do not necessarily form part of the direct savings.
When questioned about the low level of insurance awareness in Sri Lanka when compared with that of banking services, Lokuarachchi replied, Its not a question of awareness. But the reason for the low level of penetration is the reluctance of the people to part with their cash, as they dont like to accept the fact that death and misfortune may come upon them at any unforeseeable time.
MSF Chairman Hashra Weerawardena was asked to describe the efforts of the organisation during September, the month dedicated to insurance awareness in the country.
The activities for Insurance Month commenced at the launch of the first-ever National Insurance Day on September 1 at the Independence Arcade where a special stamp and first day cover were introduced in commemoration of the event. In addition to that, sixteen locations across the island were selected for regional activations with the fullest support of the many life and non-life insurance companies, who are sponsoring and organising these events.
Up to now we have completed regional activations in the following cities  Negombo, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Kiribathgoda, Ampara, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Anuradhapura, Bandarawela, Embilipitiya, Kandy and Matara  we have also lined up programmes in Galle and Maharagama during the next couple of days, he explained.
The regulatory body - the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL), has provided the necessary guidance and support for these events by participating in several locations islandwide, thus providing the momentum for the life and non-life insurance advisors and sales staff members to meet and explain the true value of insurance, stated Weerawardena regarding the role of the IBSL in the campaign.
Weerawadena was more than pleased with the participation and commitment shown by the insurance companies of Sri Lanka during the campaign.
Even though leadership was taken on by certain companies in selecting the venues, programme, etc. the entire industry has rallied around them as one to espouse the importance of insurance to the entire population of Sri Lanka and as a result of this effort all the regional activations held so far have been a tremendous success.
The IASL hopes to raise much-needed awareness of the importance of insurance to more than one million people across Sri Lanka during September, which will thus enable the insurance industry to capitalize on the momentum gained during the month throughout the rest of the year. This momentum will also help the insurance industry in a major way to achieve the vision of a day all Sri Lankans are insured, added MSF Chairman.

Legal actions against parents of underaged drivers
	
Plans are on the process to take legal actions against the parents of underaged drivers, National Council on Road Safety Chairman Dr. Sisira Kodagoda told Daily Mirror.
He said that the parents or guardians who allowed children below the age of 18 to drive should be at the receiving end of the issue and tragedy behind it and added parents and guardians should be aware of the risk and illegality of the action.
We have to look into this matter seriously. The safety of children depends on their parents. In this case, parents need to be watchful and alert of what their children are doing. Therefore, we are to carry out discussions regarding this proposal in the near future, Dr. Kodagoda said.
He stressed that the dialogue on taking legal action against parents or guardians of underaged drivers came in the wake of the death of a schoolboy in Thalawa in a motor cycle accident where the motorbike of a Grade 10 student of Kiralagama Subodhi Vidyalaya veered off the road due to high speeding.
This was just one case; there have been many similar incidents and the situation keeps getting from bad to worse. Dr. Kodagoda added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Medical Faculty deans to discuss transferring SAITM to SLIIT
	
The deans of eight medical faculties are to meet today (28) at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to explore the feasibility of transferring the ownership of the South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) based on the restructuring module recommended by the five-member Presidential Committee chaired by Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva, reliable sources said.
Dean of the Medical Faculty of the University of Kelaniya, Professor Nilanthi de Silva in a letter sent to medical students last week had asked them to attend lectures again, saying that the SAITM issue would be settled in a positive manner soon, the Daily Mirror learns.
In the letter dated September 19 she had hinted that the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) would be taken over by another entity which she had said "would most probably be SLIIT".
SAITM will be taken over by another entity (most probably SLIIT) and when it is done within 2-3 months, SAITM will cease to exist and there will be no further admissions (i.e- it will be abolished), it said.
It had also stated the government had repeatedly maintained that its national policy was to permit private education and according to the policy a non-profit institution like SLIIT, which already has a reputation of offering high quality degrees is a better alternative than the SAITM.
Moreover, it said when the SLIIT or any other entity takes over the MBBS degree programme it would have to obtain fresh approvals in order to adhere to the minimum standards specified for medical education institutions in the country.
Also it had requested the medical students to attend a discussion to be held in Kelaniya University faculty auditorium today at 11am to discuss the demands put forward by the students to return to lectures.
However, sources close to student unions said their participation in todays discussion was uncertain.
Meanwhile, Speaking to the Daily Mirror Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva said last night that the Presidential Committee headed by him had called for the restructuring of the SAITM and for it to be linked to a government authority.
The Deputy Minister said he is not aware of any discussions that were taking place but it is moderate thinking. Let them go ahead and discuss, he added.
Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) would also meet today, reportedly to take several vital decisions over SAITM. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

MFSAC at odds with Presidential Committee Report on SAITM
	
The Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC) said yesterday they could not agree with the Presidential Committee Report on SAITM.
MFSAC Acting Convener Susitha Priyankara told a news conference that they had no faith in this report which was headed by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva.
Although the committee promised to make the report following discussions with relevant authorities, they never sought our opinion. They have not even considered the opinion of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA). All committee members are SAITM biased, he added.
He said some 7, 200 students attached to state medical faculties boycotted lectures for months demanding an immediate solution to the issue.
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva told Daily Mirror that he could not comment with regard to this concern. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

PRISTINE GLORY OF  VICTORIA PARK  IN NUWARAELIYA
	
Victoria Park Nuwara Eliya has been in existence for 110 years
Topping the list of allegations levelled against the British Empire by the third world countries is the accusation that the British rulers exploited their resources. This accusation seems to be correct to some extent. However, there are many things that we are endowed with due to their occupation in Sri Lanka. Railways, road network, hospitals and the parliamentary system of Government are some of them.
The Victoria Park in Nuwara Eliya that has been established by the Governor West Ridgeway is such an asset that it displays their necessity of protecting the environment.
The Victoria Park that was built by the Englishmen, covering an extent of about 27 acres at the bottom of Pidurutalagala Mountain, completes 110 years in existence. This park was built to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria in Britain. This facility was initiated when the daughter of the then Governor of Ceylon, Joseph West Ridgeway, planted an oak plant. The park has ever since been the cynosure of all eyes in Nuwara Eliya and remained as a place of attraction for both local and foreign tourists.
This park, located close to the town, adds beauty to the whole of Nuwara Eliya. The administrative affairs of the park have been handled by the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council to date. We can see many eye-catching things in this park. A unique tree that can be seen among the vegetation is the one that was planted by the wife of the Assistant Government Agent of Nuwara Eliya, lady M.M.Wedabon, on 17th July 1919. Its known as the Peace Tree. It was planted by her one year after World War 1, wishing peace to the world. A memorial plaque, that had been marked and placed close to the tree, had got buried. This writer unearthed it and got it re-established through the authorities.
In addition, another tree that has significance is the one planted by T.W. Mackel on 6th April 1935. This was to mark the Silver Jubilee of king George V. Another tree that catches attention is the one planted by R.M.Davies on 12th May 1937 to mark king George VIs ascendancy to the Throne.
A tree had been planted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1954 when she arrived in Sri Lanka. But that tree was stolen. A plant of a similar tree had been planted there itself on the advice of former Mayor of Nuwara Eliya K. Wijayarathnasinham. The source for this tale is another former Mayor of Nuwara Eliya, Bunty Pelpola. However, the park lost this tree when arrangements were made to expand the Nuwara Eliya bus stand, recently. Its remarkable to observe that ladies have planted a large amount of trees to beautify the park.
This park has become a unique place for the local and foreign tourists. It is a paradise for the migrant birds as well. Among the many features at the part is a date tree, which is in full bloom these days. In addition to this some of the other features that catch the eye are the Medicinal Plant Park, Victoria Museum, the Childrens Park and Rose Garden. The hut used during the British period, for the observation of the climatic conditions, is also treated as important. Many sections of the park have been rented out for various business ventures.
Environmentalists have expressed their concerns regarding these activities. There are about 40 employees engaged in the maintenance work of the park. This park generates income for the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council. It is the duty of all concerned to conserve this facility for the future generation.

Following a request made by the President, Sathosa decided to import good quality broken rice which were issued to the outlets at a price of Rs. 60 per kilogramme. Earlier a kilo of broken rice was sold Rs. 65, Mr. Tennakoon said

Other essential goods are as follows:
A kilo of big onion was sold to Rs. 125 but in other super markets a kilogram of big onion was sold to Rs.168.

Reducing the prices of essential items in the Sathosa outlets would help to reduce the prices of goods in other supermarkets as well and furthermore people would be able to get their day-to-day essentials at a one rate from all the supermarkets in the country, Mr. Tennakoon said.

Sunil Ariyaratne and Nanda Malini: Towards a new musical sensibility
	
Regi Siriwardena, who wrote about writers, directors, playwrights, novelists, and mavericks, once wrote on Willliam Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. Heres what he noted: 

From sympathy and enthusiasm through disillusionment to fear and hostility, strengthened by patriotic sentiment once the war commenced  the gamut of emotions that the two poets underwent paralleled the general movement in the reactions of the upper and middle classes in England.

Siriwardena was writing about the French Revolution, and how the initial ardour for the revolutionists soured, turning into horror and then reactionary hysteria, in England. Not even the poets were spared: overnight, both Wordsworth and Coleridge, who were in their twenties when the Monarchy was overthrown and had celebrated the social and economic uprisings it compelled, became jingoists in the most conservative sense of that term. Robert Browning, in arguably the greatest single poem in English summing up the rage of the revolutionist against the turncoat, described this shift in The Lost Leader (Just for a handful of silver he left us / Just for a riband to stick in his coat). 

Some of the greatest poets  one can include not just Wordsworth and Coleridge, but also Pushkin and Auden and Spender and Day Lewis  were either reactionaries or turncoats, whose youthful feelings of exuberance at social change slowly, but gradually, turned over. What matters today, however, is not whether they rejected the labels we had, once upon a happier time, pasted on them, but whether those labels still befit the poems and the lyrics and the songs and ditties they composed and wrote when they were still in their youth, as idealistic and revolutionary as you and I are today. I dont think theres any point lambasting them for their later reversal; after all, we have no moral right to pinpoint such reversals given our own renouncement of revolutionary fervour.

(In Delovak Athara the protagonist speaks for all of us in this sense: Everyones a socialist at 20!) In Sri Lanka the revolutionary poet was, at his or her most popular and populist, the nationalist poet: Tibet S. Mahinda Thera comes to mind at once. The conditions in Sri Lanka were not comparable to those in continental Europe, since here the main symbol of oppression wasnt a rotund, idle king and his consort but a bunch of colonialists and their brown lackeys who lived in their own privileged quarters at the exorbitant cost of the rest of the country. The reawakening that the likes of Mahinda Thera brought about, consequently, was dependent on nationalist rhetoric, to be echoed many, many decades later by a song which spoke of the kind of love for ones country that he frequently had: 

Its interesting, then, that in about seven or eight cases out of 10, even today, the conventional Sinhala song about oppression, exploitation, and misery celebrate the impermanence of suffering, echoing the Buddhist outlook on the ata lo dahama: 

That last song (Rae Wada Muraya), performed by Sunil Edirisinghe, was written by Bandula Nanayakkarawasam. I met Bandula more than a year ago, when I was attached to another paper and had to interview him. (The interview, incidentally, was never published.) Given that my knowledge of Sinhala poetry was, at best, abysmal, I asked him as to how one can trace its influence in the choice of most of our lyricists to affirm, rather than rebel against, suffering in the same way the early Wordsworth had. Obviously, the answer to this had to bring up one name. Bandula brought it up. 

When Sunil Ariyaratne wrote Perahera Enawa, he didnt depict the usual pageant, with people gazing on at the nilames and the kasa karayas with admiration. He brought up a rift between those nilames and those kasa karayas. You can argue that the function of a song is to entertain, to give us some reason to be overjoyed. I would agree, but then there must be at least some lyricists, some performers, who see in music and literature a potential to unearth the political, the social. I may or may not be able to indulge in the political the way Ariyaratne did, but that doesnt diminish my respect for him. 

The great achievement of the political lyrics of Sunil Ariyaratne and the political songs of his musical consort, Nanda Malini, was their ability to unearth the social reality behind the colourful facade. They do this in Perahera Enawa, which unlike Wordsworths later poetry and like William Blakes best poetry undresses whats perceived, and celebrated, in favour of whats real, substantive, and all too common. Consider the opening: 

The sense of grandeur in the first two verses is roundly negated by the third. As the song moves on, thanks to Nanda Malinis dexterous ability to convey both infatuation and irony through her voice, that sense of negation gets more potent, more discernible: 
The truth is, as far as I can make it out with my knowledge of the field, that the classical Sinhala poet did not bother himself with the kind of revolutionary rhetoric that Ariyaratne and Malini did. Its their penchant for routing tradition, without flouting it outright, which crops up in gushes and torrents in their most acerbic work. Consider the following: 

The last line brings out a point of comparison between the contemporary politys act of yielding to superstition and the classical eras conflict between Buddhism and the many variants of Hinduism and Jainism: essentially, the intrusion of superstition on the temple of reason. The attempt by the poet to bring together the temple and reason, incidentally, is another sign of his political outlook: for the Marxist in Sri Lanka, the only clergy worth reckoning with were those who dabbled in rationalism: Walpola Rahula, Kotahena Pannakitti, and those denounced by D. S. Senanayake as political bhikkus. 

Budu Himiyantath Kaliyugaye, the opening to which I quoted above, was not part of Nanda Malinis most fiercely political album, Pawana, but rather of the earlier Sathyaye Geethaya, which also had Perahera Enawa and where she and Ariyaratne were less fierce, less overt. The fact that Perahera Enawa, Sakura Mal Pipila, and Sukiri Batillange Geethaya are celebrated, even today, in favour of and over the Pawana songs brings up a whole new debate about the rift between the political and the aesthetic in music, and indeed in the arts in general. Malinda Seneviratne once observed to this effect that the Pawana songs were dated (for the most) and hence were not as remembered or timeless as Malinis earlier work on childhood, adolescence, and repudiated love. 

Malindas contention about the timelessness or lack thereof of a particular epoch of a particular artist is a variation on the largely bourgeois debate between the timelessness and the specificity of a work of art. In conventional Marxist dialectics, theres no production without consumption, no consumption without production. What is true for economics is true also for literature, music, even the cinema: a novel or a play becomes a novel or a play by its act of being consumed by audiences. When the ardent Marxist seeks to analyse an objet dart on the basis of the social processes which bred it, he or she divorces the act of interpretation from the production of new, subsequent meanings. 

I return to Regi Siriwardena with a question he once raised: Does Maname mean for us what it meant for audiences in 1956 The question, bewildering if not downright redundant to some, was a response to the ardent Marxists rubbishing of classical art, in particular Greek art: It is because these texts have been most susceptible to continual transformation of meaning that they have survived. In other words, the best art is not conditioned by notions of timelessness and specificity; on the contrary, the best art survives continual change, while yielding to it and at times even defying the intentions of its authors. (Derrida wrote on the death of such authors; Lester James Peries denied its relevance, while the more political Dharmasena Pathiraja, in an interview I had with him, affirmed it as preferable to the bourgeois notion of the director as a definitive auteur.) 

What Malinda observed about Malinis songs is, for the most, contradicted by their continuing relevance today. Yadamin Banda Vilangula, to give just one example, was written as a response to the atrocities of the then government led by the United National Party, and was frequently broadcast in the run-up to the January 8 election in 2015. 

But I digress. Here are Malindas views on the matter, in his own words: I cannot help feeling that a cart was put before a horse; that literature was approached through politics and therefore only its purely political message was extracted and its larger call for recognition and exploration of humanity was missed or ignored or both. 

Humanity: the ardent Marxist might rubbish that as indicative of the writers bourgeois inclinations, just as it is of those who talk about the timelessness of a text, but to me the counterargument is quite simple, really: was it not humanity that mobilised an entire population through her verses, some of which were more effective than all the humanistic poetry in the world in substituting active participation for passive affirmation 

That last song (Seethala Polawama) was used by detractors of the former regime, incidentally; by those who vouched for the UNP, the JVP, and the TNA, against the imprisonment of Field Commanders and Chief Justices. Not timeless enough I think not. 

And so, in the general order of things, in my book, they remain timeless enough. Where their writer and performer went wrong (because yes, they did go wrong, right after Pawana) is grist for another article. Next week. For now though, I am done.

The classes are quiet when there are teachers in them and noisy when there arent any. One such day our class was noisy so Fr. Margesz walked in and asks who is supposed to be the teacher here today Why is he not here  The third question would normally be what is the subject to be taught in this period today
Whether we say Physics, Chemistry, Algebra, Geometry, Arithmetic, Statics Dynamics, Trigonometry, Botany or Zoology. Fr. Margesz would ask where you boys stopped at the last class you had . Fr. Margesz would then get to the black board keep his box of chalk on the desk and continues from where we had stopped at the last class whatever the subject would be.
This is to show the closeness of the altar boy and the priest. It is a new development coming from the Vatican II Council in session now in Rome. Fr. Margesz was always up to date in everything...
Fr. Margesz was so keen in our educational programmes that he took every step to teach any of the subjects to get the class going. Not everybody could change from subject to subject like one could change from channel to channel on a television set just as he had it all well programmed not only in his head but also in his heart. We believe that this was Fr. Vice Rectors God guaranteed talent and a dedicated service both well mastered. As a result of this today we see that every student who had learnt in his classes is doing yeoman service in society in the fields of Engineering, Medicine, Law, Armed Forces, Politics, Church Ministry or Social Media.
During his time the Lab-boy in the bio-lab who worked under Fr. Margesz was Mr. Laus.
He told me of this incident. You have been an altar server faithfully serving the Rectors or the Vice Rectors mass, (pujahver) every Sunday at 6 OClock hours without fail for many years. You may not be aware that I clearly remember that on one such Sunday this mass which starts sharp at 6 O Clock started at about 6.05. Later when I was seated having breakfast in the refectory with the Sacristan, Mr. Marcelline, I asked him Why did the mass, the Pujahver, start a little late today about 5 minutes, after 6
He replied Fr. Margesz, did not start the mass because the student of the college, who comes to serve the Rectors Mass every Sunday was a little late. The Swami waited till the boy came and got dressed up in his red cassock and it was only after all that did the Swami start the Sunday Service. I responded I never heard of a priest ever waiting till the altar boy arrives to start a mass. Are the altar boysso important 
On Monday, the next day, when Fr. Margesz came to the bio lab Mr. Laus asked the Swami why he had to wait till the Altar Boy came. Fr. Margesz, the Vice Rector whom the College Minor staff refer to as Praanser Swami responded in good Sinhala with a French accent. This is to show the closeness of the altar boy and the priest. It is a new development coming from the Vatican II Council in session now in Rome. Fr. Margesz was always up to date in everything. When he was in class teaching Geometry the Triangles, circles or cyclic quadrilaterals drawn on the on the black board and his Sinhala letters on the black board written for certain explanations were like computer printed stuff because Fr. Margesz was an excellent artist.
Many students of St Josephs College both the young & the old who learnt under, knew or came to know of Fr. Margesz and experience the depth of his great Services, always remember this missionary priest as one who has helped us greatly to fit right into the path of KNOWLEGDE & VIRTUE, in scientia et virtute.
Written with the help of the clerics and altar boys of my University Entrance class of 1964/65 under Fr. Margesz our Vice Rector. They are Fr. Leo Perera, Fr. Clement Waidyasekera, Fr. Nihal Nanayakkara, Fr. Joe Anthonypillai, S.J. Fr. Mervyn Perera, PC Romesh de Silva, GM Suresh Britto.

Fr. Margesz: A philosopher and a conscientious scientist
Sergeant Major. Fr. Alphonse Gerard Lucien Margesz, OMI, was born on September, 28th 1907 in the little industrial town of Lille, in Northern France. During the First World War he served his portion of compulsory military service for the French Army and rose to the rank of Sergeant Major.
He commenced his primary theological studies in the seminary in Liege Belgium and completed his higher studies at the Gregorian University in Rome obtaining a doctorate in Philosophy. He was ordained minister on June 26th 1932 and came to Sri Lanka on January 30th 1933. He chose Sri Lanka for his missionary work due to the influence of Very Rev. Fr. Peter Pillai OMI, the first Sri Lankan Rector of the French Missionary College, St. Josephs. Very Rev. Fr Peter Pillai OMI was able to see the profound sterling value of Fr. Margesz OMI, his contemporary when they were at the Gregorian University in Rome.
In 1948 he was sent to the Catholic University of Washington, USA where he obtained a MSc. Degree in biology. On returning to Sri Lanka he took duties as Professor of Biology at St. Josephs College, Colombo, and served as Vice Rector for 15 long years. Besides being a philosopher he was also a conscientious scientist, a Mathematician of repute and a talented Musician who trained and conducted the choir. He had a botanical garden at St. Josephs College where he was able to make a single rose tree bear Red, Yellow, White and Pink roses. He was a beautiful singer who sang with a rich baritone voice and last but not least he was a gifted artist.
It was during his time of service at St. Josephs College that he was awarded the Distinction Chavalier de lOrdre des Palmes Academique by the French Government for the services he had rendered in the field of Education.
Fr. Margesz was sent to Rome to do a course in the Judicial Process of the Matrimonial Court and practised this ministry at Borella. While he worked here I used to visit Fr. Margesz in his room and often I had to walk back very silently in order not to disturb our dear Vice Rector lying in bed in his white cassock. He used to do this due to fatigue in his mid seventies.
On Monday the 7th 1985, a car at the Archbishops house was to take Fr. Margesz to the doctor. But Fr. Margesz did not come down to the car. He was in his bed in his white cassock. He had breathed his last that day, a feast day of his Congregation.

UAE law targets sexual harassment, forced labour
	
REUTERS, 26 September, 2017-
The United Arab Emirates, criticized globally for its treatment of migrant workers, issued a law on Tuesday to combat abuse of domestic staff, state news agencyWAM said.
It includes prohibitions on sexual harassment, forced labour, and the employment of domestic workers under 18.
It also stipulates that workers are entitled to one paid day off each week,
30 days of paid vacation per year and up to 30 days ofsick leave.
President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan approved the law, which was praised by human rights organizations when its draft was passed by the countrys legislative body in May.
The UAE relies heavily on migrant labour with an estimated 8 million workers making up more than 80 percent of its population, according to the International Labour Organization.
The Gulf Arab state has in the past been sharply criticized by groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for allowing domestic staff to endure long hours, unpaid wages and abuse.
The new law covers 19 service work occupations, including guards, parking valet workers, gardeners, domestic workers, cooks, and nannies, as well as private trainers, nurses, and drivers.

Uma Oya project: MR says damage done minimal if measures were taken
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that the Uma Oya project was started on a proposal submitted in 2005 by the then Minister of Agriculture Anura Kumara Dissanayake, though his party has now decided to jump on the present government's bandwagon in blaming his government for the negative consequences of the project.
In a statement, he said the first water seepage had only taken place in late December 2014 just days before the present government came into power.
The environmental harm it has caused could have been averted if remedial measures had been taken at that time. However the new government took no action to correct it as it was too busy persecuting the opposition, he charged.
He said the Uma Oya project has come in for much criticism in recent times.
The JVP leader stated in Parliament that as a result of ground water seeping into a tunnel being constructed as part of the Uma Oya project, wells, streams and springs in the Bandarawela area had run dry and that thousands of acres of agricultural land have been affected. After things started going wrong, the JVP, ministers and various NGO activists started make statements laying the blame for all this on me and my government, he said.
The full statement is as follows:
The Uma Oya project
The Uma Oya project has come in for much criticism in recent times. A few days ago it was reported in the media that the Kirindi Oya tributary which flows past Bandarawela had suddenly gone dry as a result of this project.
The leader of the JVP stated in Parliament some weeks ago that as a result of ground water seeping into a tunnel being constructed as part of the Uma Oya project, 2,333 wells, streams and springs in the Bandarawela area had run dry, and cracks had appeared in 4,625 houses, six temples, one mosque and three schools in the area due to the change in ground conditions, and further that thousands of acres of agricultural land have been affected.
After things started going wrong, members of the JVP, ministers in the yahapalana government and various NGO activists have been making statements aimed at laying the blame for all this on me and my government.
One minister said that this situation had come about because I had wanted to divert water to Hambantota to irrigate land in my village. The President also stated that this project had been carried out due to political requirements.
The Uma Oya project consists of constructing a dam and reservoir across the Uma Oya at Puhulpola from where water would be diverted via a 4 km tunnel to another dam and reservoir constructed across the Mahatotilla Oya in Dyraaba. Water from this second reservoir would be channeled through a 15.3 km tunnel to a hydroelectricity powerhouse.
The outflow from the powerhouse is to be diverted via a 4 km tunnel into the Kirindi Oya, to provide water to parts of the Moneragala and Hambantota districts. The diversion of the Uma Oya has been under discussion for well over sixty years.
The idea was first mooted in 1959 in a study carried out by the United States Operations Mission and the Canadian Hunting Survey Corporation. It also featured in the United Nations Development Programme/Food and Agriculture Organisation Master Plan (1968-1969) for the Mahaweli project.
Studies regarding the Uma Oya diversion project were also carried out by the Lahmeyer International Company of Germany in 1989, by the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) in 1991 and by SNC Lavalin Inc of Canada in collaboration with the CECB in 2000. During the UNP led government of 2001-2004, at inter-ministerial meetings held in December 2003 and February 2004, chaired by the then ministers of power and energy and irrigation Karu Jayasuriya and Jayawickrema Perera with the participation of all the ministers and MPs of the Uva province, it was decided to implement the proposed Uma Oya scheme as a high priority project. 
On 26 January 2005, under the Chandrika Kumaratunga government, Cabinet approval was granted to proceed with the Uma Oya project, based on a cabinet paper submitted by the then Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation, Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
The Deputy Minister of this ministry at that time, was Bimal Ratnayake. The JVP Ministers Cabinet Paper bearing No: 05/0036/039/002 dated 4 January 2005 stated the following:
QUOTE:
For the development of the South East Dry Zone in Sri Lanka, (particularly Hambantota and Moneragala districts) there is no other alternative unless water is diverted from Uma Oya to the South East Dry Zone.
Strategy for economic development of both Hambantota and Moneragala districts changed during the recent past and diversion of Uma Oya to Kirindi Oya is now seen in the perspective of recently conceived Ruhunupura development. The infrastructure of Ruhunupura development consists of the development of the Hambantota harbour into one of the modern harbours in the region, international airport in the Moneragala district, and an oil refinery. It is expected that the Hambantota harbour will attract a large number of ships sailing in the Indian ocean. Also a large number of industrial activities are expected to take place in and around Hambantota including tourism. For all these new developments, projected water requirement has been estimated as 100 MCM in the year 2030. In the absence of a reliable source of water in the area, water from Uma Oya is seen as the only alternative to supplement this requirement.
Therefore high priority should be given for this project.
END QUOTE.
It was only after all of the above had taken place under previous governments that the Uma Oya project appeared in my 2005 presidential election manifesto as a priority project. The JVP supported my candidacy at the 2005 presidential elections and Uma Oya was made a priority project of my government.
From winning the war against terrorism to building highways, harbours and power plants, my government did many things that previous governments had only been able to dream about, but never implement.
Uma Oya was one such project. On 27 November 2007, consequent to consultations held earlier that year by the then minister for enterprises development Sarath Amunugama and the then minister for power and energy John Seneviratne with the Export Development Board of Iran (EDBI) and Farab Company of Iran, an MOU was signed with the Iranian government under the terms of which the EDBI would finance the project and Farab Company, would prepare the detailed engineering design and carry out the physical construction.
The contractor Farab Company is owned by the Iranian government and a team of engineers from the irrigation ministry, CEB and CECB had checked the credentials of this company and its experience in handling similar projects.
In 2008, a Cabinet appointed Negotiating Committee got the contract price fixed at USD 514 million.Though the contract was signed in 2008, construction did not commence until 29 November 2011 until the Central Environmental Authority gave it clearance and a full feasibility report acceptable to the engineers of the Irrigation Ministry, Ceylon Electricity Board and the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau had been received.
Ground water seepage is inevitable when drilling tunnels and measures have to be taken to prevent it. According to information available to me, the water seepage has taken place because the German manufactured drilling machine did not have the additional components to fully seal the tunnel as it moved forward.
This was apparently due to the project consultants failing to provide the correct advice. The first seepage of water had taken place only in late December 2014 just days before the presentgovernment came into power. The environmental harm it has caused could have been averted if remedial measures had been taken in time. However the new government took no action because they were too busy persecuting the opposition.
The JVP was also too busy persecuting the Rajapaksas and helping the UNP to run the FCID to make representations to the government to rectify a problem that had arisen in the only major project ever initiated by a JVP Minister.
I now learn that the necessary equipment has been obtained from Germany.
Whenever a large scale infrastructure project is implemented, there will be communities that are adversely affected. When the accelerated Mahaweli project was implemented, the entire Maskeliya town had to be shifted to make way for the Maussakele reservoir and the Teldeniya town had to be shifted to make way for the Victoria reservoir.
The extent of water seepage during the drilling of the Uma Oya tunnel, may not have been anticipated. But in projects of this magnitude, even unanticipated contingencies have to be provided for. Many large projects were implemented during the nine year tenure of my government, and some displacement of people did take place, but there was no public unrest because problems were identified early on, and compensation packages provided to the satisfaction of those affected.
Such alertness and efficiency is however lacking under the present government. Today, the situation is such that if a citizen loses his house in a landslide or flood or some man-made disaster, he will be living in a tent or a school until the next government comes into power. There is now agitation over issues that have emerged in the construction of the Central Highway which have not been resolved by the government.
Those affected by the unforeseen problems that have emerged in the implementation of the Uma Oya project have had to endure the consequences of the inherent inefficiency of the present government.
