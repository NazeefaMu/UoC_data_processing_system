Next Police Chief: An insider with an academic background?


	



 

The battle over the main chair in the Police department is going ding-dong these days.

 


Although the battle is said to be four-cornered, there is only one aspirant putting up a real spirited fight, they say.


The spirited fighter bent on grabbing the coveted chair by hook or by crook is wooing not only the support of the powerful political figures here but also that of certain influential expatriates in distant France, they say.

 

However, the stark reality is that the hopefuls are battling for this chair in vain, because those in the highest echelons have already decided on the appointee, they say. This columnist can offer a hint pointing to the lucky person: He is a scholar with an academic background and credentials in the field of public administration. He already holds a high position in the Police.
