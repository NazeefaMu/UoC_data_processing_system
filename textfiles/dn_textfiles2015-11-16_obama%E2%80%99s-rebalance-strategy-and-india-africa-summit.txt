Obama’s rebalance strategy and the India -Africa Summit

The first focus is on the US and the Asia Pacific region. The recent focuses of the US in the Asia Pacific region include five years of intensive negotiations that led to the conclusion of the landmark TPP - the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, President Xi's visit to the United States, and the trilateral summit of the leaders of Japan, Korea, and China. Followed by the historic Burma's election, President Obama's travel to APEC and the East Asia Summit, and the climate conference in Paris.
TPP is a trade deal-intended to support high-paying jobs and strengthen America's middle class. It will cut taxes on U.S. exports; it will help American small businesses to export by eliminating obstacles and opening markets, sets new rules for economic engagement in industries and reduce subsidies to state-owned enterprises abroad that make US businesses less competitive.
TPP is one part of a larger programme to strengthen the Pacific region economically with its roots in APEC. TPP sets high standards on good governance. Countries like Vietnam won't see the full economic benefits of TPP if they don't live up to their commitments to meet international standards on labour rights, for example and includes capacity-building and training that will help the less-developed TPP members meet their obligations. TPP is the economic leg of the Obama Rebalance.

Chinese President Xi's September visit to Washington has focused on cooperation in areas like climate, global health, counter-piracy, Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan and likely ensures disagreements or a crisis do not escalate into a conflict. The US secured a commitment from President Xi that China will not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft for commercial gain.
South China Sea
Approximately perhaps two dozen U.S.-China leaders meetings since the President Obama took office has in the words of Daniel R. Russel, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs put a "floor" under the relationship. In the South China Sea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan contest the sovereignty of many of the islands since sovereignty over islands gives legal entitlements over the adjacent seas. The South China Sea is a rich fishing ground with potentially significant hydrocarbon reserves. The US insists that all claims, territorial and maritime, be made based on international law, and that differences be addressed through diplomatic or legal means since these are vital shipping lanes, carrying over half the world's merchant shipping tonnage.
The US sees Southeast Asia is an important driver of growth, since a crisis there would seriously harm the global economy whilst some of the affected countries are U.S. treaty allies and close friends.
China, in 2014, launched a building spree in the contested waters and, the Chinese military has at times warned U.S. and other ships and planes in the region that they should not enter China's so-called "security zone."
The recent transit of a U.S. Navy ship near several of the disputed features is a reminder that international law applies to the South China Sea. During his visit, President Xi Jinping took a major step forward at the press conference in the Rose Garden with President Obama, when he stated unequivocally: "China has no intention of militarizing its islands in the Spratlys.
"If China follows through on this pledge, the other claimants may follow suit. Another major development was the decision, by the arbitral tribunal under the Law of the Sea Convention, that it has jurisdiction over a case brought by the Philippines evaluating China's maritime actions and claims in the South China Sea, including the so-called "9-dash line."
APEC members
This case won't address the question of sovereignty, but by applying the international law of the sea, it has the potential to resolve some important differences over the rights and entitlements of the claimants to the South China Sea maritime space and its resources.
The meetings in Seoul between the leaders of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea of three major economies and key players in regional security supports regional prosperity and American interests.
After the trilateral, President Park and Prime Minister Abe held their first summit. The leaders agreed to accelerate discussions to resolve the sensitive historical issue of "comfort women"... which would be particularly meaningful since it’s the 50th anniversary year of South Korea and Japan normalizing relations.
It makes the region more secure and helps the US better address global challenges and seize new opportunities.
Burma conducted a historic election. It fostered a civil society that engages directly with the government. Burma is also negotiating and is engaged in political dialogue with ethnic groups after nearly 70 years of ethnic-based conflict.
President Obama will travel to the Philippines for APEC – and an initiative the U.S. launched in 2011 will bear fruit: APEC members will reduce or eliminate tariffs on dozens of goods that make "green" economic growth easier and cheaper. These reductions complement the strong environmental provisions in the TPP, and will help American green tech companies.
After APEC, the President heads to Malaysia for the East Asia Summit and meetings with ASEAN leaders.
The US invested in ASEAN, through President Obama's regular participation in the Summit by sending a dedicated full-time ambassador.
The Summit brings together the ten ASEAN countries and eight dialogue partners, including the United States, China, and India for a wide-ranging discussion of the leading issues.
It helps the US take the Rebalance global, engaging key players in the Asia-Pacific on issues beyond the region, such as ISIL and the challenge of violent extremism; Iran; cyber security; and global health challenges like pandemic disease.
President Obama is expected to press a forward-looking agenda at APEC and the East Asia Summit - one that supports inclusive economic growth, builds momentum toward a successful outcome at the Paris climate talks in December, increases the region's ability to weather disasters, empowers women as full and equal economic participants, encourages innovation and aspiring entrepreneurs, stands for fairness and the rule of law, and launches ambitious discussions of digital trade and other issues critical to the future of the U.S. and regional economy.
Shortly thereafter, world leaders will gather in Paris for the global climate talks. The U.S. and China are the world's two largest emitters, and the ambitious targets both Presidents set last year, affirmed this year, were important. South Korea is hosting the U.N. Green Climate Fund. Japan has pledged $1.5 billion dollars to it.
The strategic priority that President Obama placed on the Asia-Pacific region when he came to office in 2009 makes sense with a constructive relationship with China and strong ties with other powers like India and Indonesia. Overall the rebalance has generated much.
The second focus today is on the India-Africa Forum Summit.
A record 41 of the 54 leaders of the African Union (AU) came together in Delhi at the end of October for the third India-Africa Forum Summit. Previous summits were held in 2008 and 2011. Previously, the India-Africa summit followed what was called the ‘Banjul formula’, that the AU would be represented by 15 leaders chosen from the five founders of the New Africa Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) — South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Senegal, eight RECS (or Regional Economic Coordinators), the current and incoming AU Chairperson, and the AU Commission Chair. This year India invited all 54 African Heads of State or Heads of Government.
Scholarships and infrastructure projects
The attendance of all led to some problems, as the dispute between the AU and Morocco over the Western Sahara state called SADR (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic). Morocco claims the SADR, while the AU recognises it as a full state, which led Morocco to walk out of the AU in 1984. India recognised the SADR in 1985, but then withdrew recognition in 2000. For the Summit, India said it had invited ‘all’ African Union countries and Morocco.
A full debate ensued at the summit, when Algeria and others tried to insert a clause on ‘colonialism’ in the draft declaration, which could have been aimed at Morocco, but which could also be read as ‘anti-Western’, which India, given its good relations with the U.S. and Europe, wished to avoid. To the credit of senior MEA officials, the situation was sorted out, but not before delaying the declaration and the subsequent presidential banquet.
India’s announcements of $10 billion fund, 50,000 scholarships and infrastructure projects benefit India as much as they do Africa, giving a toehold in a continent where China and the U.S. already have a greater presence. For most countries there, India represents a country with similar problems, tropical climate, and challenges of poverty and disease, but has overcome many of these challenges through low-cost innovations. As a result, India’s rural healthcare, water conservation techniques, scientific expertise, educational facilities and programmes for women mean much more than the amount of aid would. In the IAFS declaration, the clauses on cooperation on food security, solar power technology, satellite weather research and the ‘blue’, or maritime economy will probably go the longest way on the India-Africa partnership.
There were four key Summit take aways:
U.N. Reforms - India has been lobbying to reform how the U.N. is governed, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking out for a change to the Security Council to better reflect today’s geopolitical realities with PM Modi and his colleagues seeking to win support for India’s candidacy.
Terrorism - The summit also focused heavily on terrorism and defense. The Westgate Mall attack in Kenya and the continuing raids by Boko Haram in Nigeria and neighbouring states were brought up by the Kenyan and Nigerian Presidents, respectively. PM Modi has repeatedly voiced his concern regarding rising terrorism and the need to quash it. Cyber security, maritime security and defense cooperation were also on the agenda.
 
Climate Change - PM Modi called on the assembled African leaders to join an alliance of solar-rich countries at next month's Paris climate conference. Both African nations and India want to "light up lives of our people and power their future," Modi said, adding that it should be done in such a manner that "snow on Kilimanjaro does not disappear, the glacier that feeds the River Ganga [Ganges] does not retreat."
Development Initiatives-The announcements of $600 million in grant assistance along with a $100 million India-Africa development fund and a $10 million India-Africa health fund demonstrates India's transition to a more active development donor and partner. India-Africa trade currently stands at nearly $72 billion, twice as much as five years ago but still small in comparison to the value of the China-Africa trade, over $200 billion.
Taken together the Foreign Policy initiatives presented here shows different styles of two powerful nations working with regions of strategic importance to their respective interests.
