Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today dismissed media reports that prices of canned fish would be increased.
“There is no truth in these news reports. Measures have only been taken to provide high quality canned fish to the consumers,” he told a news conference held at the ministry.
Earlier, Cabinet approval was given to increase the trade levy on a kilogramme of Mackerel --being imported for the production of canned fish -- from Rs.50 to Rs.100 a kilogramme.
