We are also answerable for your actions, the Thera tells him!


	


	There is a prominent Buddhist monk who played a lead role in the campaign to bring the present government to power. It appeared at that time that he firmly believed that the Compassionate One would work on an agenda based principles aimed at ushering in a just society.

A delegation from an association of university dons that worked shoulder to shoulder with the movement led by this Buddhist prelate in the run up to the January 8 big poll recently called on the latter for an exchange of views on the current political situation.  During the discussion that ensued, the university dons expressed their grave concern over a series of ‘blunders’ committed by this government since taking office. They had further appealed to the prelate to request the New Big Boss to set right certain wrongs done by his administration.
The prelate who himself was quite unhappy  with the way the affairs of the state were being run had immediately called the New Big Boss over the phone and expressed his deep disappointment over certain commissions and omissions on the part of the regime.  He had added: “Mahattayo, what are these doings of your government?  We promised to reduce the number of ministers.  But the number of your ministers is steadily increasing. But that’s not the only promise you have broken… We kindly request you to consider the position we are placed in as well before taking vital decisions. I am making this request in all earnestness because we are also answerable in respect of the promises held out to our voters at the last election!”
