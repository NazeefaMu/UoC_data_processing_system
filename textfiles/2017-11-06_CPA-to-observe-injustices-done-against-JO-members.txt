The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegates are due to arrive in Sri Lanka on Saturday, November 11 to observe on the charges of injustices against Parliamentarians of Joint Oppositions.

JO Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardane said this delegation would come to the country after participating at the Commonwealth Parliamentarians Association Seminar in Bangladesh.

He said a request had been made in a letter to CPA to explain and reveal the denial of due privileges to the Members of the Joint Opposition.

“The JO will inform the delegation, especially about the inadequate time allowed for the JO members, to express their views in Parliament,” he said.

He said that 820 minutes were allocated to 12 TNA and JVP members, while only 210 minutes were given to 53 JO members during the Parliamentary debate on the new Constitution. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
