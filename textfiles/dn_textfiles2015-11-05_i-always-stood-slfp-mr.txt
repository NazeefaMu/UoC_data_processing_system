I always stood by the SLFP - MR

Kurunegala district Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the SLFP was his lifeblood because he is a born SLFPer who had stood by the party through thick and thin without abandoning or betraying it during various upheavals which occurred through its history.
Rajapaksa said as such he never contemplated on leaving or betraying the party which carried him to the highest pedestal in the country.
However, if the SLFP hoped to go it alone at the forthcoming local government elections he would be compelled to rethink his position because he was always on the side of the common opposition.
Speaking to the Daily News, Rajapaksa said he was fully aware and certain that the SLFP could not win elections by contesting single handed.
He said that was why he believed the SLFP should contest in coalition with the common opposition. "It was only by going to the hustings in coalition with other parties in the common position that the SLFP would win elections convincingly," the former President said.
