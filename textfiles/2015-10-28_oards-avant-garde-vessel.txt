The team was sent by the PRECIFAC to verify if there was a connection with MV Avant Garde and the Rakna Arakshana Lanka Ltd. (RALL), PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille De Silva said.
The Police team is to count all the weapons and ammunitions on board the vessel, he said.
The Sri Lanka Navy found 810 weapons on board MV Avant Garde at the time of its detection at sea some 12 nautical miles off Galle on October 6.
It is reported that the ship crew had also claimed the weapons belonged to RALL.
