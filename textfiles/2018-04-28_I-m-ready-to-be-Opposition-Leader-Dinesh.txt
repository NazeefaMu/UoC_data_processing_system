While claiming that the joint opposition had secured the majority in Parliament, joint opposition parliament group leader and MP, Dinesh Gunawardena said he was ready to be the official Opposition Leader in Parliament.

He told a news briefing the incumbent Opposition Leader, R. Sampanthan was not performing his role in Parliament and should resign from the post of Opposition Leader.

的t is visible that Mr. Sampanthan is supporting the government rather than raising his voice against the malpractices of the government. The Opposition should perform its role of making constructive criticism on the policies of the government. Mr. Sampanthan should also speak on behalf of the concerns of the people,杯he MP said. 的nstead of discussing burning issues of the country, the TNA is supporting all decisions taken by the Government. That is why we have taken the initiative to change that trend of the Opposition.箱 (Sheain Fernandopulle)
