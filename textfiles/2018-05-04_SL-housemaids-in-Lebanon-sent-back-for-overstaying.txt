A total of 58 Lankan housemaids who overstayed in Lebanon were returned to the country today.

They were returned by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Beirut on a Kuwait Airways flight that touched down at the BIA at around 9.30 am.

Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) officials, who received the group on their arrival, took measures to send them to their residences.
