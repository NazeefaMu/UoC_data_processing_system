Sri Lankan racing driver Dilantha Malagamuwa said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured him that an independent investigation would be conducted over the alleged death threat.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Malagamuwa said Premier Wickremesinghe had phoned him yesterday morning and told him that he would inform the police to conduct an investigation.

He also said he had informed the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara about an alleged death threat he received two months ago.

A special police team had commenced investigations following a complaint made to the police Head Quarters on July 4 into an alleged plot to kill him.

According to sources, Mr. Malagamuwa had lodged the complaint based on information received from the police during an interrogation with an arrested underworld figure.

When answering a question raised by a journalist about death threats to Mr, Malagamuwa the Minister said that he had not been informed about any death threats on him.

If Dilantha informed the police, they will conduct the investigations without any other interference. No one will intervene in police investigations. Investigations would be conducted according to the complaint. We cannot put the blame on any accused until the investigations are over. Impartial legal actions will be taken against anyone accused of after the investigation. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
