Name the MPs who intimidated journalists: Namal tells NYT


	

Joint opposition MP Namal Rajapaksa today asked New York Times (NYT) International Editor Michael Slackman to specify which Sri Lankan MP they accused of having intimidated journalists.

The NYT said in a statement that a group of Sri Lankan MPs allied with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa had publicly criticized two journalists who contributed to the New York Times investigation into the Hambantota Port.

“When and where did this occur? These types of unspecified, vague accusations are exactly what we have a problem with. At no time did former president Rajapaksa or myself intimidate journalists who worked on this article. Just like the media has a right to criticize politicians, don't we also have the right to "publicly criticize" reporting we believe to be faulty?,” he said in a tweet.

Mr. Rajapaksa said this wasn't the first time that the NYT got a story significantly wrong because of anonymous sources.
