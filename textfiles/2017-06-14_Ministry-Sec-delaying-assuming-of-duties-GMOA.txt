The newly appointed Health Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne had been unable to assume duties due to the differences with Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said.

Mr. Seneviratne, who is currently working as the Mahaweli Development & Environment Ministry Secretary was appointed as the Secretary to the Health Ministry by President Maithripala Sirisena a week ago.

Responding to a question raised by the Daily Mirror journalist at a press briefing held in Colombo, GMOA’s Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said though President Sirisena appointed Mr. Seneviratne as Health Ministry Secretary, he had not assumed duties so far.

“We have information that Health Minister Senaratne opposes the appointment of Mr. Seneviratne. The new Secretary has a remarkable record in the places where he served. We suspect whether the Minister wanted to appoint someone close to him,” he said.

Responding to the matter Mr. Seneviratne said he could not say an exact date that he would assume duties on the new position, however there was no special reason behind the delay.

“I’m not aware that the Health Minister Senaratne opposes my appointment. At the moment I cannot give an exact date that I’m going to assume duties. Soon after my work done at the Mahaweli Ministry, I will assume duties,” Mr. Seneviratne said.

Minister Senaratne could not be reached for a comment. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
