Daily Mail/31 January 2017-  Ashley was playing with her snake without her plugs in her stretched lobes when he decided to pop his head through the gaping hole.  


But then, what began as a funny moment between owner and pet quickly turned into a problem when it became clear that Bart was too big to fit all the way through.  


When Ashley realized that there was no way for her to safely extract her pet from her earlobe, she headed to the ER.  


While waiting in the doctor’s office, Ashley snapped an incredible image illustrating her predicament, and shared it on Facebook.  


Luckily, the doctor’s would have better luck sorting out the situation than Ashley did on her own.  ‘They numbed up my ear and used string to pull and stretch it out more so that they could get him out without hurting him,’ Ashley explained in the comments of her post.
