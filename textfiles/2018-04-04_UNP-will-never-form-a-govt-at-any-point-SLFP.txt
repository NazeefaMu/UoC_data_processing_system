The UNP will never be able to form its own government at any point, SLFP Minister Susil Premajayantha told Parliament today.

Mr. Premajayantha said this in response to UNP MPs who shouted saying they will form a UNP government shortly.

“Let’s see how you are going to form your own government. What you are trying to do is destroying the national government,” he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
