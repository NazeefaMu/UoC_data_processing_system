6 months ago, Arimac Lanka -- a Sri Lankan tech company that is being the genesis of interactive digital media with the vision of provisioning a unified open platform to creative wizards -- started a project with the aim of creating a video role playing game with Sri Lankan flavour.

The project named as “Kanchayudha” and the story and the concept are designed based on a historical Sri Lankan background. The storyline, characters, places and surroundings are entirely fictional.

With this game, you play the role of a Sri Lankan Warrior who faced difficult chapters in his life prior the events of the game. You are open to explore, solve puzzles, sneak or fight hand to hand in order to reveal the stories of his past as well as the upcoming challenges.

Now the game has been released to the public with a surprise. Earlier this week, CEO and Head of Innovation of Arimac Lanka, Chamira Prasad Jayasinghe announced that as a gratitude for the awesome fans of the game, Arimac Lanka is giving the digital download free of charge. That means Sri Lankans can download the game for free. 

You can download the game from the site www.kanchayudha.com
