Following reports that there is an unprecedented increase in the amounts of heroin and Kerala ganja being smuggled into the country, the intelligence sleuths who went into action on the orders of the main office, had uncovered the details of this latest phenomenon.

 


They had discovered that these narcotics were being brought to the spots along the Southern coast hidden in fishing boats that set out to sea from Negombo.  The most surprising discovery the security sleuths have made is that the racketeers behind this operation are three leading politicos whose reputation is such that none would dare link their names to anything shady 
or illicit! 


The highest in the country’s political echelons is already in the know of the names of the Big Three behind this smuggling operation, they say.
