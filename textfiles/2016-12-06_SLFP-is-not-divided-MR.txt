Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had not been divided but asked how party policies could be protected when they were betrayed by obtaining ministerial portfolios under the UNP Government.

“The SLFP is not divided. It is not just a name board. How can the party policies be protected when they were betrayed to the UNP? Some SLFP ministers are accusing us of dividing the party while enjoying the perks attached to the ministerial portfolios of the UNP government,” he said.

 Mr. Rajapaksa, in response to a question by journalists with regard to the withdrawal of the case against former minister Basil Rajapaksa, said that when fake cases were filed, those who filed them had to withdraw them.

“When false cases were filed, they have to withdraw them as they cannot proceed with the cases. This is utter revenge. Nothing done to take revenge is successful,” he said.

Mr. Rajapaksa, responding to a question on whether there were any divisions within the Joint Opposition as reported in the media, said no one could divide it as it was truly a Joint Opposition.
