SL Christmas carols service printed out wrong lyrics for Hail Mary prayer


	

A Christmas carols service in Sri Lanka mistakenly printed out the lyrics to gangster rapper Tupac's hit song 'Hail Mary' on thousands of its service programmes.

The unfortunate mix-up took place at the Catholic 2016 Joy to the World Festival, which was held at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka.

Instead of reflecting on the traditional Catholic prayer's message of how 'blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus' - attendees were presented with lyrics reading:  'I ain't a killer but don't push me, revenge is like the sweetest joy, Next to gettin' p***y.'

Sri Lankan journalist Jithendra Antonio uploaded photographs of the carols program to his Twitter account, tagging Pope Francis and CNN.

The lyrics were printed on over 1,000 flyers for the event - which is heralded as one of the biggest carol services in the country, according to Pedestrian TV.

The event was billed by organisers as 'a fund-raiser for poverty alleviation projects jointly organised by the Archdiocese of Colombo and St. Joseph Vaz Trust.'
