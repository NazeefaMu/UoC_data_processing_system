The annual historic Bellanvila Esela Perahera (Pageant), the 68th in the series, began parading the streets in July. This year the greatest strength behind this much looked forward to event is the fact that it’s dedicated to Ven Prof. Bellanvila WimalarathanaThera. The monk was subject to an untimely death, and his absence in Buddhist activities is considered a great loss. All activities throughout the pageant will be carried out in memory of the late priest.

		It’s a well-known fact that the concept of this pageant was the brainchild of the late Ven. Bellanwila Somarathana Thera. This majestic street pageant has come a long way, thanks to the guidance all the organisers received from Ven. Dr. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thero. The monk was the Chief Sanghanayaka of Singapore and the Viharadhipathi (chief monk) of Bellanvila Temple.   

Ven. Dhammarathana Thero is committed to continue this esteemed religious festival with the support of the other priests and members of the pageant’s organizing committee.   

Ven. Prof. Bellanvila Wimalarathana Thera was the chief architect of this pageant. It was started as a ceremony to bless the people and their cattle during times of famine and epidemics in the Bellanvila area. However, the pageant has gradually grown into a religious and cultural festival. This year its Organizing Committee will pay special tribute to the Late Thera so as to appreciate his years of service to the country and the people.   

This ceremony includes three days of religious sermons (Dhamma Desana) which draw devotees to the historic Bellanwila temple. Invoking of blessings starts with a week-long Pirith (chanting). This is followed by the Deva-dootha Perahera, Dorakada Asna, Kumbal Perahera, Mal Perahera, Paawada Perahera, Ransivili Perahera, Diya Kapana Perehera and Deva Daanaya along with many other ceremonies.   

In this consumerist society, it is no secret that people have to deal with life’s challenges on a regular basis. A temple is a place that gives such people much relief. One such place is the Bellanvila Rajamaha Viharaya, which over the years, has given the people the confidence to face life’s challenges  through spiritual upliftment.   

In addition to that, the Bellanvila Temple provides many services to the community throughout the year.   

 


 

Dhamma Education

There are two Dhamma schools which function in English and Sinhala mediums respectively. In addition to offering support to school children, who study Buddhism in both languages, it also enhances their knowledge of English. The Sri Somarathana Memorial Programme also provides scholarships to school children from low income families. This is a huge relief to parents who struggle to find the means to pay for school materials.   


 

Skill building

The Temple provides technical and industrial training to youth which includes lathe work and welding. This training along with skills in English and the knowledge of the Japanese language are offered free of charge to young people in the area.   

The Vocational Training Centre has been in existence for over 30 years. The number of students who enroll at the Centre post Ordinary Level exams has increased over the years. The Centre continues to offer these opportunities and those who have enrolled are reaping the benefits of all this training.   


 



Housing construction

The Temple also builds cost effective houses for the less affluent, annually. This is considered an incredible service and a support to those from low income families in the area.   


 

Health

The entire income from the car park goes into the health programme. These monies are especially used to provide financial assistance to patients who undergo surgery. Approximately 50,000 rupees is provided every month to many people. The temple offers these services without seeking publicity.   

The Temple also conducts health clinics where Government doctors offer their services voluntarily. Lab tests are also done and this is an invaluable service to low income families. Especially, the cost of diagnostic tests are extremely expensive and this clinic eases that burden. Going to a Government hospital at 5 a.m is difficult; especially for ailing and ageing patients. Hence this service is greatly appreciated, as it is a reach-out programme for the needy.   

In addition to this, vision tests are also done and spectacles are donated during eye clinics.   


 

Assisting other temples

Every year the Nayaka Thero selects a temple in a faraway place and supports it in many ways. Starting with an almsgiving, essential utensils are provided to these temples. Robes are offered to the monks while books are also provided to the children visiting the temple. Individual assistance is also provided to priests.   


 

Providing flood assistance

During the recent floods, the temple was instrumental in collecting dry rations for those affected. The temple authorities then distributed these aid items in collaboration with the Government. While many groups and media institutions sought publicity during this calamity, this temple offered its services in silence in offering food to landslide victims.   


 

Pageant 

Coming back to our main topic this month, it should be acknowledged that the pageant is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and colourful of its kind to be held in the country. The representatives of the Pageant’s Committee also provide opportunities to students of traditional dance to display their skills. The dance segment importantly includes dance forms of various parts in the country. In this aspect there is no discrimination to anybody. Hence the organisers include up country dance, dancing forms from the low country and Sabaragamu. The Perahera in Bellanwila is unique in providing opportunities for men, women and children, who wish to take part in the pageant. The authorities don’t allow women to take part in these pageants. 

This is one event which goes beyond commercial norms; other such pageants enjoy exclusive sponsorships. Even traditional business rivals come together to sponsor the Bellanvila Esela Pageant. Although there have been many changes in society, the religious and cultural features of the pageant have been protected and passed to the next generation. 

Not only Buddhists, but Hindus, Christians and those belonging to the Islamic faith have offered support for this pageant.  This has been done with the motive of bringing everyone together. The pageant gives an opportunity to vendors to make significant profits through sales. Pineapple, ‘achchaaru’ and gram sellers can earn during the pageant what they usually make during the entire month. All this was the vision and concepts of the Late Thera. His absence is seriously felt during this period. His knowledge of many things and healthy attitude-to help people-always bubbled to the surface during past festivals. Hence the people of the area were ever so grateful to him.   

The pageant will be telecast live on television. There are plans to make details of the pageant available on the world wide web for the benefit of international viewers. With the members of the pageant’s committee  hoping to promote this even with the Tourist Board from next year, more foreigners are expected to visit the Temple to witness the pageant in the future. The Pageant concludes on August 12.
