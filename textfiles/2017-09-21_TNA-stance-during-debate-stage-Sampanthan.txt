The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) will come up with its stance on the interim report of the Constitution at the time when it is debated in the Constitutional Council in the near future, TNA and Opposition Leader R Sampanthan said today.

"We will talk about the report later and what I would like to stress now is the need to build a peaceful and united Sri Lanka," he said.

Speaking at the constitutional assembly, the opposition leader said what is needed is to ensure that country achieves peace where it's people could live in harmony.

"There were so many efforts to bring in reforms in the past. Some important proposals were made during the efforts made by the then government which attempted to bring in constitutional reforms in August 2000. However, none of them could be incorporated to the Constitution. Such a situation made educated citizens in this country to take up residence in other countries," he said.

"We need to salvage the country' s reputation. We have been left behind while other countries march forward with economic development. Let's all join in the journey towards success in the future" he said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
