MP Vijayakala’s case postponed until Feb.22


	

The case filed against former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran over her controversial statements regarding the LTTE was postponed until February 22 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne today.

The Chief Magistrate postponed the case since no instruction had been received from the Attorney General yet.

MP Maheswaran recently said at a public event in Jaffna that there was a huge need of reorganization of the LTTE in the North and East.

She later resigned from her ministerial portfolio after a huge outcry over her remarks from people all over the country.
