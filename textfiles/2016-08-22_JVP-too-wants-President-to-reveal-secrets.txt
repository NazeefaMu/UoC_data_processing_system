JVP too wants President to reveal secrets


	

President Maithripala Sirisena should reveal what he knows about his rivals now instead of threatening to do so when a new political party is formed by them, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today.

“Whatever secrets President Sirisena knows about are not personal disputes between his family and that of the Rajapaksas or some personal matter. These are obviously things which the people of this country know about. Therefore the President should reveal these secrets now,” JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said responding to the statement made by the President at the Matara rally recently.

He threatened to reveal the secrets if the joint opposition formed a separate party.

“The President should not keep such secrets to be disclosed only when his party is threatened,” Mr Dissanayake said. (Yohan Perera)
