Two ancient Buddha statues, three copper caskets, and three conch shells that had allegedly been dug up from a treasure in Mahakanadarawa Forest Reserve in Mihintale had been seized by Anuradhapura Police during a raid in the forest reserve, a Police Spokesman said.

“However two treasure hunters left the bag containing the artefacts and fled the scene. Police gave chase to arrest them but to no avail,” the officer said.

He said one of the statues was about five inches in height and weighed one kilogramme.

They believe that the Buddha statues might have been made of gold. A senior Police Officer said the artefacts would be referred to the Department of Archaeology for examination and report.

He said investigations were continuing to identify the suspects to arrest them.
