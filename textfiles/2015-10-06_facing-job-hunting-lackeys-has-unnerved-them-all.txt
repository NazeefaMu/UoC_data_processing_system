Facing job hunting lackeys has unnerved them all!


	


A group of Green and Blue party Diyawanna members found themselves engaged in an animated colloquy in the House lobby the other day.   The topic that figured at this discourse was one of shared concern for them all: How to find jobs for the supporters who campaigned for them at the recent poll at the risk of losing their limb or life.
Addressing a Betel leaf party Ministerial one, a Green party colleague from Rajarata said: “Our supporters are now coming after us seeking jobs. But all Ministries that can provide jobs have gone to your party people.”  “You are sadly mistaken, machang,” replied the Betel leaf colleague from the West. “Our Ministries are no better than yours. All institutions coming under my purview are beggarly ones just existing hand-to-mouth!” 
“Accept the reality, machang,” another Green party one put in. “There are six Ministries that can easily generate jobs. Five of them are being handled by your party people.”
“That’s quite true,” a Green party colleague agreed. “Of the six job spinning Ministries, we have got only Education.”
Another Green party member tried to cheer up his unhappy colleagues: “Our party is back in power after a long spell. So let us be patient…There might be better times ahead!”
