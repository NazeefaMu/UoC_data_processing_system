BLACKOUT DUE TO TECHNICAL FAULT

The country experienced an islandwide blackout on Sunday night, for more than three hours, due to a technical fault at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).
Speaking to the Daily News, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said an unexpected drop in the electricity demand, during off-peak hours, was the main reason behind the blackout.
Siyambalapitiya said the power went dead throughout the country because of what is called cascade tripping.
The blackout was experienced from 12 midnight to close to 4 am.
“The demand plummeted to a region of 850 Megawatts from the usual range between 2,000-2,100 Megawatts, which caused the grid to trip,” he said.
The CEB found it difficult to deal with this unexpected situation,” the minister explained.
Minister Siyambalapitiya also apologised to the public over the inconvenience caused by the unexpected blackout.
However, Minister Siyambalapitiya said, the Ministry of Power and Energy, has launched an immediate inquiry into the incident.
The committee investigating into the matter will comprise of relevant officials and experts. Ministry Secretary Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda said the report of the inquiry would be handed over to Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya for further action.
Meanwhile, a CEB statement said that on an ordinary working day, maximum peak demand during night increased upto about 2,100 MW and reduces down to about 1,100 MW after midnight. However, during week-ends the maximum night peak demand is about 1,900 MW and the minimum demand will be reduced down to 950 MW.
“Yet on this Sunday, the total system demand had further decreased and it was around 1,775MW during the night peak which is a significant reduction from the usual. Furthermore, at 0053 hrs the demand was further reduced to around 940 MW which is much less than usual 1100 MW and this too was falling further.
According to a CEB Engineer, this is the second time that a cascade effect had caused an island wide power failure in the country since 2010.
Asked why they took so long to restore power after the outage, CEB sources said they had to synchronize the operation of power units across the country. “It took time,” they said.
“The power supply demand fell yesterday because it was a Poya day and it rained right throughout. Industries and shops were closed because of that.. Also,people did not have to turn on their fans due to the inclement weather,” an official said. Meanwhile, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Employees’ Union convener Ranjan Jayalal also said that the blackout was purely due to a technical fault.
