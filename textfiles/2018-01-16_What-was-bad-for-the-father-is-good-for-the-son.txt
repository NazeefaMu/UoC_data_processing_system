A scion of a well- known political family candidate has drawn the ire of his kith and kin by coming forward to contest the local polls as a candidate of a political party which his dead father fought tooth and nail during his long political career. 

 


The family elders are livid that the candidate has used the picture of his dead father in the posters he has put out to win the sympathy vote of his father’s loyal followers. They have urged the candidate to remove these posters which they claim is an insult to his father. However, he had pleaded with them saying, “Aiyo, how can I remove them at this stage!”, they say.
