A tall order by the ideal candidate


	



 

The JO is looking for a suitable candidate for City Mayor to be fielded on the Pohottuwa ticket at the coming local government polls. 

 


The former strongman leading the JO group had put in feelers to several former mayors in deference to the opinion of several party high-ups that one who had already gone through the mill would fill the bill better. 


In fact, the former strongman had sought the advice of a politico who had to quit this post quite recently about a candidate capable of giving a fight to Rose Madam to come from the Green party and the latter had recommended Omar K as a good match for the Green candidate. 


However, Omar K had reportedly replied that he was willing to run for city mayor only if the Pohottuwa becomes part and parcel of the Blue party before the filing of nominations.
