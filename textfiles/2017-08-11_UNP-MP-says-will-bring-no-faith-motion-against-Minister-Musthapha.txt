UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri said he will bring a no confidence motion against Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapha in the near future.

“I will bring a no confidence motion against the Minister as he has been continuously evaded answering oral questions" the MP told Parliament last morning.

"I hope backbenchers will support me in this endeavor" he said. (Yohan Perera)
