No-faith motion: Speaker to rule on Thursday


	

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday informed Parliament that he would give a ruling on the no-confidence motion against Minister Ravi Karunanayake on Thursday after consulting the Attorney General.

"It is essential to consult the Attorney General because an objection has been raised on the basis that the matter is subjudice," he said.

The Daily Mirror reliably learns that some government members are of the view that the no- confidence motion is subjudice because the inquiry being carried out under Section nine of the Commission of Inquiry Act was similar to that of a case being tried in Court.

The Speaker informed Parliament about his ruling on this matter when joint opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa requested the Speaker to rule on the no-confidence motion.

MP Udaya Gammanpila said the no-confidence motion had nothing to do with the inquiry into the bond scam.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe joining in the cross talk said the Speaker could give his ruling today or tomorrow. "We can take up the motion soon after the Speaker gives his ruling. This government has ensured parliamentary democracy and therefore there is no issue," he said.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked why the no-confidence motion was not included in the parliamentary order books. "Speaker could do so despite the objections raised on the motion's legal validity," he said. (Yohan Perera)
