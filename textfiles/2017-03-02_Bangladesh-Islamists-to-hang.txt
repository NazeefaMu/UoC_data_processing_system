THE HINDU, 01st FEBRUARY, 2017- Five Islamist militants were sentenced to death on Tuesday by a special court in Bangladesh for murdering a Japanese citizen in 2015.


The convicts are the members of the banned outfit Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), which orchestrated a string of explosions in 63 Bangladesh districts in 2005. The JMB was later outlawed.
The Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for Kunio Hoshi’s murder in October 2015, but the government has repeatedly said the West Asia-based terrorist group has no presence in Bangladesh.
