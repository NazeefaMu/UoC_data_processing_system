Pedagogue goes off at a tangent


	



 

A delegation of chief purohitas the other day called on the former strongman at his official residence in the city. 

 


The chief purohitas, all from the Betel leaf party were bent on negotiating an agreement with the former boss to contest the upcoming local and provincial polls as a unified entity.


The talks were proceeding on a cordial note when a Diyawanna member, a well-known pedagogue, going off on a tangent launched a long-winded lecture on the country’s economic crisis and several topical issues like the bond scam. Finding that the discussion was moving on a wrong track, one of the chief purohitas who happened to be a past pupil of the pedagogue pointed out that they were veering away from their subject.


However, the pedagogue continued to hold fort regardless.  At this stage, the chief purohita interposed: “Sir, I am a pupil of yours. Your lecture is certainly interesting and we don’t mind listening to it. But not now, but at some other time! Now let us get back to our subject under discussion!”
And that exhortation from the pupil silenced the voluble politico and negotiations were soon back on the track.
