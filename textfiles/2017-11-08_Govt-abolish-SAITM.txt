Government had decided to abolish SAITM to resolve all other issues pertaining to the same before December 31 this year and to continue the ban on recruiting new students to the SAITM, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said today.

Making a special statement at the constitutional assembly, Dr. De Silva, who is also the Chairman of the committee appointed by the President said appropriate steps would be taken with regard to students of SAITM who have already completed the medial degree as per the University Act No 16 of 1978.

Dr. De Silva said these decisions were made after discussing with the parents of Medical Faculty students last morning and with Acting Secretary to President Sumith Abeysinghe and Secretary to Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake. "We hope those who are engaged in the death fast will end it," Dr. De Silva added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
