Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday warned that action would be taken against the electronic media, who used government's telecasting licence to insult religions and some sections of the society.


The Premier made this comment with reference to the recent singing by a female singer, who sang the sinhala song 'Danno Budunge' in opera style at the Independence Day event in Colombo.


"The television or radio, these frequencies do not belong to those media companies. The government issued the licnece. They belong to the public," he said making a special statement in Badulla.


Commenting on the recent bill with regard to the increase of women representations in the country’s decision-making bodies, the Prime Minister charged that the ‘Rajapaksa’ gang in Parlaiment attempted to sabotage it by way of entering into the chamber in Parliament.


“It shows that that group doesn't care about the women’ rights at all,” he claimed.
