Neville's Valencia still winless as Villarreal go fourth

 
MADRID, THURSDAY: Gary Neville remains without a win in La Liga as Valencia boss as Villarreal moved up to fourth thanks to captain Bruno Soriano's spectacular free-kick in a 1-0 win on Thursday.
Bruno found the top corner from the edge of the box midway through the second-half to allow Villarreal to edge two points ahead of Celta Vigo in the battle for the final Champions League place.
However, Valencia's ambitions of a top-four finish now look forlorn as they lie 11 points behind their local rivals in 10th.
Valencia had only managed to draw Neville's opening two league games in charge against Eibar and Getafe before the 10-day winter break. And the former Manchester United defender took a more defensive approach in a bid to at least preserve his unbeaten record with a five-man defence as Villarreal dominated the first 45 minutes.
Roberto Soldado had the best chance to open the scoring against his old side, but the former Tottenham Hotspur striker failed to connect with Jonathan dos Santos's inviting cross. - AFP
