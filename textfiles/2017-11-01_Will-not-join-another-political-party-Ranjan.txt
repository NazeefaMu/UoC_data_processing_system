Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake, who lost his Divulapitiya UNP Organizer post several days ago, said that he would not join another political party.

“I will go home but will never do jumping politics, rumors that I am going to another party is wrong, I will never betray my voters and will fight to achieve what we promised,” Ramanayake tweeted.
