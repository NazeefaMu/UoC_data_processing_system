Sri Lanka Cricket today appointed former South African quick Allan Donald as their bowling consultant on a short-term deal. 

The former Proteas spearhead will oversee Sri Lankan bowlers during the Champions Trophy in England in July, before moving to English county Kent as their assistant coach. Kent recently appointed Donald as the assistant to Matt Walker but yet to join the team due to a visa issue. 

Donald, 50, took 330 wickets in a Test career that spanned 10 years, and helped the development of South African pace trio—Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander during his stint as their fast bowling coach.

“Donald is currently slated to take on a role as Assistant Coach at Kent County who have agreed to release him for a two month stint with SLC in the lead up to the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England and Wales from the 1st –18th of June this year,” Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement.

Donald is expected to arrive in the island on Monday and expected to join the national squad in Kandy on May 9 in their residential training in Pallekele.
