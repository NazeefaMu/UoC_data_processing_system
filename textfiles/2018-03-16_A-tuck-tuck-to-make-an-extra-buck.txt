There is a two star-rank cop working as a tuck-tuck driver to earn an additional income, they say.

 


This cop clever at warming his way into the graces of powerful politicos, is often seen driving the tuck-tuck in uniform. Those of higher rank in the service reportedly turn a blind eye to the unethical conduct of this cop. Meanwhile, the other tuck-tuck drivers in the area complain that their khaki-clad colleague is bullying them abusing the clout of his rank.
