Pope Francis has urged the world's Christians to reject gluttony and materialism as he ushered in Christmas with a late-night Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. 

Francis, marking the sixth Christmas of his papacy, led a solemn service for nearly 10,000 people in the Vatican church for his traditional festive.  

During the Mass the Pope urged people in the developed world to seek a simpler, less materialistic life and condemned the yawning gap between the rich and the poor. 

Worshippers who want to catch a glimpse of the Pope at Christmas were advised to request tickets up to six months in advance. (Daily Mail)
