This is the heart-pounding moment a prowling lion sneaks up on a dozy leopard in an unusual encounter between two of the world's big cats.

Out on the hunt at the Sabi Sands private game reserve in South Africa the lion was spotted by guests out in the distance.

In the foreground was a sleepy leopard, who lay down for some rest on top of a mound. (Daily Mail)
