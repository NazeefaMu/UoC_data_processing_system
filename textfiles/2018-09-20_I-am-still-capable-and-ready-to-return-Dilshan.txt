While stressing that he is still capable and fit enough to play cricket, Sri Lanka's legendary cricketer Tillakaratne Dilshan said today he was ready and willing to contribute for the welfare of Sri Lankan cricket either as a player or a consultant considering the continuous struggle of the current Sri Lankan cricket team.

Responding to speculations circulating in the social media hinting of his comeback to International Cricket, he told the Daily Mirror that he was ready to return to the Sri Lanka cricket team if Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) or the Ministry of Sports requested him.

“I continue to play my domestic cricket. Hence, it is not a challenge for me to return to the international side again,” Dilshan said.

“I always think of my country. I presume I did my best in cricket prior to my retirement. However, I am of the opinion that I should do something more for my country,” Dilshan added.

Dilshan last played for the Sri Lankan side (in ODIs) on August 28, 2016.

Despite speculation that he wanted to play until the 2019 World-cup, due to certain issues, he had to retire earlier. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
