While claiming that the Joint Opposition members were against the attempts made to further postponement of the local Government elections, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said today it was the responsibility of the Government to hold the elections without delay.

He told Parliament that people were expecting the elections and added that there was confusion in the country about the elections being postponed.

"Now it will run into three years since the election being postponed. Why are these elections postponed? It is a small election. The full responsibility to hold the elections is on the part of the Government. It is the Government that postponed the elections," he said.

The leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said they were also against the postponement of elections.

"We need an election. We have finalised nominations. The candidates have already begun their election campaign," he said.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said this was an issue about the democracy and pointed out that the Stay Order was a result of the Government's attempt to postpone the elections.

He charged that some Ministers used their Secretaries and confidantes in the case filed to postpone the elections.

TNA MP M. Sumanthiran, who joined the crosstalk, said they also want the election held soon. (Ajith Siriwardana)
