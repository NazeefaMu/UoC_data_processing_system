Dreaming of magical things at 21

I know I am grinning the same way the characters of ‘Kuda Hora’ are grinning from the framed photo on the wall as I sit in a comfortable straight-backed chair in the comfortable ‘den’ if I may call it that, of my favorite writer. It is only 9.30 in the morning, and I am amused because I realize someone has already got an appointment before me, with the legendary author and illustrator of children’s books whose fame has reached every corner of the globe.
I am amazed at how much he has to say as he talks non-stop, never allowing any of his companions to utter a word. Suddenly I’m on my feet, for she is here before me. “So lovely to see you, Puthe,” says Sybil Wettasinghe, greeting me with a hug. Waving her hands towards the window of her study she dismisses the chatter-box, “he is a bit angry with me today because I got late to give him his breakfast.” He, of course is the ‘Thun Iri Appu’ who appears on the rooftop next to her study window every morning. She says she spends hours watching her guests who drop in to have breakfast with her. Apart from the chattering squirrel the others guests are, four red-vented bulbuls and a few babblers who drop by, later in the morning.
“Can you believe I am eighty-eight?” she asks me, seating herself in the rocking chair by the window: the kind we usually see by a burning fire on a winter evening when children gather around their grandma begging for a story. But this is not winter, a ray of sunlight falling on the brown carpet, tells me so, and the only child around is inside my heart waiting ever so eagerly to hear a story, perhaps the one about the cabbage and the cucumber who went for a bath!
I shake my head in answer to her question. No. I can’t believe she is eighty-eight. “Don’t look so incredulous,” she chides. “I don’t feel I am eighty-eight. Age is nothing to me. Even though I turned eighty-eight (Saturday before last), I still have the mind of a child.”
And so, we move towards our topic. What would she do if she was twenty-one, today? A slow smile brightens her face. A sparkle comes into her eyes. “I would live my life exactly the way I lived it when I was twenty-one!” she proclaims.
The reasons are simple. It was when she was twenty-one that she had had the most wonderful, the most eventful time of her life! Having started work at the Lankadeepa when she was seventeen, by the time she was twenty-one she had joined Lake House, first as an illustrator of the paper called Janatha, later to broaden her horizons working with legendary editors like Denzil Peiris and Tarzee Vittachi, “for everyone at Lake House wanted my illustrations.” She confesses everyone thought she was a wonderful artist and she enjoyed basking in this new found glory.
“I didn’t lose my head though,” she assures me with a twinkle in her eye.
Love too, was hovering in the air when she was twenty-one, leaving memories in her heart she would no doubt love to rekindle if she were to turn twenty-one again. “He was very handsome, tall, fair, a man of few words. I was his opposite, dark and short. But for some reason he was attracted to me.” She recalls it was while she was in her early twenties that Don Dharmapala Wettasinghe had started to court her, by giving her presents such as the beautifully illustrated Aesop’s tales and The Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám. Yet, he had never told her what he felt for her, even though he would have found many a chance to do so, as he too was working at the Lake House, as the Chief Sub Editor. She remembers he was fond of her work and would often comment, “I love your pictures, all those beautiful lines and beautiful colours...” Looking back at her youth today, she realizes he must have meant something more as well when he praised her illustrations. Things moved onto a different level when, one day, he asked her if she would like to have a cup of tea in the canteen. She agreed and, after they finished the tea, he asked her if he could drop her home. “It wasn’t as if he had a car to take me home,” she muses. “He meant could he take me home by bus!”
These are the things she would love to recapture if she could be twenty one today. Especially that memorable moment when he first touched her hand one evening when she was working late: she remembers how he had simply kept his hand on hers for the briefest of seconds and walked away. She didn’t know it then, but many years later, he would grasp her hand with all the energy he could summon as he lay dying at the age of 63 in a private hospital in Colombo.
As he breathed his last he slowly let go of her hand, as if to indicate that the life they began together the day their hands first touched had now come to an end. She didn’t cry that day. She came home from the hospital and wrote a poem instead: a poem that forms the epilogue of her biography ‘The Story of Sybil Wettasinghe’, by Vijita Fernando.
No, she insists, even if she was twenty one today, she would still not embrace modern technology. “I use the computer only to send and receive emails,” she says sans any traces of regret. “I am proud to say I write all my stories by hand. There is something mechanical in a computer...something that stops my thoughts from flowing.”
And this is all that matters: keeping all those thoughts flowing: turning them into stories and pictures: a process which culminates in the joy she feels when she receives letters and phone calls from children who have read her stories.
“There are children from Bibile, Mahiyanganaya, Galle, who write to me, or come to see me to tell me they read my stories. Parents from Japan, Denmark, Germany send me emails or call me to tell me their children refuse to fall asleep unless they hear one of my stories. No award can replace the joy I feel when I get to know children love what I create.”
Her age might change, but Sybil Wettasinghe knows she herself will never change. “I’m unchangeable.” She is certain of this. “Whether I am twenty one or eighty eight I will always be a true villager.” The girl who went to the village school in Gintota and listened to the stories her grandmother and mother narrated, on moonlit nights when the entire village gathered in their garden, still lives within her.
Thus I leave her, seated in her rocking chair, grateful for the glimpse she had given me of her life, of the child in her who will remain the same whether she is twenty one or otherwise, who she feels is her “guiding light” forever reminding her “of the enchanting wonderment, mystery and charm of the fantasy world of little children.”
The last poem in her autobiography, “A Child in me” sums up her life so completely. “A child and a grown up, live as one, in perfect harmony within me...together they dream of magical things...”
As I walk away I glance up to see Thun Iri Appu peering down at me from the rooftop. “Tring, tring,” he seems to say, “Sybil Nanda is our very own, magical friend.” I believe him.
