Multi Plugs to be banned, square pin plugs to be the standard: PUCSL


	

The use of square pin plugs in future will be the standard for Sri Lanka and as such the import and manufacture of appliances other than G-plugs commonly known as square pin plugs will be banned in future, Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) said.

The Commission has decided that the Type G-plug and socket outlet, widely known as the 13 Ampere plug and socket outlet, commonly referred to as the “Square Pin” plug and socket is to be the national standard in Sri Lanka,

 



To plug these different plug-tops for different socket outlets people tend to follow unsafe actions such as 

Use of Low quality multi sockets (multi plugs)
	Use of low quality extensions
	Permanently blocking the earth hole to keep the gates open (Ex. Inserting pens / pencils to the earth hole)
	Inserting naked wires in to sockets


“There has been some 95 electrocutions in 2015 up from 76 in 2013 and 73 in 2014. Use of substandard plugs, sockets, electrical accessories, adaptors and extension cords are one of the main causes for electrocution and fire.

To mitigate these unsafe practices and to standardize use of plugs and related materials in Sri Lanka, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has introduced a new set of standards.   



Manufacturing and Importing

With effect from August 2017 all Electrical equipment’s and appliances manufactured or imported must only contain 13 Ampere square pin plugs only(This standard applies for Mobile phone charges as well)
	 
	Only 13 Ampere plugs/sockets (type G) will be permitted to be manufacture or imported with effect from August 2017.
	 
	All extension cords manufactured or imported with effect from August 2017 must contain only 13 Ampere sockets and an inbuilt fuse
Sale of Plugs and Sockets 

With effect from August 2018 only 13 Ampere plugs and Sockets could be sold (sale of all types other than type - G plugs and sockets will be banned)
	 
	With effect from August 2018 only Extension Cords with 13 Ampere sockets and an inbuilt fuse could be sold (sale of all other types of Extension cords will be banned)
	 
	With effect from August 2018 all electrical equipment's and appliances sold must contain 13 Ampere Plugs (Type - G)
For consumers who are already using Non standardized types of plugs and Sockets, it is not mandatory to change it immediately , but if there is a need arises to change or replace an existing plug point PUCSL recommends the public to purchase only a square socket plug which is been tagged as "6A Max".
