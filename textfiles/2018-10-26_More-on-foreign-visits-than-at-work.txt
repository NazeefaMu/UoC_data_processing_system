More on foreign visits than at work!


	



 

These top two at a place where politicos regularly meet are racing each other in making foreign trips one after another, they say.

 


Whenever high political authorities make official visits abroad, these two high-ups too would invariably accompany them taking turns. Meanwhile, they would on their own go on foreign trips at regular intervals on some pretext or other.


All these trips are being made at public expense, they say.


The employees of the place would often remark: “Our two lokkas are more on visits abroad than at work here!”
