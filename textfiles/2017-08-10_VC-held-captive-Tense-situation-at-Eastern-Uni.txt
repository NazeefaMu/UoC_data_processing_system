Prof. Jayasingam said the police was informed about the incident and arrived on the scene but they had failed to bring the situation under control and release him and his staff. The rest of the staff had been allowed to leave the premises later on leaving behind, he said.

Meanwhile, Eravur Police said a situation had been reported about some 200 Second Year students who had entered the administrative building by force in protest as they have not been allowed to sit for their examinations by the university administration.
