Politicking begins!


	



 

Ten provincial level Green stalwarts from several parts of the country have planned to submit a collective appeal to the Green leader to provide them with adequate funds to provide urgent relief measures to the people in their respective areas in view of the upcoming polls. 

 


They are going to explain to the party leader that there are sections at the grass roots level who remain faithful to the party despite difficulties they are undergoing and it is their duty to look after their needs in their hour of need. 


Signatories to this letter of appeal are provincial politicos from Pulatisipura, Sabaragamuwa, West and the South.  Some of them are chief Ministerial hopefuls, they say.
