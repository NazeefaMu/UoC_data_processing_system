Wildlife officers have arrested six treasure hunters who were excavating the area close to the Sigiriya Rock Fortress in search of King Kashyappa's golden sword said to be buried inside the forest reserve.
The officers had taken into custody crow bars, Mamoties and other equipment used by the suspects for digging.
The wildlife range officers raided the area on being tipped off that some treasure hunters were digging inside the Sigiriya forest reserve at Alankalawewa in search of buried treasure belonging to King Kashyapa including a golden sword. The suspects are believed to be residents of Alankalawewa and had been deployed as workmen by a businessman whose identity was still to be established.
Sigiriya Assistant Range Officer W.M.K. Wasala, Guards R.P. Sarathchandra, P.M.P. Hewavitharana and assistants L.A.S. Liyanage, and H.M.D.P. Herath conducted the raid. ( K. K. Ariyadasa)
