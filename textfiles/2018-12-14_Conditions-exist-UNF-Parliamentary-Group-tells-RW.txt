The United National Front (UNF) Parliamentary Group had informed party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs could be accommodated in a future government only after certain conditions were met.

They made these comments following the group meeting which was held at Temple Trees last evening.

It was therefore reported that SLFP group of MPs who did not obtain membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had offered to work with the UNP in the event it wanted to form a government.

A decision was also taken by the group to hold a rally on December 17. (Yohan Perera)
