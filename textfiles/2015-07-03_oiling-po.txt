MR is like a crab in a boiling pot: UNP


	

Speaking on the decision of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to re-enter into politics, UNP Spokesman Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said Mr. Rajapaksa behaves like a crab dancing in a boiling pot of water.
He said therefore, Mr. Rajapaksa is allowed to do anything he wants until the election on August 17 in which he would be defeated again by the people.
“People will show a lesson to politicians who hoodwinked them,” Minister Kariyawasam said.
He said the UNP was not concerned or worried about giving nominations to former President to contest from the UPFA.
“Mr. Rajapaksa distributed so many things as incentives to the people during the previous presidential election campaign but still people rejected him. We, on the other hand won the election by 400,000 more votes without distributing goods among people,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
