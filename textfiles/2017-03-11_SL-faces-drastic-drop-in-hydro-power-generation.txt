SL faces drastic drop in hydro-power generation


	

Hydropower generation has dropped to less than 10 percent of the total energy requirement of the country because of the prevailing dry spell, Power and Energy Ministry Spokesman Sulakshana Jayawardane said.

He said 2016 Sri Lanka had the lowest recorded rainfall in ten years and this compelled the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to depend less on hydro power and instead focus on thermal and coal power generation so as to maintain an uninterrupted power supply.

“Under normal circumstances, hydropower makes up for 40 to 50 per cent of the total energy requirement. However, it has now dropped to 10 per cent,” Mr. Jayawardane said. (Kelum Bandara)
