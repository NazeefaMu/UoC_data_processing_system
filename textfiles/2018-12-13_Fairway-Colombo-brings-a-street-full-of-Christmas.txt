Transforming the iconic Dutch Hospital precinct with a variety of innovative and diverse events, Fairway Colombo has established itself as one of the most popular hotspots of Colombo. 

Fairway Colombo began the season’s festivities on the 11th of December with Street Latin Night, which pays tribute to rejuvenating street dances such as Salsa, Bachata and Afro. Every second and fourth Tuesday, Hospital Street is converted into a fiesta as both first timers and experienced dancers come together under the guidance of expert instructors to celebrate their passion and love of dancing.
Celebrating the Christmas cheer, Hospital Street will see a new addition to the regular event line up in the form of the Fairway Colombo Christmas Market. Hosted in association with the Good Market, this is the perfect place to buydelicious Christmas goodies and share the joys of the season. Kicking off on the 19thof December from 3 p.m. onwards, the Christmas Market will light up the street with the award winning group Voice.Printtaking the stage on the 20th and the critically acclaimed all female choral group, Soul Sounds spreading the spirit of the season on the 21st.

The Fairway Christmas Market will be accompanied by other events hosted by the global award winning hotel, which has created a space in the city that celebrates diversity and reflects a multitude of cultures. The Fairway Colombo Street Food Festival will take place during the last weekend of the month with over 40 vendors gathering in one street to offer the best and most scrumptious deals for food lovers. The atmosphere is kept alive with bands, DJs and exciting eating and drinking competitions.



The second weekend of the month is reserved for art and jazz lovers who can stroll through Hospital Street which is decorated with breathtaking canvasses of art by talented local artists and listen to the soulful renderings of jazz music in the late afternoon. 

On every second and fourth Wednesday, those patronizing Hospital Street will experience an explosion of musical talent, where it is common for young executives to loosen their ties, roll up their sleeves and take the mic. Fairway Jam on the Street allows everybody with a love for music to jam together with their friends. It has become a much loved platform for budding artists to showcase their talents as the space and equipment are provided free of charge, and all they have to do is register for the event. Surprise guest appearances by legendary and professional musicians at every event adds colour to the jamming sessions. 

With such an attractive array of events organisedby Fairway Colombo with Maharaja Broadcasting Corporation as its media partner, Hospital Street at Dutch Hospital will be pulsating throughout the season as the place to celebrate the best time of all.
