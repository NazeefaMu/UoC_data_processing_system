At least 41 people were killed on Sunday in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi after dust storms and thunderstorms wreaked havoc in multiple parts across India, the Indian Express reported today.

High-velocity winds coupled with rain and lightning uprooted trees and disrupted rail and flight services and brought traffic to a standstill.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the rain accompanied by strong winds will continue for the next 72 hours across the country, though the intensity might not be as strong.

“There is a circulation of a western disturbance in northwest India. We had forecast that the weather will be adverse for two-three days. This thunderstorm will continue for the next 48-72 hours,” said Charan Singh, Scientist, IMD, on the weather change in Delhi.
