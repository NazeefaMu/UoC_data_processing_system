	The Opposition announced last week that a no-confidence motion will be submitted against Public Order, Disaster Management and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga over his failure to prevent attacks against Opposition supporters. The Opposition MPs stated that Minister Amaratunga's alleged involvement in the assault on the Wattala Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman is further proof of their allegations.
