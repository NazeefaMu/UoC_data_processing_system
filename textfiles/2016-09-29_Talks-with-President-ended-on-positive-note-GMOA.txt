The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said today that the discussions held with President Maithripala Sirisena with regard to their school admission issue ended on a positive note on Wednesday with the President assuring them that he would mediate to find a solution to the issue.

GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the President had assured them that he would arrange a meeting between Education Ministry officials and the GMOA next week to find a solution to the issue.

“The discussion between President and the GMOA was successful. The government has provided medical officers with pensions and schools for their children as an act of motivation for the duty they rendered throughout the country,” he said.

Dr. Ananda said the President admitted the fact that privileges given to doctors for school admissions was a policy decision and not a special privilege given to a particular sector.

He said they pointed out to the President that there were no equal opportunities in education whereas it was so in the health sector and added that the President promised to formulate a mechanism to enhance primary education in collaboration with the Presidential Secretariat, the GMOA and other relevant institutions.
