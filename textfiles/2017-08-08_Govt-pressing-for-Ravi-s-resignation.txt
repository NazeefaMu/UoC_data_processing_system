Govt. pressing for Ravi's resignation


	

In the face of a no-confidence motion against Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake, the government is reported to be urging him to step down rather than face defeat in a vote.

After the motion was handed over by the joint opposition, government members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) decided to vote in favour of the motion seeking to unseat the minister while a section of the United National Party (UNP) had also decided not to support him if it came to a vote.

Against this backdrop, government leaders believe that it would be humiliating to the entire government if the minister was unseated through a parliamentary process.

Informed sources said both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had asked the minister to resign.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has called for a party leaders’ meeting today to discuss future business of the House. JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said he would seek a date at today’s meeting to debate the no-confidence motion against Minister Karunanayake.

However, according to reports the government is determined to push the minister to resign without leaving room for a vote on the motion. (Kelum Bandara)
