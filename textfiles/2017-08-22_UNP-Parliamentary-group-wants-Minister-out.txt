According to informed sources the questions have been raised by several MPs including Ashu Marasinghe and Ajith P Perera who had spoken intensely against Minister Rajapakshe during the previous parliamentary group meeting and the UNP’s working committee meeting on Thursday.

It has been revealed by the committee appointed that Mr Rajapakshe had failed to give a statement to the committee appointed to look into his matter at the last working committee meeting. The committee members including Mangala Samaraweera, Malik Samarawickrama and Ravindra Samaraweera had informed the parliamentary group meeting last evening that Minister Rajapakshe had failed to make the statement as promised by him. He was given time till yesterday ( August 21) to make a statement before the committee regarding the Hambantota Port. (By Yohan Perera)
