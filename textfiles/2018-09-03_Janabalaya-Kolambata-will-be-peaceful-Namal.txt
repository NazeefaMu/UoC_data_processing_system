The 'Janabalaya Kolambata', protest march organized by the Joint Opposition (JO) scheduled to be held on Wednesday (5) in Colombo, would be carried out in a peaceful way, MP Namal Rajapaksa said today.

Addressing a news briefing, he said the protest march had been organized in a way that no harm would be caused neither by the general public nor to public property.

“The Government is spreading rumours that the JO protest would bring inconvenience and trouble to the general public. It is obvious that the Government is scared of this protest because they know that this protest march would become a challenge to the Government,” the MP said.

"That’s why they are in a move to sabotage this protest march,” the MP added.

He said the protest campaign mainly aimed at toppling the Government and pressing it to go for the General Election.

Meanwhile, MP Kanchana Wijesekera said that anybody could join hands with them irrespective of party affiliations.

“This is a protest for all those who are against this Government and aspiring to have a new Government. Hence, there is no restriction or barrier to joining in this protest,” MP Wijesekera said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
