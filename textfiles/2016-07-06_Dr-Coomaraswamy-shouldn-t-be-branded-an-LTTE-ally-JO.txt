A day after Pivithuru Hela Urumaya criticized the newly appointed Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, former MPs Tissa Vitharana and G.L.Peiris said he should not be branded as a person having links with the LTTE, just because he was employed by Raj Rajaratnam, who is alleged to have funded the LTTE.

They said this at the weekly media briefing of the joint opposition held in Borella today.

“We should not consider him as a person involved with the LTTE. It is true he worked for Raj Rajaratnam who founded the Galleon Group, an American-based investment fund management firm for some time. But, Dr. Coomaraswamy is not a bad person. He worked for Rajaratnam as a professional. On that basis, we cannot hit out at him,” Prof. Vitarana said.

"We hope he would pay his role as the Governor of Central Bank for the betterment of our country, while preventing bribery and corruption," he said.

Meanwhile, MP Ranjith Soysa said they were pleased to hear Dr. Coomaraswamy openly speaking about his connections with Rajaratnam during a recent news conference.

He said unlike some ministers of the current government, Dr. Coomaraswamy told revealed it to the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)
