The government should investigate whether there was a connection between the island-wide strike launched last week by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and some other professional groups, and the Avant Garde issue, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, yesterday.
He suggested that the government ascertain whether there was an attempt of embarrass Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne for commenting on the Avant Garde issue.
He made these remarks while speaking at an event in Battaramulla.
“We all know that Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne openly spoke about the Avant Garde issue. I suspect that all of a sudden, these strike actions were called with the purpose of demoralising him. It is possible,” he said.
According to the minister, there could be a connection between the GMOA and the Avant Garde company.
He alleged that billions of rupees earned by Avant Garde Maritime Security Pvt. Ltd (AGMSL) was utilised for campaigning activities for former president, and present Kurunegala MP, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
However, he said, after the AGMSL operations were taken over by the Sri Lanka Navy, the income was being used for country. (Piyumi Fonseka)
