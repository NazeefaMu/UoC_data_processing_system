While stating that the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) is against the proposal of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) to remove the executive presidency, General Secretary of the PHU Upul Wijesekara said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was behind the JVP’s proposal.

Addressing a news conference, he said premier Wickremesinghe anticipated centralizing executive powers unto his purview by making use of the abolishment of the executive presidency.

“It is obvious that the Prime Minister is acting according to the agendas of the foreign countries. Premier Wickremesinghe is now bit struggling to act upon the foreign countries as he lacks the executive powers. Once the executive presidency is removed PM would be eagerly waiting to run the country in accordance with the whims and fancies of the foreign countries,” Mr. Wijesekara said.

He said political experts should be consulted in this regard and should see whether it would be worthwhile to the country.

Meanwhile, deputy leader of the PHU Madumadawa Aravinda said there is a visible confrontation in the JVP due to what transpired after the No-Confidence brought against Premier Wickremesinghe.

“Although the JVP came to a unanimous decision that they would vote against the PM, some members were not that much in favour of the decision. Consequently, one group of the JVP is with K. D. Lal Kantha whereas another group is with the JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake,” Madumadawa said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
