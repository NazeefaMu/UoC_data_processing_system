DAILY MAIL, 07th APRIL, 2017- President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping opened their high-stakes summit at Trump’s Florida beach resort Thursday, with the urgent threat of North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and tensions over trade on the agenda.  


Xi’s visit was overshadowed, though, by a U.S. missile barrage on an air base in Syria in response to this week’s chemical weapons attack against civilians, which the U.S. blamed on President Bashar Assad. The U.S. announced the missile attack shortly after Xi and his wife left the Mar-a-Lago estate Thursday night.  


Trump appeared lighthearted earlier Thursday as he greeted Xi at Mar-A-Lago, gesturing and pointing to journalists as they tussled to get a shot of the two leaders together for the 
first time.  


Ahead of the dinner, Trump said he and Xi already had a long discussion and had “developed a friendship,” and then joked, “I have gotten nothing, 
absolutely nothing.”
