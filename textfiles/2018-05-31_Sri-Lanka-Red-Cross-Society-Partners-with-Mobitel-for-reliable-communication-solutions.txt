The National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel, exchanged a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) recently at Trace Expert City. As per the terms of the MoU, Mobitel will henceforth be the Communication Partner for the SLRCS. Having the SLRCS sign on for Mobitel’s communication expertise reflects the perception of reliability of the mobile service provider for critical services that the SLRCS provides to the people of Sri Lanka. In the current climate where flood and landslide warnings are being issued, having a reliable communication partner is crucial for a humanitarian body. This MoU marks yet another accomplishment for Mobitel.

As part of the MoU, Mobitel will provide the SLRCS with a mobile donation platform (subscription based/on demand) and assist SLRCS Disaster Response Teams to better serve disaster-affected areas. It will implement special communication programs and services in SLRCS housing and community building projects and extend latest technology assistance for SLRCS Disaster Management Operation rooms and command centers. SLRCS is engaged in critical functions and Mobitel’s expertise in latest technology is well positioned to cater to its mission critical requirements. As the National Mobile Service Provider, Mobitel’s technology provides the ideal bridge for the SLRCS to connect with disaster victims to provide relief and rescue in times of floods.

Commenting on the partnership, Nalin Perera - CEO, Mobitel, said, “Mobitel is proud to have been selected by the Sri Lanka Red Cross as their communications solution provider to offer the best in ICT products and services. Mobitel’s innovative and reliable services are truly enhancing communication, technology, health, and IT literacy opportunities for citizens throughout the nation. The SLRCS has been active in the recent flood disasters in Sri Lanka and is a highly reliable relief agency both locally and globally and it is a privilege for Mobitel to partner with such an organization.”

Jagath Abeysinghe – President, SLRCS added, “Sri Lanka Red Cross Society provides humanitarian support during times of natural disasters and conflicts, or even community emergencies, providing 

critical services to save lives and provide essentials for survival and dignity of people. In our mission, we need a reliable communications partner who can not only provide advanced solutions to streamline our disaster management and community housing projects, but also provide connectivity and enhance our operations. We found these qualities in Mobitel and look forward to enjoying Mobitel’s communications solutions in enhancing our critical operations. Sri Lanka has suffered a series of natural disasters in recent years during which our services are badly needed by the disaster affected people and we believe Mobitel will provide the necessary support to ensure we function at our optimal best.”
