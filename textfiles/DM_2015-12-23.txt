Abducted man tells his story
	
	Amila Priyanga Amarasinghe, the 34-year-old man who was allegedly abducted by several supporters of UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra, said today that he did not know why he was abducted.
	He denied having an affair with a woman as claimed.
	Commenting on Monday's incident, he said eight supporters of Hirunika Premachandra had entered the shop in Dematagoda where he worked and ordered him to come outside and talk with them.
	I told them to ask my boss for permission to take me out. They then scolded me and assaulted me. They dragged me out of the shop by my shirt collar while assaulting me, and put me into a black "Defender" vehicle which belonged to Ms. Premachandra, he said.
	He said the men had pushed his boss away when he asked them for their identity cards: They said they were from the police and did not need to reveal their identity.
	He said he asked them where they were taking him and they said, "to a police station". Then they took me to Ms. Premachandras office, he said.
	The place was crowded. The abductors had dragged him out and thrown him into the office as if they were going to kill him, he said.
	Ms. Premachandra had then entered the office and told him he had been abducted at the request request of one of her supporters.
	She said she was a lawyer and knew how to protect herself. She said she had the power to kidnap me any time she wanted to, he said.
	He said Ms. Premachandra received telephone call about fifteen minutes afterward.
	The caller told her that my boss had lodged a complaint with the Dematagoda Police. She then asked me to tell him that they hadnt hurt me and had brought me back safe and sound. She also asked me to get the complaint withdrawn, he said.
	The abductors said that I could come to them if my boss fired me. Then they sent me back to the shop in a three-wheeler," he said.
	He said that he had no connection with Hirunika Premachandra or her supporters. I cant even face the people now, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Black defenders in place of white vans: JVP
	
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today described, the use of a vehicle belonging to MP Hirunika Premachandra to abduct a youth, as a transition from the white van culture to a black defender vehicle culture.
JVP Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath told a media briefing that this kind of drama was totally unwarranted.
However, he said the issue was not with Ms.Premachandra but with the political culture introduced by the previous regime.
The political culture introduced by the previous regime is being followed by the present government as well" Mr. Herath said. (Yohan Perera)

'Mahinda Gang' caused budget defeat-Nishantha
	
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriyas kneeling before some provincial councillors belonging to the Mahinda Gang led to the defeat of the health budget of Western Province presented by the Jathika Hela Urumaya, said the Western Provincial Council's Minister of Health, Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe (of the JHU), yesterday.
The 2016 expenditure head for Western Province Health Ministry, submitted by Warnasinghe, was defeated by 45 votes to 23 last Tuesday.
Asserting that the blame for the first ever defeat of the budget of the Western Provincial Council should be borne by Chief Minister Devapriya, Mr. Warnasinghe said this would cripple the health services provided by the council next year, creating difficulties for the people.
He said this was an act of political revenge by his opponents who were supporters of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He added that he could face such a situation because he had never knelt before any politician even though he had received unfair requests and threats.
There was no just reason to vote against my budget as not a single allegation was made against my ministry during the three months I served, he said.
He said those who defeated the budget should have brought in a no-confidence motion against him if they disliked him without inconveniencing millions of people.
He said he would soon decide whether to resign his office or not. (Piyumi Fonseka)

A commission should look into Wilpattu:  Bathiudeen
	
	A commission should be appointed to look into the Wilpattu deforestation controversy, Minister of Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said today.
	While refuting allegations that he had illegally re-settled internally displaced Muslims in Wilpattu, Bathiudeen said if such illegal constructions had happened, it could be investigated through Commissions or the Police.
	The Presidential Commission, Bribery Commission, FCID, CID and the Police are functioning in the country to investigate illegal acts. Why none of them is investigating this allegation and come to a conclusion he said.
	If some is having evidence against me, they could lodge a complaint with any of above mentioned institutions, he said.
	He said that he had no connection in to the Wilpattu deforestation.
	All the allegations are baseless. I will quit from politics if the allegation that I re-settled internally displaced families in Wilpattu could be proved, Minister Bathiudeen said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Hirunika's staff members remanded
	
Five of Colombo District UNP Parliamentarian Hirunika Premanchandras staff members and another civilian were remanded till January 4 by Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage in order to produce the six of them for an identification parade allegedly for abducting a person of a Dematagoda drapery store on December 21.
Fort Magistrate Liyanage, who took the bench at the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday, remanded the suspects on considering the submissions of ASP Chandrathilaka.
The ASP told the Magistrate that on December 21Dematagoda Police had received a complaint that the employee of Lucky Star textiles at Dematagoda was abducted by some unidentified persons in the defender 62-1859.
He said while Dematagoda Police conducted investigations, the CCD took over it from the Dematagoda Police on the instructions of the IGP.
Consequently during their investigations they identified the Defender that belonged to Hirunika Premachandra.
The ASP said when they contacted Ms. Premachandra, she had told the CCD that she was unaware of such an incident.
However, later she had surrendered the Defender and the suspects to the CCD. She had said that she was attending a function to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of CMC at that particular time.
The ASP said they had recorded the statements of four eye witnesses and requested the Magistrate to remand the suspects as they had to hold an identification parade and consequently file charges against suspects for being members of an unlawful assembly to abducting , assaulting and for unlawful confinement of the victim, Amila Priyankara Amarasinghe, against his will.
Counsel Amila Indika appearing for the suspects told the Magistrate that the victim had abducted the wife of one of the suspects in the case and the suspect had asked the other suspects to settle the matter by getting his wife back to him. Thus the five staff members of Mrs. Premachandra had gone to the drapery store to settle the matter and they had abducted the victim.
Counsel Indika said he would object for holding the identification parade as the suspects were already uncovered to the public.
He emphasised that a rival TV Channel of Ms. Premachandra had repeatedly telecasted the video footage from the CCTV cameras to the public and had released posted it on Facebook page of the TV channel.
The Counsel said there was no privacy about the suspects and the Police cannot hold an identification parade according to the Criminal Procedure Code. (T. Farook Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)

Dilan lashes out at Kabir Hashim
	
	UPFA Minister Dilan Perera today lashed out at UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim for allegedly making statements belittling previous UPFA governments.
	Addressing a news conference, the minister said it was not appropriate to make such remarks against the UPFA while a national government was in place.Our country was engulfed in terrorism when the previous UPFA government came into power. There were even eelam courts and they even had their own police force. Its the UPFA government which defeated terrorism. Its true that we lost twice at elections because of our shortcomings. That doesnt give anyone the right to belittle each and every progressive measure we took, he said.
	He claimed Minister Hashim had remarked that Sri Lanka had been a lavatory of capitalist economic strategies during the reign of the previous UPFA government.
	It was the UNP that couldnt figure out what a lavatory was. The 2016 budget was on the verge of turning into a nice lavatory but we were able to prevent that as SLFPers who are now a part of the national government. Be it is capitalism or otherwise there should be the right for people to live and breathe in freedom, Minister Perera said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

LPBOA to stop beggars, peddlers in buses
	
	The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) said it was going to request Inspector General of Police (IGP) N.K. Illangakoon take action to bar beggars and peddlers in their buses.
	We are going to request the IGP to take action to prohibit begging and the selling of goods inside private buses from January following complaints from many passengers, LPBOA Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
	According to the Motor Traffic Act of 1951, begging, doing businesses and conducting any lectures inside the buses were prohibited, he said.
	He said that earlier the association had sent a letter to the former Secretary to the Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in 2013 requesting assistance to ban begging and selling goods inside buses.
	But without taking action on our complaint, he had registered them under the Divi Neguma Programme and let them do their own businesses.
	Then we also sent copies of the letter to the former DIG, Minister of Private Transport Services C.B. Ratnayake and Minister of Transport Kumara Welgama as well, Mr. Wijeratne said. 
	Though there are rules and regulations, the Police seem not to implement them properly. As a result of beggars and peddlers commuters face a number of inconveniences.
	We have received so many complaints from passengers and considering those, we decided to ban begging and doing such businesses inside buses, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

MR courting the Dragon
	
	Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to visit China during the middle of January, sources close to him said yesterday.
	This is his first visit to the country after the defeat at the January 8 presidential election. During his tenure, Sino-Lanka relations were elevated to the level of Strategic Partnership Cooperation and Chinese business ventures invested heavily in Sri Lanka's infrastructure projects.
	The then opposition accused him of being over reliant on China to the detriment of other countries.
	Chinese President Xi Jinping also visited Sri Lanka during the latter part of Mr. Rajapaksas tenure and attended the launch of the Colombo Port City project. The new government suspended the project for a review of agreements signed and asked for a fresh environmental impact assessment.
	However, the project has received the green light and it is likely to be resumed early next year. (Kelum Bandara)

Opposition calls for fresh budget proposals
	
	The joint opposition today requested the government to table fresh budget proposals in Parliament in January, to enact new amendments proposed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, so as to cover the budget expenditure and lessen its deficit.
	UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane stated that the amendments submitted by the Prime Minister immediately prior to the third reading of the budget on Saturday, had not been officially tabled in Parliament.
	Budget proposals of the first reading were passed in Parliament, but the amendments later mentioned by the Prime Minister were not even tabled or passed. These proposals are mere statements which hold no value or assurance. Thus, we request the government to submit new proposals to Parliament in order to enact them, he told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre.
	He further mentioned that Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had neglected President Maithripala Sirisena by proposing to move the bank accounts of state institutions at state banks to private banks. This is something the President had not agreed upon. People will lose faith in state banks because of this move, he added.
	Mr. Gunawardane pointed out that imprudent economic plans of the government would result in the collapse of the countrys economy in three months, without the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). (Lahiru Pothmulla)

	The Government of Saudi Arabia had decided not to carry out the death sentence on the Sri Lankan housemaid who was to be stoned to death for adultery, and to imprison her instead, said Acting Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva at a media briefing at the Foreign Affairs Ministry today.
	The appeal filed by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Foreign Employment Ministry for sympathetic consideration in respect of the accused was taken up yesterday by the Saudi Arabian Al Dawadmi court. We are pleased to announce that the efforts made by our government were a success. Instead of being stoned to death, she will be imprisoned for some years. The exact number of years has not yet been notified, he said.
	Speaking to the media, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said it was a national achievement that the life of the Sri Lankan woman was saved by the efforts of our government.
	This woman was the first Sri Lankan migrant worker who was sentenced to be to stoned to death. We are grateful to the Saudi Arabian government for listening to us. The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Azmi Thassim coordinated with us to provide legal counsel and consular assistance in order to assist in the appeal process, she said.
	She said that it took some time to clear the case since they had to respect the Saudi Arabian laws and judiciary. Most probably, the woman's term of imprisonment will be limited to three years, she said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Take action against Hirunika: Gammanpila
	
UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila said today that action should be taken against the young female Parliamentarian in connection with the abduction of a man in Dematagoda on Monday afternoon.
He said it appears she was above the law. Is this Yahapalanaya he asked.
Addressing a news conference at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre, Parliamentarian Gammanpila said the Defender vehicle, which had been used to abduct the youth, belonged to this MP and that it was her supporters who had abducted the youth.
The abducted youth had been kept in an office belonging to the young Parliamentarian. She had admitted to intervening into a family dispute and giving advice to the abducted. If this was any other person, legal action would have been taken already. But still no action had been taken against her, he said.
He said the UNP had charged the previous UPFA government of entertaining a white-van culture to abduct people and to carry out other illegal activities.
We only ended the white van culture which was introduced by the UNP. Today, they have launched a black Defender culture to replace white-van culture, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
