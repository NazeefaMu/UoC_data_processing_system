Though both the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) are urging the people to cast their vote for the ruling party, it is doubtful as to which party was ruling the country, National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) Chairman K.D. Lal Kantha said.

He told a public rally in Ginigathhena that the country had a unity government but neither President Maithripala Sirisena nor Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe were able to say that it belonged to any one of them.

“Members elected to Local Government bodies should be aware that they will directly receive the funds allocated for development work,” he added. (Ranjith Rajapakse)
