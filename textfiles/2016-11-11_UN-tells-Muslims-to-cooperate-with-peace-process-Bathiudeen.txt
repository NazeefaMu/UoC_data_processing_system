Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said yesterday the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Miroslav Jenca had requested the Sri Lankan Muslim community to work closely with the country’s peace process.

 “Mr. Jenca is aware about the plight of the Muslim Community, in particular about those who have been directly or indirectly affected by the conflict. During his recent visit to Sri Lanka, he met government officials, parliamentarians, religious leaders, youth and civil society groups to take stock of the peace process, including transitional justice and constitutional reform with a view to achieving reconciliation and sustainable peace for all Sri Lankans,” the minister said.

He said Mr. Jenca endorsed Sri Lanka’s peace building plan which has provided a framework on areas of transitional justice, accountability, reconciliation, good governance and resettlement.
