The new Big Boss and other Betel leaf party bigwigs at a special meeting held recently decided to take deterrent action against the dissidents breaching party discipline, they say.

 


At this meeting, the Big Boss had also explained the grave charges that each member of the former strongman’s family is facing and the legal action that could be taken against them.


The Big Boss next turned his attention to a young Diyawanna member of the party hailing from the central hills who was reportedly making statements in public prejudicial to the interests of the party. A decision to take disciplinary action against him too was taken at this special meeting, they say.
