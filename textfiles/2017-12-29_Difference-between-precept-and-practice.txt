This politico is known to be waxing eloquent about the need to protect the environment. However, he has been passively looking on when the wewa in a village is being polluted by the effluent from his close kinsman’s factory located on a village. 

 


The factory owner has not taken any action to properly dispose of the effluent and other waste matter from the factory and the water of the wewa used by about 200 families in the village for drinking and all other purposes gets highly polluted particularly during heavy showers, they say.
