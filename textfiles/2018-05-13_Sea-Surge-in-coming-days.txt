There is a possibility of surging of the sea along the coastal areas from Mannar to Batticaloa via Colombo and Galle, Department of Meteorology warned today.

The Department said sea surge risk will prevail until May 15, 2018 due to the effect of swell waves, having 2.0-2.5m height.

Meanwhile, a minor flood situation was reported from the Galle District in the Habaraduwa area where 30 houses were reported to be affected. Several houses were reported to be under water in Beruwala and Panadula as well.

Heavy showers were predicted in several areas including the Central, Southern, Uva Provinces and Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala Districts.

Rainfall of more than 60mm was reported from Kotmale and Galle Districts as of last afternoon. (Yohan Perera)
