The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) said today it was opposed to the 20th Amendment to the Constitution presented by the Janatha Vimuthi Peramuna (JVP) and pointed out that such a move would unstabilise the country and be a threat to democracy.

JHU General Secretary and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka told a news conference that they were opposed to Constitutional Amendments in a piecemeal manner.

“The Prime Minister is proposed to be the Head of State in the 20th Amendment proposed by the JVP. A similar provision was included in the 19th Amendment originally. But, the Supreme Court struck it off. The Supreme Court ruled it needed approval of people by referendum,” he said.

Mr. Ranawaka said the 20A had been proposed to abolish executive presidency without reforming the current electoral system and other related matters. Therefore, he said it would lead to instability in the country in politics, posing a threat to democracy.

He said they were ready to study and support if anyone introduced a new constitution along with a fresh electoral system enabling a stable Parliament to be formed. (Ajith Siriwardana)
