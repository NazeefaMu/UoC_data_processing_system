Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament yesterday that he did not have any knowledge about the existence of an organization by the name of the Task Force for National Reconciliation headed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.

The Prime Minister said this in response to a question asked by opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa leading to an exchange of words between them.

Mr. Weerawansa said that according to media reports such an organization was headed by Ms. Kumaratunga and that media coverage had been given to its activities. He asked whether those reports were false.

“I do not know about the existence of such an organization headed by the former President. If you like, you can just give her a call and check. You were old friends,”the Prime Minister said.

“I do not intend turning this into a comedy. Our friendship is old. But, there is newfound friendship with you and her. You two are new friends. It is easier for you to make inquiries," Mr. Weerawansa said.

" Yes I have known her from my childhood. In fact, we learnt dancing together at that time. Anyway, if she is involved in any reconciliation, isn’t it good? Are you not for reconciliation? Please tell us,” the Premier said and added that there were attempts to bring soldiers before war crime tribunals at that time. He said such war crime charges were averted after President Maithripala Sirisena took over.

“You were acting in that manner. We have saved them from such measures,” he said.

Mr. Weerawansa said no such attempts were made at that time, and it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who brought about reconciliation.

“It is under your so-called reconciliation that Tamil and Sinhala students clashed at the Jaffna University,” he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
