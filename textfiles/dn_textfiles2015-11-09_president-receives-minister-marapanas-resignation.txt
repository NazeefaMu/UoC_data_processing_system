President receives Minister Marapana's resignation

President Maithripala Sirisena this morning informed the Cabinet that he had received the resignation letter of  Law and Order and Prison Reforms Minister Tilak Marapana.
 
Parliamentarian Marapana came under fire last week after a comment he made regarding the Avant-Garde controversy in Parliament. The Minister stated that the police raid on the Avant-Garde floating armoury ship at the Galle Harbour was similar to the millennium city raid in 2002.
