The Colombo Chief Magistrate today rejected a request made by counsel, appearing for the National Blood Bank’s former director Dr. Mangalika Bindusara, calling for the cancellation of the arrest warrant issued on June 7.

The counsel told Court that Dr. Bindusara was undergoing medical treatment in Australia.

Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara directed the defendant to surrender after completing her treatment in Australia.

Dr. Bindusara has been charged with importing packs of expired blood plasma and using it on patients.
