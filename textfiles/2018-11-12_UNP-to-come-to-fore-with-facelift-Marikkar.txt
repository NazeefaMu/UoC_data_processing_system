United National Party (UNP) former MP S. M. Marikkar yesterday said his party should campaign for the General Elections with new out look.

Mr. Marikkar said this at a media briefing last morning.

“Political platform has to change. Therefore UNP should also have a new face especially in order to attract the young floating vote which is more than one million,” he said

“Many UNPers want Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa to take over in the even the current leader Ranil Wickremesinghe deciding to step down,” he added.

At the same time he said his party would first await the response from the Supreme Court on the dissolution, “ We hope that the Supreme Court will give a positive verdict as we believe that there is still rule of law in the country,” he said.

He also said President Sirisena had been pushed against the wall by some of his current political allies to obtain the membership of the SLPP. “ SLFPers joining the SLPP would create fresh problems for the President,” Mr.Marikkar said

Further he claimed that some of the SLFP ers had offered to join the UNP.(Yohan Perera)
