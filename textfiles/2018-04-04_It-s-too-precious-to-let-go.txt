It’s too precious to let go


	



 

The election to pick a new boss for the body looking after the country’s most popular game is due in May this year.

 


Meanwhile, Number One has decided to place a taboo on politicos seeking this much coveted post. He seems to have accepted the general opinion that the gentleman’s game is destined to suffer setbacks whenever it is under the thumb of a politico, they say. 


Meanwhile, an active politico, the incumbent who is said to be on numerous missions on behalf of Number One these days, had recently sought his (latter’s) permission to seek the post this time round too.


However, Number One’s response had been a firm “no”, they say.


The politico, highly enamoured with this prestigious post, is not prepared to give it up easily and is said to be looking for other means of retaining it come hell or high water or the next election.
