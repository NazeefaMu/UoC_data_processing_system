The Government Information Department yesterday said postal staff officers can obtain police security if its necessary to reopen post offices which had been closed due to the ongoing postal strike seeking solutions to the Public Administration Circular 06/2006 over recruitment.

Quoting the Post Master General Rohana Abeyratne, Government Information Department Director-General Sudarshana Gunawardana said postal staff officers were responsible to provide necessary facilities and security to open their relevant post offices.

Accordingly, IGP Pujith Jayasundara has also been instructed to provide necessary protection for post offices if requested by staff officers.

Around 653 island-wide post offices, 3, 410 sub-post offices and 100 control officers had been closed for seven days yesterday as a result of the trade union action commenced last Monday (11). (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
