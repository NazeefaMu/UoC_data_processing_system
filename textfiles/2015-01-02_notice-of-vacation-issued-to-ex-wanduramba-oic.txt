The vacation-of-service notice which was issued by the Police Superintendent’s office in Galle to former Wanduramba Police OIC Inspector P.L. Keerthisinghe has been delivered to his house in Dadella, Police said.
Galle ASP L.R. Kumarasiri said the notice was issued because the relevant authorities had not accepted the former Police OIC’s resignation and had not reported for duty December 22, 2014 without obtaining approved leave for his absence.
He said this notice was issued in terms of Section 172 of the Public Service Commission Regulations as having vacated his post.
The former Inspector handed over his letter of resignation on December 22 after three suspects who were in Police custody were forcibly taken away by Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama. He said he was unable to perform his duties because of pressure from politicians and higher ups in the police service. (D.G. Sugathapala and Sumathipala Deeyagahage)
