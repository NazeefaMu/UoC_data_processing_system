The price of lunch packets will be increased in the wake of the price of a domestic LP gas cylinder going up by Rs.110, All Island Canteen Owners Association Chairman Asela Sampath said today.

He told Daily Mirror the price of lunch packets should be increased and lunch packets should be gazetted as an essential food item.

“Lunch packets should be named an essential food item by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) and should have a controlled price. That control price should be revised according to the price of related items,” Mr. Sampath said.

He said a lunch packet should have a minimum standard and it should include three vegetables, a piece of fish and greens.

“We will have a meeting and make an announcement on the price increase of several food items and beverages,” Mr. Sampath said and added that the price of a gas cylinder was increased at a time that the prices of other goods were also increasing. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
