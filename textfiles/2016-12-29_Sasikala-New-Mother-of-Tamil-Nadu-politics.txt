Sasikala Natarajan has been elected as the general secretary of India's regional AIADMK party, replacing Jayalalitha Jayaram, who died this month after a prolonged illness. BBC Tamil's Thirumalai Manivannan profiles Sasikala's political journey in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the BBC News reported today.

From a homemaker to becoming a trusted friend of the most powerful woman in Tamil Nadu politics, it has been a long and dramatic journey for Sasikala.

For close to three decades, Sasikala, known as "Chinnamma" (younger mother) to her supporters, has been an almost permanent fixture in Jayalalitha's life, often seen with the former chief minister on public platforms.
