Ronda Rousey breaks silence after loss to Holly Holm ‘I’ll be back’

After Holly Holm defeated Ronda Rousey at UFC 193, everyone had something to say about it.
Even Donald Trump gave his opinion on the outcome of the fight. But one person who has been quiet throughout since the fight is Rousey herself. On Sunday night, she posted rather cut-and-dry update on Instagram. It said:
“I just want to thank everyone for the love and support. I appreciate the concerns about my health, but I’m fine.
As I mentioned before, I’m going to take a little bit of time, but I’ll be back”.
It’s safe to say that Rousey will be keeping a low profile until her next fight is announced or when she begins filming the Road House remake, which she is starring in.
