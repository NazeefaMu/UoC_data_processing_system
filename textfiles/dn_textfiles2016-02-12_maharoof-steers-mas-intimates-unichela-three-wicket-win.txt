A sterling all round performance by Farveez Maharoof gave MAS Intimates Unichela a heart stopping three wicket win, with two deliveries to spare over Sampath Bank, in the 23rd Singer-MCA Premier League T+20, Tier "A" Final at the MCA Grounds recently.
Unichela skipper, Mahela Udawatte, judiciously used Farveez Maharoof in three spells where he bagged the vital wickets of Hasantha Fernando, Rumesh Buddhika and top scorer, Sameen Kandanarachchi, to finish with 3 for 23 in four overs.

Kandanarachchi was associated in two fruitful partnerships - an opening stand of 48 runs in 20 balls with Primosh Perera (22), and a fourth wicket stand of 70 runs in 40 balls with skipper, Jeevan Mendis (30).
Thilina Kandamby, playing his last game for the Bankers, remained unbeaten on 42 in 25 balls, hitting three sixes and equal number of fours as he put the finishing touches to the Sampath Bank innings with an unbroken stand of 65 runs in 39 balls with Dilhara Lokuhettige (21 not out).
Unichela chasing 197 run to win in 20 overs (RPO 9.85), lost their skipper,Mahela Udawatte and Sanka Ramesh early.
Farveez Maharoof (77 in 35 balls with eight sixes and four fours) joined the remaining opener Nadeera Nawala (61 in 46 balls inclusive of a six and six fours) and took the game to another level as they put on 112 runs in 65 balls for the 3rd wicket.
The exit of Maharoof at 157 in the 16th over gave the bankers some fresh air.
The spectators got to the edge of their seats as Unichela needing 40 runs in 27 balls,lost two quick wickets, that of Thilaksha Malshan and Nadeera Nawala.
The game turned towards Unichela when Charitha Buddhika gave away 14 runs including two wides in the 18th overs.
Rumesh Buddhika turned the tables for the bankers, as he bagged two wicket for four runs in the penultimate over, leaving Unichela to get 10 runsin the final over, bowled by experienced, Hasantha Fernando, with Lassana Perera and Anuk Fernando at the wickets.
Fernando took a single in the first ball and gave it over to Lassana Perera to finish the game with three successive boundaries, as Unichela took charge of the brand new Singer Challenge trophy, winning by three wickets, in the four ball, thus retaining the title for the 2nd successive year.
