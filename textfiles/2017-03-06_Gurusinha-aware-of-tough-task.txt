Gurusinha aware of tough task


	

Asanka Gurusinha in his first interaction with the media since assuming duties as the manager  of the national cricket team yesterday said that he is ready to take up the challenge in taking Sri Lanka cricket to the next level.

“It’s a big challenge and I know,” he said. “But with a structure in place and the support from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), I believe we can achieve the objectives Sri Lanka Cricket have got right now. The World Cup in 2019 is our main target. I am glad to get the opportunity to work with some of the finest players. We will try and see whether we can improve a few things.


Gurusinha had not held any official positions with SLC since leaving to Australia soon after Sri Lanka’s World Cup victory in 1996 but revealed there were several approaches in the past.

“ Even the two gentlemen sitting either side of me (pointing to SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala (right) and Aravinda de Silva--the head of Cricket Committee (left) asked me to come back, so as several others after that. But I thought this is the right time,” Gurusinha said at a press conference in Colombo.

“I am very excited to accept this role. Aravinda is my close friend and we have known each other from our school days. He was my captain when we represented Sri Lanka at the Under-19 level. Glad to join the board (SLC) and work alongside him. There are some amazing people working to improve our cricket like Aravinda and Sanath who is the Chairman of Selectors. Sanath changed the way cricket is played. He was a young player when I was reaching the twilight of my career and I am amazed at how far he has come,” he added.

Gurusinha, a steady number three batsman was roped in as part of SLC’s restructuring process and will coordinate all cricket related matters.  “We are in the process of restructuring our cricket and the arrival of Asanka Gurusinha is part of that. We are keen to get our best brains to help develop our cricket. Asanka’s role will be one where he will co-ordinate with selectors, the team, High Performance Manager and the board (SLC),” said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.

Gurusinha is the latest of the World Cup winning cricketers to join ranks with the current cricket administrators, following Aravinda, Sanath, Chaminda Vaas, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Hashan Thilakeratne and Upul Chandana who worked in different capacities and Sumathipala said the doors are even open for Arjuna Ranatunga to join hands with the board to work for the good of the game.

Aravinda de Silva, the head of cricket committee has apparently masterminded Gurusinha’s appointment as he believes Gurusinha could toughen up the mental strengths of the players.

“I have worked with most of the players who are the in the senior team at the moment when they were at under-19 level. What I sensed those days was that they weren’t mentally tough. The guys who are doing well now are the ones who are mentally stronger. The others will fade away. The sport needs guys who are mentally strong and I can’t think of anyone else than Asanka to toughen them up. He was mentally the toughest guy I played with,” De Silva said.

“He has played some extraordinary innings on some difficult wickets. The hundred he scored at the MCG in a Test match in 1995 is one of the finest I have seen. It was on a green top and I was struggling. Asanka went ahead of me and made it look all too easy. Tactically he is one of our finest brains. He is a perfect team man as well,” de Silva added.

Gurusinha’s contracts runs until the 2019 World Cup.

Soon after the media briefing Gurusinhe left straight to Galle with Jayasuriya to join the Sri Lanka team, training ahead of the opening Test against Bangladesh on Tuesday.(Champika Fernando)
