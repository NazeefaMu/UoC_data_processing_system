To my dear friend Niranjan


	

When shall we meet again? I wonder!  
You left us without a warning, when our hearts were so unprepared to let you go!   
I battled with the news that brought so much heart ache and grief to me at your sudden and untimely demise.   
That earth shattering news, left me feeling scarred beyond repair, and I, catapulted into an abysmal pit of despair and desolation.   
But my friend, now that you’re gone, I will need to gather my strength, to walk this journey on this earth without you, until I come to meet you again.   
You are up there, and I am down here, further away from you and reminiscing and reliving the moments we spent together is the only solace I’m left with.  
All those years of memories we built, were shattered with no recuse, with just one phone call to say my dear and near friend was no more. If I knew you were in a hurry, Oh! How much more I would have shared with you?  
A friendship that started decades ago, where we built a tapestry of memories that wove into each other with no demarcation and judgment.  
Your heart was kind and devoid of malice, ever pleasing to all who met you, with your sly smile and sometimes corny jokes that always left a mark in our hearts.   
We all have a story to tell, of times gone past, with your big, big heart, ever willing to shoulder a pain of another.   
Your smile lit up a dark moment, and a kind face that touched many souls.  
Words do not suffice to say how much you will be missed, my convivial Nagi!
