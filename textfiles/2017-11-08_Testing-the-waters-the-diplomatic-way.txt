Testing the waters, the diplomatic way


	



A Colombo-based envoy from a powerful neighbouring country paid an informal visit to the Hambantota area the other day, they say.


The main purpose of his quiet visit was to find out all the whys and wherefores relating to the massive protest staged against that country in the area recently.


During this visit the envoy reportedly spoke to many people from all walks of life to learn at first hand their views and sentiments about his country’s involvement in several key projects in the district. He had taken advantage of these meetings with the ordinary people to gauge their opinion about the political situation in the country as well. 


Once back in Colombo, during a conversation with a group of friends the envoy had reportedly made a significant prediction about a possible political scenario in the country. Some yahapalanaya stalwarts who heard about this prediction did not find it to their liking, they say.
