Is there a natural way to stop a migraine?

Try this natural remedy for migraine: submerge your feet and hands in very warm water and place an ice pack at the base of your skull. The heat in your extremities will pull some of the blood from your head, relieving your headache.

 

What’s the least amount of exercise I can do to derive benefits?

Your heart can benefit from just one hour of exercise a week, and this hour can be broken into segments: 20 minutes over 3 days, or 10 minutes over 6 days - as long as you get your hour in each week. Any aerobic activity will work.
