RT.COM/15 Dec, 2016-  
Russia’s president is visiting Japan to discuss signing a peace treaty and expanding economic cooperation. However, a decades-old territorial dispute and Japan’s support for the Obama administration’s anti-Russian sanctions may stand in the way.  


Vladimir Putin has arrived in Japan on Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two are to hold a series of talks at a mountainside inn at a hot springs resort called Nagato in Abe’s home constituency in southwest Japan. The Russian delegation and their Japanese hosts will move to the capital, Tokyo, on Friday.  


Abe welcomed Putin, noting that he had last visited Japan over a decade ago.  
“I am glad to have this opportunity to welcome you in my home city, Nagato.
