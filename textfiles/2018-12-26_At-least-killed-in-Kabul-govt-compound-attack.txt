KABUL AFP Dec 25, 2018 - An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul Government compound killed at least 43 people, the Health Ministry said Tuesday, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year.   


No militant group has claimed responsibility for the raid, which caps a bloody year for Afghanistan as long-suffering civilians and security forces are slaughtered in record numbers.   Another 10 people were wounded in Monday’s massacre on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and an office that handles pensions and benefits for war veterans are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said.   


Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the entrance, sending terrified government workers running for their lives. Some jumped from windows several floors high to escape the militants.   Hundreds more were trapped inside buildings for hours as heavily armed security forces swarmed the area.
