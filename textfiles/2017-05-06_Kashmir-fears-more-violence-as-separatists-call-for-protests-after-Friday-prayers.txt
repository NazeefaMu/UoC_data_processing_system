HINDUSTAN TIMES, 05th MAY, 2017- Kashmir braced for more clashes on Friday morning as the Valley’s joint separatist leadership called for after-prayer protests, a day after a civilian driver was killed and three soldiers injured in an ambush in Shopian district.


“Strongly condemning the excessive force and crackdown against civilian population in south Kashmir’s Shopian district, Joint resistance leaders, Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Mohammad Yasin Malik urged people to protest against state terrorism after Friday congregational prayers on May 5,” a press statement said. Kashmir has seen a spate of bank lootings, militant attacks and mounting civilian-police clashes over the past few months following viral videos of alleged human rights violations and roughing up of paramilitary personnel.
