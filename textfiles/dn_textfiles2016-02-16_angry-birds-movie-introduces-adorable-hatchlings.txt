'The Angry Birds Movie' introduces the adorable Hatchlings

 
An animated movie these days just isn't complete without some cute baby characters, and 'The Angry Birds Movie' is no exception. Rovio and Sony Pictures have debuted our first look at the the adorable Hatchlings as they (attempt to) sing "Deck the Halls". t
The main trio of Angry Birds will be led by Jason Sudeikis as Red, a bird with a temper, with Josh Gad as the speedy Chuck, and Danny McBride voicing the volatile Bomb.
Supporting them are Bill Hader as a pig, Maya Rudolph as Matilda, and Peter Dinklage as the Mighty Eagle. Also lending their voices to the video game adaptation are Keegan-Michael Key, Kate McKinnon, Tony Hale, Ike Barinholtz, Hannibal Buress, Cristela Alonzo, Jillian Bell, Danielle Brooks, singer Romeo Santos and YouTube stars Smosh.
"The question Rovio gets more than anything is 'Why are these birds so angry?'," producer John Cohen (Despicable Me) said previously. "This is the origin story for how that conflict came to exist between birds and little green piggies." In its various formats, the 'Angry Birds' game has been downloaded over two billion times as of this year, with an animated series 'Angry Birds Toons' that has collectively tallied three-billion views on numerous platforms. Written by 'The Simpsons' alum Jon Vitti and directed by Fergal Reilly and Clay Kaytis, 'The Angry Birds Movie' is set to debut in the US on May 20, 2016.
