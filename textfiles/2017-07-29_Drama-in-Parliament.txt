Drama in Parliament


	

An anxious moment followed the adjournment of Parliament yesterday when the quorum bell started ringing.

Several MPs rushed to the chambers while the media rushed to the press galleries at that moment.

It was found out that the bell was rung by an MP.

Few MPs then engaged in what it seemed like a drama. MP Ranjith Soysa then nominated MP Priyankara Jayawardene as the speaker. The drama continued for a few minutes. MPs were seen leaving the chambers. Some MPs inside seemed serious about the drama while others took it as a joke. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
