An advice from a friend on how to win the election!


	


A Yahapalanya Ministerial one the other day visited a former political colleague and classmate rolled into one at a private hospital in the city. 
The one hospitalised was not really sick; he only preferred the comforts of a private hospital to those of a remand jail.
They were enjoying a long chat and eventually they drifted into a topic they were both interested in -- the current political situation in the country.
“What is the political party from which you propose to contest the next election?” the friend asked the Ministerial one.
“I will contest under the Betel leaf symbol.”
“You are keen on winning. Aren’t you?” the friend inquired again. “Certainly,” the Ministerial colleague replied.
“Then may I give some good advice as a good friend?”
“Of course, you may!” replied the Ministerial one. 
“If you follow my advice, you will have a good chance of winning the election,” said the friend on the hospital bed. “Stop berating my elder brother and my family members because if you attack them, you will lose the votes of all SLFPers!”
