Conflicts from disputes and terror infiltrate media coverage daily, which is increasingly throwing back the question of peace. Citizens both locally and internationally are constantly subjected to a plethora of ‘bad’ news, arising from religious intolerance to power struggles to inhumane acts against humans and animals alike. Naturally this would lead to the question of whether there is no positive news to put a smile on our faces. This has prompted the Daily Mirror to be on the lookout for more positive news stories that would bring about a smile on the faces of its readers; and so we will be bringing you a weekly page of news to bring a silver lining to the otherwise gloomy news cycle. 

It is our belief that a good deed brightens a dark world.


We are on the lookout for positive and happy news from all parts of our beautiful island.  Share with us the happy and heart-warming stories that you encounter in your everyday life. If something makes you smile, chances are it will make most of the Daily Mirror readers smile and bring a pleasant change from all the negativity going on around us. 


Share a good deed that you have done for someone else or your community.  Not only will it put a smile on someone’s face but set a good example to others, the concept of “pay it forward” has never been so important.
