Adorable images show a baby elephant throwing a tantrum like a stroppy child in South Africa as its mother looks unperturbed and continues walking along the road.

The troublesome tyke threw himself to the ground with his legs flailing in the air hoping to get his mother's attention. But a few moments later the female leaves her young behind and carries on moving. (Daily Mail)
