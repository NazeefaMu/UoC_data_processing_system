The Meteorology Department is handicapped without the latest digital technology for weather forecast resulting in the inability to mitigate disasters such as the one currently being faced by the country.

This transpired at a news conference held in the parliamentary complex with the participation of Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and key officials of the Met. Department.

He said the heavy rains were forecast as early as May 10. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
