The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today remained skeptical about the latest stand taken by the government regarding South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) also known as the Malabe private medical college.

The government announced that it had decided to abolish the SAITM and convert it into a not for profit institution coming under the University Grants Commission (UGC).

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told Daily Mirror his association welcomed the decision to abolish the SAITM . However, he added that the GMOA need further clarification on the proposed step to make it a not for profit institute.

“The government’s decision to abolish the SAITM can be regarded as a positive step in the battle against SAITM by various parties and individuals. It is clear that the government has accepted our stance on the SAITM with this decision,” he said.

He said that it was doubtful what kind of authority would govern the SAITM with this new announcement. He added that it was also questionable as to what extent the required standards in medical education would be met. He said there was no clarity as to how clinical training would be provided to students through the institution that had been proposed.

He said that a reasonable solution should be found to facilitate the students who studied at the SAITM and those who passed out from it. 'We need further a space for discussion in regard to the next steps that need to be taken," he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
