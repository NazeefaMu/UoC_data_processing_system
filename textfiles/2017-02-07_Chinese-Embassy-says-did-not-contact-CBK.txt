After allegations by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga that the Chinese authorities gave President Mahinda Rajapaksa Rs.15 billion, the Chinese Embassy had reportedly told the Joint Opposition, that it did not meet with her for the last one-and –half-years, the Daily Mirror learns.

On behalf of the Joint Opposition led by Mr. Rajapaksa, former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris contacted the Embassy in this regard.

Prof. Peiris told the Daily Mirror that the embassy confirmed that it did not have any meeting with Ms. Kumaratunga for more than a year.

“For more than a year, the Embassy has not met her. This story is malicious falsehood,” he said.

He said that the Embassy communicated this to Mr. Rajapaksa’s Secretary Udith Lokubandara. (Kelum Bandara)
