A politico, a onetime purohita, now holding a very high office at the provincial level had reported to Police the theft of the money brought from the bank to pay the employees of the factory he owns.

 


Police making inquiries into the theft had questioned a female clerk of the factory office responsible for the cash safe. 


However, the provincial bigwig had taken exception to Police quizzing his female clerk in connection with the theft and berated them for unnecessarily frightening the ‘innocent girl’.
