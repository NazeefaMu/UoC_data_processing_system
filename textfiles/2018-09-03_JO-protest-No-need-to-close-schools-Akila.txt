There won’t be any need to close schools tomorrow on account of the JO protest march, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.

The ‘Janabalaya Kolambata’, anti-government protest campaign organized by the joint opposition is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Colombo.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, the minister said the Government has not taken any steps either to close schools in Colombo or send students home before 1.30 pm owing to this march.

“Why should we be worried about this protest? Let them conduct their protests. We are not keen to know what the JO is doing,” the Minister said. 

“We have deployed the Police to take necessary actions in the event any unlawful act that could take place during this protest,” the Minister added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
