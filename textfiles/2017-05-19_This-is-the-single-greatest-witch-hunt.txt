‘This is the single greatest witch hunt’


	

President Trump railed against his Justice Department’s decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign.   


‘With all the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!’ the president wrote first thing Thursday morning, misspelling ‘counsel.’   


Trump followed that up with: ‘This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!’   
Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who served a decade and was then reappointed by President Obama, will take over the executive branch investigation. The Justice Department announced that Mueller would serve as special counsel, and would have ‘all appropriate resources’ to carry out the probe – during a week when Donald Trump’s White House was battered by disclosures about his contacts with the Russians and his firing of former FBI Director James Comey.  The White House has spent weeks batting back efforts to install an independent outsider to lead the Russia probe, saying there are already sufficient probes. As Special Counsel, Mueller will have a wide berth to follow the investigation where he sees fit, and set his own terms for how much information he wants to reveal or withhold.   


It wasn’t immediately clear how or whether Trump’s contacts with Comey and reported efforts to either steer or inquire about the FBI’s Russia probes played a role in the decision.
