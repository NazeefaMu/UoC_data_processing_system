US embassy launches Interview Waiver Program


	

The US Embassy in Colombo today launched the Interview Waiver Program (IWP) for eligible visa applicants in Sri Lanka and Maldives.
 
The embassy said in a statement that the program allows eligible applicants to renew their visas without appearing for a personal interview.  IWP may be used only by applicants who have previously traveled to the United States and are renewing B1/B2 visitor visas issued after April 2008.  First-time applicants are not eligible.  The U.S. Embassy in Colombo will accept applications only from Sri Lankans and Maldivians resident in the Consular District.

“This new program will streamline visa processing while enhancing our customer service to Sri Lankan and Maldivian visa applicants,” U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap said. “The program is meant to help facilitate travel to the United States.”

All visa applicants will be automatically considered for the program after completing the DS160 online application form and paying the regular processing fees.  Previous travel history will determine eligibility for IWP.  The online program will prompt those not meeting program requirements to schedule a regular visa appointment.

Eligibility for IWP does not guarantee visa issuance.  Approved applications will be ready for pick-up within two weeks of document submission to the U.S. Embassy.  Applicants that have already scheduled appointments with the Embassy are not eligible for the program.  For more information on IWP or other visa issues, visit the Embassy website srilanka.usembassy.gov, it added.
