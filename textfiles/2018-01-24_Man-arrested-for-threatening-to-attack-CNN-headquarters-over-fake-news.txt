US authorities have arrested a man who allegedly made several calls to CNN’s Atlanta headquarters, threatening to shoot and kill employees over what he said was “fake news”, according to a federal affidavit.


The man, identified as 19-year-old Brandon Griesemer of Novi, Michigan, made 22 calls to CNN’s publicly listed telephone number on January 9 and 10, and four calls that were recorded contained death threats. Griesemer was charged in a district court on Friday with transmitting interstate communications with the intent to extort and threat to injure. He was released the same day on a $10,000 bond. If convicted, he could face a fine or up to five years in prison.
