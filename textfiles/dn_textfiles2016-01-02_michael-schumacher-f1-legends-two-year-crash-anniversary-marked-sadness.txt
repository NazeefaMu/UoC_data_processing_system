Michael Schumacher: F1 legend's two-year crash anniversary marked with sadness

JOHANNESBURG: Michael Schumacher's former team-mates have marked the two-year anniversary of the Formula One legend's skiing crash with sadness.
Former Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said that he was really close to the German driver's family, adding that he was expecting a miraculous recovery to happen for the F1 legend.
Montezemolo, under whose reign Schumacher won a record five consecutive world championships, hadn't visited his former colleague since the tragic incident, Sport24 reported.
Echoing similar views, son of great Enzo Ferrai, Piero Ferrari, said that he felt sad to see Schumacher in such a condition, insisting that he had never imagined that fate would have this in store for him.

Schumacher, who has record seven Formula One titles and 91 race wins, was injured while skiing during a French Alps vacation in 2013 and has been going through his painfully slow recovery at his Swiss lakeside home.-
