Because the government was keen to sell the Hambantota Harbour that it claimed it was a white elephant, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today.


He said people are aware as to how many ships arrive at the Hambantota Port.


“When the two ships seized by the port employees departed another two arrived,” Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said his government earned a sufficient income from the port during his tenure and that there was not plan to sell it to foreigners.


Mr. Rajapaksa said during his tenure 24 flights arrived weekly at the Mattala Airport but it was reduced to one by the present government and the warehouse given to Paddy Marketing Board to insult the then government.
