Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would not have any difficulty to get former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, who was alleged to have involved in MiG deal, to return to Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

“Hitler’s brother would not have any difficulty in bringing back Weeratunga to Sri Lanka as he is still associated with the latter,” PM Wickremesinghe told UNP Ministers at Temple Trees today.

He had referred to former President as Hitler’s brother. “The Sri Lankan Government had made arrangements to bring Mr Weeratunga back to the country with the help of the Interpol, even if former President did not ask him to come back to Sri Lanka,” Mr Wickremesinghe had said.

The Prime Minister had expressed these sentiments, while chatting with the Ministers after the official meeting.

The Ministers have brought the Prime Minister’s focus on the statement made by former President that Prime Minster should bring former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran back to the country.

The Prime Minister had told the Ministers that he couldn’t bring Mr Mahendran back as he had not associated with the latter, ever since he left the Governor Post of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

“I cannot bring Mr Mahendran back even if Mr. Rajapaksa could bring Mr Weeratunga back to the country. Mr Rajapaksa could bring Mr Weeratunga back to the country as he associated with the latter continuously,” the Prime Minister had said.

The Prime Minister had also told the Ministers that he was not prepared to associate with those against whom arrest warrants had been issued. (Yohan Perera)
