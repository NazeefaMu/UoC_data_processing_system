The story about a massive amount of money in US dollars being held in a super bank account opened in an Arab country in the name of a son of a former VVIP continues to reverberate in political circles and the public domain. 
The person who gave the tip off about this bank account to the authorities has reportedly affirmed in writing that this treasure is a gift offered to the VVIP’s son by a former head of an Arab nation.   
The Arab benefactor who once was looked on as the most powerful and charismatic head of state in the Arab world had handed over the monetary gift neatly packed in several bags, according to the informant. This Arab leader, in fact, came to a tragic end a few years ago.
