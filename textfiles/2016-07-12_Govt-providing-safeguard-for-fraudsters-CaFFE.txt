While remanding Namal Rajapaksa on allegations of misappropriating Rs. 70 million worth of funds belonging to a property developer, the Government on the other hand was providing necessary environment for the construction work to proceed, the Anti-Corruption Front said today.

Addressing a media briefing, the Spokesman for the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Keerthi Tennakoon said now it was clear that the Government was not doing what it preached.

“Until the Government changes its attitude on providing safeguard for fraudsters, it cannot stop spreading misinformation into society. Most of the corrupt transactions that happened in Sri Lanka, are still continuing, as they happened in the past,” he said.

“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had introduced a totally corrupt mechanism into the system and we have to live with it,” Co-Convener of the Left Centre Chameera Perera said at the media briefing.

“That is the way they are trying to dissolve the FCID by weakening it and that is how they are trying to protect corrupted officials,” he said.

“The fraudulent activities of the company had now been revealed to the country. Anyhow we have received details on continuing the construction proceedings through a UNP Cabinet Minister,” he said.

“This is not what we expected from a new Government. The members of the Government are trying to re-start the fraud and corrupt practices. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should respond to these allegations. The situation had come to a point where the Prime Minister has to resort to look inward and self-questioning,” he said.

“The Prime Minister should pay attention very much over the UNP Ministers, who are alleged to be involved in frauds and corruption in this Government.

“We urge the good governance Government to lead by example,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
