JVP Uva Provincial Councilor Samantha Vidyarathna had said he would lodge a complaint against Uva Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake with the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) over several fraudulent acts committed by him within the council.

Claiming that he had evidence in his possession to incriminate the chief minister, PC Vidyarathna alleged that the chief minister had misused funds belonging to the council last November.

He said the chief minister had attempted to ask for forgiveness for his misdeeds from the Gods by dashing coconuts etc.

Speaking about this attempt by the CM to absolve himself from blame for his illegal activities, PC member Vidyarathna said he was better off going to court and at least trying to prove his innocence to a judge.

“Two state banks have given more than Rs.5 million for a bag distribution ceremony to be held at the Council. We have got to know that the minister had not deposited them into the council’s bank account. There were also some other projects carried out by the council to collect money for the bag distribution event. However, the minister had said he used the whole amount of money for the event,” Vidyarathna said.

Coming up with more allegations, he alleged that the Chief Minister had arbitrarily withdrawn millions held in six fixed deposits belonging to the council from a state bank before the deposits had reached maturity.

The move has taken by the Chief Minister despite opposition shown by all the provincial councillors to the idea, he said.

He claimed the Chief Minister had withdrawn the money kept with the particular bank in retaliation for a decision made by the bank management not to give any money for the bag distribution event. (Piyumi Fonseka)
