A'pura MC approves resolution to sing national anthem in cinema halls


	

A resolution submitted by Anuradhapura Municipal Council's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna member Ranjith Rajakaruna that cinema hall owners should be instructed to play the national anthem at all cinema halls before the screening movies, was unanimously passed at the monthly council meeting yesterday.

It was decided to request the President and Cultural Affairs Minister to direct all the cinema hall owners to implement the resolution at all the cinema halls in the country.

The councillor said most Sri Lankans do not remember the national anthem and added that playing it several times at a cinema hall would help them remember it.

He said the Indian Supreme Court had also directed that their national anthem should be sung at the cinema halls there. (Dayarathne Ambogama)
