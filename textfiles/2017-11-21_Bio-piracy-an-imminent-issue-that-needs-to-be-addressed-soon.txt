Bio-piracy, an imminent issue that  needs to be addressed soon


	

Bio-piracy is a problem which we do address over the last two and half decades, but non of the former governments or the present government have taken suitable steps so far to get due revenue, proper mechanism for access and to conserve the genetic resources of Sri Lanka. Therefore it is high time to take appropriate action on this burning issue.   


Biological diversity or bio-diversity is a term use to describe the variety of life on Earth. It refers to the wide variety of eco systems and living organisms: animals, plants, their habitats and their genes. Bio-diversity can be divided into three categories as Eco system diversity, Species diversity and Genetic diversity. Eco system diversity refers to the variety of eco systems in a given place which includes landscapes, climate, soil, water, fire, rocks, wind, etc that functions together as one unit. The variation among species refers to the diversity that exists among species. Genetic diversity means the genetic variation among individuals of a population and that among all the different populations of the same species comprises the total genetic variation of those species.   

What is bio piracy?  


Bio Piracy means unauthorized access of biological materials and use in commercial purposes - Obtaining monopolistic rights by an individual or a company or an institution of one country on certain biological material, while that biological material is belonging to another country. This rights obtaining could be in the form of Intellectual property rights (IPR), obtaining Patent rights, plant breeders’ rights or sharing the benefits/profits.  


Being a “bio-diversity hotspot” a large number of Sri Lankan species have high potential ability in bio-piracy. A large number of our plant and animal species have been subjected to bio piracy. As a result the country is losing in the environmental, social and economical aspects.   


Our Association, Lanka Nature Conservationists (LNC) comprise of the founder and early members of the Young Zoologists Association (YZA) formed in 1972 by the then Director National Zoological Gardens, late Deshabandu Lyn de Alwis, an association functioning very effectively to date. We have again re-grouped after 45 years to contribute our knowledge and experience for the environment conservation of Sri Lanka.  


A seminar was organised by the Lanka Nature Conservationists recently to build-up awareness creation and active participation to fight against  Bio-Piracy, with relevant stakeholders.
