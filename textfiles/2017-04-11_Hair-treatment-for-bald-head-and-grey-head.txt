A purohita in yahapalanaya and a former purohita were guests of honour at the opening of a multi-purpose customer service centre in a distant village the other day. 

 


While going round the place after the opening they found themselves in a section where a wide range of Ayurvedic medicinal products were on display on racks and showcases. The purohita who suddenly reached out to a bottle of herbal oil told his colleague, who had a fast balding head: “Here’s the ideal thing for you to apply on the head to stop losing your hair!”


The other politico, not to be outdone quickly pulled a bottle from one of the racks and said: “This oil suits you best! This stops your hair turning white!”


The purohita replied: “I will buy this bottle on your advice. I can’t forget that you were once my boss!”
