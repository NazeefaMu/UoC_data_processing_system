Five suspects have been arrested by the police in connection with the theft of the Ranamayura’ Golden Peacock Award of the late filmmaker Dr Lester James Peries that was stolen from his residence.

The award was stolen on Wednesday morning while his funeral service was in progress.

However, it was found on an overhead rack of a Kollupitiya-Kaduwela private bus on Saturday.

Investigation revealed that the suspects had abandoned the award at the bus because of fear that they would be arrested as the incident was given publicity through the media. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
