Offer still hangs in the balance!


	



 

The former strongman has now got a peace envoy of the caliber of Erik Solheim, they say.
It was this young person who had played the role of JO envoy at the recent peace talks held between the two groups.

 


By the way, the young peace envoy of the JO had recently received a telephone call from a very high political authority in the country.


“Mantrituma, tell your father and your group to accept at least five Ministerial portfolios. Because then only we can form a new government. Remember, this is the last chance…”


The young peace envoy had replied that that there was no change so far in the stance taken by his group. Nevertheless, he would make it a point to promptly convey the message.


The message had been duly conveyed. But it is still under discussion, they say.
