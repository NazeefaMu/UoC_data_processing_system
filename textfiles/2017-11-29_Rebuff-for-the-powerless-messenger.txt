Rebuff for the powerless messenger


	



 

The former strongman received a call on his hot line the other day. It was from a leading businessman with close ties to a very powerful political family in the country. You may even describe him as one of the main dealers in the country’s staple food.

 


The call was meant to convey the urgent message that there was a move afoot to confine a member of the strongman’s family to the Welikada state-run lodge. 


He also revealed the actors behind this move as well. 


The former strongman replied: “Then why don’t you ask your man to call off the move?”


The businessman tried to explain why he could not intervene. But an exasperated former strongman cut off the line.
