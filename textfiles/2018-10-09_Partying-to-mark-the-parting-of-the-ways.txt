They have reportedly had their last supper in style.

 


This term-end dinner that has become an honoured traditional event had been held in an official residence located in the premises where once the palace of the country’s last king stood and it had cost each provincial purohita Rs. 10,000 and each member Rs. 3,000.


The council’s white-collar high-ups too had attended this dinner where liquor had flowed freely.


The partying had gone on till midnight, where everyone had bidden every other one goodbye while expressing the fervent wish to meet again under the same roof under similar circumstances.


Only one untoward incident had marred the happy event:  one provincial politico who had collared a council white-collar high-up inside a room in the official residence had reportedly abused him in filth for failing to carry out an order given by him.
