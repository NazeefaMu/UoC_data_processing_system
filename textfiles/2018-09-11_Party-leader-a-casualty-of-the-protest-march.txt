Party leader, a casualty of the protest march!


	

A certain political leader who joined the recent ‘Janabalaya Kolombata’ protest march at the Pettah Bogaha junction walked only a short distance when he became so exhausted, he collapsed into a sitting position on the road.

 


Panting heavily, the politico remained virtually lying on the road for about one hour, a few yards short of the Lake House roundabout where the protesters were to converge. He looked around for his security guards for support to get back on feet, but they had got lost in the milling crowd.


Meanwhile, some marchers were seen taking selfies with the helplessly lying politico. However, one of them had the presence of mind to fan him with a folded poster while another offered him water from the bottle he was carrying.


The politico had later risen to his feet with the support of a security guard who had turned up after some time and staggered his way to the Lake House roundabout with his help, they say.
