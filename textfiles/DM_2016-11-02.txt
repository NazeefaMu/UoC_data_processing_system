A good meal wins many a good friend
	
The king rooster desperately vying for a seat at the top table in yahapalanaya hosted two Betel leaf secretarial ones to a grand dinner at a high-end hotel the other day, they say.
Being bereft of long- used-to power and authority coming from high office, the king rooster had been an unhappy backbencher ever since the advent of yahapalanaya and he had been sending out feelers to the new Big Boss one after another for some time. And he had arranged this grand dinner to confirm his faith in the yahapalanaya leadership.
By the way, the king rooster had made it a point to get the nod for the planned dinner in advance from the former strongman, his political lodestar, who, he knew would sooner or later learn about it.
At this dinner, the king rooster had broken down in tears while confessing to the secretarial ones from Rajarata and Magamtota the rough and tough time he had to go through for 18 long months without political power and authority, they say.
The secretarial duo who took pity on the king rooster had consoled him saying that they would do their best to convince the Big Boss of the need to assign him a seat at the top table as early as possible.

'Aava', a Gota creation: Rajitha
	
Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne today said the underworld gang "Aava" active in the North was a creation of former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and certain top military officers.
He said though there may be some rationale to use them against the LTTE during the war, in the peace time they are only a bunch of criminals and thugs who should be apprehended at once and brought before the law.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing, Minister Senaratne said it was obvious that the same officials who fed and bred them were once again active and instructed the terror group to create troubles and disrupt peace in the North for their political advantage.
For a moment you can justify the action taken by former Defense Secretary and military officers to form this underworld group because the LTTE was also an illegal terror group. But why it is active in the peace time What they expect by creating a fear psychosis among the civilians in the North, he questioned and added all members of the Aava group were Tamils.
Minister Senaratne dismissed the suggestion that this underworld group was a creation of the Tamil Diaspora and said Aava was active in the North during the war and the armed forces were aware of that and added he could even reveal the name of the Brigadier who acted as the god father of the Ava group during the war.
The Defense Ministry has given clear instructions to the police and intelligence services to apprehend them as early as possible and take legal action against them, he said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

A group of white-collar high-ups attached to an office concerned with pharmaceuticals appeared before the COPE following summons served on them.
Asked to freely air their grievances, the ladies among the high-ups had broken down in tears.
Then the COPE members had urged the ladies in tears to come clean with their grievances. Thus encouraged, the ladies had come out with plethora of allegations against their chief. They also told the committee members that certain allegations that they had to make against their boss were so sordid and seedy, it went against their grain to divulge them.
They also named a certain political authority who is protecting their boss despite his misconduct and the gravity of offenses being committed by him.

This character who once ruled the roost in the power and energy sector had become a multi-billionaire within a matter of two years during the previous regime.
Some informed ones in the power and energy sector express their dismay and surprise that the loquacious advocates of yahapalanaya have turned a blind eye to the bigwigs like this one who had plundered the countrys wealth with impunity.

CSN challenges revocation of broadcasting licence
	
Court of Appeal yesterday issued Notices on the Mass Media Ministry secretary, Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatillake, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission and its director general, pursuant to a Writ petition filed by Carlton Sports Network (Private) Limited challenging the impugned decision to revoke its Television Broadcasting Licence.
The Bench, comprising Justices Vijith Malalgoda (President/CA) and S.Thurairajah, issued order to maintain status quo as of yesterday, in respect of the licences for four frequencies allocated to CSN by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission.
Court fixed the case to be supported for interim relief on November 16.
Presidents Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardane, making his submissions on behalf of CSN, alleged that the revocation of the broadcasting licence of CSN was akin to gagging the media.
He alleged that before the alleged revocation, there was no show cause notice issued, no allegations made, no inquiry or hearing and no charge sheet issued. The cancellation was mala fide and with intent to deceive and contrary to the principles of natural justice, he said.
CSN cited Parliamentary Reforms & Mass Media Ministry Secretary Nimal Bopage, Minister Gayantha Karunatillake, the TRC and its Director General Sunil S.Sirisena as Respondents.
Sanjeeva Jayawardane PC, with Kaushalya Molligoda, Lakmini Warusevitane and Charitha Rupasinghe, instructed by Nisanka Wijesinghe, appeared for CSN.
CSN states it is engaged in carrying on the business of operating a terrestrial television network and the production of television programme content for broadcast.
It claims it has not violated any of the terms and conditions contained in its licence. It maintains the revocation has been resorted to as a pre-emptive strike, without even affording it the basic right and concomitant safeguard of being issued some form of show cause notice or intimation of the allegations against it.
It contends that the right to be heard is indispensable, inalienable and indivisible and needs to be afeguarded.
It alleges the revocation by the Media Ministry Secretary is utterly and most grievously ultra vires and illegal, arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable and violative of the basic principles of natural justice.
It is seeking the Court to quash the decision by the Ministry Secretary and restrain the Secretary from interfering with the operation, functioning and broadcasts of its television channel. (S.S.Selvanayagam)

He said Minister Senaratne should focus on executing duties of his ministry instead of making malicious allegations.
He (the minister) has been given a ministerial portfolio and he should stick to its duties. He shouldnt come up with stories which are utter nonsense, Mr. Rajapaksa told the Daily Mirror.
In response to the ministers claim that Mr. Rajapaksa and those who are behind the Aava gang are spreading violence to destabilise the situation in the North even today, the former defence secretary said, If he thinks Im capable of such things, I will take it as a compliment.

If Chinese loans are expensive, why ask for another- Envoy
	
Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang , who responded yesterday to criticism that the Chinese loans were expensive, said yesterday that he had asked Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake why he talked about yet another loan from China if the loans were expensive.
At a media briefing of a select group of journalists, the Ambassador said his government had stipulated fixed lending rates for developing countries. Asserting that the concessionary loan rate was only two percent, he said Sri Lanka could borrow a significant amount from EXIM Bank of China based on the relations between the two countries.
Some ministers also criticised saying Chinese loans were expensive. We have regular or fixed interest rates for developing countries. It is two percent not only for Sri Lanka. It is five percent for commercial loans, he said.
He said, I spoke to Ravi, the Minister of Finance. Ravi has criticised this many times publicly. I asked him, "If you dont like this one, why do you, again, talk with me about another
Commenting on the Port City project, he said it was an investment of US $ 1.4 billion and very important for Sri Lanka.
Unfortunately, it was suspended for one and half years. But, through the efforts from both sides, importance was attached to this project. Despite the suspension, we have made no policy change towards Sri Lanka. China and Sri Lanka were, indeed, friends for 1600 years, not just from the last year. We request the company concerned to follow the instructions and decisions taken by the government of Sri Lanka, he said.
He said the company sustained a daily loss of US $ 1 million due to the suspension, and asked what would be the end result if a project of another country were suspended in that manner.
We have no hidden agenda here. We follow the law, he said.
He asked how Foreign Direct Investments(FDIs) could be attracted if projects were changed along with the change of governments. (Kelum Bandara)

Monetary Board verdict on bond scam soon
	
The Monetary Board is soon expected to come up with its verdict on the alleged treasury bond scam based on an on-site report prepared by the Central Bank officials, which is now being deliberated by the Monetary Board.
To this end the, Monetary Boardon Mondayfor the first time began to study the on-site examination report on Perpetual Treasuries Limited and it will meeton Fridayfor the second time for the week to further deliberate the report, said the Central Bank Governor, Indrajit Coomaraswamy. 
That report was presented to the Monetary Board yesterday and (we) had a discussion on that report.
It (report) has requested the various departments of the Central Bank to undertake more work in specific areas to enable the Monetary Board to take an informed decision (and) as to what the Monetary Board should do in relation to the finding of the on-site report.
The board will have another meetingon Fridayto discuss this further, Dr. Coomaraswamy told a press briefing yesterday. The Central Bank is expected to issue a statement once the Monetary Board decides on the future course of action related to the on-site report.
The countrys financial market was stunned by the findings of a leaked draft report on the activities of the primary dealer in questionPerpetual Treasuriesby the Central Bank, where it was stated that Perpetual Treasuries made a Rs.5 billion profit in just two months trading in government securities.
The Central Bank later acknowledged the ownership of the report.
Before that, the published accounts of Perpetual Treasuries showed the primary dealer raking in a profit of Rs.5.1 billion for the financial year 2015/16 against Rs.960 million in the previous year, much higher than the profits earned by a mid-sized commercial bank in the country.
Last week, the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) presented its findings on the alleged bond scam and said that former Central Bank Governor, Arjuna Mahendran, who is the father-in-law of the ultimate owner of Perpetual Treasuries, was directly responsible for the scam and recommended legal action against him.
According to Dr. Coomaraswamy, the Central Banks probe on the alleged bond scandal would continue independently, but they would study the COPE report as well as the initial findings made by the three-member committee appointed by the Prime Minister last year to look into the matter.
My understanding of the Monetary Board is that they want to follow the evidence as they come out in an objective way, he stressed.
When the Monetary Board meetson Fridayit will evaluate the powers vested with the Central Bank as to what actions could be taken by them on the findings of the on-site report.
Meanwhile, in another development, the Central Bank has also set up an enforcement division with the objective of bringing the wrongdoers to book more persistently. 
We want to aggressively prosecute the wrongdoing. Perhaps the Central Bank could have done a bit more on that front. So we really want to change the whole culture there, the Governor explained.
The newly setup enforcement division will also resolve some of the outstanding issues. 
We want to be more persistent and concerted in our efforts to prosecute wrongdoing, he added.

There would be no illegal construction of any buildings in the land near the Sri Pada Forest Reserve, Deputy Minister Parliament Reforms and Mass Media Karunarathna Paranawithana said today.
Addressing the media at the weekly cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department Mr. Paranawithana said a rumor was spreading that a request was made to construct a hotel in the Marewatte Estate in the Sri Pada Forest Reserve.
The holiday resort is situated in a private land in the Marewatte Estate. Several reports are being spread in the social media saying that the Sri Pada Forest Reserve would be taken over by Muslims by converting it into to a Mecca.
This is a direct insult to the Muslims and it is sad to hear such incidents. Muslim devotees in the Sri Pada area pay their respect to the Sri Pada. They always participate and support all the religious activities done in the Sri Pada. Most of the Hindu devotees as well provide facilities for the Sri Pada pilgrims, he said.
He said, however, a powerful minister from the former government tried to construct some kind of hotel and to build a helipad in the area near a waterfall.
There was no news in that time about it. But we stood against that. That minister is still in this government too and he has abandoned his idea. The recent owners of the holiday resort had requested permission to renovate it and the permission had been granted to them. But no environmental report had been received for the renovation and the Environmental Authority is conducting an investigation regarding the matter, he said.
This government would not allow the clearing of any forest area to build hotels and helipads in the Sri Pada Forest Reserve, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

We now have a stronger balance sheet...but income and profit levels are not yet acceptable, Winters said after the Asia-focused bank generated income of US $3.47 billion in July to September, down 6 percent from US $3.68 billion from a year ago.
Rivals more focused on the United States and Europe have reaped huge trading profits and although StanCharts third quarter underlying pretax profits were US $458 million compared with a US $139 million loss last year, this failed to offset investor disappointment with the fall in income. Standard Charted is delivering pretty close to zero growth. Not what investors expect when investing in emerging markets, Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. StanCharts shares were trading 5.6 percent lower at 1015 GMT, the worst performing stock in the benchmark FTSE 100 index , as the bank also confirmed Hong Kongs financial regulator planned to take action against it in relation to its role as a joint sponsor of an initial public offering in 2009. This comes days after Swiss bank UBS said Hong Kongs Securities and Futures Commission was investigating its role in certain unnamed stock market listings. Since joining the bank in June last year, former JPMorgan investment banker Winters has announced plans to axe more than 15,000 jobs, closed the banks stock trading business and raised US $5.1 billion in capital to restore profitability.
The efforts have paid off for StanCharts bottom line, and the third quarter result marks a second consecutive quarter of profit after it swung to an annual loss for 2015, when it was hit by the costs of revamping its management team and exiting out-of-favour markets.
But while it has successfully cut costs, the moves have also hit revenues, prompting the bank to defer its goal to reach a return on equity of 8 percent by 2018.
The lender scrapped its dividend and launched a $5 billion rights issue a year ago in order to bolster its common equity capital level, which stands at 13 percent.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford said the bank would assess whether to restore the dividend before the full-year results in February, but there were many uncertainties.
Halford also said he did not expect any large loan writebacks in India, following media reports that StanChart could release a US $100 million provision covering losses from loans to steel-to power conglomerate Essar Global.

Wrangle continues over new Constitution already in a tangle
	
The JO stalwarts who had been putting their thick heads together for some time had already assured the yahapalanaya leadership of a collective aye of their 51 members for the proposed new Constitution provided their proposals were accepted.
Meanwhile, some JO members had learnt that the government was planning to re-introduce the aborted Constitution 2000 after doing some patchwork. While conveying this information to the group leaders, these members had also pointed out that not only the proposed Constitution contains a number of Articles that the group could not subscribe to, but also the government had ignored the provisos that the group had stipulated.
Forewarned about the move to incorporate in the new Constitution certain provisions they are dead against, the JO stalwarts like the Boralugoda scion and the law professor are closely monitoring the new developments.
The JO group is likely to withdraw their support to the proposed new Constitution at the end of the day, informed sources say.

Yarning on the bond scam
	
A group of Diyawanna backbenchers from both sides of the divide including two or three from the North and the East were having a heart-to-heart chat in the House lobby the other day.
Their attention soon turned to the much talked about Central Bank bonds issue. When the discourse was taking a serious turn, a Betel leaf backbencher spoke up: Machang, this bonds business is not something that every Jack, Tom and harry can do Theres a special degree for this subject An economist from the JO camp immediately pooh-poohed his colleagues finding. Tosh! This is the first time I heard that there is a special degree for the subject of Treasury bonds!
The interlocutor was not prepared to take back what he said about the special degree. How many things are there that we know nothing about in this world, my friend he asked his challenger. I hear there is a university called Bond university in Australia and the master brain behind the bond scam here is said to be a graduate of that university
This statement made visibly in dead earnest drew guffaws from the other members.
Dont come out with whoppers, Machang! one of the members said.
I swear this is true, replied the member who made the humorous diversion. Make a search on the internet if you dont believe me!
