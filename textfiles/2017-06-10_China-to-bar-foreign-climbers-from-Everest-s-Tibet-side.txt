China will bar foreigners from climbing the Tibetan side of Mount Everest during the coming autumn season after a Polish traveller was accused of illegally crossing into Nepal last month.

  
The China Tibet Mountaineering Association (CTMA) declared in a notice on Wednesday that it will suspend climbing permits for all of Tibet, including other popular summits such as Cho Oyu and Shishapangma.   


The association said the ban was decided after Polish climber Janusz Adam Adamski “illegally scaled (Everest) from the north side” and entered Nepal in the south.
