The Government is expected to pay US $ 7.5 million to an Indian company for laundry service of local hospitals, risking the jobs of Sri Lankans even before ETCA was signed, the GMOA said yesterday.

Referring to the Sri Lankan delegation which visited India for discussions on the trade agreement, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it would create issues in the Sri Lankan job market.

“If authorities were attempting to outsource laundry services of the country to India, it will result in hundreds of Sri Lankans losing their jobs.”

Dr. Aluthge warned that the situation would worsen in the future, if the country was to sign the ETCA. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
