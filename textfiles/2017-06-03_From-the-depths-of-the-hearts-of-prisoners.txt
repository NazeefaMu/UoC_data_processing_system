3,000 parcels of inmates and 3,000 packets from the officers were distributed with the utmost collaboration of the Air Force,

“We can’t help everyone, but everyone can help someone.” Ronald Reagan once said. A rare act of generosity was initiated by the inmates of the Welikada Prison along with the co-ordination of Chandana Ekanayaka, the Superintendent of the Prison to voluntarily sacrifice their lunch in aid of the victims of the recent floods and earth slips. 


The good work was highly commended by many owing to the fact that, this sort of approach depicted the true disposition of the people, who are often branded as ‘criminals’. It is in fact amazing how these inmates made up their mind to forgo their lunch to distribute amongst the destitute. 


It was reported that 3,000 parcels of inmates and another 3,000 packets from the officers were successfully distributed with the utmost collaboration of the Air Force, who came to the front to reach the locations to give out the lunch packets to the affected ones.




“We live in isolation and feel that we are forsaken. I don’t intend that I deserve any concern. But when we got to know that some people of different regions are in dire need of help following the catastrophe, we as prisoners determined to do something as a compensation of what wrong we have done to some people,” an inmate said.


Chandana Ekanayake, the Superintendent of the Welikada Prison told the Daily Mirror that he was extremely delighted to hear that the inmates had decided to sacrifice their lunch for flood victims. He nevertheless pointed out how the inmates concerned with the issue and enthusiastic to assist them with a possible way they could. Moreover, it was the inmates who had prepared the meal and arranged the items in a hygienic manner. “I have been in this prison for 30 years and I firmly believe that these inmates possess a lot of human qualities in them. I deem that our attempt to rehabilitate them has been worthwhile, when these types of acts are visible,” Ekanayake said.


It is obvious that the bureaucrats of the prison render a tremendous job towards the socialisation of the inmates in terms of the rehabilitation process and other social activities. 




Indeed, it is a hard task to direct the inmates as they are susceptible to be self-willed and self-reproachful. It was reported that there are nearly 3000 prisoners comprising the inmates who have been sentenced to death and those who are appealing and those who are convicted with minor offences. “I lost my temper on one occasion in my life. But it doesn’t mean that I have lost my humanity. Many people label us as murderers, robbers. They may not know how we are trying to make up ourselves with sincere repentance. It is entirely a different life style we spend here from the life we had outside. I specially try to engage myself in a religious atmosphere like listening to Buddhist sermons and self meditation,” another inmate said.


In conclusion, it should be noted that I don’t want to exaggerate what the inmates have said to us in a brief discussion with them. 


It is all that emerged from the bottom of their hearts. Besides, I have the feeling that everyone needs time to correct their mistakes, yet the support of others becomes a requisite to guide him. That is where the role of the officials came into play in this contest to motivate the inmates in carrying out their good work. 


I think that it is noteworthy that the support of the officials should be praised due to the fact that this action could have not been in effect unless they showed their interest in this case.
