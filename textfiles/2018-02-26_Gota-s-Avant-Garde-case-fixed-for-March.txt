Gota's Avant Garde case fixed for March 26


	

The trial, in which former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Nissanka Senadhipathi and six others are facing corruption charges in connection with the Avant Garde Maritime Services Ltd, was postponed to March 26 by Colombo Chief Magistrate today.

President's Counsel Anil Silva appearing for Mr. Rajapaksa requested Court to postpone the trial fixed for today.

He requested Court to postpone the case on the basis that a revision petition had been filed in Court of Appeal challenging the refusal by the High Court to revise the decision taken by the Chief Magistrate to set aside the preliminary objections raised by the defense.
