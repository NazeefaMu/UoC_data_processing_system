Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today his government allowed SAITM to operate a medical faculty based on certain conditions.

He said this in response to a question asked by a journalist outside the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court premises.

Mr. Rajapaksa was present in court when the case against former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Avant Garde Maritime Security Services Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi was taken up for hearing.

While leaving the court premises, the former president said the government was taking revenge on its political opponents.

“This is what is called taking revenge. They can't do anything other than taking revenge using the services of the FCID and the CID,” he said.
