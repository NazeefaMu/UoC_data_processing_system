France fears of a biological attack on water supplies

FRANCE: Paris stepped up security at key water supply facilities Saturday night amid warnings of bio-chemical attacks.
The move was part of a raft of security measures imposed by France and Belgium in response to “imminent” fears of further terrorist strikes.
With Belgium on its highest terror alert, Jan Jambon, the interior minister, ordered a search of every single address in Molenbeek, the Brussels suburb dubbed a “terror den” over its links to several of the Paris killers.
Some 85 of the 130 jihadists who have returned from Syria to Belgium live there.
With the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) promising fresh attacks on Paris following those that killed 130 nine days ago - and issuing a video showing a fallen Eiffel Tower and Air France plane - the capital tightened security in water storage and supply sites amid reports of the theft of biohazard suits at a Paris hospital.
Eau de Paris, the capital's state-run water company, has banned access to six sensitive sites to all but key personnel following the Government's decision to declare a state of emergency for three months.
“Our eight security agents are the only ones to be accredited by the defence ministry and are in permanent contact with the terrorism cell of Paris police headquarters,” a spokesman told Le Parisien.
The storage and treatment sites have protective fencing and special sensors to detect intrusion. To limit the risk of contamination, Eau de Paris has increased the amount of chlorine added to water at five supply sites.
“The dose injected has been raised,” said Celia Blauel, president of Eau de Paris. Chlorine is a key indicator of any anomaly in the water. “When the chlorine level drops, it means there is biological contamination,” she said.
It is tested all along the supply chain, meaning that water authorities can “cut off supply in a contaminated area if necessary without stopping the entire system,” she added.
Eau de Paris produces a million cubic metres of drinking water per day but the capital only consumes half of that amount. “So we always have a day's lag in terms of consumption,” said Ms Blauel, describing the system as “extremely safe”.
The heightened security came amid reports that a dozen protective suits against highly contaminative viruses have gone missing from Paris’ Necker hospital.
Three times as many protective boots made of polyethylene - resistant to chemical agents - have also vanished, along with gloves and anti-bacterial masks.
The hospital said: “The disappearance of this limited amount of equipment was noticed on Wednesday and a complaint has been filed.”
Philippe Goujon, mayor of Paris's 15th arrondissement, where Necker is located, said the theft was “naturally worrying”.
It emerged last week that hospitals and emergency services across France have been supplied with the most powerful antidote to sarin and other nerve gas chemicals for the first time.
Under a November 14 decree, the army's medical service was ordered to distribute stocks of the drug atropine.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that the country could rule nothing out when it came to terrorists bent on mass murder, including “chemical and biological weapons”.
Iraqi and American intelligence have warned that IS is aggressively pursuing development of chemical weapons, setting up a branch dedicated to research and experiments with the help of scientists from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the region. French intelligence agents are convinced that IS is producing mustard gas, after obtaining samples from in Syria. However, US intelligence officials do not believe that IS has the capability to develop sophisticated weapons such as nerve gas. With Paris trying to return to normal life but with all public gatherings banned until November 30, terror fears spread to Brussels after the Government warned of a “precise” and “imminent” threat of a Paris-style attack on the Belgian capital.
