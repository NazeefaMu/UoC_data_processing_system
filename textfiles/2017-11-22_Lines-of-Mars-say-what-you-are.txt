The lines of Mars rise from the lower part of the Mount of Mars or from near the initial part of the Life line and proceed towards the Mount of Venus.


There can be one or more lines of Mars and they can be thin, thick or very faint. Whatever their nature, if they originate from the Mount of Mars, they can be called the lines of Mars.

 

Geniuses and great intellectuals
There are two main types of Mars lines. One type proceeds alongside the Life line and in some cases they run parallel to the Life line up to the latter’s end. People having such lines are geniuses and great intellectuals. They are gifted with extraordinary perceptive and discerning powers. They are capable of taking independent decisions and adhere to them.

 

They are trustworthy
These subjects are physically robust and enjoy good health. They are emotionally stable and do not act in anger or on impulse. 


The second type of lines: They do not run all the way alongside the Life line. These lines reach the Mount of Venus.

 

Careless and emotional
People having such a line or lines are careless by nature. They are emotional and would act rashly under provocation. They keep company with people below their status. 

 

Destined to attain a high position
Some have thin lines branching off the line or lines of Mars and moving upwards. Such people cherish many desires and leave no stone unturned to fulfill such desires. If such sub-lines meet the Fate line, the subject would attain a rise in his position. He is very sentimental if the sub-lines join the Heart line.
If the line of Mars is strong, prominent and dual, the subject would be a murderer. If the line is not dual, the subject would attain a high position in a security force.

 

Energetic and ambitious
If sub-lines rising from a line of Mars cross the Life line, the subject would be energetic and would want to rise in life. Sub-lines reaching the Head line or the Sun line indicate generation of a mental force as an aid to achieving success in life. Similar result would occur if a sub-line merges with the line of Saturn.


Following positions of the Mars line or lines and the results indicated against them may be noted for guidance:


(1) The presence of a clear line of Mars in a hand where the Life line deep and clear and the Mount of Venus is prominently large: The subject is prone to excessive indulgence of sexual appetite (a clear Head line and a Strong thumb can restrain such propensity) 
(2) A sub-line off the Mars line cuts the Apollo or Saturn line: The excessive indulgence has affected the career of the subject
(3) In the case of (2) above if the Apollo line terminates in a Dot, Bar, or a Cross: The subject would suffer loss of reputation
(4) In the case of (2) above, if such a rising line cuts a Line of Affection: Domestic life would be in ruins
The line of Mars by itself is a good indication, but there is an element of danger depending on its direction. In a hand where all main lines are strong, a good Mars line would reinforce the subject’s ability and power to achieve success.
