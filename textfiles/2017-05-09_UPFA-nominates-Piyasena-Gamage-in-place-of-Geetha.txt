UPFA General Secretary and Minister, Mahinda Amaraweera said today he would nominate former minister Piyasena Gamage to fill the vacancy created by former MP Geetha Kumarasinghe being disqualified.

He said this while responding to a question asked by a journalist at the weekly Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) media briefing.

Minister Chandima Weerakkody said according to the law; a writ had been taken against Geetha Kumarasinghe.

“No such appeal had been made to the Supreme Court. As far as I know, no case had been filed at the time of sending the letter of relinquishment to the Elections Commission. Therefore, there is no legal basis to prevent the appointment of Mr. Gamage,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
