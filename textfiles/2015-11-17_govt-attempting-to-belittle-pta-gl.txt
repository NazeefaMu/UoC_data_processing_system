Though the purpose of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) is to protect the people from security threats, the government is attempting to make out that the PTA as something frightening, former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris charged today.
He claimed that the government was using the PTA to arrest and punish security forces personnel while releasing former LTTE cadres detained under the PTA. He criticized the government move to release ex-LTTE cadres claiming it posed a threat to national security.
“Many people were attempting to belittle the PTA. Even the UN Human Right Commissioner called for its repeal. Therefore, the government which co-sponsored the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka is attempting to describe the PTA as something detrimental,” Prof. Peiris said.
Commenting on the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, he said even that country is strengthening laws and regulations and taking security measures to protect the country from terrorism.
Claiming that TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran had requested visiting Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to appoint an Australian prosecutor to the proposed special court to inquire into war crimes allegations, he asked what authority the TNA had to make such a request.
“TNA is not the government and they are in no position to make such a request unless the government has given them the authority to do so,” Prof. Peiris said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH
