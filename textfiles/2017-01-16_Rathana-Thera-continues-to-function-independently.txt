Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said today he is functioning as an independent Member of Parliament. He said he was keen to create awareness among the people for the need to set up a national council with inputs from intellectual politicians and others.

The monk, who said he had no differences of opinion with the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) and that he had been for some time now functioning independently in Parliament, added that he had no intention of joining the opposition.

Meanwhile, the Thera said former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has no opportunity to regain power as he couldn't contest the Presidency for the 3rd term. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
