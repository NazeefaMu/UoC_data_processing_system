Viyath Maga too carries forward Mahinda Chinthanaya: MR


	

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today said that there was no animosity between the Nelum Mawatha-the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) head office-and Viyath Maga headed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa and that the Viyath Maga too carried forward Mahinda Chinthanaya.

Mr Rajapaksa said this while addressing a group of Provincial Councillors who joined the SLPP at the party head-office in Battaramulla.

The event was attended by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, SLPP National Organiser Basil Rajapaksa, MPs Chamal Rajapaksa, Dullas Alahapperuma, Bandula Gunawardane, Pavithra Wanniarachchi and many others.

“I’m happy Gotabaya Rajapaksa was invited to this event and he decided to attend. Otherwise, they say brothers are fighting, Nelum Mawatha and Viyath Maga are fighting. Viyath Maga is only a name, it carries forward Mahinda Chinthanaya,” the former President said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
