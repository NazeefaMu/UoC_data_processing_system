The Local Government Elections (Amendment) Bill came into effect today with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya placing his endorsement.

The Speaker’s office said he placed his signature to endorse the Bill at 1.15 p.m. today.

“This is a historical event as this piece of legislation, which I have just endorsed will make provisions for the election of a member, who would be responsible for a Ward and will also put an end to the Preferential Vote (PR) system at the Local Government elections,” the Speaker said.

He said that it was only a first step towards ensuring proper democracy in the country.

Further he said that the new electoral system would enable even an ordinary citizen to serve his/her fellow citizens.
