Postal workers have resorted to a protest fast outside the Central Mail Exchange (CME) a short while ago, demanding the Government to resolve their issues.

Around 30 employees had joined in the action and pledged that they would fast unto death if the authorities further remained silent.

The work stoppage launched by the postal workers attached to 24 unions on Monday (11) completed ten days today. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
