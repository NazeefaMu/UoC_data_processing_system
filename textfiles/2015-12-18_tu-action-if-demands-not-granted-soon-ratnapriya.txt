TU action if demands not granted soon: Ratnapriya


	

Government, semi Government and private sector Trade Unions’ Collective Convener Saman Ratnapriya said yesterday they would resort to trade union action if the government failed to fulfill its promises made at the meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said the government had agreed to grant 11 of 12 demands made by them and this was why the collective had called its scheduled countrywide token strike.
“The government has a responsibility to fulfill its promises without any delay and not force us to take trade union action,” he said.
Mr. Ratnapriya rejected the claims by some people that they had betrayed the trade union action but it was nothing unusual to call off trade union action when 60 per cent of the demands were achieved. We have gone beyond that limit,” he said.
