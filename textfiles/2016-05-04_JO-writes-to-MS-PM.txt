JO writes to MS, PM


	

The joint opposition today said it had written to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe requesting that specially trained military personnel be provided for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s security.

The letters were signed by a group of joint opposition members including MP Dinesh Gunawardana, MP Wimal Weerawansa and MP Bandula Gunawardena, Tissa Vitharana and Raja Kollure.

The letters state that it is unacceptable and improper to withdraw the military security provided to Mr. Rajapaksa because it was Mr. Rajapaksa who had defeated the world’s most ruthless terrorists and a person who had received several threats from them.
