Some of the key messages that emerged from the session were that women undoubtedly play multiple roles in today’s complex society and that they have achieved many milestones in a multitude of spheres. The speakers reiterated the need for women everywhere to consider themselves equal to men, despite operating in a largely male-dominated society. Women’s ability to multi task is their key strength and it should be appreciated in every realm they enter. The speakers urged women to be true to themselves and be proud of their identity and achievements, even though at times they have to work harder than men in order to prove their worth.

The senior management of Serendib Flour Mills, staff and other invitees were present on the occasion. The event concluded by hailing the power of women. The Year 2018 also marks the 10th anniversary of Serendib Flour Mills and the company has exciting plans to make this year a memorable one.
