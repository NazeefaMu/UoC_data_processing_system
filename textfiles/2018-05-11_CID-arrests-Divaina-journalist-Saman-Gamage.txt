Divaina Newspaper journalist Saman Gamage was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) last night.

Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said the journalist was arrested as he had failed to appear before the Gampaha Magistrate’s Court after he was summoned to do so on Friday (4).

The Police Spokesman explained that Gamage had been previously summoned to the CID to record a statement over an article written by him regarding an investigation into the assault of former Chief Editor of Rivira and Divaina newspapers Upali Tennakoon.

When the suspect failed to appear, the CID then notified the Gampaha Magistrate’s Court of the incident, prompting the court to summon him.  

When Gamage failed to appear before the court, the CID then filed a lawsuit under clause 109 subsection 6, which resulted in the Court issuing of an arrest warrant.

The suspect is to be produced before the Gampaha Magistrate Court today. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
