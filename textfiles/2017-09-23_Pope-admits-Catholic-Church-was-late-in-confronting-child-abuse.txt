 (Daily Mail),-Pope Francis on Thursday acknowledged the Catholic Church was “a bit late” in realising the damage done by priests who rape and molest children, and said that the decades-long practice of moving pedophiles around rather than sanctioning them was 
to blame.  


Francis met Thursday for the first time with his sex abuse advisory commission, a group of outside experts named in 2014 to advise him and the Catholic Church on best practices to keep pedophiles out of the priesthood and protect children.
