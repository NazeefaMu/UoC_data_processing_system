A move is afoot to promote 313 employees of a certain state-owned corporation dealing in petroleum products to higher grades under the pretext of compensating them for being political victims. 

 


The purohita in charge of the subject is currently out of the island and the Deputy has taken advantage of his absence to submit a Cabinet paper for the purpose, they say. 


The employees selected for promotion are members of a trade union with ties to the Green party and the implementation of the promotion proposal is estimated to cost the corporation a massive Rs.20 million a month to meet these employees’ additional allowance bill alone.


 By the way, this corporation comes under a Ministry presided over a purohita from the Betel leaf party and its deputy is a fair member from the Green party.
