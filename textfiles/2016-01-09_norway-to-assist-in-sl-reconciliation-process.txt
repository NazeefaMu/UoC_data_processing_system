Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Borge Brende , during his one day official visit to Sri Lanka, held talks with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga heading the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR).
At the meeting, Ms. Kumaratunga briefed the Norwegian Minister about measures being taken by the government in this regard.
