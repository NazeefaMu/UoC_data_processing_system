At least 17 reserved forests in five districts in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces are being cleared with the initiative of several Muslim ministers representing the receptive areas, an environmental lobby group charged.
Environmental Conservation Trust (ECT) Director Sajeewa Chamikara charged that a total of 16,500 acres of reserved forests in Vanuniya, Mullaithivu and Ampara Districts are being cleared in the guise of resettling of internally displaced persons and for cultivation.
He said the reserved forests of Karunkalipuram, Marichchukaddi, Purawasankulum, Kulamarrippu, Naganchchley, Madhu road, Irresenthikulunm, Wadakadu, KakenikulamPeriyamdhu, Odusuddan, Muhudubadapathhu, Karadikkuli government forest in the North and Kumubukkanna Reserve, Bakmitiyawa and Thimbirigolla in the East are being cleared.
The ECT Director charged that these reserved forests are being cleared violating legislations such as the Forest Ordinance, National Environment Act and the 'Antiquities Ordinance of 1940.
He said the clearing was begun during the last regime but it had continued during the present government as well. (Yohan Perera and Darshana Sanjeewa)
