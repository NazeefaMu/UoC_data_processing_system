Coming weeks will be crucial for Sri Lanka as important discussions could take place with the European Union in reviving the GSP plus status, government sources said.

A three member team from the European Union including EU Parliament MP Anne-Marie Mineur, Lola Sanchez Coldentey and Ben Vanpeperstraete are already in town to study the Sri Lanka situation while there is a possibility of Chairperson International Trade Committee of European Union visiting Sri Lanka shortly.

Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Harsha De Silva who confirmed that there may be the possibility of Chairperson International Trade Committee of European Union visiting Sri Lanka shortly told Daily Mirror that the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Brussels has extended a verbal invitation to the chair of International Trade Committee of European Union to visit Sri Lanka though there is no confirmation of his visit yet.

However, it was reported that the resolution on reviving GSP plus to Sri Lanka will be taken up by the European Union on April 19. The Government has already stated that Sri Lanka could regain GSP by May this year. (Yohan Perera)
