Cabinet nod for Karapitiya expansion

The Health Ministry is expanding the facilities at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital. The Cabinet has approved to build the new theatre complex and CCD has estimated the project.
The project has already received the approval of the Planning Department, Health Services Director General Dr. Palitha Mahipala said.
He said the ministry has taken measures to solve the issue at Karapitiya Teaching Hospital’s heart surgery waiting list. There are 2,200 patients in the waiting list to undergo heart surgeries at the hospital and their surgeries will be expedited.
“But without the cooperation of the public to control NCDs, expanding health facilities will be similar to filling water to a bottle with a hole in the bottom,” Dr. Mahipala said.
He said that patients with various germs will be operated at Welisara Chest Hospital and relevant instructions were given to the Karapitiya hospital Director to transfer such patients to Welisara Hospital. This will be done to keep the theatre complex at Karapitiya hospital free of germs and ensure the safety of patients undergoing heart surgeries.
Heart surgeries will commence soon at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Hospital and Polonnaruwa Hospital. Cath labs has already been provided for those two hospitals. Four more Thoracic surgeons will be assigned to Welisara Chest Hospital. So far Thoracic surgeries were conducted only at Welisara Chest Hospital and later the surgeries were commenced at Karapitiya Hospital, he said.
