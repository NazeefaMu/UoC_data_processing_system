Every third Sunday of November to be Road Accident Victim’s Day

Steps would be taken to provide more dividends, including enhanced compensation and other relief to accident victims in consultation with Insurance Companies, said Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He gave this assurance at a ceremony to mark road accident victims’ day held at the Colombo new Town Hall recently. The third Sunday of November each year has been designated Road Accident Victims Day by the UNO under an agreement made on October 26, 2005.
Minister de Silva said as Sri Lanka is progressing towards development status, people’s needs too has been ever increasing. Those who used a bicycle have now changed over to a motorcycle, while motor cyclists have systematically changed over to a motor car and presently the hybrid vehicle.
A large number of middle class people wished to travel by car rather than public transport, since it was a matter of prestige.
"When the number of vehicles increase in this manner, roads also have to be developed to cater to them. When roads are developed, more problems, coupled with more road accidents occur.
This was the nature of development and progress. As such, the National Council for Road Safety should take note of these facts and come up with more timely and pragmatic methods to tackle these problems.
Road accidents have become a menace throughout the world today," Minister de Silva said.
Minister de Silva said he wished to put forward certain recommendations to tackle this problem. One was to remove all old and outdated vehicles from roads.
