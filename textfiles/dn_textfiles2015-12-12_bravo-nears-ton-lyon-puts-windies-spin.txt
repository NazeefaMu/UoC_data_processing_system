Bravo nears ton as Lyon puts Windies in a spin

HOBART, FRIDAY: Nathan Lyon put the skids under the flailing West Indies as Australia set course for an overwhelming early victory despite Darren Bravo holding on in the first Test in Hobart on Friday.
At the close of a stop-start day through showers, the Windies were 207 for six with Bravo offering spirited resistance on 94 and Kemar Roach in support on 31.
Bravo and Roach kept the Windies innings pulse beating with an unbeaten seventh-wicket stand of 91.
"I think the guys are confident in Darren and me at the crease. We've done a pretty good job so far, hopefully we can carry on tomorrow and do a much better job," Roach said.
Lyon claimed two wickets in one over to trigger a middle-order collapse to have the West Indies in familiar trouble in their chase after a mammoth declaration of 583 for four on the second day.
The probing off-spinner snared the wickets of Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood in his seventh over along with opener Rajendra Chandrika for 175 Test wickets to leave the hapless Caribbean tourists struggling to avoid a heavy defeat with three days left.
"I'm really confident in my skill set to get the job done. The ball is coming out beautifully out of my hand in the nets and I've been working hard," said Lyon, who is playing in his 50th Test match.
The Windies sticky predicament was accentuated by the dismissal of skipper Jason Holder, the last of the recognised batsmen at the crease with Bravo. AFP
