The Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL) granted license for InsureMe Insurance Brokers (Pvt.) Ltd (InsureMe) to operate as an insurance broker with effect from September 9, 2016.
InsureMe is founded by a team of insurance specialists with the objective of delivering a professional service to insurance customers by offering innovative and convenient solutions. 
Finding the right insurance solution which provides the real value is a time-consuming and expensive task today. InsureMe intends to provide a more transparent and unbiased professional service to its customers by offering a wide range of insurance options direct from the major insurers in the country. 
Commenting on the launch of InsureMe, Director/CEO Vipula Dharmapala said, “InsureMe will bring an innovative insurance experience to the customers where the customers are empowered with knowledge to make an informed decision when selecting the insurance solutions. This truly would be a novel experience to the customers in the Sri Lankan market.  A dedicated team of professionals will always ensure that the customers would get a professional service all time.”
