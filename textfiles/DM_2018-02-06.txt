Are party leaders scared to amend Section 80 PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who kicked off the adjournment debate on the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports in Parliament today, questioned whether political party leaders were prepared to amend the Section 80 of the Constitution.
The PRECIFAC in its report has recommended that Section 80 of the Constitution be amended to provide for the stripping of a person's civic rights if found guilty of serious crimes.
"Are the party leaders prepared to amend Section 80 of the Constitution or are they scared to do it," he asked.
The PM told Parliament that legislation pertaining to the re-organization of the Central Bank would be introduced as recommended by the PCoI.
"We will also present legislation to create a budget office for Parliament soon," he said and added that those responsible for the bond scam had already been arrested and would be legally dealt with. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)

Confidant of winning 250 LG bodies: SLPP
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today it was confident of winning 225 to 250 Local Government (LG) bodies out of 341.
SLPP national organiser Basil Rajapaksa said the people who are disgruntled with the United National Party (UNP) should vote for the SLPP instead of any of the other parties.
It is the SLPP and Mahinda Rajapaksa who are upholding Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) principles. We will continue to preserve them, he said.
Responding to UNP and SLFP threats that the government will withhold funds to LG bodies which were won by the SLPP, Mr. Rajapaksa said they could administer the LG bodies with their own revenue.
He said the government was attempting to handover the management of cemeteries and other entities which were under LG bodies, to private institutions.
The UNP is asking to vote for them so that they could run the LG bodies the way they are running the government. Perhaps, they intend to rob banks at village level similar to the way they robbed the Central Bank, Mr. Rajapaksa said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

## Title: EPF gets zero returns from majority of private equity investments

EPF gets zero returns from majority of private equity investments
	
The countrys largest retirement fund, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which is under the custodianship of the Central Bank, has to this day not generated any returns for the Rs.9.3 billion in private equity investments made up to 2014.
The figure in comparison is a little more than the moneys the state is said to have lost during the infamous treasury bond scams in 2015 and 2016.
According to a Right to Information disclosure the Central Bank made to Mirror Businessfollowing significant delays in processing the inquiry, due to the scope of the data requestedthe pension fund had provided in total Rs.10.8 billion in private equity funding to seven firms during the period in question.
This was the period when Ajit Nivard Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank, an era, which the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into bond scams said, may have resulted in more losses to the EPF from insider trading in treasury bond issuances than from the incidents in 2015 and 2016.
Cabraal has denied these allegations. However, the EPF had during this period invested billions of rupees in loss-making public listed companies.
While the market price of shares of many EPF investments has depreciated significantly from the purchase price, the fund has continued to hold on to some of these investments.
As equity investments of the nearly Rs.2 trillion fund amounted to around 5 percent of the portfolio, the Rs.10.8 billion in private equity amounted to around 0.5 percent of the portfolio.
The largest of these investments, made in 2013, was Rs.7.5 billion in the state-owned Canwill Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd, which is the holding company of Grand Hyatt in Colombo, currently under construction.
The government recently announced that it had begun the process of having Grand Hyatt eventually listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, although recently it was revealed in Mirror Business that the government has been delaying the construction process due to a lack of funds.
Cargills Bank Ltd received an investment of Rs.495 million from the EPF in 2014, while Weligama Hotel Properties (Pvt.) Ltd, which is a subsidiary of East West Properties PLC and the owner of Weligama Bay Marriott Resort & Spa, received an investment of Rs.405 million in 2014 as well.
The multimillion dollar loss-making state-owned SriLankan Airlines too received an investment of Rs.500 million from the EPF in 2010.
Meanwhile, Jetwing Symphony Limited, which recently went for an initial public offering (IPO), due to a pre-negotiated condition with the EPF when it invested Rs.390 million in 2014, started trading its shares at Rs.15, which would have provided the EPF for an exit with a compounded annual growth rate of 10.9 percent, a little less than the portfolio return on the investment average of 11.3 percent.
However, the EPF did not choose to exit the firm, which has been operating at a loss, since most of its hotels commenced commercial operations in 2016 and 2017 and would take approximately two years to record profits. Jetwing Symphonys share price has slipped by Rs.1 since the IPO in December.
Of the Rs.10.8 billion of EPFs private equity holdings, only West Coast Power (Pvt.) Ltd shares and SriLankan Catering preference shares have generated returns on investment.
The Rs.1 billion investment in SriLankan Catering has provided returns since the year the investment was made, generating Rs.1 billion in dividends over the eight-year period.
Meanwhile, the Rs.494.8 million invested in West Coast Power (Pvt.) Ltd, which operates the Yugadanavi thermal power plant in Kerawalapitiya, has become the most successful investment, paying Rs.5.3 billion in dividends from 2011 to 2017.
Over 90 percent of the EPFs investments are in the so-called risk-free government securities, but the recent insider trading scandal related to government securities had resulted in Rs.8.5 billion in losses to the EPF and several other state-controlled funds and institutions.

Fighting each other isnt going to provide the answer
	
Kesaralal Gunasekara
United Peoples Freedom Alliances Mayoral candidate for the Dehiwala- Mount Lavinia Municipal Council Kesaralal Gunasekara in an interview with Daily mirrorspoke about the progress of his campaign and presented his analysis on the upcoming elections. 
Excerpts: 
QWhat is your impression of the campaign so far 
The election procedure has changed this time. Earlier, there was intra-party rivalry. Today, people can vote for the party of their choice. As a result, intra-party fighting is all gone. The best candidate can put forward his manifesto and get the support of the masses, who are ultimately going to gain.
There is a shift as far as voting is concerned. Traditionally, UNPers and SLFPers detested each other when it came to voting. By and large, we have had a good campaign. We have enough material. We have a good team. I am coming forward as the mayoral candidate. I have enough experience both in Parliament and the local administrative system. We are more equipped to handle local government issues than any other party. 
QNow, the anti-UNP vote base has been divided. One group is contesting under the betel leaf and the other contests under the flower bud symbol. How will it affect the final outcome 
This is fundamentally a city. Many people are of the view that this will not have any bearing. Some of the people whom we met arent aware whether there is any other party. I must tell you that it isnt easy to get a party and its symbol familiar with the people. In that context, I doubt the new partys performance. 
QYou are contesting for the second largest municipal council of Sri Lanka. What are the specific issues you have identified in the area 
There are so many issues. Main among them is the garbage issue. Its a serious issue. If we set a date for the collection of waste, it has to be done as predetermined. So far, we havent been able to implement something of that nature. Once we secure power in the council, we intend to do something in this regard. Secondly, there are instances where people turn to the councils seeking solutions to the matters of their concern. Then, the municipal authorities direct them to take legal action. We need to have a departure from that practice. The judicial process is a costly exercise. What we plan is to create a situation where there is a committee to look into such concerns. After that, a decision can be taken regarding what to do. 
QGoing by your interactions with the people during the canvassing process, are they merely concerned about the local issues or national issues 
They are very much concerned about local issues. I hardly came across anyone talking about the cost of living. May be, it is because this is a city area. People came up with issues like garbage disposal, street lighting, and sewerage disposal. 
QBut the leaders of the main political forces always speak about national issues when campaigning for the elections. Some even ask people to see this as a referendum. What is your view 
This is an election for people to elect representatives to run their localities. You cannot ask people to forget about these matters. This is not a local election. You need a team. 
QThe UNP and the SLFP are critical of each other. How will it affect the future of the Unity Government 
A similar question was directed to me at a recent TV talk show. It was attended by experts in the field of economics. One must understand that there is no other alternative. You have to go ahead whether you like it or not. As far the statements by any party threatening to form its own Government, I must say that they arent experienced enough in politics. There is no way the Government can be taken in this manner. The best thing is for the two parties to get together and work. You may have issues all over. You need to manage them all. We need to move in the correct direction. We need to understand that fighting each other is not going to provide the answer. 
QDo you mean to say that the Unity Government should continue 
It has to run its full term. Both parties are looking forward to each others goals. The course of action should be to get together and see how we can take the country forward. So many people are coming up with theories as to what happened during the past few months. The local authorities arent for them. In fact, I detest certain politicians coming and talking at our meetings. They are talking nonsense. Some senior members of the party absolutely talk rubbish when they address our meetings. They must concentrate on local affairs. 
QThe Dehiwala- Mount Lavinia Municipal Council has always been with the UNP barring on a few occasions. How do you see it this time 
There are two electorates falling under this municipal area. One is Dehiwala and the other Ratmalana. They are two contrasting electorates. They would not come out the same. One party may do better in Dehiwala and the other party in Ratmalana. 
If you look at the results of the last elections, we were stronger in Ratmalana than in Dehiwala. That is why we could establish the administration. 


It isnt easy to get a party and symbol familiar
	National Unity Govt. should continue as there is no other alternative- UPFA candidate for Dehiwala
	Garbage disposal, street lighting are key issues to be addressed
	New Election Law is better
	There is no intra-party rivalry

QDo you think it will work the same way this time 
Yes, we have a better team. We are much more equipped. 
QFormer Mayor Danasiri Amaratunga is contesting from the other party. How will it affect the UPFA as a whole 
I have categorically said that the party is not going to be the strongest in the area. 
QIn your view, the UPFA is the party to win 
Yes, it is. 
QWhat is your assessment of the new election law 
The change is good. There is no intra-party fighting. Yet, the number of people to be elected is too big. It is too heavy. 
QWhat are the pluses and minuses of the new election law as far as campaigning is concerned 
The advantage is that it is easy for us to drive a point. You go from house to house. You do not need to have massive meetings. It is easy to visit households in a limited area.

Four children among 23 killed as Syria air strikes pound rebel area
	

THE HINDU, 05th FEBRUARY, 2018- At least 23 civilians were killed on Monday as Syrian government air strikes pounded a rebel-held enclave near the capital Damascus, a monitor said.
The region of Eastern Ghouta is home to an estimated 4,00,000 people living under government siege and facing escalating bombardment in recent weeks.
Dozens of air strikes hit several areas in Eastern Ghouta, killing 23 civilians including four children, said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor.
The deadliest raids hit a market in the town of Beit Sawa, killing nine civilians including two children. Another six civilians, including a young girl, were killed in bombardment on the town of Hazzeh. The remaining eight were killed in strikes across the rest of the besieged region, and more than 80 people were wounded, the Observatory said.
An AFP correspondent in Eastern Ghouta could hear warplanes above, circling around the town every few minutes.
Eastern Ghouta is supposed to be one of four de-escalation zones agreed last year, but violence has ramped up there in recent weeks.

Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday vowed to provide free public Wi-fi facilities before the end of the year.
He said that the facility would be implemented in April for the first time and each village would be connected by the end of the year.
While addressing a United National Party (UNP) election rally in Puttalam he said operating a mobile phone without Wi-fi facility had become one of the biggest issues.
Everyone has a smart phone but there is an issue with getting access to data. Once the facility is implemented every one can access the internet. We will see what will happen after giving free Wi-fi, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
Parents however do not like providing free Wi-fi for youth. Cant imagine what the girls would do on free Wi-fi.
We had been in the Opposition for ten years. Do we have to go back there Do we need to create a Pohottu era, he said.
The Premier requested people who participated at the rally to vote for the UNP to continue the work after the election. (Chatruanga Samarawickrama)

Minister Susil Premajayantha said today President Maithripala Sirisena would be compelled to effect changes at the national level soon after the Local Government elections because the current government could not continue in this manner.
"Although the UNP stated that when the election is over the current unity government will continue as usual but anyone can understand that it was impossible to do so," he told the weekly SLFP news briefing.
"The people want a change. Most of the sectors in the country are facing a crisis, such as the prices of essential items increasing, unemployment, economic problems, and the increase in the number of robberies. Considering these facts it is necessary to have a change as soon as possible. I can't tell you now how the changes will be carried out, but the President himself has said he will take the control of the country's economy after the elections and promised to punish the corrupt. He will decide how the changes will be made, but change is a must." (Sandun A Jayasekera)

HNB enhances seven-day banking by adding personal financial loan services
	

Bringing greater convenience to their weekend banking customers, Sri Lankas largest private sector commercial bank, HNB PLC, added personal financial services to their already existing seven-day banking customer centres.
Customers across 12 townships in Sri Lanka can now avail themselves of loans even during weekends, in addition to the usual banking services from these fully-fledged centres.
Such centres will manage all over-the-counter banking needs plus provide advisory assistance to customers on HNBs unique financial products including personal and housing loans, leasing and credit cards, at an easier, relaxed, weekend pace.
HNB envisages that the Saturday and Sunday offering will be a boon to their customers, most of whom have very tight work schedules during the week. Such customers who have no time to visit the bank could now pop-by to the closest seven-day centre during a weekend to discuss all their banking needs from loans to leasing.
HNB Retail Banking Deputy General Manager Sanjay Wijemanne speaking on the rationale behind the additional services said: HNB has taken a pragmatic decision to transform our existing seven-day banking centres to include value added services, such as personal financial services. Now, customers can meet a dedicated staffer during the weekend for advice and assistance, collect applications, hand-over documents and more, without being rushed.
The centres now located in Wellawatte, Rajagiriya, Maharagama, Negombo, Anuradhapura, Kiribathgoda, Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle, Ratnapura, Trincomalee and Jaffna will see a further 40 such customer centers, now open only on Saturdays, convert into fully-fledged weekend units.
Adding to providing exceptional customer service, HNB will also introduce a unique door-to-door service for customers who have applied for a personal or housing loan. A dedicated banking agent will visit the residence or business premises to complete necessary documentation.

Islamic State threatens Iran from Tora Bora borderlands
	

REUTERS, 05th FEBRUARY, 2018- Islamic State may be on the wane in Iraq and Syria but for Iran, the threat is still strong, centered on Kurdish communities along the Iraq-Iran border where militants have operated in recent years.
The locals even have a nickname for the area, Tora Bora, after the mountain hideout al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden fled to after the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, a senior Iraqi security official in the border region said.
In late January, three Revolutionary Guards were killed in the Bamo region fighting 21 Islamic State militants who had sneaked in from Iraq. Three militants detonated suicide vests and two others were killed in the clash, the Guards said.
Days earlier, Irans intelligence ministry found a weapons cache in the town of Marivan on the Iranian side of the border that included TNT, C4, electronic detonators, grenades, ammunition clips for AK-47 machine guns and rocket propelled grenades.
The clash and discovery indicate that Islamic State still has the ability to penetrate the tightly controlled security net of the Islamic Republic, which has largely managed to avoid the devastation wrought by the group in neighbouring countries.
Today (Islamic State) does not control a country ... in order to assert that they exist, they may carry out an attack any day, Hossein Dehghan, a former defence minister and now an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a recent interview with the semi-official Tasnim news agency.

Israel and Egypt in secret pact against ISIS
	

Israel has joined forces with Egypts military to smash ISIS militants in Nothern Sinai.
Unmarked Israeli drones, helicopters and jets have carried out a covert air campaign to rid Egypt of Islamic terrorists, for more than two years.
Around 100 airstrikes have been executed in the country, with often more than one a week.But Israeli assistance in the region has helped Cairo regain a footing in the battle against extremism, reports the New York Times.
The partnership marks a new dawn for the two countries, who were once enemies in three wars.
However, the nations have shared foe with ISIS, Iran and extremist Islam.
According to the US military officials Israels military presence has played a key role in helping the Egyptian military fight ISIS.However, there are concerns that Israels role in keeping terrorists at bay in Egypt is having a negative effect on the region.
But while Israeli officials are happy to help colleagues in Cairo contain ISIS, the missions have been kept under wraps.

This couple has made it a practice to visit remote areas in the country by helicopter for electioneering.

The minister said the SL Navy which had acquired this business had earned profits ofmore than Rs.10 million a day and pointed out justice must be meted out by enforcing the law on the former defence secretary as well.
Meanwhile, he requested the President to wield his sword over the Ratwatte family for misappropriating another Rs.12 billion from the Ceylon Electricity Board. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Law will be enforced on Mahendran as well: Kavinda
	
The law will be enforced on Central Banks former governor Arjuna Mahendran in the same way it had been enforced on Sri Lanka's former ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga, who was arrested by Interpol, UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardene said yesterday.
He said this at a media briefing held at UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha yesterday.
You can see how the Interpol arrested former Udayanga Weeratunga over the weekend. Arjuna Mahendran will also be dealt in the same way because the rule of law would be enforced on all wrongdoers, Dr. Jayawardene said responding to a question asked by a journalist about Mr.Mahendran's fate.
The journalists reminded Dr. Jayawardene that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had assured he would take the responsibility for enforcing rule of law on Mr. Mahendran if he was found to have committed any wrongdoing.
When asked whether Mr. Weeratunga's arrest was a political gimmick in the wake of the LG elections, he said it was not so.
Can we ask Interpol to arrest him because the LG elections are round the corner, Dr. Jayawardena asked.
He assured that the law would be enforced on everyone including Mr. Mahendran and those who have been named in the PRECIFAC report.
Dr. Jayawardene said the arrest of Mr. Aloysius and CEO Kasun Palisena may have been delayed because of the inquiry being carried out by the Bond Commission.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe requested Attorney General to take action against those who have been accused of the CB bond scam in 2016. However, the Presidential Commission was appointed later. This situation may have delayed action against those who were charged with the bond scam, he said and added that the UNP was ready to debate the PCoI and PRECIFAC reports in Parliament today.

License of Aloysius owned Mendis brewery cancelled
	
The licence of arrack distillery W.M. Mendis & Co. Ltd has been cancelled by the Excise Department for non-payment of taxes, the Excise Department confirmed.
The production in the distillery has been suspended since January this year, Commissioner of Excise Helan Meegasmulla told the Daily FT.
The company has evaded tax payments to the tune of Rs. 580 million for the month of December 2017. The company had an outstanding of Rs. 720 million, however, part of the amount has been settled before the licence was revoked, sources told Daily FT.
Owned by Arjun Aloysius, now in custody in connection to the Central Bank bond scam, W.M. Mendis & Co. has been stopped since last month and has let go of all temporary workers, it was learnt.
Perpetual Capital Holdings Ltd bought over the distillery company in 2012, with indications from its then-Chairman Arjun Aloysius that it was the first of a series of investments. Established in the 1960s, W. M. Mendis & Co. is one of the oldest local liquor brands in the country.

The Excise Department is also awaiting the court ruling to be given on 16 February on another case filed against the company for non-payment of tax, before Perpetual Capital Holdings took over the company, sources said. (Daily FT)

Made to kneel as punishment
	
Two top female high-ups of the Ministry concerned have been assigned to inquire into a complaint that several girls including a granddaughter of a dead senior politico were made to stand on their knees by a teacher of an international school in an area north of Colombo, they say.

These girls had been ordered to go down on their knees for several minutes for failing to bring their text books despite repeated advice to them, a school source said.
They say that according to the normal practice, a zonal authority would look into an incident of this nature, but in this case two high-ups from the Ministry itself had been asked to conduct an inquiry into it due to the influence used by the family of the dead senior politico.

Maldives declares state of emergency as crisis deepens
	

Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen Monday declared a 15-day state of emergency, his aide Azima Shukoor announced, deepening the political crisis in the Indian
Ocean nation.
The move gives sweeping powers to security forces to arrest and detain suspects, and comes amid a tense standoff between the Supreme Court and the government.
The president has refused to comply with a court order to release political prisoners, despite growing international pressure and concern.
Shukoor read out the declaration on state television shortly after Yameen sent three letters to the judges asking them to reverse their decision.
This is the second time Yameen has declared a state of emergency. He last took the step in November 2015 after an alleged attempt to assassinate him.
Officials said the president is required to inform the parliament about any declaration of emergency within two days, but the countrys legislature has been suspended indefinitely by authorities.
The Supreme Court on Thursday had also restored the seats of 12 MPs who had defected from Yameens party, effectively handing the opposition a majority in the 85-member parliament, making the president vulnerable to impeachment.

There was a move to relocate a government school in an area represented by a leading politico.

The traders in the locality who took the lead to protest against the move held a picket demanding that the school be shifted to a block of land belonging to the Mahaveli Authority situated in close proximity to its present site.
The provincial governor who later visited the proposed block of land approved its transfer for relocating the school and instructed that it be bounded by a barbwire fence.
The traders happy that they won their demand cried hurrah and set about putting up the boundary fence around the piece of land allotted for the school. However, a team of Policemen who arrived at the scene told the men busy putting up the fence that they were committing an offense. The governor has transferred this land for relocating our village school and we are putting up the fence on his instructions, they told the Policemen. Police told them that the governor has no powers to allocate state land to anybody and proceeded to dismantle the fence the traders had put up.
The traders had later made representations to the governor about the Police action. However, he had admitted that he had no powers to distribute lands and he could do nothing about it. And they were back to square one!

Obtaining foreign loan: Mahendran, Aloysius involved in another deal: PHU
	
The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) yesterday alleged that former Central Bank (CB) Governor Arjuna Mahendran and his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius had caused a colossal loss to the country when obtaining a foreign loan to build the Pothuhera to Galagedara stretch of the Central Expressway.
He said the the government had obtained a loan of Rs. 138 billion from the Tokyo Mitsubishi bank of Japan to build the 32 kilometer stretch of the Central Expressway from Pothuhera to Galagedara.
The Japanese bank's local agent who negotiated the deal to obtain the loan, was none other than Arjun Aloysius. All foreign loans should be approved by the CB monetary board, if the loan conditions are favourable. The monetary board was where Mr. Mahendran acted as the Chairman when he was the CB governor. For the loan of Rs. 138 billion, Sri Lanka has to pay Rs. 14 billion as the insurance. The insurance, which amounting to 10 percent of the loan, was obtained by the bank in case the government failed to pay the loan. This 10 percent is exorbitant compared to previous insurance rates of 5-10% and 2-5%," he told a news briefing.
He said neither Mr. Mahendran nor Mr. Aloysius would reveal the conflict of interest in the approval procedure of the loan or the fact that it was obtained when Aloysius was an agent of the Japanese bank.
He said this deal was the second chapter of the bond scam and requested President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a presidential commission of inquiry in this regard without delay. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today it would support new laws to prevent the people's representatives charged with fraud and corruption from contesting elections and would defeat any moves to scrap civic rights of any individual.
Party Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said Parliament was where laws were drafted and not where people were punished.
"We recently heard about a move to scrap the civic rights of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. We will not support the drafting of laws for political games because Parliament is not meant to inflict punishment," he said.
However, Mr. Dissaynayake said they would support laws to prevent politicians charged with fraud and corruption contesting elections as recommended by the PRECIFAC report.
"The PRECIFAC report has recommended that politicians charged with fraud and corruption should not be allowed to contest elections not for seven years as stipulated in the Constitution but during their lifetime. We fully agree with that recommendation," he said. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

PM tried to protect Mahendran: JVP
	
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said today Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was directly involved in protecting Central Bank's former governor Arjuna Mahendran.
He told Parliament during the debate on Bond Commission and PRECIFAC reports that the Prime Minister's entire approach was directed towards protecting the fraudsters rather than punishing them.
Mr. Dissanayake said the PCoI report had clearly stated that Mr. Mahendran had provided insider information to PTL owner Arjun Aloysius and that if the proper steps were taken on time, the Rs.688 million loss could have been prevented.
He said when he raised this matter about the bond scam in February 27, 2015, the Prime Minister responded in March 17 saying Mr. Mahendran was in no way involved in CB bond sales. Mr. Dissanayake said they had no way of knowing the truth until the PCoI report was published in December last year.
"The PCoI report had revealed that the Prime Minister could have acted with more responsibility when obtaining information. The report has indirectly held the Prime Minister responsible in this matter," he said and added that the appointment of the Pitipana Committee by the Prime Minister was another subtle move to suppress this matter.
"The PCoI has clearly stated that the members of the Pitipana Committee did not have required technical or professional qualifications to investigate such a complicated matter," Mr. Dissanayake said and added that the allegations against the Prime Minister should not and could not be disregarded.
He said they could not rely on the law enforcing agencies set up by Parliament and urged the people to use their power to punish the culprits.
Mr. Dissanayake said the PRECIFAC report had also revealed that billions of rupees had been misappropriated and plundered by the previous government including funds belonging to the ITN, the Avant Garde transaction and the Hedging deal.
He stressed the need to change Sri Lanka's entire political culture, which was engulfed in fraud and corruption and that the political parties which administered this country during the past 70 years had looted public money from time to time. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)

President, Premier will govern Sri Lanka till 2020
	

Dr. Harsha de Silva
Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, in an interview with Daily mirror, responded to remarks made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the status of the economy. He said that the two leaders would continue to govern the country till 2020 or even beyond. 
Excerpts: 
QPresident Maithripala Sirisena spoke about taking control of the economy after the elections. He expressed his displeasure in economic terms over the performance of the Government during the last three years. Your response
We have a vision which is 2025. We have a clear path in moving forward. We stated about this vision because we have an eight-year plan. We have a hurdle called 2020. We will clear the 2020 hurdle. I am looking at 2025. 
QBut, the President, after considering the past performances, is now vowing to take control of the economy. What is your view
That isnt what he means. After he said this, I physically sat with him and spoke with him. What he meant was this. He had slight worries regarding the cost of living. Some local entrepreneurs were leaving Sri Lanka. He wanted them to remain in Sri Lanka and prosper. He wanted more focus on the rural economy. That is agriculture. He told me that he never meant to take over the Ministries administering economic affairs. He only said that everybody should work with the National Economic Council. It is headed by the President with the participation of the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Central Bank Governor, the Ministry Secretary etc. 
There is a Secretary attached to this body. His name is Lalith Samarakoon whom I know very well. I had a meeting with him. He has an academic background.
QBut the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) headed by the Prime Minister has been calling the shots in economic affairs so far
The CCEM looks at policy issues, some complications in the execution of projects. It takes decisions accordingly with the line ministers. I, along with the officials, have fruitful discussions. After that the decisions are referred to the Cabinet. The Cabinet approves these decisions. The CCEM doesnt work outside the Cabinet. 
Mr. Lalith Samarakoon also sits with the CCEM. What he does is represent the Presidents views regarding the CCEM matters, actually not all of

President never intended to take over Ministries
	There is more than an element of truth in what President said about frauds in tea and the pepper re-export business
	Average Cost of Living dropped in January despite various allegations
	Cabinet Committee on Economic Management headed by PM never excluded Presidents views

them. He brings observations from the President. Sarath Rajapathirane, who is the Chief Economic Advisor to the President, is a member of the CCEM. The President nor his office has been excluded from the CCEM. I do not see a huge policy clash . 
QDoes it mean that the President and the Prime Minister would run the Government together till 2020 or even after
Most definitely. There is no issue absolutely. We can become prosperous only if we become a player in the global market. There is no other alternative. What former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at that time did was the exact opposite. He brought down exports from 34 percent to 13 percent. Instead, he should have increased it. The fundamental error in economic policy resulted in the debt issue, pressure on the currency and the inability to move. It happened both during Mrs. Bandaranaikes time and Mr. Rajapaksas. You cant reduce the export component of the economy. 
QThe President, at a recent meeting with head of media, said that state revenue had been siphoned off to private individuals with political connections under this Government. How true is it
I do not know what he meant by it. We didnt have the opportunity to sit and talk. I would like to get more information to understand what he meant. State revenue must come to the Treasury unless there is a fraud. I am fully in agreement with the President that we have to fight corruption. We have to get rid of corruption and frauds. 
QThe President also talked about major rackets in the re-export business of tea and pepper, even sullying the image of such products of Sri Lankan origin under the new Government. What is your response
There is more than element oftruth in it. 
QCan you elaborate on it please
This happened in the trading business of Karunka or dry areca nuts. It happens in the re-export business of pepper, tea etc. Politicians are also involved. I know politicians from all sides. As the President mentioned, some individuals who were involved in corruption and fraud during the previous period, are continuing with their sordid acts. 
That doesnt mean that we should stop the re-export business. I agree with the President when he said there were frauds and the politicians were involved. But, I disagree with the President trying to stop the value added re-export business. You dont throw the baby out with the bathwater. The tea re-export business of blending is a niche market. As far as pepper is concerned, it was pure corruption. India stopped the acceptance of our pepper at its ports. It is the same with areca nuts. Certain officials were basically sidelined by the corrupt politicians. Sri Lanka has been an emporium right throughout. Our cinnamon found its way to Europe before Christ. It was done by our great kings. Parakramabahu the Great was a trader. The Portuguese, the Dutch and the British traded spices with Sri Lanka. We must not allow crooked elements to sully our good name. Those fellows must be taken to task. 
QIf you are aware of such politicians, can you name them
It should be investigated. The President said this. Then, it should be investigated. He said he would not spare anyone. Then, he should investigate it through the CID. 
QHow are you going to contain the cost of living in the wake of another crop failure- the forth in succession
Actually, I want to show you something. That is to show how misinformed some people are. I know that politicians like Basil Rajapaksa and Mahinda Rajapaksa are talking about the cost of living going up. They are either ignorant or deceitful. We had adverse weather situations. From January, the average cost of living has come down. Its not that the inflation came down. Inflation is basically about increasing prices. What is deflation is about prices coming down. We had deflation for the month of January. In January people spent Rs 449 less on food compared to the previous month. In fact, people spent on coconuts Rs.230 less in January when compared to December. Yet, they spent Rs.410 more on non-food items. That is mainly for tuition fees. 
QApart from that, how is your party going to implement the recommendations of the Tilak Marapana Committee on the Central Bank Bond Scam 
It has already been implemented. 
QDoes it mean that Ravi Karunanayake has been asked to step down
He has been told not to undertake any activity as the Assistant Leader of the United National Party (UNP). That is what we learned from the statement of party Secretary Kabir Hashim.

The Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lankan High Commission in London has been suspended after a video, which showed him behaving in an offensive manner, was emerged and circulated on social media.
In a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said today the authorities in Sri Lanka have taken serious note of videos being circulated on social and web-based media of the alleged incident involving the Minister Counsellor (Defence) behaving in an offensive manner.
In this connection, instructions have been sent to Sri Lankas High Commissioner in London on Tuesday to suspend the Minister Counsellor (Defence) from work with immediate effect. Authorities in Sri Lanka including the Sri Lanka Army will initiate inquiries on the incident immediately, it said.
The incident had occurred during a protest held by a group of LTTEsupporters outside the High Commission in London on the Sri Lankas Independence Day.
The protesters demanded information on the missing persons, to release all political prisoners and to close down torture camps.
A video showed Minister Counsellor (Defence) Brigadier Priyankara Fernando, who came out from the High Commission, making a cut-throat gesture towards the protesters. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Ukraine requests Abu Dhabi to return Udayanga
	
Ukraine authorities had reportedly requested the Abu Dhabi authorities to handover former Sri Lankan envoy to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga to Ukraine as he holds Ukrainian citizenship.
Weeratunga who was detained in Dubai on Sunday (4) while in transit to the United States was later transferred to the authorities in Abu Dhabi by the Immigration and Emigration officers as per an INTERPOL warrant issued.
He was accused in a probe into the acquisition of MiG-27 fighter jets from Ukraine, while he was also accused of supplying weapons to anti-Government forces in several countries and was absconding the Sri Lankan authorities using a Sri Lankan Diplomat Passport.
Meanwhile, Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said that a special investigation team was to leave for Abu Dhabi this evening to hold discussions with the Abu Dhabi authorities over the possibility of extraditing the former envoy to Sri Lanka.
The team that is to be sent to Abu Dhabi consists of seven officers including a Financial Crime Investigation (FCID) officer, two senior officers from the Attorney General's Department, an Immigration and Emigration officer, two Criminal Investigation Division (CID) Officers and an official from Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Although reports said that a red warrant had been issued to arrest Mr. Weeratunga, reliable sources told Daily Mirror that only a blue warrant had been approved by the INTERPOL which only permits to collect additional information about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.
However, addressing a public meeting in Galle today, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said Sri Lanka is to request the Abu Dhabi government to return the accused ex-diplomat to Sri Lanka as soon as possible. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Wake up, mum!
	
This is the adorable moment a baby elephant clung to his sedated mother after being rescued from a pit in Zambia
Vets had been forced to knock the mother out as they rescued her calf from a man-made pit in South Luangwa National Park because she was so agitated.
Once the calf had been lifted to safety he ran over to his mother and clung on to her ear with her trunk until she could be revived.
Villagers were alerted to the baby's plight after hearing the mother's cries, and called rescue workers to the scene.
Vets arrived the following day to find both animals very distressed, having been struggling at the pit all night.
As vets were administering drugs to bring the mother around, the calf walked up alongside them and place a tender trunk on her mother's ear. 
Rachel added: 'She got a bit defensive for a minute when we put her down and then decided our vet was helping and wouldn't leave him alone.
'The baby did not mind Dr Sichande administering the antidote in his presence and ended up getting in the way trying to help.
'We reversed the mum with the antidote and as soon as she started to get up the baby suckled immediately.
'She must have been really hungry from all night in the pit. Everyone then happily wondered off.' (Daily Mail)

SLPPs Roshnie De Saram contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward believes that individuals with a professional background should be involved in politics
The Local Government polls are a few days away and contestants are in the process of winning the hearts of people. Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward is Roshnie De Saram under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket. Roshnie is a proud pupil of Visakha Vidyalaya and sports a qualification in Business and Management from Australia. Belonging to a post-independence lineage of politicians, Roshnie has always been interested to serve the less fortunate. If elected, Roshnie has big plans for Colombo and she shared her views about the upcoming polls during an interview with the Daily mirror .
QWhy did you decide to contest this time 
We need to bring the country back to its former state and it is Mahinda Rajapakse who can do that. I initially supported the UNP, but I want to see change happen and therefore I decided to contest for the first time at the upcoming Local Government Elections. 
QThose with professional backgrounds are seldom found in parliament. What are your views on this 
I think its very important that individuals with a professional background are involved in politics. Otherwise this country cannot function with people who have a lower level of education.
QColombo has many issues which were promised to be solved. The low-income households are one aspect. Is it right for politicians to make more promises to these people and in turn do nothing 
They are living under very poor conditions. Their bathrooms and other sanitary facilities need to be upgraded immediately. I think we should give them a hand to uplift their lifestyles. 
QWhat are your plans for Colombo 
If Im elected to office I will make some big changes for the benefit of my people. Some of my plans include building houses for those with special needs, eradicating dengue through efficient smoke treatment, implementing a central hotline system for prompt action to be taken; appoint committees consisting of residents, businessmen, environmentalists and professionals to be the voice of each ward. Im also planning to have a city with an uninterrupted renewable energy system and an efficient health division for regulating food outlets and health services. 
QWomen were virtually neglected in the political scene for a long time. What changes do you like to see happening with the introduction of the 25% quota for women 
I think it is one of the best decisions that was ever taken. Women do a lot of multi-tasking and we understand the requirements of every mother and sister. We need more women to be involved in the decision-making process. Mothers run the homes and their livelihoods need to be improved. 
QHow important is it to implement infrastructure facilities to make the city user-friendly for differently abled people 
It definitely is a major requirement. When I visited the Wadiya I saw a boy who was begging. He was bent so badly and had no mother or father to look after him. They too need to live with dignity. It is important that they are given a proper place to stay in. They could be involved in self-employed businesses such as the incense industry. Their skills and talents such as artwork and handwork could be highlighted as well. So we need to start community centres as means of empowering them.
QPeople expected a change on January 8. Three years down the line what has the present Government achieved 
Nothing is happening today. Businesses could be improved, charity could be done, but we dont see anything happening today. We have done our part to help the people, but they arent even bothered. I have helped people in my capacity, but todays cost of living is so high. What we did for Rs. 75,000 back in the day exceeds the Rs. 100,000 limit today. Therefore its time to make a wise decision. 
QColombo is known to be a UNP stronghold. How will you take up this challenge by contesting from the Pohottuwa 
People say that they are born UNPers. There are educated people making similar statements, but what have they got I think they are only thinking about themselves and not of the rest of the citizens. Why cant we change their mindsets The former President loved the country and had a vision for it. I hope that we will be able to make a change this time. 
Q What is your message to the people 
Dont be selfish. I want to ask people to wake up and vote for what is right. Everyone is dreaming as they are being given big promises. We need to transform Colombo into a sustainable city. In order to do that, people need to be wise in taking their decisions.

UPAs Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward wants montessoris that teach children in Tamil  
The Local Government Elections are four days away and all candidates are gearing up for the big event. Contesting for the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) Karuppiah Ramakrishnan representing the Kirula Ward has a vision to work towards transparency in politics. Having completed his degree in media at the University of Sri Jayawardanapura, Ramakrishnan has over 10 years of work experience as a sports journalist and has contributed to a leading English newspaper in the country. Speaking to the Daily mirror , Ramakrishnan shared his plans for Colombo and its people. 
QWhy did you want to enter politics
For me politics is a volunteer service. I have been involved in Rotaract and other youth activities and have always worked for the community. People join politics to earn more bucks and this is where they go wrong. Our party led by Mano Ganesan has produced two cabinet ministers and one state minister. At the provincial council level we have 16 members. Were a strong party supporting the Tamil population and as a youngster I wanted to be involved in it to make a change. 
QHow challenging is the new electoral system for newcomers
It is very easy to work under the new system. Each representative has to look after his or her particular ward. If the people vote for the correct person he or she will make sure that the people are very well represented. Now they dont have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people. 
QThere are many Tamil people in Colombo. As a minority what major issues do they face
Issues in Colombo are common to all its people. Although we talk about just four lakhs of people in Colombo we need to consider upgrading the infrastructure facilities to benefit people visiting Colombo on a daily basis. The CMC should set an example to the rest of the municipal councils, but there has been very little progress over the past years. Dengue is another issue we need to concentrate on. I dont remember the CMC being represented by a Tamil mayor during the past few decades. I remember that just after we received independence, a Tamil mayor was elected to office for a brief 10 months. Why has it happened that way Therefore theres a nationalist issue here. The CMC has 16 Montessori facilities that accommodate children of low income families. But they are conducted in Sinhala medium and its a challenge for Tamil children. Therefore such issues need to be looked at using a more holistic approach which will benefit everyone. 

Now they dont have to go collecting a higher number of votes from each city to win an entire electorate. Nobody can have his or her own way with this system and that is another positive. We can all work independently for the benefit of the people. 

QWhat are your plans for Colombo
Dengue is one of the major issues. The only solution for dengue is fumigation which is bad for the environment. It not only kills the mosquitoes, but it disrupts the food cycle as well. Therefore its not a practical solution. We need to encourage people to stay clean and make sure that their gardens are properly maintained. That way this issue could be solved. Other countries dont carry out fumigation to control the mosquito issue. If not for the British, the CMC wouldnt even have had a building today. The UNP was in power for 60 years and what have they done 
Another issue is that the CMC introduced an e-Tax Online Payment system. But this system could be extended to other services as well. Therefore technology could be effectively used to make it more efficient. 
Traffic needs to be controlled immediately. If the CMC puts in more thought to control traffic they could use a GPS system to indicate those entering Colombo where there is more traffic. It could be like a digital guide to Colombo showing people where they could find a washroom facility, a caf and other places they would wish to visit. When we walk along Rajakeeya Mawatha, the environment is different to that in Maligawatte. Why couldnt we plant more trees in Colombo People in underserved developments live with minimum facilities. Some even dont have space to pull up a clothing line and instead use a current wire to hang their wet clothes. This is the sad side of Colombo which we as a party will focus on. 
QPeople have the tendency to abstain from voting as they claim that the system is corrupt. What is your message to them
If you exercise your voting rights during this election, you can elect someone who will work for your ward. Therefore people need to vote wisely. When these candidates go canvassing people can always ask for their educational qualifications and professional background, that way people can be sure about their vote. This is not the old system and therefore they do not have to worry. People have the power this time.

Rehan Wijeratne Jayawickreme, contesting under the UNP ticket from the Weligama-Hettiweediya ward is concerned about the drug menace
Many new faces have taken up the challenge to make a change in the upcoming Local Government polls. Representing the late Major Montague Jayawickreme and late minister Ranjan Wijeratne generation is Rehan Wijeratne Jayawickreme who will be contesting under the United National Party (UNP) ticket from the Weligama-Hettiweediya ward. Having studied at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia and the British School of Colombo, Rehan is also armed with a Diploma in Media and Communication at the Deakin University, Melbourne. He later worked as a tea taster and his political background eventually inspired him to step in to politics.Following are excerpts of an interview the Daily mirror did with Jayawickreme during which he shared his plans for Weligama. 
QWhat inspired you to contest this time
Both my granduncles were in politics and I have seen them working ever since I was small. I also think that not many youngsters are involved in politics at a lower level. So I thought I should contest and also encourage many other youngsters as well. 
QWhat are your plans for Weligama
Some of the main issues include the garbage problem. It is a huge issue here. Its piling up and everybody has neglected it. If I am elected I will implement a waste-to-energy project to convert garbage to energy. Also the beaches in Weligama are some of the best you could find in the South. They could be promoted for surfing and other water sports, targeting tourists. I am planning to develop tourism since it is already picking up like in other destinations such as Mirissa. 
QThe beach boys and the drug issue are main problems in the coastal areas. How will you take action to control these issues
The beach boy issue in Weligama is not as bad as that in other areas. Beach boys have now started their own surfing schools and are earning well. But the drug issue is prevailing and I hope to work with law enforcement authorities to put a stop to this menace. 
QHow challenging is the new electoral system for newcomers
This is the first time that our generation is contesting under this system and I see many positives in it. The candidate that is elected is the sole representative for his ward and therefore the individual has a bigger scope. It is less challenging than having to look after an entire electorate. You are only responsible for your ward. 

Our mindset is such that we will definitely win. The corrupt system mainly applies to the main elections. But for this election, people have to use their vote wisely if they want a change. The elected candidate will look after his/her ward. So those who want to see Good Governance should go ahead and vote for the UNP. 
QThe South, especially areas such as Matara and Weligama, is known to be an SLFP voter base. Isnt it a challenge to contest from the UNP
The Pohottuwa list got rejected from the Weligama Urban council. The UNP, despite being not popular in the South, has slowly started to reach the people. During the past regime the UNP didnt have the power to work in this area. So this time I see that more UNPers are interested in voting for the UNP because the Government too is part of the UNP. 
QDuring the time of your granduncles there was much political hatred. How do you see this now and in the future
During their time there was a major JVP insurrection. But now there is technology and the society is more educated. I dont think youngsters would want another war. They believe in education rather than in violence. 
QPeople have less hopes on politics now and the majority has doubts about voting. How confident are you that the UNP will win
So far we have received much feedback. Our mindset is such that we will definitely win. The corrupt system mainly applies to the main elections. But for this election, people have to use their vote wisely if they want a change. The elected candidate will look after his/her ward. So those who want to see Good Governance should go ahead and vote for the UNP.
