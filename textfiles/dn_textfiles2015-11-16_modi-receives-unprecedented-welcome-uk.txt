Modi receives unprecedented welcome in the UK

A new era in Indo-British relations has dawned. No Indian leader, not even the Mahathma or Shri Nehru or Indira Gandhi has received such a grand welcome, it is unprecedented, Prime Minister Modi was even invited by Her Majesty the Queen to a luncheon, an honour normally reserved for a Head of State; it was not so long ago that then Chief Minister of Gujrat, Mr.Modi was blacklisted by them after the killing of Muslims in Gujrat.
British foreign policy
It’s quite an amazing turn around in British attitude, for they have even laid on another unprecedented event, Prime Minister Modi addressed no less than sixty thousand or more British nationals of Indian origin at the Wembly Stadium, at which Prime Minister Cameron and many Ministers of the British government were also present. PM Modi also addressed Parliament. This requires us to speculate as to what the reason could be for this huge change in British attitude towards India.
In this context I must also flag the fact that the Chinese Prime Minister also received an unprecedented welcome when he visited the UK last month. Britain, it is said now has a policy described as a ‘Mercantilist policy’ towards China.
Does it therefore not indicate a major shift in British foreign policy? I presume that Britain’s involvement with the US in Iraq and the findings of the Chilcott Report may have taught them a lesson; that it is better for Britain not to involve itself in foreign adventures, leaving that to the US and perhaps only lending ‘side support’, indicating a retreat by Britain in the area of involvement in the affairs of the world, as was indicated clearly by the British Parliament voting against intervention in Syria. Their main goal therefore seems to be ‘Prosperity’ through economic development and by plugging into the Chinese and Indian economies.
India and Britain have sealed a £9bn worth of commercial deals in the retail, logistics, energy, finance, IT, education and health sectors, which the PM Cameron had said created or safeguarded 1,900 jobs.
According to the joint statement issued at the end of the visit, India and the UK have stated that they stand united against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and support the early finalization of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. “They will continue to work together to disrupt all financial and tactical support for terrorist networks including ISIL, al-Qaeda, This joint statement is to create that umbrella framework under which this kind of a security cooperation can continue.”
Responding to a question at the joint press conference, Modi said, “Both our countries face extreme threat from terrorism, that is why fighting terrorism is not something that just one or two or three countries can do. This is the responsibility of every human… Mahatma Gandhi used to say that you only get justice when you know what injustice is. So, who do we designate as terrorists? Who helps the terrorists? In fact, there is a proposal in the United Nations on this issue, but unfortunately, it is just hanging without any settlement and the UK and we agree that we need to discuss this at length. That is why all well-meaning nations should work together.”
Cameron then said, “India has suffered on the streets of Mumbai… We have suffered on the streets of London, and we have to confront, particularly this Islamist extremist violence and terrorism, which is doing so much damage, not just to our countries but also to the world….”(The monstrous attack in Paris will no doubt bring the Democracies together to end this menace)
‘Make in India’
On Defence Cooperation, the joint statement said that UK and India will “elevate” their Defence relationship by establishing capability partnerships in strategic areas, through which they will work together across the spectrum of doctrine, training and other elements upon which military effectiveness depends.
The two PMs also agreed that their governments would work together to support ‘Make in India’ on indigenous defence projects.
Cyber security also emerged as a priority during the visit. According to the joint statement, the two countries will work together to provide world-class expertise, education and training to their nations’ cyber security professionals. The two countries agreed to expand the UK’s Chevening Cyber Scholarships programme for India and establish a Cyber Security Training Centre of Excellence.
On online child pornography, they said the two sides will work together, in partnership with their nations’ technology industries, on the global ‘We PROTECT’ initiative to combat “online child sexual exploitation”. In this regard, they said the UK will provide advice on the setting up of the new Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre.
So a new era has indeed dawned in Indo-British relations and we need to take cognizance of it and see how best we can plug into this new relationship to ensure the prosperity of our country.
