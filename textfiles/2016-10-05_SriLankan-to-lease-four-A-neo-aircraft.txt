Reorienting SriLankan airlines as a regional carrier as a part of its restructuring process to seek the attention of foreign investors, will entail the leasing of four narrow-bodied short-haul Airbus A320neo aircraft next year, the top management said.

“Yes, we have some orders and deliveries coming next year. These are the aircraft we need, actually. These are good aircraft, very modern aircraft, and they can do sectors like Colombo to Hong Kong non-stop, for example,” SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte said.

Four of the aircraft will be leased from the US-based Air Leasing Corporation, while two will be leased from the world’s largest aircraft leasing company, the Dutch AerCap Holdings N. V.
