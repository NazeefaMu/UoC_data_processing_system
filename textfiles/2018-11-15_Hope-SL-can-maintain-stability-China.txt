Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said this in response to a question asked during the regular press conference held on Wednesday.

“As a traditional friendly neighbour of Sri Lanka, China has been closely following the developments of the situation in Sri Lanka. We hope that Sri Lanka can maintain stability and that all relevant parties in Sri Lanka have the wits and ways needed to deal with the current situation,” she said.
