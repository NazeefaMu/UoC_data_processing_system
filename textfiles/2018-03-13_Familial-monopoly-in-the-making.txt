An elder of a prominent political family in the central province is reportedly pulling wires these days to ensconce a family member in the main chair of a major local body administering a historic city.

 


Three members of this family are already in thick of active politics.


A business tycoon of an enterprise linked to a tale of romance already in the running for the coveted chair is going to be a formidable rival to the member from the political family, they say.
