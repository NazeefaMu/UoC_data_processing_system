The former strongman had occasion to visit Nuwara Eliya the other day to attend a function there. He was to be hosted to lunch at a ‘grand’ hotel in the city. 

 


Soon after the former strongman’s arrival at the hotel, a milky white Lamborghini drew up opposite the hotel. A heavyweight from another main political party who was scouting around at the time spotted the Lamborghini and immediately concluded that it was the former strongman who arrived in the vehicle.  The politico thought that he got a good news story which could create an instant sensation in the country and sent it to several high places along with a few pictures he had taken. However, some interested parties decided to check the owner of the vehicle through the registration number before going to town with the story.  When they found out the real owner of the vehicle, their excitement instantly evaporated and decided to remain mum about it, they say.
