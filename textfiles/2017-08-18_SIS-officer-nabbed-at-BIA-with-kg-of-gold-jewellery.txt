A State Intelligence Services (SIS) officer attached to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) was arrested when attempting to smuggle two kilograms of gold jewellery.

Deputy Customs Director and Spokesman Sunil Jayaratne said the jewellery which was found tied to his knees had a street value of about Rs.1 million.

Airport Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said the suspect had been arrested by the Customs Narcotic Officers following a tip off.

“The suspect said he had received the jewellery from a passenger who had arrived from Singapore requesting that they be taken out of the airport,” Mr. Basnayaka said.

He said the 28-year-old suspect was a resident of Ragama and investigations had been launched to trace the passenger.

Mr. Basnayaka said the SIS officers attached to the airport were allowed to walk around the airport premises without permission.

“I had previously issued a warning to all Customs officers and employees to be on alert of any suspicious activities at the airport premises and that legal action would be taken against any person if found guilty,” Mr. Basnayaka said.

The detection was made by Customs Assistant Superintendents Roshan Cyril, Jude Fernando, Thisara Weerasinghe.

Investigations are being conducted by the Customs Superintendents M.M.P. Rohana, Wasantha Kumara Kobawaka under the supervision of Airport Deputy Customs Directors Dharshana Silva and P.J.B. Basnayake. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
