India interfering in SL’s affairs: Chinese experts


	

Sri Lanka's vow not to allow Chinese military activity in the port of Hambantota is meant to pacify India, but is "unnecessary" since the port has always been meant for civilian use and India is too sensitive over China's presence in the Indian Ocean, Chinese experts have told the Global Times.

Sri Lankan Ambassador to China Karunasena Kodituwakku said in Beijing on Saturday that no Chinese military activity will be allowed in the port of Hambantota.

Sri Lanka's promise is unnecessary because the port is meant for civilian use, and shows that India is interfering in Sri Lanka's affairs, Chu Yin, an associate professor at the University of International Relations, has told the Global Times on Monday.

"The Belt and Road initiative always focuses on civilian projects to help developing countries, and China respects these countries' security concerns when pushing infrastructure development," Chu said.

He added that "since India remains preoccupied with China's presence in the region, Sri Lanka has to repeatedly pacify its neighbor even when this is aimed at promoting Sri Lanka's economic development."

"China has no intention to offend India, and the program is good for Sri Lanka's economic development. But if India has a problem with the program and oppresses its neighbor, it only shows that it is interfering in other countries' domestic affairs," Chu said.

Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times that "Sri Lanka initially wanted India to help develop Hambantota port, but it finally turned to China for help since India faces financial difficulties and concerns over future competition with its own ports in the Indian Ocean."
