Gammanpila has contract with UNP to divide SLFP - Minister

We will never allow anyone to divide the SLFP. Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila has undertaken a contract with the UNP to divide the SLFP,” Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He said Gammanpila has recently stated in a radio interview that the SLFP should be divided with the aim of defeating the UNP. But, I must say to him that if the SLFP is divided, the UNP will win," Minister de Silva added.
The minister was addressing the media at the Information Department yesterday.
"The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will assist in the process of drafting a new Constitution as there is no mismatching with the process," the minister said.
"The SLFP received positive feedback from the United National Party(UNP) in connection with drafting of the new Constitution. Under this, nine proposals forwarded by the SLFP were accepted by the UNP," he said.
"Accordingly, the SLFP will assist in the formation of the basic structure for Constitutional Reforms and appointment of the Constitutional Committee," he said.
He added that people should not panic in this regard as the new Constitution has not been prepared yet. "But, certain persons in the opposition are trying to arouse people by leveling baseless allegations that the new Constitution creates severe issues on various sectors, including the country's unitary status or the priority accorded to Buddhism. The people, who level those baseless allegations, are trying to make political gain.“It is clear that certain persons want to divide the SLFP for achieving their political objectives.
Minister de Silvapraised President Maithripala Sirisena for the measures taken to protect the SLFP.
However, he added that there are two opinions in the party. Speaking on the FCID, Minister de Silva said that the SLFP is against the FCID since its establishment is against the general practice of the country. "Therefore, the FCID should be dissolved," he said.
“But it doesn’t mean that the investigations should be discontinued. Investigations should be carried out as usual through other established institutions such as the CID, Police and other such bodies” he said.
Speaking on the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa, he said that the SLFP has no argument with the conducting of probes in to financial malpractices. But, those investigations should be balanced and should not have double standards.
The minister added that a new Attorney General will be appointed soon which would further strengthen the judicial system.
“However, we are against the appointment of an outsider to the post of Attorney General. Moreover there should not be any disputes between the Police and the judiciary system,” he said.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner will visit the country on Saturday 6.
When the minister was asked whether the issue of the country will be taken up at the Geneva General Session in March, he said that probably the progress of protecting human rights in the country will be considered in March.
Minister Samarasinghe added there was much foreign mediation during the regime of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
“During the regime of Rajapaksa, a former Attorney General of India and 12 other members visited the country together with Darusman, who prepared the much talked about Darusman report.
Besides, two foreign judges came to the country to assist the Paranagama Commission during the Rajapaksa period.
A team from the Scotland Yard Police also visited the country to conduct investigations into the Raviraj assassination,” he said. "However, the minister added that there is nothing wrong in obtaining the assistance of foreign experts. The latest technology and methodologies are available with certain foreign experts and therefore the assistance of such experts can be obtained to the country as technical assistance," he said.
Reginald Cooray said that only the President can win the hearts of minorities. “The SLFP did not receive the votes of minority communities. Only President Sirisena can obtain the minority votes,” he said.
