Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today rejected reports of an alleged incident that had taken place during a parent-teacher meeting at the Madina Central College in Madawala, a national school in Kandy as being racially motivated.

Reports circulating in websites and social media claimed that the parents of the school are demanding that only Muslim teachers be appointed to the school.

When contacted by Daily Mirror, the minister dismissed the claims but said that there was an issue about the school. “I’m not aware as to the details of the issue and have to contact the additional secretary for further information,” he said.

Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers' Union Secretary Joseph Stalin also denied the reports but said a tense situation had arisen during a parent-teacher meeting of the grade-11 class Tuesday.

“The parents have complained to the ministry against the School Principal. During the parent-teacher meeting, a Sinhalese teacher had reportedly defended the Principal and that was when the tense situation arose. Some parents had brought eggs and tomatoes to be thrown at the Principal,” he said.

Our reporter said seven parents had been arrested by the Wattegama Police after eggs were thrown at the Principal and that they were released after being produced in the Theldeniya Magistrate’s Court on Friday.

Ceylon Teachers' Services Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe also said that there was a complaint against the Principal by the parents over allegations of financial misappropriation and administration issues. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
