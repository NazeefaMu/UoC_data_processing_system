SL Govt. lacks commitment to women’s rights issues: HRW


	

The Sri Lankan government delegation seemed incapable or unwilling to address any issues of substance regarding women’s rights including discriminatory marriage laws, land and livelihood concerns, and strengthening laws that protect women, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) charged today.

Issuing a statement, it said the delegation fell back on platitudinous responses that existing laws were sufficient to meet the government’s obligations and that constitutional amendments now under consideration will address other issues.

“Of particular concern was the delegation’s inability to answer questions related to the role women will play in current efforts to seek truth, justice, and reconciliation for the widespread human rights abuses committed during Sri Lanka’s civil war,” it said.

The HRW said Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva Ravinatha Aryasinha responded to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) when it became clear that the committee wasn’t about to let the delegation off the hook.

“But instead of providing direct answers, he delivered a preview of Sri Lanka’s presentation to the Human Rights Council during its 34th session, which began this Monday,” it said.

It said the government betrays a lack of commitment to women’s rights issues by sending a delegation to the CEDAW Committee unprepared to answer obvious questions,

“Governments and human rights activists watching Sri Lanka over the next few weeks during its review at the Human Rights Council would do well to remember Sri Lanka’s appalling performance before the CEDAW Committee. No one at the council should let Sri Lanka dodge critical questions a second time around,” it said.
