In Monaragala’s remote Buttala village Buddhists revere Fr. Michael Rodrigo as a saint because of what he did for them and with them. Today, Fr. Michael’s 30th death anniversary, Buttala Buddhists will hold a similar ceremony to honour this religious figure. 

Human life, deeply rooted in God, nobly lived with a clear vision and depth of wisdom, with critical awareness and holistic understanding of the socio- economic- political reality, with unshaken conviction and selfless commitment, with undaunted courage and energetic zeal, totally immersed in the rough and tough life of the poor and down-trodden, such a noble life dedicated to the cause of humanity, founded on Kingdom values and attitudes, can never be snuffed out ad lib by the bullet of an assassin!   
On 10th November 1987 at 7.30 p.m, a shot was fired in Buttala! The physical life of Fr. Mike was brutally terminated! Thirty years have passed since that shockingly dark evening! And yet, Fr. Mike lives on with even greater vitality, vibrancy and fecundity in the minds and hearts, thoughts and sentiments, lives and spirit of those who knew him, of those who had heard him, of those who continued to be inspired by him. Fr. Mike’s vision of the Kingdom of the poor rooted in the heart of the Paschal Mystery; his message to the world on Justice and Truth and the equality of all persons including the most vulnerable and marginalized, his eco- friendly outlook on Nature and Mother Earth, continues to ring out loud and clear even in today’s context. Despite the years that have passed, the spirit of Fr. Mike, the strength and power of his life, the fragrance of his commitment, the nobility of his message of justice and truth, compassion and equality, continue to inspire our nation and all peoples! Thus he truly lives on. His spirit lives on today with so many of us, simple folks or highly intellectual stalwarts, or even spiritual giants!   
Let us listen to a couple of them.   

 

Bishop Vianney Fernando, a couple of days after the demise of Fr. Mike, had this to say:    “I knew Fr. Mike from the time I was a young seminarian. Having just returned after his doctoral studies from abroad he was assigned to teach psychology at the National Seminary. I happened to be among the first group of seminarians he taught. We loved his lectures. He was an excellent teacher. He was an intense person in whatever he did…. After the liturgical renewal launched by Vatican II, Fr. Mike spearheaded in Sri Lanka the implementation of the Conciliar reforms in liturgy. He responded with vigor and zest to the need of the day as he perceived it.
When my predecessor Bishop Leo Nanayakakra took over the newly carved out Diocese of Uva, Fr. Mike followed him. A new awareness was coming upon him. Preferential option for the poor began to be recognized as an integral part of the task of evangelization. Fr. Mike once again responded with zest and zeal, enthusiasm and profound faith. He opted out from his teaching career to be with the poor. He decided to enter into a dialogue of life with the poor peasants.
He opted to be with them to support them in their struggles. Above all he understood the deepest meaning of his ministerial priesthood as taking on the “SERVANTHOOD OF THE KINGDOM”, following his Master and Saviour Jesus Christ. When threatened by forces that militate against such an option he carried on undaunted. And so finally he was brutally murdered. But the cause for which he died, the cause of God’s poor, lives on. It will be impossible to kill the “Spirit” that inspired Fr. Mike….. his spirit will live on, not only in his beloved people of Buttala, but as an inspiration to spur on thousands of others to opt courageously for the poor and the oppressed. (“He who opted for the poor”, Justice Vol.2, No 5-6, National Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace).   

 

“I am Maduri , a Buddhist from Buttala, who still holds as precious the life and message of Fr. Mike. A simple, humble and genuine Catholic priest, Fr. Mike inspired our whole village to all that was just and true, noble and humane, good and compassionate! Seeing him, speaking to him, and listening to his very rich and rare thoughts and sentiments communicated so graciously, we began to realize what God must be like, since we believed that Fr. Mike was a man of God who reflected by his very being, something of the Divine. Fr. Mike was a man of compassion and kindness, accepting the poor with such dignity and respect, without any discrimination or distinction, appreciating all that we were in our poverty and lowliness, drinking from a coconut shell if and when offered, seated on a mat or on our mud floor with such facility and ease, always making us feel great while he made himself small! Later we came to know that Jesus was also like Fr. Mike, or, was it that Fr. Mike was like Jesus!
He is now no more! 30 years have passed since that fatal day, and yet we feel he is with us, inspiring us to think maturely and wisely, serving others with selfless love, reaching out to the most distressed and oppressed ones in society, to be a concerned, caring and sharing people, to care for Mother Earth and preserve her from destruction and degradation, to shun violence and promote lasting peace with justice, and to think critically of the prevailing socio-economic-political reality of the country. He initiated a process of friendly dialogue and co-existence at Inter-faith level, which continues to inspire us to this very day.
Thank you Fr. Mike, for bringing light and life to us and to our families, nay to our whole village! As you have enlightened and inspired us thus far, may your spirit continue to live on among us. I salute you with deep respect and gratitude ! (Maduri).

 



	Caring and sharing people, to care for Mother Earth and preserve her from destruction and degradation
	
	
	When the prevailing current keeps on pushing us towards profit-making, almost drowning us in its din, we sense the presence of Fr. Mike’s spirit
	
	
	As all martyrs do, he has allowed the manner of his death to project a large picture of his life that was until then hidden from the rest of the country
	


 

Bonnie and Rose Galhena , fromTudella have this to say: “Fr. Mike is very much remembered by us, not merely because our Montessori, blessed by him, is named ‘St. Michael’s Montessori’, but mainly because of the vision and missionary thrust he shared with us so simply and genuinely, right from its inception. Throughout the early stages of our struggle to get started , Fr. Mike was a tower of strength and a beacon of light for us, animating, motivating and energizing us to shun the prevailing social current of greed for prestige, wealth and power, and instead, to be gospel-oriented along the path of justice and truth, while building God’s Kingdom through our Child-Development venture. While maintaining quality education in the line of Dr. Maria Montessori, we have imbibed the spirit of Fr. Mike who inspired us at every moment to be child-friendly, moving away from competition and profit-seeking, while upholding the dignity and rights of every child without any discrimination or distinction. The under-privileged child has an equal place in St, Michael’s Montessori, be it at work or at play, or at the display of their potentialities and talents. At every turn of decision-making, when the prevailing current keeps on pushing us towards profit-making, almost drowning us in its din, we sense the presence of Fr. Mike’s spirit, which is the spirit of Jesus, prompting us, above all else to keep our vision and missionary thrust in its proper perspective, always geared towards Kingdom Values of the worth and dignity of all God’s children!! This gospel spirit has spread during the past years among the staff, as well as among the parents of the children of St.Michael’s Montessori, thanks to Fr. Mike.
The theme song of St. Michael’s Montessori, MITHURANI, SATHURANI, was composed by Fr. Mike, and we sing it during important occasions to this day. The spirit of Fr. Mike is very vibrant and alive among us ! He truly lives on!

 

Fr. AloyPeiris, S.J. in the Foreword to “JOURNEY FOR JUSTICE”, by Nandani Gunawardena, launched on November 6 at the Centre for Society and Religion, says : “Fr. Mike was a true follower of his meek and humble Master.Not clinging to his prestige in the academe or his family status, he climbed down the social ladder to share the life-struggle of the politically victimized and economically exploited peasants, and paid a heavy price for it with his precious life….having become obedient unto death …. ; but God exalted him as a martyr to justice, inspiring a number of clerical and lay groups to start new gospel-based movements for ensuring religious harmony and social justice. He did not die in vain …. As all martyrs do, he has allowed the manner of his death to project a large picture of his life that was until then hidden from the rest of the country and which was marked by a fearless fidelity to the gospel… Yes, very much like his Master…. he has risen in the hearts of so many that no one can muffle his voice now.”
