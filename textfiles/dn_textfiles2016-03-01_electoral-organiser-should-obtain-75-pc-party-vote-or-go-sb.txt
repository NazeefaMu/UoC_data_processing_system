Electoral organiser should obtain 75 pc of party vote or go - SB

 
An electoral organiser who cannot garner at least 75 per cent of the votes cast for the party from their electorate should vacate their electorates, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
The minister who was appointed as the new SLFP electoral organiser for Hewaheta said that he was happy to leave his former electorate Udunuwara as he could not fulfill this requirement at the last general election.
Dissanayake said that he was only able to get 10,000 votes out of 20,000 votes cast for the SLFP at the Udunuwara electorate. In contrast, Dissanayake said he had obtained 99.9 per cent of votes cast for the party when he was Hanguranketha electorate organiser.
The minister also recalled that during his tenure as the SLFP General Secretary, he was instrumental in bringing a regulation that party organisers who cannot garner 75 per cent of votes cast for the party from their electorate should resign.
Dissanayake said that as a politician who hails from Udunuwara, he was confident of gaining the upper hand for his party at future elections from the electorate.
