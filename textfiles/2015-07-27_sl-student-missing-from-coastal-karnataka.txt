	A Sri Lankan student, who was studying hotel management course at a renowned college in Moodbidri town in coastal Karnataka was reported missing from her hostel. The college management has lodged a complaint with the Moodbidri police stating that the student, Sattambiralage Don Nimnatarushi Sebastian, was found missing from her hostel room.
	Apparently, she had complained to her college management about facilities in the hostel on July 17. On July 25, the 26-year-old lady went missing from her hostel. According to the police, Sebastian left the hostel in the morning as usual but did not attend the class. Upon examining the CCTV footage of the hostel and the neighborhood, it was found out that Sebastian was headed in the direction of Mangaluru (Mangalore), another coastal city.
	The police have instructed the college management to inform Sebastian's parents about their daughter having left the hostel without informing her warden or classmates. The coastal districts of Udupi and Mangaluru have emerged as educational hubs for students from Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asian nations. (India Today)
