Making it difficult for foreign-funded venture


	



 

A Malaysian investor who wanted to start a big business venture here went through all procedural formalities, put in place the necessary infrastructure, installed the required machinery and was about to go into production when a high political authority put a spoke in the wheel. 

 


When asked what other requirement the businessman had to meet to go ahead with the venture, the political authority had informed the investor that he (the latter) had failed so far to earn his ‘pleasure’. 
However, the investor was not prepared to offer any gratification to the high political authority. He put his foot down saying that he would pack up everything and go back home rather than meet the political authority’s ‘pleasure’ demand. 


However, Number One who heard about the ‘pleasure’ demand quickly intervened to give the green light to the investor. 


However, the political authority is not prepared to concede defeat, give up the hunt and let the quarry alone. On the contrary, he is said to be playing every trick in his bag to harass the investor, they say.
