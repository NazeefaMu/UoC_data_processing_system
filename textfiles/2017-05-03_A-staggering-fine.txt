A staggering ‘fine’


	



 

The party leadership had imposed a ‘heavy fine’ on several senior purohitas: Rs.5 million each as their share towards the party’s May Day expenses. 

 


The other purohitas too had been asked to pay a ‘fine’, but it is an amount they could easily afford, they say.


So the unhappy seniors had gone into a hush-hush several times to discuss how they could raise enough dough to meet the ‘fine’, they say.
