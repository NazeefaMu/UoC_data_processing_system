US quits UNHRC over ‘anti-Israel bias’


	

The US has pulled out of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) calling its anti-Israel and a “cesspool of political bias,” the BBC reported.

US envoy to the UN Nikki Haley has said the "hypocritical and self-serving" body "makes a mockery of human rights."

Ms Haley last year accused the council of "chronic anti-Israel bias" and said the US was reviewing its membership.

Ms Haley announced the US's intention to quit the council at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who called the council "a poor defender of human rights".

UN Secretary-General António Guterres, in a statement released through his spokesman, responded by saying he would have "much preferred" the US to remain in the council.

The UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, called the US withdrawal "disappointing, if not really surprising, news". Israel, meanwhile, has praised the decision.

Formed in 2006, the Geneva-based council has been criticised for allowing countries with questionable human rights records to be members.
