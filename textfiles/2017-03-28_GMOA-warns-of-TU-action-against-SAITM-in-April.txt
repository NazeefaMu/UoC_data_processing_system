The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has warned it would launch a countrywide trade union action next month April against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

GMOA spokesman Nalinda Herath told the media several unions had pledged their support to the GMOA in its effort to safeguard the country’s healthcare services.

“We met more than 100 unions and most of them are of the view that the SAITM issue should be resolved sooner than later,” he said and added that the details of the TU action would not be revealed just yet.

Dr. Herath said some of the ministers too supported them in their fight against SAITM.

“Minister Champika Ranawaka recently revealed the other side of SAITM in Parliament assured us he will take this matter up,” he said and added that many are of the view that Attorney General the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister were responsible for this dilemma.
