Pakistan clinched their maiden ICC Champion Trophy beating India by a massive 180-run margin in the final a short while ago at The Oval.

After being put in to bat, Pakistan put up 338 for four on the board buoyed by opener Fakhar Zaman's maiden international century and fifties from Azhar Ali and Mohammad Hafeez. Mohammad Amir then tore in to India's top-order claiming three for 16 as India were bundled out for 158 in 30.3 overs. (The Times of India)
