Megapolis and western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka today made a request to President Maithripala Sirisena to establish a Sinhala and Tamil medium National School with all facilities at the heart of Colombo.

Attending a ceremony to publicize the ‘Laksetha Sewana’ housing complex he said a population around 0.2 million resides in the Colombo Central and even though many schools are located in the Colombo city, these residents are unable to enroll their children to a school in the close vicinity.

He also said that he believe the President would fulfill his request on a priority basis.

“We believe that the president will implement our request as the ministry of education is carrying out a programme to provide at least one National School per electorate these days. We have agreed to build knowledge based economy, as such we should create an environment to improve the quality of education in par with international standards.” he said.
