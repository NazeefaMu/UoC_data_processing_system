Southland MP urges NZ govt. not to deport SL family


	

A New Zealand Parliamentarian has written to the country’s Immigration Minister urging him to allow a Sri Lankan family whose visa has not been renewed to stay in the country, the Newstalk ZB today reported.

The Wijerathne family, three boys and mum Dinesha and dad Sam, have lived here for nearly eight years.

Dinesha held an essential work visa to work as a chef in Queenstown, but it was not renewed because she developed Multiple Sclerosis - and cannot work full time. They are now facing a deportation date of November 21.

Clutha Southland MP Hamish Walker has appealed to the Immigration Minister on the family's behalf.

He asked in the letter to the Minister that any matters around deportation are put on hold and a temporary work visa be issued to Sam so he can financially support the family while they are here.

"I want this family to be able to stay in NZ. They have contributed a huge amount over the last eight years, so I want to do everything I can to fight for this family, it is why I have written to the Minister of Immigration."

Baskets of Blessing director Tam Schurmann set up a Givealittle page for the family, which has raised more than $14,000 dollars.

She is calling for compassion from the Immigration Department.

"This is not a family who came to New Zealand and is taking advantage. This is not a family who has asked for handouts. It is a situation that could happen to anybody."
