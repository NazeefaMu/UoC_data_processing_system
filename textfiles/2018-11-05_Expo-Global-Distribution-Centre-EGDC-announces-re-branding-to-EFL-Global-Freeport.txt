Driving further consolidation of its end-to-end supply chain solutions, EFL (Expolanka Freight) announced a rebranding of its Freeport operations under the new moniker: ‘EFL Global Freeport (Pvt) Ltd’. 

Representing the first private sector enterprise to be granted a license to operate as a Freeport in Sri Lanka, the Freeport’s recent rebranding flows from a continuous effort to maintain brand consistency across the company’s global footprint of 18 countries and optimize its reach with the right mix of local and international clients capable of elevating Sri Lanka’s position as a global logistics hub in the South Asian region.

The company’s Japanese strategic partners, SG Holdings Group’s Chairman, Eiichi Kuriwada and EFL Founder and President Mr. Hanif Yusoof did the honors at a special ceremony held to mark this important milestone in the organization’s increasingly prosperous journey. In addition, Chairman of Expolanka Holdings PLC Naosuke Kawasaki and other Senior Personnel alongside representative from SG Holdings attended this function.

Mr. Hanif Yusoof stated that, “Sri Lanka remains one of the most uniquely and advantageously positioned countries in the world with regards to the logistics trade. Located just 12 nautical miles away from the world’s busiest shipping route, we believe that there remains substantial untapped potential for our nation to act as a facilitator for global trade.

With our rebranding as the EFL Freeport, we aim to convey a simple message to our local and international clientele: namely, that Sri Lanka is open for business. By offering a complete suite of services to simplify supply chain complexities within a cost and time efficient manner, we are confident that the newly rebranded EFL Freeport will serve as a catalyst for exponential growth in the logistics industry for years to come.” 

Despite the significant rebranding, the company’s composition and strategy of personalized solutions will remain unchanged with the Freeport continuing to offer a wide range of international logistics services and value addition activities to both local BOI companies and foreign customers.
