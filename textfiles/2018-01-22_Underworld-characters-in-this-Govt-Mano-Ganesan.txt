National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said today there were those involved in underworld criminal activities and drug trafficking in this government.

He said those elements would not be allowed to scuttle the forward march of this government.

“We are ready to give tuition to all the parties including the United National Party (UNP) and the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) on reconciliation. We can then stake a claim to this government. If somebody calls this a UNP or SLFP government, it will be a foolish remark. We all played a role in installing this government,” he said.
