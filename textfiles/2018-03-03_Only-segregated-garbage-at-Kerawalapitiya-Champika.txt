Dumping unsegregated garbage at Kerawalapitiya garbage dumping site has been banned from February 28, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.

Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) had conveyed this decision to all local government bodies.

The minister said though the SLLRDC Chairman had conveyed this decision the relevant authorities in writing, some LG bodies are continuing to dump unsegregated garbage at Kerawalapitiya.

He said the entire administration of the Kerawalapitiya garbage dump had been handed over to SLLRDC from February 28 and under no circumstances would unsegregated garbage be accepted as of this date.

However, the minister said they would accept any amount of segregated and degradable garbage at this site.

He said President Maithripala Sirisena and the Cabinet had been informed of this decision. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
