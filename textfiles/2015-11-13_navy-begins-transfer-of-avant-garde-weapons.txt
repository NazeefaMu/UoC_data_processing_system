The Navy would take all the weapons belonging to the Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt.) Limited to its possession commencing today, Navy Spokesman Captain Akram Alavi said.
He said the move comes after the decision of President Maithripala Sirisena to hand over the operations of the Avant Garde to the Sri Lanka Navy.
“At the moment, the weapons are being brought to SLNS Dakshina at the Galle Harbour. The process may take a couple of days to complete,” he said.
