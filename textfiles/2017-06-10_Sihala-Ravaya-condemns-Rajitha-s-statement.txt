Sinhala Ravaya General Secretary Magalkande Sudaththa Thera yesterday condemned the statement made by Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne that BBS General Secretary Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera was being protected by a minister.

The minister said on Wednesday that a warrant had been issued for the arrest of Gnanasara Thera on charges of inciting racial and religious hatred but that it was difficult to arrest him because he was being protected by a minister.

“Minister Senaratne is making ambiguous statements without exposing the truth. He has not exposed the truth behind the Althugama clash,” the Thera said. “We request the IGP to record statements from the minister as to who assaulted Muslims and set fire to their shops and who was behind these incidents.

“We express our displeasure over Minister Senaratne for making such irresponsible statements as a Cabinet spokesman. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
