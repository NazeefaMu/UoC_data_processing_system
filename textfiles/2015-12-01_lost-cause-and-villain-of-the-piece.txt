These Betel leaf stalwarts were engrossed in a serious discussion in the Diyawanna council lobby the other day. “You can’t even imagine winning a poll without him to lead the campaign!” a member from the Colombo area told his colleagues.
“But, going by the new developments, getting his active involvement any longer looks like a dim prospect,” a member from Galle area vouchsafed. “Why?” the others asked in unison. “Because the former boss has already decided to step aside to make way for the new boss to run the show!” he replied.  
 
“Why can’t we make a try to bring the two together? After all, they are old friends. In politics, we all have to let bygones be bygones!”  This suggestion came from a member from Wayamba well known for his political match-making skills. “There was a time when we could have brought them together,” the member from the Colombo area replied. “But it is too late now. The letter circulated among the party members on the eve of the former lokka’s birthday put paid to all chances for reconciliation.”
“Who was really behind that warning letter, machang?” another Betel leaf senior asked.
“It was that Rajarata man who messed up the affair,” said the member from the Colombo area, but he did not name him.
