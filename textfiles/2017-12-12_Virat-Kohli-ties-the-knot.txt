Indian cricketer Virat Kohli and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma on Monday officially announced their marriage.

News of the impending wedding started doing rounds when Kohli pulled out of India's limited-overs matches against Sri Lanka and Anushka also ducked out of her busy acting schedule in December.

Kohli and Anushka, both 29, started dating in 2013 after they met during the filming of a shampoo advert. (Khaleej Times)
