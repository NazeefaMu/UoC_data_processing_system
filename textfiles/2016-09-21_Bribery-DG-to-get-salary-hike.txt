Parliament today adopted a resolution providing for a special salary scale and other allowances for Bribery Commission's Director General A.A.P. Dilrukshi Dias Wickramasinghe to be paid effective from February, last year.

The Cabinet approval has been given for this motion. It was taken up in the House today with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe moving it. The motion says that her monthly salary scale is placed on par with that of the Additional Solicitor General, a post she held previously before assuming duties in the new position. Alongside, she is entitled to the telephone and fuel allowances on par with rates designated for the Ministry Secretaries.

The salary hike and other allowances, announced in the motion, have been affected from February 12, 2015.(Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
