Mansion is in limelight again


	



 

This billionaire business tycoon has been in the limelight ever since news broke out that he offered his mansion on a platter to a one-time powerful politician. 

 


Now reports say that he has sought permission from the Speaker to put up extensions to his much publicized mansion.


 This mansion is located in close proximity to the Parliamentary complex  and  owners of buildings  situated within a radius of one kilometre from the complex are required for security reasons to obtain permission from Parliamentary authorities before making  any structural change to their buildings.

 Meanwhile, another report says that the billionaire businessman has already obtained the permission he had sought.
