About 100 missing after boat sinks off Libyan coast
	
About 100 migrant passengers are missing in the Mediterranean Sea after their boat sank off the coast of Libya.
The Italian coastguard, which is conducting a search, said eight bodies had been recovered from the water, and four people had been rescued.
But dozens were still believed missing after darkness fell, in difficult search conditions.
The boat sank between Libya and Italy, about 30 miles (50km) from the Libyan coast.
A French naval ship, two trade vessels, and aerial support are involved in the search.
It is unclear what the nationalities of the migrants involved are.
The number of migrants travelling to Europe by land have dropped since the height of the migrant crisis in late 2015, but sea crossings remain both popular and dangerous.
On Friday, the Italian coast guard rescued about 550 migrants making the journey across the Mediterranean.
Doctors Without Borders, which was involved in the rescue, said that in once case it found 123 people crammed on to a single inflatable dinghy.
More than 1,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea in the first two weeks of 2017, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) estimates. Before this incident, it estimated 11 people had died or were missing.
In 2016, the UNHCR said 5,000 people died trying to reach Europe by Mediterranean routes - the highest number yet.
The agency said the increase was due, in part, to human traffickers loading more people on to each craft, many of which were not suitable for the crossing attempt.(BBC)

Cut use of ACs
	
President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to issue a circular requiring the government offices to reduce the usage of air conditioners in the wake of the prevailing dry spell that may cause a power crisis as well, a Deputy Minister said today.
Deputy Minister of Energy Ajith P. Perera told a media briefing that a circular would be issued by the President to limit the usage of air conditioners and to reduce the temperature only up to 26 degrees centigrade on the air conditioners.
He said more energy had to be used when air conditioners were used to reduce the temperature of a building to as low as 22, 21 or 20 degrees centigrade.
He said State owned power stations had decided to use water sparingly as the levels in the reservoirs were decreasing fast.
Hydro power accounts to only 36 percent of the countrys electricity generation, but we have decided to use water sparingly given the present weather conditions, he said.
We expect to carry on without power cuts till March this year as inter-monsoon rains are expected around that time. However, a decision has to be made if the inter-monsoonal rains do not come as expected, the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister said there would not be an issue in the long term with the decision to go for solar power, while a major liquid gas (LNG) power plant would be constructed in Kerawalapitiya in the near future.

Lottery dealers to boycott sales for five days
	
All Island Lottery Dealers Association (AILDA) would boycott selling lottery tickets for five days from tomorrow (16) as their demands were not met as promised by the President, the Daily Mirror learns.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake also strongly maintains that the new price of Rs.30 would not be changed at any cost.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the government was not in a position to fulfill these demands and the prices or the commissions that they anticipate to be amended would remain unchanged at all circumstances.
However, the association President Krishan Marambe said the government had not yet responded to their demands as promised.
The lottery ticket dealers protested since the latter part of last year over the price increase which was proposed in the budget 2017.
This came in the wake of the Finance Ministry decision to amend the lottery ticket price to be increased from Rs. 20 to Rs.30 with effect from January 01.
However, the lottery ticket dealers demonstrated against the price hike demanding that their livelihood would get affected if their commissions were reduced as a result of the price hike.
The protest which lasted over one week was called off on January 5 following an assurance given by President Maithripala Sirisena that he would immediately look in to the matter.
We called off our protest due to the promise made by the President that he would personally look into the matter. We cant sell tickets at the new price. Our sales have come down by 40 percent. We cannot trust the government or the Lottery Board any further. So, we would boycott till 20 January.
This is our livelihood. We had given enough time to solve the matter. It is not fair to risk our sales to cover the boards (NLB and DLB) expenses. Boards are earning millions of profits over our sweat and blood. In return what is left for us It is Just our day-to-day income. Now the Board is robbing even that, Krishan said.
Commenting on the issue National Development Boards Chairperson Shyamila Perera told the Daily Mirror that she wasnt aware about the protest and somehow the Board had given an appointment today to speak on the matter with few members of the Sellers Association.
Im not aware about this protest. We had received 530 new applications for dealerships and out of that we recruited 280. Therefore we are totally prepared for this and we dont expect a huge impact on the Boards sales as a result of their protest, she said.
Development Lottery Board also had appointed 10 vehicles in the lottery distribution process within the Colombo and suburb areas avoiding a drop in sales, an official said.
Through the discussions we had with the people and the sellers, we have learnt that the sales had affected to some extent as most of the people have reduced the number of lottery tickets they purchase, she said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
