Sources from the Prime Minister's office told the Daily Mirror that Mr. Wickremesinghe would hand over the reports to President Maithripala Sirisena when he returns to the country after attending the G7 summit in Japan.

He had also ordered the Navy and the Chief Minister to refrain from giving statements to the media till the President decided on some action. (Yohan Perera)
