The insurance arm of the LOLC group is actively promoting health and wellness amongst its staff as well as amongst the public. Both LOLC Life Assurance and LOLC General Insurance joined hands to organise ‘Walk for health 2018’, which commenced from the LOLC Insurance head office premises located at No. 481, T.B. Jaya Mawatha (Darley Road), Colombo 10. 


The walk proceeded towards the Nelum Pokuna Theatre and concluded by returning to the head office. The two entities stepped into the new year with the Walk for Health campaign and throughout the walk displayed key health tips to encourage and promote healthy living. 


“Healthy living is not just about losing weight. It’s a combination of good nutrition, regular exercise and having a positive mental attitude. As a responsible corporate citizen, we, at LOLC Insurance, felt the need to encourage our staff as well as the public to lead healthy lifestyles,” said LOLC Insurance COO Nilanga Wickramasinghe.




Wickramasinghe added, “Today, physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, causing an estimated 3.2 million deaths globally. Sitting for long periods at work can cause numerous health implications such as increased risk for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and even cancer. This is why we have come to the forefront to promote healthy lifestyles because it ensures a healthy workforce, a healthy workplace and ultimately a healthy society.” 


LOLC Insurance Walk for Health 2018 concluded with a health camp for staff, offering free eye check-ups conducted by Vision Care and health check-ups by Browns Hospitals. Free of charge instructions on different types of workouts as well as introduction to Yoga and Zumba were also provided at the health camp.


Furthermore, the staff members were given the opportunity to discover and experience a range of spa treatments by expert therapists at the Siddhalepa Spa. The health camp also consisted of various healthy food stalls to encourage and educate the staff on consuming healthy food.
