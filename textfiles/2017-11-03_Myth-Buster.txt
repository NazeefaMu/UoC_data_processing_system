MYTH: There’s nothing you can do to prevent vision loss 

BUSTED:  “This depends on the cause of the vision loss. If there is a trauma or injury then they can’t prevent it. There are some people who become blind due to cataract, glaucoma, vitamin A deficiency, diabetes, retractive errors. These can be prevented. Then there are congenital problems which can’t be prevented due to age and the maturity of the sight,” said Dr.M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
