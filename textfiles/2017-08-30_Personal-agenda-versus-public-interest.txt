Personal agenda versus public interest


	



 

Practically all opposition political parties are vehemently opposed to postponing the local and provincial polls.

 


However, there is a leader of a minor political party playing a major role in the council who while overtly clamoring for early polls is covertly trying his best to get the polls further postponed.


This party leader had secretly appealed to a very high authority in yahapalanaya to postpone at least provincial polls for some time.


He wants to have the provincial polls postponed to buy time to undermine the political clout and the popularity of a certain provincial chief who has become a thorn in his side, they say.
