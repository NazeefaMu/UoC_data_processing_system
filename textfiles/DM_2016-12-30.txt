Four CPC officials held captive by IOC
	
Four officials, including a deputy manager, of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), who had gone on an observation tour of four oil tanks belonging to the CPC in China Bay, had been held captive by officials of the Indian Oil Company (IOC). They had been locked up for about one hour.
The deputy operations manager of the corporation Menaka Jeewasiri, Assistant Engineer K. P Easwaran and two security officers, who had accompanied them, had been held captive by the IOC officials.
Sources said that four of the oil tanks at the tank farm in China Bay had been handed over to the CPC with the approval of the Cabinet, and these officers had examined them for the purpose of further development.
During their tour, the officers had been subjected to this treatment, said Ajith Dharmapriya, the media coordinator of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. The two vehicles the officers had come in had also been held by the IOC officials.
Dharmapriya said that the officers had later lodged a complaint with the China Bay Police concerning the incident.
The chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said that they had informed the Ministry Secretary of the incident and further action would be taken.
Meanwhile, the China Bay Police said that Chiththam Raju, the senior vice chairman of the Indian Oil Company had complained to the police that officers of the CPC had trespassed on their company property.
In his complaint, Mr. Chiththam Raju had that that the officials had been given permission to enter the area only on one particular day -- namely December 28th -- but the officials had come on the 29th. He had said there was a bilateral agreement and no one was allowed to enter the site without the permission of higher officials.
Further investigations are being conducted by the OIC of the China Bay Police Station, P. Kumaradasa. (Mahinda Nissanka and Amadoru Amarajeewa)

Looming power shortage: CEB seeks purchase of power for 6 months
	
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is to urgently lease purchase power at a cost of nearly Rs. 35 per unit for the next six months on an emergency basis at a total cost of Rs. 8 billion, the Daily Mirror learns.
The CEB has sought the approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to lease purchase a 65 MWs of power for six months considering the prevailing power situation in the country.
However, an energy expert told the Daily Mirror that the CEB should first attempt to purchase additional power from local power providers and the paying Rs. 35 per unit for lease purchase was extremely costly and would further burden the CEB compelling it to a tariff revision in mid 2017.
The CEB is still in the reds and not paid back its loans fully. Therefore, the power purchase at this price is not advisable, he stressed.
The CEB is of the view that a possible power shortage during the first half of next year could be avoided only by urgently purchasing power if the situation is allowed to he continued further.
The CEB has informed the PUCSL that the CEB Board had decided to introduce a Self-Generation Scheme for Bulk Customers as a means of slowing the drawdown of hydro reservoirs and has proposed as a solution to lease purchase power through international open tenders from December 05, 2016 to until April 30, 2017.
To be eligible, the Bulk Supply Customers shall have a Generator capacity of 100 kWh or above.
The customers shall generate at least 2000 units of kWh per month or 20% of their total monthly consumption.
The offered purchase rate (rebate) for a unit (kWh) is Rs 36.00 during Day Time (5.30 am to 6.30 pm and Night Peak from 6.30 pm to 10.30 pm.
The offered rate of Rs 36.00 is calculated based on the average Fuel, Operation & Maintenance Cost of a Diesel Generator at the current price of Diesel of Rs 31.50 and an additional incentive of Rs. 4.50 which is equal to the incentive offered in the past.
Your concurrence is required at earliest to implement the proposed scheme which would have an impact on the revenue requirement of distribution licensees.
Procumbent of 60 MWs of supplementary power is the only option available to the CEB to meet the demand under the current dry spell experienced in the count following the failure of two consecutive monsoonal rains and second inter monsoonal rain. Hydro reservoir storage has depleted to critical level. The total storage now stands at 480 GWh and it is the lowest recorded in this time of the year compared to last 25 year, the CEB has said.
Present Hydro Storage as at December stood at Castlereigh 57.6%, Maussakele - 46.4%, Kotmale  42.8%, Victoria - 24.8%, Randenigala 60.8% and Samanalawewa 27.2% with the total contribution of hydro power to the national grid at around 25%.
The total system inflow has dropped to around 2 to 3 GWh during this month resulting in hydro energy storage to continuously deplete. If this dry spell continues then the inflow will further reduce in the future. It is also to be noted that recorded minimum inflows were received in this year during the months of September, October, November and December compared to last two years.
This will result in starting storage to be lower in the beginning of 2017 leading to a serious power supply situation in next six months until the onset of South-West Monsoon in May 2017. The demand for electricity will also increase due to higher temperature in the country due to continuing dry spell, further aggravating the situation.
Under the above circumstances, the CEB is planning to Procure 60 MW of Supplementary Power for 6 months to meet the demand due to current dry spell experienced in the country.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

Minister rejects Jayasuriyas resignation
	
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera yesterday intervened to defuse growing tension between National Cricket Selectors and the Cricket Board after Chairman of Selectors Sanath Jayasuriya tendered his resignation citing interference.
Jayasuriya who had reportedly forwarded his resignation to the Minister of Sports on Wednesday (21) met the Minister of Sports last morning to air his grievances before the man who appointed him and his committee in April.
Minister Jayasekera when contacted confirmed the meeting with the legendary cricketer in his office last morning contrary to Sanath Jayasuriya who denied meeting the minister or sending his resignation in.
Yes I met him yesterday, minister said. He had few concerns which I will sort them out soon.
Minister admitted that Jayasuriyas main concern was the alleged interference on selection by some members of the cricket Executive Committee.
Another grievance is Sri Lanka Crickets (SLC) decision not to send a selector on tour, a practice which Jayasuriya enjoyed during his previous term in office.
There had been some interference or attempts by various individuals in the Executive Committee to interfere in the selection process. I will discuss this with the President and sort this out, he added.
When contacted Jayasuriya he bluntly denied the story. No I did not give (resignation), he said. When asked whether he met the minister he said No, but I am waiting to meet him.
Jayasuriya took over as Chief Selector once more, little over a year after he stepped down from the role, replacing an ad-hoc committee led by Aravinda de Silva in April this year.
De Silva took charge after the Cricket Board unceremoniously sacked the committee headed by Kapila Wijegunawardane, just hours before the Sri Lanka Teams tour to the ICC T20 World Cup in March.
Wijegunawardanes committee refused to make changes to the squad named for the World T20 Tournament.

Obama expels 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for US election hacking
	
The Obama Administration yesterday announced its retaliation for Russian efforts to interfere with the US presidential election, ordering sweeping new sanctions that included the expulsion of 35 Russians, the Guardian reported today.
US intelligence services believe Russia ordered cyber-attacks on the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Hillary Clintons campaign and other political organizations, in an attempt to influence the election in favor of the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
In a statement issued two weeks after the president said he would respond to cyber-attacks by Moscow at a time and place of our choosing, Obama said Americans should be alarmed by Russias actions and pledged further action.
I have issued an executive order that provides additional authority for responding to certain cyber activity that seeks to interfere with or undermine our election processes and institutions, or those of our allies or partners, Obama said in the statement, released while he was vacationing with his family in Hawaii.
Using this new authority, I have sanctioned nine entities and individuals: the GRU and the FSB, two Russian intelligence services; four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRUs cyber operations.
In addition, the secretary of the treasury is designating two Russian individuals for using cyber-enabled means to cause misappropriation of funds and personal identifying information. He also announced the closure of two Russian compounds in the US.
