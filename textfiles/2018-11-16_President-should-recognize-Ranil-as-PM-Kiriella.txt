United National Party (UNP) MP Lakshman Kiriella said today President Maithripala Sirisena should recognize UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister because the no-confidence motion against the fake government was once again passed in Parliament today.

He told Daily Mirror that the motion was declared passed on a voice vote and as such the government had ceased to function.

Mr. Kiriella said Mr. Wickremesinghe commands sufficient support in the House.  (Kelum Bandara)
