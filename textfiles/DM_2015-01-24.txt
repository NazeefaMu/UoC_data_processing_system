Military training for principals to stop
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariwasasm today said a circular will be issued within the next few days that would call-off the controversial leadership training programs that were held for Principals in military camps.
We are presently in the process of preparing the circular and in order for the program to be cancelled it has to be authorized by the President. We will be carrying out the necessary processes within the next few weeks, he added.
Principals were given leadership training in military camps under the previous government where following the two-week program, they were awarded military titles. Over 4000 Principals received military titles through this program and it came under heavy criticism by education sector professionals who pointed out it results in a heavy militarization of the education sector. A principal also died while partaking in a training program in 2013. (Lakna Paranamanna )
