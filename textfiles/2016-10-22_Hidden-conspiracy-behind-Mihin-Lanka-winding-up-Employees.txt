Hidden conspiracy behind Mihin Lanka winding up: Employees


	

While claiming an alleged hidden conspiracy behind the government’s decision to wind up the budget airline Mihin Lanka, a group of employees of the airline yesterday stressed that their job security be ensured.

Speaking at a media briefing at Public Library, Colombo, yesterday Mihin Lanka purser and Secretary of the newly-formed Trade Union Ms. Primali Kumaranayake said the airline management had not officially informed them about the future of the airline and its staff.

The airline, which has announced the discontinuation of its flights and services from October 30, 2016 would still exist till March 31, 2017, the management had reportedly told the staff.

However, 90% of the 300 airline staff, including both the permanent and the contract cadres are losing their jobs with effect from January 1, 2017, while only 10% have already been offered jobs at the Sri Lankan Airlines, Ms. Kumaranayake said.

“Around 270 Mihin Lanka staff members have been subjected to grave injustice despite their service, professional achievements and seniority for more than nine years. Even though the management had informed about the merging of our flights and services with Sri Lankan, they have not mentioned anything about our future. The compensation they later agreed to pay us is unfair and inadequate,” she said.

Another Mihin Lanka purser and Convener of the trade union Ms. Shaheeka Shaheed said there is no valid and fair reason for the government to close the budget airline which was starting to gain profits on its own and has not even been declared bankrupt.

According to her, Sri Lankan Airlines had already taken over 4 aircraft and 12 destinations of Mihin. She said they were earlier told by the management that they would be recruited to the National Carrier and assured their jobs would not be in danger during the transition. (Piyumi Fonseka)
