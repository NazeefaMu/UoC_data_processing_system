Cabinet rescinds age limit on trishaw drivers


	

The Cabinet is reported to have today rescinded the gazette notice that barred those below 35 years from obtaining three-wheeler driving licenses.

Although the Transport Ministry had issued a gazette notice on the minimum age to drive three-wheelers, the Cabinet was of the opinion that there should not be a bar on any age group. It was revealed that some 550,000 people below the age of 35 were engaged in this driving trishaws as a means of self-employment and as such should be allowed to carry out their work without any hindrance.
