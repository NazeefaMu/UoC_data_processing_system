Parliament will be closed for sessions in the third week of October due to refurbishment of the buildings, informed sources said yesterday.

Informed sources said the sessions will not be held during the third week in October due to refurbishment of the buildings, including the setting up of a new IT system and the restoration of electronic voting system among others.

The sessions are usually held during the first week and the third week, but in October this year, the sessions will be held during the first and the last week because of repairs.

According to sources, plans are afoot to use the electronic voting system for the budget this year.
However Parliamentary sources did not divulge the cost of the repairs. (Yohan Perera)
