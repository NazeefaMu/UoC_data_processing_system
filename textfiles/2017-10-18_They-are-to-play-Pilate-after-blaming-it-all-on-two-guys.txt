They are to play Pilate after blaming it all on two guys


	



 

Yahapalanaya is planning to wash its hands off the stinking treasury bond scam by staging the act of giving walking papers to two fall guys.

 


One guy is a top advisor of the government who held high office some time ago. The other one is a secretarial one of a key Ministry considered a finance wizard, who is now on a service extension which is due to expire come December.  The sin attributed to the duo is sitting on a committee initially appointed to probe the bond scam. 


Some senior purohitas had pointed out that the yahapalanaya got tainted with the bond scam because of these two white collar ones. The twosome will be replaced by new appointees shortly, they predict.
