In the aftermath of the Cabinet reshuffle, the government is now moving to replace some ministry secretaries, it is learnt.

The government replaced nine Cabinet portfolios, and eight state and deputy ministry posts on two occasions.

Political sources said some ministry secretaries would also be replaced soon. However, it is learnt that there will be no change in the secretarial posts in the Finance and Foreign Ministries.

A new secretary is also likely to be appointed to the Mahaweli Development Ministry assigned to Minister Mahinda Amaraweera. (Kelum Bandara)
