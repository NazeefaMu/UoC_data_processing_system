Making a killing: A typical case


	



 

A secretarial one at an assisting level of a key Ministry has offered his charming daughter a job in a state-run body coming under the purview of this Ministry. The daughter’s beau too has been appointed to a top executive post in the body. 

 


No specific duties have been assigned to the secretarial one’s daughter and she is enjoying a virtual holiday at the institution, they say.


The high-ups of this state-run body have made it a practice to send urgent letters for signature to the secretarial one through the charming daughter as her doting father would readily sign them. 


Although this secretarial one is not a member of the director board of this state-run body, he has made it a practice to attend the regular board meetings solely for the purpose of claiming an allowance of Rs.11,600 for attending such a meeting, employees say.
