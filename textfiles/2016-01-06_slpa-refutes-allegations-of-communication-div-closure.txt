The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) today denied allegations that a decision was taken to seal the head office of the authority’s Communications and Public Relations Division.
In a media statement, the Ports Authority said investigations had been initiated by the Presidential investigation commission over corruption and fraud that allegedly took place during the process of filling water into the Hambantota Port during Phase II of the project.
The details of the project were handed over to the Presidential Investigation Commission by the Ports and Shipping Ministry Secretary on the instructions of PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille De Silva, the statement said. The report had been handed over to a committee headed by SLPA Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga.
Earlier today, the Ports Trade Union had threatened to take action against Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, following his decision to seal the Authority’s Communications and Public Relations Division head office, stating that the Minister would not be allowed to play ‘cricket’ at the SLPA.
The union believed the closure was due to the fact that the chairman of the division was also the Chairman of the ‘Janasathu Sewa Cricket Union’.  (Chaturanga Pradeep)
