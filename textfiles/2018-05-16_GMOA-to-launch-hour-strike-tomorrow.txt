Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) would be on a countrywide 24-hour token strike tomorrow against the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed with Singapore and the proposed ETCA with India, GMOA Secretary Dr Haritha Aluthge said today.

He said, however, the emergency treatment units, maternity, children, cancer, nephrology and Army hospitals would function as usual despite the token strike.

He said the GMOA was forced to take this decision in the absence of a positive response from the authorities including President Maithripala Sirisena to their request. He also said the token strike would begin at 8.00 a.m. at all the Government Hospitals.

“We have earlier written to President Sirisena informing this issue. We are still waiting for a response from him. The authorities should not enter into or implement such agreements in an arbitrary manner without setting up a National Policy on International Trade Agreements,” he said.

He said the FTA recently signed with Singapore was detrimental to the country and it would create an open space for foreign countries to invade Sri Lanka's job market.

He said the FTA had not included a termination date and exit clause and such an agreement was disadvantageous to the country.

“The authorities concerned had signed this FTA without presenting it to Parliament,” he said.

“Sri Lanka and India are to hold the next round of official level talks on the proposed ETCA from May 23. We are against it since it is also detrimental to the country,” he said.

Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr Naveen De Soyza said Subject Minister Malik Samarawickrama should be held responsible for this issue and added that he should immediately resign from his post or else he should be removed.

He said the GMOA membership had been informed to not to engage in private practices during the token strike. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
