Historical moment saw him fast asleep


	



 

The Radical Red party leader made an interesting revelation at an election rally in Rajarata the other day.

 


The revelation was about how a Betel party senior in yahapalanaya slept all his cares away while an important Bill was being passed into law. 


It was the day of the last sitting for the debate on the bill on the new election system. This senior often found snoozing during the Diyawanna sessions was in a deep slumber at the time the vote on the Bill was taken. And none had thought it important to waken him either.


By the time, this senior woke up, the Bill had already been put to vote and passed and all party leaders were leaving the chamber, the Red leader recalled.
