Host Bangladesh stuns defending champion SA

Host Bangladesh gave the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2016 a momentous start with a 43-run victory over defending champion South Africa in Wednesday’s opening Group A match played at Chittagong yesterday.
In a Group C fixture at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong, Dan Lawrence and Jack Burnham hit centuries as title contender England brushed aside Fiji by 299 runs.
Bangladesh, which elected to bat on a slow pitch was restricted to 240 for seven in its 50 overs. Nazmul Hossain hit 73 off 82 balls to boost the total after useful contributions from Pinak Ghosh (43) and Joyraz Sheik (46).
The target proved too tough for South Africa, which was bowled out for 197 in the penultimate over despite a defiant 100 from opener Liam Smith.
Meanwhile, England piled up 371 for three in its 50 overs against Fiji, with Essex’s Lawrence smashing 174 off 150 balls with 25 fours and a six, and Burnham of Durham making 148 off 137 balls with 19 fours and four sixes.
The pair put on 303 for the second wicket after opener Max Holden had been dismissed in the third over. Fiji were bowled out for 72 in only 27.3 overs.
