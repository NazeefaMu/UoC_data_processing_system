Didn’t they go by the book?


	



 

The second in command in yahapalanaya recently ordered the reversal of a transaction carried out by the country’s oldest state-owned bank.

 


The order had been issued following a complaint that the deal had not been carried out adhering to the stipulated rules and regulations.  


Worried that the deal with foreign funds had been clinched at a time the government was under fire from the opposition for selling government assets one after another, the second in command had reprimanded some purohitas handling affairs related to banks and had even pulled up the head of the bourse as well, they say.


Some maintain that the big guns at the management level in the bank should take the rap for the transaction.


Meanwhile, some others assert that misinformation provided by an affluent political son- in- law in yahapalanaya is responsible for turning the transaction into a serious issue.  However, confusion over the issue is expected to clear up soon, they say.
