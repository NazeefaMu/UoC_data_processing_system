A fair and lovely one who contested the recent mini-poll in an area where a kingdom once flourished had suffered defeat. However, a leading politico had intervened to offer her a ‘list seat’ to the chagrin of the other candidates including a woman candidate who made legitimate claims to the slots on the list, they say.
