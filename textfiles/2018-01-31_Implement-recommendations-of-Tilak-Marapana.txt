Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reportedly told his Cabinet Ministers that he would implement the recommendations of the Tilak Marapana committee on the bond scam.

It is learnt that the Committee has recommended that MP Ravi Karunanayake should step down from his post as the Assistant Leader of the party and refrain from national political activities on behalf of the party.

The Prime Minister informed this to the Cabinet Ministers representing the UNP.

He convened them for a meeting at Temple Trees yesterday.

However, it is learnt that Mr. Karunanayake is refusing to adhere to the request by the party hierarchy. (Kelum Bandara)
