A certain Deputy Minister who had been sidelined by both his party leader and the Cabinet Minister had finally launched a development programme titled ‘Blue Economy’ on his own to prove his mettle. 

 


Now that his programme is making fast headway, several Ministers too are reportedly seeking official nod to secure active participation in implementing it. This has caused much chagrin to the Deputy Minister who wanted to organise this programme as his own show, they say.
