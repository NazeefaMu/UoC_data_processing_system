Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, who investigated the Central Bank bond scam along with others, had been sidelined from initiating legal action based on recommendations by the Presidential Commission regarding the fraud, sources said.

Despite him being the senior-most-official in the Criminal Division of the Attorney General’s Department, he had not been assigned to the task of proceeding with legal action as recommended by the Commission in its report, the source said.

Instead, Additional Solicitor General Murdu Fernando, who is attached to the Civil Division, has been assigned to it.

Alongside, President’s Counsel Yasantha Kodagoda and Priyantha Napana and others who played a major role in the investigation of the bond scam through the Presidential Commission, have been sidelined from instituting legal action against the frauds mentioned in the report, the source said.
