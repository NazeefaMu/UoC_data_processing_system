Failure to uncover the culprits behind the shooting at SAITM CEO Samira Senaratne will obviously mean that the government has had a hand in it, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday.

Mr. Dissanayake raised this question while blaming the government for its failure to uncover those who were behind the incident.

He questioned about the progress of the investigation on the incident. Also he requested the government to reveal the details that have been found so far.

Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella who responded said Minister of Law and Order Sagala Ratnayake will make a statement on the incident today. (Yohan Perera)
