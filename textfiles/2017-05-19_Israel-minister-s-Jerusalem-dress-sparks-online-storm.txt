JERUSALEM AFP May18, 2017-Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev triggered a social media storm on Thursday after she attended the Cannes film festival in an evening dress featuring a Jerusalem Islamic shrine.   

Several tweets altered what one called the “provocative” garment which shows a panorama of the walled Old City in Israeli-occupied east Jerusalem, including the Dome of the Rock, located in the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound.   


The site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, is sacred to both Muslims and Jews and a regular scene of friction between them.   


It is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.
