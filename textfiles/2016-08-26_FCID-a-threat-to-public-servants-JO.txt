FCID a threat to public servants: JO


	

The Financial Crimes Investigations Unit (FCID) has become a threat to the private sector and to public servants, the joint opposition said today.

JO MP Bandula Gunawardena said some public servants had tendered their resignation out of fear of being questioned by the FCID and urged the government to reinstate them without delay. "The people will not be able to get anything done from the State sector if these public servants leave," he said.

MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the hunting of private sector employees by the FCID was a disturbing trend and pointed out that one of those it had questioned was employed in the public sector on an honorary basis.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge in his response said investigations would be carried out on wrongdoers. "What have these public servants done? They have been distributing state funds to the people during the Uva Provincial Council election," he said.

The Prime Minister said the public servants who had resigned could not be reinstated. "These public servants have resigned on their own and we cannot drag them back and reinstate them," he said.

Referring to the allegation made by Dinesh Gunawardane, the Prime Minister said the private sector worker which the MPs referred to was a friend of his as well. "He is my friend as well but he has been questioned on a court order. The questioning was not done on the orders of the government," he said. (Yohan Perera)
