Forty-five years on, Aloy Jayawardene being a Roman Catholic, heeded the request of sculptor Ven. Dr. Mapalagama Vipulasara Thera to brass cast a Buddha Statue to be placed at the Viharamahadevi Park in 1972 to commemorate the Republic Day of Sri Lanka. He presented a replica of it to President Maithripala Sirisena at his office to commemorate the 45th anniversary of its installation. The brass cast 15-foot statue which is the largest brass cast Samadhi Buddha Statue in Sri Lanka sits at the entrance to the Viharamahadevi Park.   

The priest created a mould in concrete and 58 pieces of same were given to Mr. Jayawardene to do the brass casting. The method to do this was by wax casting which Mr. Jayawardene studied prior to its production. A distinguished gathering at the unveiling of the Statue included President William Gopallawa and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Subsequently, Mr. Jayawardene was selected for the Leaders Invitation Programme of the Government of Japan in October 1972. This programme was offered to Mr. Jayawardene by the Prime Minister for having undertaken to do the Buddha Statue, being a Catholic. 

Mr. Jayawardene, President Emeritus of Sri Lanka Chamber of Small and Medium Industries, says the Late Venerable Dr. Mapalagama Vipulasara Thera was extremely proud of him because he did a great job being a Roman Catholic.
