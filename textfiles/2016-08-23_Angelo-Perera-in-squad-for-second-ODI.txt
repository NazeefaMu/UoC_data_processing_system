Sri Lanka have made one change to the squad for tomorrow’s second One Day International against Australia with Angelo Perera coming in for injured fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep, captain Angelo Mathews said today.


Mathews also said that the final was not decided as yet, but that a few changes may be likely.


“We have still not decided on the batting line-up for tomorrow, but there is a good chance that Angelo Perera and Seekuge Prasanna will feature in the team tomorrow,” Mathews said. “We have not made a final decision yet.”


“If we take these conditions into consideration, there isn’t much assistance for fast bowlers. Our strength is our spinners. That is how we planned for the Test Series and we will go with the same plan for this game,” Mathews also said.  


Coach Graham Ford reiterated that a final decision on personnel had not been taken yet, and that they would look at the pitch tomorrow before making naming the final XI.


Discussing Sunday’s defeat Ford saidl, ”Australia played some good cricket. The pitch was a tough pitch and felt that scraping our way to 227 was quite a good effort. Chandimal played really well and young Mendis played extremely well. We weren’t at our best with the ball, and weren’t our best on the field. Sometimes you need a few things to go your way as well. [I] Thought Australia bowled really well on that surface and finding runs wasn’t easy. [It was a] Tough game and that’s expected from the best team in the world.”
