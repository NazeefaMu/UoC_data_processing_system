While the commission was conducting its duties yesterday, with evidence being recorded from the Director of the IT Department of the CBSL Wasantha Kumara Alwis, former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran was advised not to use his mobile phone inside the premises by Supreme Court Justice Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, who is the President of the Commission.

Justice Chitrasiri had told Counsel appearing on behalf of the former Governor that he had observed Mr. Mahendran using his mobile phone inside the premises while the proceedings were on and instructed him to tell his client to refrain from doing so as it was against policy.

The former governor was allowed to be present to listen to the proceedings. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
