Western Provincial Councilor Hirunika Premachandra said that she would not remain in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) if former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was given nominations to contest from the party.
She said she would make a decision on her SLFP membership today.
“All the things we have spoken of during the previous presidential council election would become false if Mr. Rajapaksa was allowed to contest from SLFP.  Therefore, I will not remain in the SLFP if he was given nominations and will contest from another party,” she said.
