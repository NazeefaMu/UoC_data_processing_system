Sri Lanka Club in Bahrain celebrates anniversary

The "Sri Lanka Club-Bahrain", celebrated the 37th Anniversary in Manama, at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, consisting of over 300 Sri Lankans domiciled in Bahrain and non-Sri Lankans.
The Sri Lanka Club-Bahrain is the only registered Sri Lankan Association in Bahrain consisting of well over 400 members, mostly professionals, employed in corporates and financial institutions in Bahrain.
The key objectives of the Sri Lanka Club-Bahrain are to organize, coordinate and execute projects, functions and cultural events, thus promoting and enhancing the image and profile of Sri Lanka not only to the expatriate Sri Lankans domiciled in Bahrain but also to the non-Sri Lankan populace of Bahrain.
The Club is often described as "United One Sri Lankan Community" living in the Pearl of the Arabian Sea, thus functioning as a microcosm of the United Sri Lanka.
The Chief Guest of the 37th year Anniversary Celebrations was Dr. A. Saj U. Mendis, the newly appointed Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Bahrain.
The President of the Club, Mohamed Muneer, in his opening remarks commended the Government of Bahrain as well as the members of the Club for their unstinting and tenacious support, cooperation, facilitation and assistance extended in order to make the Club highly effervescent, diverse and seminal, particularly, to the expatriate Sri Lankan community.
Dr. Mendis, in his keynote address, said that this was the most fitting and most opportune occasion for Sri Lankan expatriates domiciled in Bahrain to consider committing investments and economic activity in Sri Lanka as well as to work in Sri Lanka.
