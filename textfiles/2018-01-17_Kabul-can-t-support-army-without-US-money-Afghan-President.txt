Afghanistan, (rt.com), - Without American assistance, Kabul can’t fight the many militant groups active in the country after 16 years of US involvement. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says the national army won’t last longer than six months on its own.  

 

American taxpayers, who contribute around 90 percent of Afghanistan’s defence budget, are bankrolling a war against terrorists in the county, which the government would not be able to continue without the US funding, Ghani told CBS News on Sunday.  


“We will not be able to support our army for six months without US support and US capabilities… Because we don’t have the money,” Ghani said.  


Saying that at least “21 international terrorist groups” are operating in his country, Ghani warned that “terrorists can strike at any time... We are under siege,” Ghani told the ‘60 Minutes’ program. ”  


This continues the 16-year incursion that has seen over 2,000 US servicemen lose their lives and over $700 billion spent on military assistance, lined with repeated promises of a soon-to-come victory from three successive US presidential administrations
