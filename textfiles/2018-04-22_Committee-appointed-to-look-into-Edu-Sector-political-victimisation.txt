A three-member investigation committee had been appointed by the Ministry of Public Administration and Management to look into the possibilities of providing relief to about 1, 000 education sector employees, who faced political victimisation during the recent past.

Sources said that following a meeting held on Friday (20), the committee headed by the Prime Minister’s Coordinating Advisor for Public and Trade Unions Jinasena Dadallage and two officials of the Education Ministry was appointed to the task.

When contacted Mr. Dadallage said the committee was set up to revise the decision taken at the previous committees in this regard.

He said two committees had been set up for the task earlier.

According to the measures, the employees would receive promotions, compensations or salary increments.

Mr. Dadallage also said that according to the reports that a vast majority Government workers in the education sector had faced most political victimisation.

Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily Mirror, Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) General Secretary Joseph Stalin said the move could be a violation of the Service Minute of the Education Sector.

He said they had filed a Fundamental Rights Petition last year under SCFR 164/2016 at the Supreme Court when the Government made its first attempt to grant relief to 2,400 education sector employees.

He said the Supreme Court, considering the FR, halted the move.

Mr. Stalin said the move was a violation of all three, the Education, Principal and Teachers’ Service and the Government was attempting to favour its supporters.

He also urged the Government to withdraw the committee appointed immediately or it would resort to stern trade union action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
