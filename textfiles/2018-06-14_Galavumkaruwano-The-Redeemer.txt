Kamal Dias, a parishioner of St. Michael’s Church, Koralawella, received an invitation from the then Parish Priest, Rev. Fr. Leo Camillus to direct a ‘Passion Play’ for the parishioners. Accordingly, he directed his first drama titled ‘Last Supper’ in 2012, which was staged at parish premises. In the following year 2013, at the request of Rev. Fr. Eric Madurawela he directed ‘The Redeemer’.

Whole of 2014, Kamal devotes his time to study and do a research on ‘passion plays’.‘Passion Plays’ of Rev. Fr. Jacome Gonsalvez, Duwa, Boralessa and ‘Oberamagu’ in Germany gives him the required insights. Further he was fortunate enough to receive some books written by Prof. Vijitha Rohana of Kelaniya University on this subject. Subsequently the dramatist becomes very enthusiastic in giving the hidden reality of the passion of Jesus Christ; His sacrificial role of bringing salvation to a fallen humanity.   

By 2015 Kamal succeeds in directing a comprehensive ‘passion play’. Promptly he receives he receives full patronage of Rev. Fr. Shihan Indika Perera, present Parish Priest. Another committed parishioner, Roshan Fernando very generously undertakes the production and management. From then onwards Kamal, with the blessings of the Almighty God directs 4 dramas (2015 – 2018). Script writing, music, recording, sound management and direction are solely by this dramatist. Gradually the hidden talents of this artiste begin to unfold.  

Passion play titled, ‘Galawumkaruwano’in 2015 highlights the conversion of St. Paul. Sacred touch of the Lord converts the Roman officer, Saul who persecuted the Jewish Christians to Paul the Missionary. The main theme of this drama confirms the fact that Lord is able to transform anyone according to His Holy Will for His service. Protagonist’s high standard of acting portrays the message to the society in a powerful way. Galavumkaruwano in 2016 brings to the forefront the character of Barabbas and his change. Character of the thief on the right hand side is also special. The remarkable feature of this drama is how great a sinner is if he repents and turns to the Lord, he will be pardoned by unconditional love and forgiveness of Jesus. This is a call to the audience to repent and practice the noble quality of forgiveness, as done by the Master Himself.   

In 2017, drama takes a different turn as a beautiful presentation. Six young maidens depict the wind (Sulanga). Main theme is, ‘Do not let the Word of God be swept away by the wind’. It also shows the obstacles people have to face to encounter Jesus. E.gs. Leader of the Jewish Council, preventing Jairus from meeting Jesus, temptations of Jesus, where satan takes great effort to prevent Jesus from carrying out Father’s Will and His mission. It is difficult to obey the commands of the Lord, but if you do, reward is yours (Peter casting the net and getting a big catch of fish). This drama gives the message to the modern society, which runs a rat race to attain wealth, power and positions. It clearly shows the futility of these efforts. Obeying God’s word and living a life adopting Kingdom values is the key for peace and happiness. This is a comprehensive beautiful drama with rich lyrics and dances.  

In 2018, Galavumkaruwano the dramatist introduces two fictitious characters, Gamael and Eliyas. Ancient Jewish society, with a superiority complex treats Samaritans in a degrading manner. They were humiliated and rejected. As a defensive combat Gamael, the Samaritan forms a group to fight against Jews. But the Lord Almighty completely changes this plan. While training this group Gamael, gets struck with leprosy. According to the Jewish custom he goes to the ‘leprosy colony’ (ostracized). There he meets Elias,the friendly Jew. While associating with him, his hatred towards Jews diminishes. He sees people of various situations, rich and poor, educated and illiterate, just and unjust, Jews and Samaritans, all living in harmony sharing what they get. They expect only ‘Divine Healing’ for their sins. He also learns about Jesus the Jewish Healer, develops a thirst to meet Jesus. After meeting Jesus and receiving healing he gets a desire to share the peace, joy, healing and his marvelous transformation with others and becomes a missionary.   

Life style of ancient Jewish leaders has a parallel to our modern society and political leaders. At that time hypocritical Jewish religious leaders, burdened the citizens with taxes and hard rules. All these were for their benefit and gain. If we turn the search light to present day happenings, it is very much similar. Dramatist in a subtle way opens the eyes of the audience to the fact that, exploitation of helpless is a great sin.   

According to Kamal all the actors and actresses from 2012 to 2018 are from Koralawella itself. For each drama about 50 of them participate. Also he gets the support of another 80 parishioners during practices and staging the plays. Training period is 2 ½ months. Attendance has been 95% late in the evenings (after work and after school). For all this, he is very grateful to all who co-operated with him. It is with great delight he stated that during drama practices people of different ages and levels of society were bonded in a spirit of brotherhood and commitment, which brought himself satisfaction. He believes that the touch of the Lord Almighty and the guidance of the Holy Spirit which were there throughout made these things a possibility. Therefore his praises and thanks to the Holy Trinity and St. Michael will be there forever. Thus ended our conversation.
