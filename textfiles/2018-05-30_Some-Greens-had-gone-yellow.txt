Some Greens had gone yellow


	



 

The Green backbenchers had, the other day, rendezvoused to take a vital decision.

 


Of over 20 invitees, only eight members had turned up at the tryst. And each of them had made the full use of this forum to give vent to their woes resulting from the step motherly treatment meted out to them by the party leadership. 


Finally, all eight members had reached a consensus to function as an independent group in the council. 


Then a member hailing from the Badulla district had said: “Well, that’s a good idea. Let us hand over a letter to the leadership stating our decision and the reasons that led us to reach this decision.”


So, one of them had drafted a letter on the lines all agreed to and had sent it round for their signatures.


When this letter returned after going a full round, the sender had found   that it carried only two signatures.  One signatory was the Badulla district member who initiated the move and the other was a young member from the gem-rich district.


Livid about the shameless let-down by his colleagues, the Badulla member had torn up the letter into several pieces and vowed not to have anything with the “spineless creatures” in future!
