A special nocturnal zone would be opened at the Dehiwala National Zoological Gardens for three days from 22, September, Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said yesterday.

The zoo will be opened on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 7.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. Entrance fee for adults is Rs. 200 and for children Rs.100.

“The opening event will take place tomorrow under the patronage of Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera and the participation of several Ministers, ambassadors and Ministry Secretaries.

He stated that not all the zones would be kept open in the nights.

“A special zone where nocturnal animals could be seen only would be opened at nights,” he said.

“As this is the first experience of opening a zoo at night time, we expect a standard of discipline from visitors.

“In addition, activities likely to hurt the animals, consuming alcohol, taking pictures with flash lights and feeding animals are prohibited,” Minister Jayawickrama said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
