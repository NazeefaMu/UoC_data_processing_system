South Africa in pursuit of a massive victory target of 490 runs were struggling at 139 for five when play ended on day three of the second Test match which continued at the SSC Grounds in Maitland Place.

Earlier, Sri Lanka who resumed from their overnight score of 151 for three made steady progress through Dimuth Karunaratne and Angelo Mathews. Karunaratne played with confidence and his knock of 85 came in 136 balls that included a dozen boundaries whilst adding 63 runs for the third with Mathews.

Mathews cracked 71 with seven boundaries and added 64 for the fifth wicket. Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj was once again the top wicket-taker with three scalps and ended with 12 wickets in the match. Pix by Kushan Pathiraja
