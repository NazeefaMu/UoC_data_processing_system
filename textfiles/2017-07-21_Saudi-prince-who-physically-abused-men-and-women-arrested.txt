Saudi Arabia, (Daily Mail,), 20 July 2017 -   A Saudi prince has been arrested on the orders of a furious King Salman after videos appearing to show the young royal abusing men and women emerged.   


The footage went viral and came to the attention of the Saudi King, who issued an immediate warrant for the Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud’s arrest and imprisoned everyone involved in the verbal and physical attacks.    Citizens were left with blood dripping from their mouths and wounds on their faces as the prince appears to wave a gun at the camera and punch a man repeatedly in the head. Prince Saud appears to feature at the beginning and the end of the video, first punching a bloodied man in the head and then sitting in a car waving a gun around.    Other clips show citizens being hit in the head, having rifles pointed at them and one shows a group of women being abused.
