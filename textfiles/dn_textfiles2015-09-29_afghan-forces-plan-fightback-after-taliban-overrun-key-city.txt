Afghan forces plan fightback after Taliban overrun key city

AFGHANISTAN: Afghanistan on Tuesday massed troops for a counter-offensive to take back Kunduz, a day after Taliban insurgents overran the strategic northern city in their biggest victory since being ousted from power in 2001.
Afghan security forces have retreated to the outlying airport, leaving the Taliban effectively in control of Kunduz after they stormed the city on Monday, capturing government buildings and freeing hundreds of prisoners.
The stunning fall of the provincial capital, which has sent panicked residents fleeing, has dealt a major blow to Afghanistan’s NATO-trained security forces and spotlighted the insurgency’s potential to expand beyond its rural strongholds.
“New forces have arrived in Kunduz... A big operation is due to start,” interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told AFP.
