Red Bull Kart Fight returns to Sri Lanka

Back to fuel the passions of Sri Lanka’s motor racing fans, the iconic Red Bull Kart Fight returns to the island on the 28th and 29th of November 2015. The event is designed to give wings to aspiring racers who will put their skills to the test at the Kanway Autodrome, Mirigama.
Red Bull Kart Fight is a local amateur karting competition that gives drivers across the country the chance to experience wheel-to-wheel action and the smell of burning rubber. This year’s winner will be taken on an unforgettable trip to England to visit Red Bull Racing Garage in Milton Keynes and then onto fulfilling their track dream by test-driving a vehicle of their choice at the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit. Eshan Siriwardena, who won the local edition of Red Bull Kart Fight in 2012 went on to represent Sri Lanka at the World Finals in Italy and said, “The feeling is surreal. Racing for your country and racing with the world gives you a rush of adrenaline you won’t experience anywhere else. It’s the closest you can get to racing an international grand prix.”
The 2012 edition of Red Bull Kart Fight was the first international pro-karting event of its kind on Sri Lankan shores and saw three stages of high-speed action on a custom track around Independence Square. This year’s competition will take place over a course of 2 days with Qualifiers and the Finals held on a purpose-built 1500m racetrack at the Kanway Autodrome in Mirigama that offers a mix of straights, chicanes and inclines for an exciting drive. The racer who emerges victorious after 2 days challenging competition will be crowned the winner of Red Bull Kart Fight Sri Lanka and will go on to receiving his unforgettable prize.
“The motorsport community in Sri Lanka is growing and recently, the local karting scene has seen a growth of popularity amongst racers of all ages. Red Bull Kart Fight is a great initiative that will give these racers a chance to take part in the only international karting event in the country and the much needed exposure when provided with a global platform which would help them develop world-class careers. This event will also serve as an inspiration to the new generation of up and coming karters” said the Minister of Sports, Dayasiri Jayasekera who endorsed the event.
“This year with the winner receiving the honour of visiting the Red Bull Racing Factory and the Silverstone Grand Prix Circuit, my only hope is that in the near future we see Sri Lanka being put on the global map by racers who have been inspired by events such as these.
Red Bull Kart Fight is partnered with Sri Lanka Conventions Bureau as the official destination partner, Kiss FM as the media partner, Racecraft India and the Negombo Motorsports Club will officiate the event.
