	The term of imprisonment of the Sri Lankan housemaid who was charged with adultery in Saudi Arabia has not been clearly mentioned, the Foreign Employment Ministry stated yesterday.
	Following an appeal filed by the Foreign Affairs Ministry and Foreign Employment Ministry for sympathetic consideration in respect of the housemaid, the Government of Saudi Arabia had decided not to carry out the death sentence, but to imprison her instead.
	While announcing the news, Acting Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva had told the media that they were not yet been informed about the term of imprisonment of the housemaid.
	However, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said the Ministry was yet to inquire a particular court in Saudi Arabia regarding the term of imprisonment and how it would be served. (Piyumi Fonseka)
