Cannes Lions announces festival schedule


	

The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity (18th – 22nd June) has today released details of the 2018 Festival schedule.

Built around the new Tracks system, which unites the learning programme and awards structure, the 2018 Festival schedule will equip audiences with the knowledge and foresight they need in a constantly evolving communication industry.

“This year’s Festival features more brands than ever before, and there are many thought provoking topics that will be discussed,” commented Jose Papa, Managing Director, Cannes Lions. “This is a year where the roles, responsibilities, and even the identity of the creative industry is changing. Legends like David Droga and Jeff Goodby will be joined by first-time speakers from Apple, Uber and Amazon in a programme packed with new formats that will really bring the big issues to life.”

New formats this year include the Creative Debates which will tackle major questions facing the industry, including “Who Will be Your Next Boss?” Participants in this debate include Nick Law, Chief Creative Officer, Publicis Groupe, Anatoly Roytman, Managing Director Europe, Africa and Latin America, Accenture Interactive, Emma Sharkey, Creative Director, Rothco and Jaime Robinson, Founder and Chief Creative Officer, Joan. They will interrogate and decipher the future of the branded communications industry and the players within it.

Power Hours join the Forum programme, and see three speakers deliver 20 minute talks all linked by a common theme. The Forum programme will also feature innovative game show-style formats, including a session led by Mark Earls (the ‘Herdmeister’), author and thought leader in modern behavioural and cognitive science in advertising. The programme will also feature more interactive and immersive sessions on the rooftop Terrace Stage, including a session with musicians Jessie Ware and Paloma Faith which looks at creativity and motherhood.

Commenting on the programme, Philip Thomas, CEO, Ascential Events and Chairman-Elect, Cannes Lions said, “The global creative community were very clear about what they wanted from this year’s programme: more insight from brands and more sessions that addressed the challenges facing the industry. We’ve dialled up on both these key areas. There are still lots of the familiar festival favourites, like the New Directors’ Showcase and talks from inspiring creatives, but this year’s visitors can enjoy more interactive sessions and specialist programmes that will equip them with business critical knowledge and insight.”

The Festival opens with a keynote session from Droga5 Creative Chairman and Founder, David Droga, with a highly anticipated talk entitled, ‘Why the Hard is Easy and the Easy is Hard’. Other creative leaders on stage include the brothers Piysuh Pandey and Prasoon Pandey, who are the joint recipients of the 2018 Lion of St. Mark, Jeff Goodby, Co-Chairman and Partner, Goodby Silverstein & Partners, Chuck Porter, Founder and Chairman, Crispin Porter + Bogusky and Susan Credle, Global Chief Creative Officer, FCB.

World-leading CMOs participating in a programme featuring more than 70 brands include Bozoma St. John, Uber, Syl Saller, Diageo, Claudia Willvonseder, IKEA, Atilla Cansun, Merck, Elizabeth Rutledge, American Express and Jennifer Sey, Levi Strauss & Co. Fernando Machado, CMO, Burger King, returns to Cannes Lions after a triumphant 2017 in which the restaurant brand took home the prestigious Creative Marketer of the Year award.

Famous names from the worlds of entertainment, music and sport appearing at the Festival this year include actors David Oyelowo, Samira Wiley and Thandie Newton, world-famous guitarist Johnny Marr, Olympic Medalist Adam Rippon, mixed martial arts world champion Angela Sun Ju Lee and the President and COO of Beats Electronics, Luke Wood.

Representing creativity across different formats, James Marsh (Man on Wire, The Theory of Everything) will share his views on modern storytelling and film craft and Jonathan Entwistle, creator, director and Executive Producer of the of Channel 4 and The Netflix Original Series 'The End Of The F***ing World' brings his eye for art direction and cinematography to the stage.

As part of the Festival restructure announced in November 2017, Lions Innovation has been expanded to a five-day event open to all Cannes Lions festival pass holders. This year’s programme includes speakers from L’Oréal, Deloitte Digital, Walmart and Volvo. With a focus on brand transformation, this year’s Lions Innovation programme tackles how to drive a culture of innovation within brands.
