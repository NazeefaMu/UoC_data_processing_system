Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake today alleged that the government had begun a process of carrying out their personal objectives rather than taking steps to implement peoples’ aspirations.
Mr. Dissanayake expressed these views at a news briefing organised by the JVP together with civil society groups and artistes in Colombo to its 20 proposals calling for immediate implementation of political reforms.
Mr. Dissanayake said that civil society groups and political parties worked to bring the present government to power against the actions of the Rajapaksa government in order to bring about political reforms ensure law and order, democracy and bring economic benefits to the people.
He said however the government was deviating from its promises to the people at the last presidential and general elections.
He added that they decided to present a set of proposals to compel the government to expedite delivering promises made to the people at the elections.
Mr. Dissanayake said the government was acting in a lethargic manner with regard to its promise to take legal action against those involved in fraud and corruption.
He said the President or the Prime Minister had no right to evade from the promises made to the people and that they would compel them to implement the government’s promises including political reforms.
Mr. Dissanayake said they would submit their proposals to the President and the Prime Minister as well.
The set of 20 proposals by the civil society groups, artistes and political groups included, appointing a parliamentary select committee to prepare a programme to enable Sri Lankan citizens living abroad to vote from where they are domiciled and establishing the ‘Truth and Reconciliation Commission’ to enable those who were affected by the war to present their grievances, to find out the truth regarding such complaints and to give relief to the distress.
It also included bringing in constitutional amendments to totally abolish the executive presidential system, enforce laws to revoke parliamentary seats of parliamentarians who cross over and abolish provisions that exists in the 19th Amendment to bring the number of ministers to 30 and the number of deputy ministers to 40 and legalise the subjects and institutions of ministries on a scientific basis by bringing in a Parliamentary Act.(Ajith Siriwardana)
