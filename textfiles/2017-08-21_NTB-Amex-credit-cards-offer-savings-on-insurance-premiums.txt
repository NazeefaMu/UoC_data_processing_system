Ensuring their customers settle for nothing short of the best option, Save Your Monkey has partnered with Nations Trust Bank to offer zero percent interest installment plans on American Express credit cards when purchasing insurance policies via saveyourmonkey.com. 


In addition, card members will also be eligible for up to 10 percent savings on their insurance premium and savings up to 25 percent on special promotion days. The Save Your Monkey team and the bank officials signed off the agreement recently at the Nations Trust Bank in Navam Mawatha, Colombo 02. 


This partnership with Nations Trust Bank American Express comes to life as part of their endeavor to change the conventional perception that procuring an insurance policy is a tedious legal obligation. 
“In this digital era, it’s all about convenience. At saveyourmonkey.com, our vision is to make the process of purchasing the best insurance policy as simple and convenient as any other easy online transaction. We know sometimes customers tend to forgo opting for the most comprehensive insurance policy due to financial restrictions. Our partnership with NTB Amex aims to lift any financial barriers that hold back our customers from going for the best option. We are confident that this initiative will add significant value to our customers,” said saveyourmonkey.com founder and CEO Chathura Jayatissa.


Commenting on the partnership, Nations Trust Bank Head of Cards Niluka Gunatilake said, “We continuously strive to provide our card-members services and offers that make their life comfortable. 
Having to pay an insurance premium can be daunting at times, however, it’s important to find a sound and suitable policy to secure one’s future and to reap maximum benefits. To facilitate this for our card-members, we have partnered with saveyourmonkey.com to offer special savings and zero percent interest installment plans. We believe this will help the process of transforming the traditional way insurance is 
carried out.”
