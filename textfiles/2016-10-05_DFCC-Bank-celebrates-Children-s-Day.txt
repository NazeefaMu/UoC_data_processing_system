DFCC Bank is conducting exciting activities across its branch network to celebrate the Children’s Day. The bank will host art competitions at each of its regional offices located in Wellawatte, Nawala, Kandy, Jaffna, Kaduruwela, Matara and Negombo on October 8, 2016. The competition will be based on the theme of ‘Growth’ and will be open to children between the ages of six and 12. DFCC Bank is focused on advancing financial inclusion within all levels of society. The bank believes that teaching children the savings habit will enhance their financial skills and offers the Vardhana Junior savings product for young customers.


DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando commented, “The main purpose behind this campaign, whilst celebrating children, is to inculcate in them the important habit of saving. As a responsible commercial bank, DFCC has always been a strong advocate of encouraging children to save from an early age. The bank also has a strong legacy of empowering customers for growth and we believe that saving is an important element in the growth process. Our unique Vardhana Junior accounts are attracting a wide base of customers who realise the importance of saving for the future.”
He further added, “This will also be a great opportunity for us to engage with the communities within the regions and we look forward to meeting all the talented participants at the competition.”
The top three winners at each location will be gifted a Vardhana Junior account with a deposit of Rs.10,000, Rs.5,000 and Rs.2,500, respectively. The participants will also receive gift packs and certificates of participation.


Interested participants are required to register at the nearest DFCC regional office.
