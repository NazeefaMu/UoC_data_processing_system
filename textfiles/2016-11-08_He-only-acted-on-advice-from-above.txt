He only acted on advice from above


	



A group of Diyawanna members who button-holed a colleague at their canteen lambasted him for making public statements that caused severe embarrassment to them all. “See what you have said and done to make us all look fools.” They unleashed their pent up fury.


“What am I to do? I had to act as told by our ‘Lokka’!” the beleaguered member had protested his innocence.
“If you wanted to oblige the ‘Lokka’ you should have acted alone without dragging us all into this mud-hole. Now we can’t face people. They will pelt stones at us.”


The group highly disconcerted about the public anger they had incurred over their controversial role with regard to the latest COPE report, had dispersed on a sour note.
