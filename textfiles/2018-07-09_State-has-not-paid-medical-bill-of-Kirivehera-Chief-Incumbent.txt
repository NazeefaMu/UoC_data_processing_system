The government is yet to settle the hospital bill of Chief Incumbent of the Kataragama Kirivehera Temple Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera who was shot by an underworld gang, temple sources said.

The thera is still receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo where his hospital bill has exceeded Rs.3 million, they said.

On the day following the shooting incident President Maithripala Sirisena was quoted by many media outlets as saying the medical expenses of the thera who was airlifted from Hambantota to Colombo in a helicopter, would be borne by the State.

When inquiries on this were made from Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, he clarified that while they needed to get Cabinet approval for these medical expenses to be paid by the government, he would bring the matter to the attention of the President.(A special correspondent)
