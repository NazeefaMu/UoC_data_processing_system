Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could file a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition in the Supreme Court to obtain its opinion whether he could contest or not at the Presidential Election, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader, MP Udaya Gammanpila said addressing a news briefing today.

There is speculation in political circles that according to the opinion of some legal experts, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not debarred from contesting the Presidential Election for a third time.

“Anybody who wishes to bring former President back to office, can also file an FR petition in the SC emphasizing that his or her suffrage would be violated if somebody else other than Mahinda Rajapaksa contested,” he said.

“It is hard for me to express my ideal thoughts on the opinion expressed by some legal experts like Nihal Jayawickrama, because I have not referred to their source on which they say that former President is eligible to contest,” the MP said.

However, he said Mr Rajapaksa could file an FR petition in the SC so that the Supreme Court could order the Elections Commission to allow the ex- President to contest. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
