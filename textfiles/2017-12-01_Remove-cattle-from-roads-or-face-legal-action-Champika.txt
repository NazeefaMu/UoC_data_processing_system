Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka today vowed to take legal action against cattle owners who allow their cattle to roam the streets of the Western province.  

The Minister requested cattle owners to ensure their cattle were not on the roads by December15, stating that local bodies would be directed to take legal action against cattle owners.  
He said according to the Megapolis Ordinance, a license should be obtained to manage a herd of cattle in a shed.
However, he stated that if owners were unable to manage their herds, the cattle should be handed over to the Ministry.
Stray cattle had become a nuisance to the public and often created traffic. Therefore, they would be captured and sent to Embilipitiya cattle orphanage, the Minister said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
