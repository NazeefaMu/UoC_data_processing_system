The Joint Opposition (JO) today said the opportunity should be given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to contest in the upcoming Presidential Election if people wanted, despite the government’s attempt to block it through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.

MP Indika Anuruddha told a news conference that if the people wished to elect Mr. Rajapaksa as the President again, the opportunity should be given, irrespective of the number of Presidential terms.

He said it was useless to hold a Presidential Election by keeping the best player aside and added that it was not necessary to obtain the opinion of the Courts with regard to this matter.

“There are many cases in Courts already. The people’s will and opinion should be considered with regard to this and the government parties can decide on it. The government is attempting to do the same with Mr. Rajapaksa which happened to the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in the 1970s. The government should do away with its poor policies,” he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
