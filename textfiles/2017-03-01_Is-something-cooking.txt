The former strongman spent a few days in Lion City recently. Reports said that he was on a visit to the city nation for medical consultation and treatment. 

 


Meanwhile, Number Two in yahapalanaya who too was on a foreign tour had a stop-over in Lion City on his way back home while the former strongman was still there ‘taking treatment’. 


Incidentally, there was a story doing rounds that Number Two had a one-on-one meeting with the former strongman while they were in Lion City. However, this story remains unconfirmed.


Meanwhile, reliable sources say that it is a fact that a certain powerful purohita hailing from the South, often in and out of the palace, had a lengthy exchange with the former strongman at a well-known cricket club in Lion City. 


The duo had reportedly discussed a number of key issues of national significance.  However, the contents of this discussion remain a secret so far.
