Public inconvenienced due to road construction

Residents and travellers on the A06 Road in the Galewela town area are inconvenienced due to road construction activities. Respiratory diseases are increasing in the area due to dust, health officials said.
Police said vehicle accidents have also increased in the area due to the construction activities.
Residents say relevant authorities have not taken steps to mitigate the problem. If authorities could spray water along the construction site, the spread of dust would lessen.
They request the government to take immediate action in this regard.
