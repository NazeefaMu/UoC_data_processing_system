He silenced the match-maker


	


The former strongman the other day called a certain yahapalanaya purohita who is said to be playing the mediator role to bring about reconciliation between the present and the past heads of the Blue party. 
When the purohita came on the line, the former strongman came to the subject straightway. “You are talking about party unity, but you are berating us in the same breath. What are you really up to?”
The purohita, who was taken aback by the former strongman’s rapid fire query, immediately protested his innocence. “I never criticized you, Sir. On the contrary, I always asserted that 90 per cent of genuine Blues in this country are behind you…”
“Do you mean that your present leader doesn’t have a following?” the former strongman shot back.
“He does have a following,” replied the purohita. “They make up about only …percent.  Most of them are minorities. In your case, Sir, you command the support of 90 per cent of the Blues. Our victory at the polls is a cinch when our present leader’s votes are added to your support-base.”
The former Boss greeted this reply with derisive laughter. 
“Why are you laughing, Sir?” the purohita protested. “I told you the truth.”
“If that is the truth, go and tell your leaders who command hardly any support from the party membership to throw in their lot with me who has the solid support of 90 per cent of the Blues behind me. Do you want me to kowtow to your leaders despite my being a leader with a 90 per cent voter-base?” the former strongman asked. He rang off when he found no reply to his question was forthcoming from the other end.
