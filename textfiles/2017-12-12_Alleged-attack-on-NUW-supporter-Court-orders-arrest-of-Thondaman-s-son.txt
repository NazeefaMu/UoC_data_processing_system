Hatton Magistrate T. Saravanaraja yesterday ordered the Maskeliya Police to arrest Jeevan Thondaman, the son of CWC General Secretary and Parliamentarian Arumugam Thondaman and produce him in courts regarding an alleged attack on a National Union of Workers’ (NUW) supporter who had participated in a funeral in Maskeliya.

Police earlier arrested four CWC suspects who had surrendered to the Police over this incident and produced them in courts. The Hatton Magistrate ordered that the case be taken up again on April 4 while releasing the four suspects including the CWC Vice President and Central Provincial Council Minister M. Rameshwaran on cash bail.

The others who were released on bail were Wellayan Dinesh, M. Pichchamoorthy and S. Baskaran.

Maskeliya Police told the Magistrate that another suspect named Jeevan Thondaman was to be arrested and hence these suspects be remanded till December 13. However the lawyers who appeared for the suspects said this complaint had been made with an ulterior motive and requested that they be released on bail. (Ranjith Rajapakse)
