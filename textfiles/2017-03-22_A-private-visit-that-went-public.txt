A private visit that went public


	



 

There is a monk who played an active role in several popular movements responsible for bringing about a series of far reaching political developments in the recent past. 

 


This monk who had been closely associated with several political parties from time to time has of late embarked on a new mission after severing his latest political ties. The excuse he often proffers for this conduct is that he has always been above petty and narrow sectarian politics. 


The monk had quite recently visited a sibling of a highly influential political family in Pulatisipura seeking a big favour from him. The sibling who had given a right royal welcome to the monk had not only complied with his request, but had offered ‘an unforgettable gift’ as well to him.


A politico from Pulatisipura equipped with a fine-tuned political antenna had obtained within minutes the full details of the encounter between the monk and the sibling (with the VIP status now thrust on him) and spread the news far and wide soon afterwards, they say.
