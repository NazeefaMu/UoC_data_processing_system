President Maithripala Sirisena is reported to have raised concerns about the failure on the part of the government to contain the rising cost of living at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting.

For the second time, the Cabinet took up the matter for discussion with some ministers criticizing Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen for failing to control the high living costs.

It is learnt that the President, at one point, said the government would even find it difficult to face elections given the way the cost of living was increasing at the moment. (Kelum Bandara)
