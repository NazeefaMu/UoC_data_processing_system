Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader and Chief opposition whip Anura Kumara Dissanayke told Parliament yesterday that JVP members representing the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) are ready to resign from it if anyone thinks the stand taken by his party on certain issues affect the investigations carried out by the said committee.

Mr Dissanayake was responding to a statement made by Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella that COPE members should not divulge information on its investigations . “Is it correct to talk about investigations on COPE in Parliament and to divulge information by holding media conferences" he questioned.

Mr Dissanayake said members of JVP were ready to resign if any one thought they could influence investigations. "We can resign at any time if anyone says JVP members are influencing investigations" he said. (Yohan Perera)
