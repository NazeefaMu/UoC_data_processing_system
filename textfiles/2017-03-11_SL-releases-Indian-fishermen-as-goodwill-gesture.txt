In a goodwill gesture, Sri Lanka on Friday released 53 Indian fishermen lodged in Jaffna Prison, ANI reported yesterday.

More fishermen are expected to be released today from the Vavuniya and Trincomalee jail by the Sri Lankan Government.

The news article said all the fishermen will be sent to India soon.

Earlier on Thursday, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said that all 85 fishermen, who are in custody of the Sri Lankan Government, would be released soon.

"The Government of Sri Lanka has informed the High Commission of India in Colombo that all 85 Indian fishermen, currently in custody, will be released. We understand that the instructions in this regard to the concerned authorities in Sri Lanka have been issued. We are awaiting further orders within Sri Lanka in this regard," MEA official spokesperson Gopal Bagley told the media.

With regards to the killing of an Indian fisherman allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy, Bagley said that the High Commission had reached to "the highest possible levels in Colombo" and was assured of "thorough investigation" into the matter.

Earlier this week, a group of Indian fishermen, who were fishing between Danushkodi and Katchatheevu off the Tamil Nadu coast, were allegedly fired upon by the Sri Lankan Navy in which one fisherman was killed.
