Release the swindlers' list: Karu asks Austin


	

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has written to the Secretary to President Austin Fernando to send him the list of names mentioned in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) Report as those who had allegedly received financial gratuities from Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. boss Arjun Aloysius.

Mr Jayasuriya has made the request several times to Mr Fernando but there has been no positive response up to now.

An official of the Speaker’s Office told the Daily Mirror that a third request had been made to the Presidential Secretariat a few days ago by Speaker Jayasuriya under the Parliamentary Privilege as the issue involved Parliamentarians.

“Speaker Jayasuriya expects a positive response by next week from Mr Fernando as the disclosure of those names is of national interest,” the official added.

Meanwhile, Director General of National Archives Department Dr Nadeera Rupesinghe said she could release any document connected to a Presidential Commission Report only if and when the Secretary to President made a formal request.

“Normally, all confidential documents or reports sent to the National Archives can be released to the public domain only after 30 years,” Dr Rupesinghe added.

Meanwhile, former Minister Susil Premajayantha said the Presidential Secretariat must publish the list of names of those who got money from Mr Aloysius sooner than later because it had caused a huge controversy among the public, the media and in the political field.

“The delay in releasing the names of those mentioned during the CoI proceedings as beneficiaries of companies connected to Central Bank bond scandal creates an unnecessary and negative dialogue in the country,” he said.

“We are aware that Dayasiri Jayasekara has been given only Rs. one million. But we have information that there are many others, who have received fat financial gratuities and assets from Mr Aloysius,” he stressed.

Mr Premajayantha who is also a former COPE member told the Daily Mirror that the main concern of politicians like him was to clear their own name from this allegations because he had not received a cent from Mr Aloysius.

“Media reports indicated that there are 118 names in the list as those who got these unethical gratuities from Mr Aloysius, who is the second suspect in the bond scam case.

“We want to know whether all of them are politicians and if not who?. We want a clear picture of this sordid affair and know who did what to save suspects involved in the bond scam,” Premajayantha added. (Sandun A Jayasekera and Ajith Siriwardana)
