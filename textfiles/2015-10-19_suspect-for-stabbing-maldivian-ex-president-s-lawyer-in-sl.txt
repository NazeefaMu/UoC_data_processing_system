A suspect wanted by Interpol on the charges of stabbing jailed Maldivian ex-President Mohamed Nasheed’s lawyer has been spotted in Colombo, News World India said.
The suspect named Shafraz Ibrahim, 20, was spotted at Sosun Villa, a property owned by the Maldivian government in Colombo.
According to a report by Maldives Independent, Shafraz of Karankaage, Raa Atoll Inguraidhoo, was spotted playing football with members of the Maldivian student community.
According to a red notice issued by Interpol on October 15, Shafraz is “wanted by the judicial authorities of Maldives for prosecution,” for “gang assault using sharp weapons.”
A red notice has also been issued for 23-year-old Raaid Ahmed over the September 4 attack.
Shafraz and Raaid are suspected of stabbing lawyer Mahfooz Saeed in the head in broad daylight.
The 26-year-old lawyer narrowly survived the attack. He underwent surgery at Indira Gandhi Memorial Hospital to remove the knife lodged three and a half inches deep above his left ear.
The Maldives Independent quotes a source: “Shafraz was very casual and friendly, he was chatting with other Maldivians and some MECC staff.”
