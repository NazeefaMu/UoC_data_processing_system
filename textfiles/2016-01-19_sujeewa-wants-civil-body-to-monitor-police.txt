	Expressing his displeasure on the slow progress of the investigations carried out on the incident in Embilipitiya, where a youth named Sumith Prasanna was killed, the State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe today suggested setting up a special institution to monitor the actions of the Police.
	State Minister Senasinghe told a media briefing that a special institution which comprises civil officers should be set up to monitor the action of the Police.
	“I would make a suggestion to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Ranil Wickremesinghe that a special body, which comprises civil persons should be set up to monitor the actions of the Police as the recent behavior of the Police cannot be condoned,” he said.
	He said the Police should be given a sound training in handling of cases and should be re-motivated.  He said new attitudes should be instilled in the minds of Policemen.
	He said that the government did not welcome the way the Police officers had acted during the incident in Embilipitiya.
	“It should be determined as to how the Police got an emergency call on 119 and who had given the call,” he said.
	Mr. Senasinghe said he too had been subjected to harassment by Police on various occasions in the past. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)
