Amana Takaful PLC (ATL) was reaffirmed ISO 9001:2008 certification for both its General and Family (Life) Takaful businesses as part of its endeavour to continuously provide high service standards to its discerning customers.
ISO 9001:2008 certifications are awarded to companies that meet with the highest quality management standards stipulated by the International Standards Organisation. The accreditation auditor, Det Norske Veritas (DNV, Norway), after an in-depth assessment on ATL’s overall operations for General and Life Takaful, awarded the recertification at the recently concluded audit. 
“The recertification is a testament to ATL’s ability to enrich our underwriting processes in the issuing and dispatching of policies and speedy settlement of claims which directly reflects the operational excellence our team strives to maintain,” said ATL CEO Fazal Ghaffoor.
ATL continues to be in the forefront of the insurance industry in Sri Lanka and caters to all segments of customers. The Takaful way of insurance operates on the concept of bringing people together to be part of a system that gives them the opportunity to help each other. Since its inception 17 years ago, ATL has been successful in establishing a strong position for the concept of Takaful amidst competition from established conventional players. 
As the pioneer Takaful provider, ATL operates 27 branches and is set to expand further to better serve customers across the country. ATL continuously reaches out to customers from all segments of society and offers innovative and state-of-the-art insurance products that are convenient, affordable and reliable. As part of its commitment to remain ‘open to all’, ATL serves all communities and employs a multi-ethnic team across its network.
