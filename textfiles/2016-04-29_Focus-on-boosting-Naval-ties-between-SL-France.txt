The French Navy today said that it is time to start a ‘solid’ partnership between France and Sri Lanka.

“This is a good time to start the partnership between our two nations,” Captain Laurent Machard De Gramont, the Commanding Officer of the French Naval Ship ‘Aconit’ that arrived at the Port of Colombo on a goodwill visit stated.

Speaking to the media French Ambassador in Colombo Jean-Marin Schuh said that France was very much present in the Indian ocean.

“After six years, this is the first visit by a French ship to Sri Lanka and more visits are to follow,” he said.

“Aconit” will remain in the Colombo Harbour till May 5 and the ship’s complement is due to participate in several programmes organized by the Sri Lanka Navy to strengthen mutual relations during their stay in Sri Lanka. The Ship is due to conduct a Passage Exercise (PASSEX) with SLN Ships in view of sharing professional expertise between the two friendly navies.

Captain De Gramont paid a courtesy call on the Commander Western Naval Area, Rear Admiral Jayantha De Silva at the Western Naval Command Headquarters in Colombo. They held cordial discussions and exchanged mementos to mark the occasion.
