APPRECIATION: THE DR. RATNAM I KNEW!


	

One year and nine months ago I had the privilege of getting accommodation at Ratnam’s Private Hospital down Union Place.  My friend Professor Sheriffdeen, called and said I had to see Dr Ganesh Ratnam about my request for a room.

I was apprehensive at first, but I need not have been, he was the kindest, gentlest, most simple human being I have met.  I was introduced to his Secretary Chandrika, who took over from there and he just left everything in her capable hands. Running an institution like that is no mean task; it requires incredible patience, kindness and tenacity which fortunately Dr Ratnam possessed in full measure.  As the days and months passed, I grew to appreciate this gentle human being, who was the epitome of kindness and concern.

 


"His patients and residents always came first, regardless of time or weather, if he was needed; he was always there, always. "



His patients and residents always came first, regardless of time or weather, if he was needed; he was always there, always.  Even now I feel that if I look out of my room, I will still see him walking the corridors in his signature jeans and T-Shirt which was his standard attire.

Gardening was his passion.  I remember mentioning once that I had nothing but concrete to look out on as I was the only person on that corridor. Imagine my surprise when I returned from the office that evening, I found a garden being constructed.  Such was the sincerity of his commitment to anyone or anything.

Looking back over the short time I was privileged to have known Dr Ratnam, I am certain that all those who knew the doctor would say with proud conviction that we were richly blessed because he touched our lives.

He must be wishing how we could know today that nothing but our sadness can really pass away. His was a blessed death, he was gone before we knew it and only God knows why!

So, let us think of him as living in the hearts of those he touched, for nothing loved is ever lost and he was loved so much.

Today would have been your 72nd birthday dear Doctor, so together with the Angels I want to say ‘Happy Birthday’ – our loss is heaven’s gain!

It is easy to leave footprints in the sands of time, but it takes a very special person to leave footprints in the lives of those he touched!
