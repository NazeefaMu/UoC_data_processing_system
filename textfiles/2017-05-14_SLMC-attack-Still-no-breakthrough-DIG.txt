The Police had not made any significant progress in their investigations yet into the grenade attack on the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) last Friday night, Senior DIG (Western Province) Nandana Munasinghe said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror he said that the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) officers, who were conducting investigations, had taken statements from the security officers at the SLMC premises and probing on the motive of the attack, which might lead to arrests of suspects.

A Type- M4 live hand grenade had been lobbed into the SLMC premises on Friday night but it failed to explode, the Police said.

The security personnel had discovered it on Saturday morning, Police said.

However, the security personnel, who were on duty had heard some object hurled at the SLMC building but had not found anything during the night. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
