The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) deployed its second aircraft overseas after three MI 17 Helicopters left for South Sudan last week to join the United Nations Missions Aviation Unit.
The first group comprising of two officers, 10 airmen and the three MI 17 aircrafts was flown by an AN 124 aircraft last Saturday (June, 6).
Air Force Commander, Air Marshal Kolitha Gunatilleke examined the initial loading at the SLAF Base in Katunayake last Friday.(SLAF)
