DPA, 29th JANUARY, 2018-Bruno Mars claimed the night’s biggest accolades at the 60th Grammy Awards in New York on Sunday, taking home trophies for Best Album, Record and Song Of The Year.
The event also gave visible support to the “Time’s Up” movement, with many performers and guests clad in white to speak out against sexual harassment and abuse which has been shown to be rife in the entertainment industry.


“You guys are the reason I’m in the studio pulling my hair out,” Mars told his fellow Best Album nominees which included Jay-Z, Lorde and Childish Gambino.


The R&B singer won all six of the top awards he was nominated for including prizes for album, record for “24K Magic” and song of the year for “That’s What I Like.”


Kendrick Lamar also won five Grammys, including Best Rap Album for “DAMN.”


“It is really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve, for the next listener, the next generation after,” Lamar said during his acceptance speech for Best Rap Album. The Compton-born rapper also took home the trophy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Loyalty” featuring Rihanna.
