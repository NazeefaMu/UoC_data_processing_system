Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleka appearing on behalf of Aloysius’ personal assistant, Steve Samuel, informed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry yesterday that his client is being treated at the Asiri Hospital ICU and would not be able to appear before the Commission in the near future.

He said that his client Samuel is currently being treated for a cardiac illness and that he was still unable to meet him as he is being treated at the ICU, hence demanded more time to tender the affidavit requested earlier by the Commission.

The Commission also yesterday confirmed that it had received the medical reports of the witness

The Commission instructed the counsel to let the Commission know when Samuel is ready to submit the affidavit. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
