Govt. using Gnanasara Thera to delay polls: JO


	

The government is attempting to delay the local government elections by using Galagodatte Gnanasara Thera to divert attention from the real issues, the joint opposition said today.

JO spokesman Gamini Lokuge told a news conference that the government was reluctant to hold the elections because it knew it would be defeated.

He said this government with the help of the international forces is conducting the ‘Gnanasara drama’ to divert the attention so that it could cling to power.

Mr. Lokuge said a similar coup was hatched during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime by using the Thera to topple the then government.

Meanwhile, he said the government should not sell the country's resources such as the buildings which housed Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Galle post offices.

Commenting on the incident where Minister John Amaratunga was reported to have threatened a group of journalists when he was questioned about the garbage disposal issue, the MP said it was the right time for the minister to retire from politics.
