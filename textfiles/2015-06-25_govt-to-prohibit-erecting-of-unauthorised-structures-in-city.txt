President Maithripala Sirisena has prohibited the erecting of unauthorised structures on the streets of Colombo and Mayor A.J. Muzammil had also agreed to withdraw the unauthorised pavement boutiques erected recently on three streets in Colombo, Skills Development and Vocational Training Deputy Minister Thilanga Sumathipala said.
He told the media at the SLFP weekly news briefing that Mr. Muzammil had permitted the erection of unauthorised structures on those streets, perhaps because of the influence of some UNP ministers. “I spoke to him on the matter and told him it was a dangerous and unlawful to erect unauthorised structures on the pavements of three main roads in the city after former Defence and Urban Development Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa cleared the city streets of unauthorised structures in a bid to beautify Colombo, an action which led to Colombo being named the fastest developing city in the world,” Mr. Sumathipala said.
He added that in Mr. Rajapaksa’s city beautification drive, 3,178 pavement hawkers, who had erected unauthorised structures, were evicted but were given an alternative location to ply their trade. “However, 451 pavement traders are still to receive such redress. The Urban Development Authority (UDA) has permitted pavement hawkers to use the areas in front of the Fort and Maradana stations, while in Borella shop owners have complained that their eviction had effected their livelihoods. Their argument is that they were paying for water and electricity at the places from where they were evicted. They had been permitted to use the pavement to erect stalls during the Sinhala – Hindu New Year, Vesak, Christmas and Ramazan festivals etc.,” he said.
Mr. Sumathipala said after a discussion with President Sirisena, attended by the IGP, the UDA Chairman, the Colombo Mayor and himself, the President had ordered them not to allow the erection of any unauthorised structures in the City of Colombo, taking into account the city’s cleanliness.
The UDA, the CMC and the IGP would prepare a report on how pavement hawkers who have not received alternative places to ply their trade would be accommodated and submit it to the President Sirisena, Mr. Sumathipala said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
