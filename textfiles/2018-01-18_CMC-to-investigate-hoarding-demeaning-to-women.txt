The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) has launched an inquiry into the erecting of a hoarding which apparently sends a message offensive to women.

The hoarding, which was erected by a fitness company, shows a picture of a barrel and says ‘This is no shape for a woman’.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, CMC Commissioner V. K. A. Anura said they had launched an inquiry into this following a request made to them by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva. “We will take a decision with regard to this hoarding after conducting an inquiry,” he said.

Earlier yesterday, Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva tweeted saying "I asked the Colombo MC Commissioner to remove this unapproved, offensive hoarding. I will not tolerate this in Kotte".(Kalathma Jayawardhane)
