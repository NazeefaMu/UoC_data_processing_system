A certain candidate in the local polls fray known to be a lackey of a leading politico in the country is said to be operating a kasippu distillery in the backyard of his election office.

 


The candidate is liberally serving kasippu to voters who call over to express their support and those actively engaged in campaigning for him, they say.


The local Police are well aware of this kasippu spot, but are turning a blind eye to it, people in the area say.
