President Sirisena protects bond scam offenders - JO


	

President Maithripala Sirisena has been attempting to protect the major bond scam offenders since the beginning of the first bond scam on February 2015, Joint Opposition MP Prasanna Ranatunga said today.

Addressing a news conference, he said the bond scam should have been nipped in the bud if President Sirisena had not dissolved the parliament when the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) report in connection with the Central Bank bond issue was presented to parliament by its chairman D.E.W. Gunasekera, after the first bond fraud on February 2015.

“President was well aware that the COPE report had envisaged the responsibility of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in relation with the bond scam. Having known that Premier was one of the major culprits of bonds fraud, President Sirisena dissolved parliament without debating the COPE report in order to protect the Premier,” MP Ranatunga said.

He further said that President Sirisena appointed Arjuna Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank knowing that he was not Sri Lankan citizen. Thus, he asked whether we need any evidence other than this to say that President Sirisena protects rouges. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
