Is a person’s intelligence fixed? Can one enhance ability? Comprehensive education research done in the United States and world over conclusively shows that intelligence and ability can be enhanced by adapting a Growth Mindset Framework in contrast to a fixed mindset. This talk will describe what a Growth Mindset is, explain its mechanism, provide proof of its success and offer activities and tips towards mindset conversion. The talk will also provide some tips and will be useful for parents, students and professionals who wish to optimize their own (or their children’s potential) for success in life.
