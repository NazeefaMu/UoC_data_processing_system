The unloading of 40,000 barrels of diesel out of a total consignment of 100,000 barrels imported to Sri Lanka has been suspended after the initial testing revealed that the stock was of low quality, Petroleum Industries Minister Chandima Weerakkody said today.

“Our initial testing at sea before pumping the consignment of diesel to the Kolonnawa installation, has found that 40,000 barrels was not up to the accepted standard and samples were sent for further laboratory tests," he said. "We will not hesitate to return the 40,000 barrels of substandard fuel and ask that they be replaced or request for compensation from the supplier."

The minister said there was no issue of quality pertaining to the remaining 60,000 barrels as they had been stored in separate compartments of the oil tanker that arrived from Singapore.

He said the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation kept a watchful eye on the oil tankers that bring fuel to Sri Lanka, as there were instances of sub-standard fuel entering the local market in the recent past, compelling CEYPETCO to pay millions of rupees in compensation to motorists.

“We do not need another repetition of the earlier fiasco,” the minister said. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
