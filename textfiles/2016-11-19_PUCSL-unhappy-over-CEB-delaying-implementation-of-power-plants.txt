PUCSL unhappy over CEB delaying implementation of power plants


	

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday issued a directive expressing its grave concerns to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), over the delay in constructing power plants according to the approved Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) and demanded an explanation for the same before November 29.

“The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka approved the LCLTGEP on 15th of September 2016 and it is the sole responsibility of the Transmission licensee to adhere to the approved LCLTGEP and take immediate steps to implement it, given the critical nature of the power supply during the period 2017-2020.” the PUCSL said in a letter to the CEB.

It pointed out that the LCLTGEP was approved to ensure the future electricity demand was fulfilled and directed the transmission licensee to immediately construct and operate the power plants for the period of 2017 – 2020, as per the approved plan to avoid the possible power shortages that could ensue during the period.

It however noted that the CEB had asked for more time with the implementation plan compared to the approved LCLTGEP.

“Critical plants to be built during the period of 2017-2020 have been delayed up to two years from the LCLTGEP which could ultimately result in not being able to meet the country’s electricity demand which in turn may create issues to the daily supply of electricity throughout the country,” the PUCSL said.

“Delays in building the power plants indicated in the LCLTGEP will result in failure to meet the electricity demand during 2017-2020 period,” the commission said.

The PUCSL had thus issued a directive to the CEB to submit reasons for the deviation from the approved LCLTGEP for each and every power plant, asking them to provide a report on the impact of the power situation during 2017-2020 as a result of deviating from the approved plan and asking them to provide solutions/proposals to meet the increased demand in case of a shortage in the future. They said this explanation should reach the commission before Nov. 29. (Ajith Siriwardana)
