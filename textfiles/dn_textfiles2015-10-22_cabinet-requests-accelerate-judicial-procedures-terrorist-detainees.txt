Cabinet requests to accelerate Judicial procedures on Terrorist detainees

The government has taken steps to accelerate the judicial process regarding the persons who are in remand custody as suspects on terrorist activities during and after the conflict, Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the weekly cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department Auditorium today (22) he pointed out that a majority out of around 12,000 LTTE carders who have surrendered to the government at the end of the conflict have been rehabilitated by the government except those who have been accused of terrorist activities.
 
Those who have convicted guilty, and who are under an ongoing judicial act and who have been remanded as suspects are still retained.
 
Considering the proposal made by D.M. Swaminathan, Minister of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, the Cabinet of Ministers have requested the Minister of Justice to present the recommendation on accelerating the judicial procedures on these detainees to the Cabinet of Ministers, Minister Senaratne added.
