Motion back on the table


	



 

The much publicized no confidence motion put on hold for some time is back on the table, they say. 

 


The JO stalwarts who initiated the move had later got discouraged when it dawned on them that presenting the motion would serve no purpose unless there was an assurance of support from Blue party colleagues now backing the new big boss.


In the meantime, several mediators had gone into action and a flurry of talks between the two factions that ensued had led to reaching the agreement sought. 


Now they have begun signing the motion. Even one JO member from Gampaha and two of the three Blue ones from the government side who initially opposed the move had later signed the motion under much pressure, they say.  According to the latest report, the JO has been assured of ‘ayes’ from all in the Blue faction with the government except the one from a young heavyweight from Rajarata. 


According to loquacious Ranji from the gem city in charge of collecting signatures for the motion, they were ready to give a severe jolt to yahapalanaya come next week, they say.
