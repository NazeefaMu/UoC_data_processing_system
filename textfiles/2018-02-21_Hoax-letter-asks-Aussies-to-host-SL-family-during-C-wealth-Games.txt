Queensland Police in Australia is investigating a ‘racist hoax’ letter, which has said that one Queensland resident has been selected to host a Sri Lankan family during the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, 9news.com.au reported on Tuesday.

The letter, which appears to be printed on Gold Coast Commonwealth Games letterhead and signed under the name of chairman Peter Beattie, notifies one resident they have been selected to host a Sri Lankan family during the event under the “United by the Moment, Share Your Home” plan.

“These people will suffer tremendous upheaval and it will take some time for them to adapt to our way of life. So as not to inconvenience you, we shall provide adequate supplies of curry powder, rice, chicken and powdered goats milk,” the letter reads.

The letter goes on to list tents, stretchers and portable toilets as being “available at a modest rental” to host the extended family, as well as free immunisation against typhus, cholera, tuberculosis and leprosy and “two milking goats”, among other provisions.

In a statement, a GOLDOC spokesperson has told 9news.com.au. that the letter is a fake and has been handed over to Queensland Police who will conduct preliminary investigations into the motive and origin of its source. 

The letter, which emerged on user discussion website Reddit, has drawn criticism as an attempt to stir up racial tensions.
