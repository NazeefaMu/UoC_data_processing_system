Suriya starrer S3's first look revealed

The shooting for the third installment of the action/crime franchise has officially begun.
Kollywood actor Suriya has had his share of good and bad movies. But the one which really brought him huge success was the 2010 action masala film Singam. After the raving reception, the Tamil actor teamed up again with director Hari to make Singam 2 in 2013, which was also as big a hit as its predecessor. So Singam 3 was a very natural choice for the Kollywood hunk.
Much to the delight of the fans, the first look of Singam 3 titled as S3 has been unveiled. The first look photos look very interesting and shows the macho Kollywood star's face merged with that of a lion with the words THE UNIVERSAL COP emblazoned on top of the poster.
There are also photos of Suriya sporting his trademark Singam mustache and looking very cool and stylish in a pair of black shades. Shooting of S3 has started today and the movie is expected to be released sometime this year. Other than Suriya, Shruti Haasan and Aushka Shetty also play leading roles in the movie.
Although the storyline of Singam 1 and 2 were rather predictable and we hope S3 adopts a fresher plot-line. We wish the actor director duo luck so that S3 becomes an even bigger success than the first two parts. BollywoodLife
