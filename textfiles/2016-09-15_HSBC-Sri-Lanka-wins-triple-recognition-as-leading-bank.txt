HSBC Sri Lanka was awarded a triple, by virtue of having been awarded three coveted awards in recognition of the bank’s ability to maintain its position as a leading foreign bank in the country, backed by a strong track record and long-standing history in the local banking arena.
For the second consecutive year, HSBC was announced the Best Foreign Bank in Sri Lanka at  Finance Asia’s Country Awards for Achievement 2016. The award is an indication of HSBC’s strong financial position and growth, making it well placed to grow with local businesses it has banked for many years. It further recognises HSBC’s expertise in loan financing through significant deals that further demonstrate the bank’s strength and impressive network within Sri Lanka as well as its strong leadership position in credit card spend and receivables.
HSBC also swept the board by winning a spate of awards in Hong Kong, China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand.  On the corporate sustainability sphere, HSBC Sri Lanka received the Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Award by Enterprise Asia under the Social Empowerment category for the ‘Restoration of the cascading tank project in Anuradhapura’ by Enterprise Asia.
The awards honour Asian businesses for championing sustainable and responsible business practices, demonstrating the company’s leadership, sincerity and ongoing commitment to incorporating responsible and ethical values, compliance, respect for people and individuals, involvement in communities and protection of the environment into the way they run their businesses.
Out of more than 300 submissions received from companies in 28 countries across Asia, 59 projects were deemed noteworthy and selected as the recipients of this year’s awards.  
Commenting on the accolades, HSBC Sri Lanka and the Maldives CEO Patrick Gallagher stated, “We are honoured to win the award for Best Foreign Bank in Sri Lanka for the second time running and to be recognised for social empowerment with Asia Responsible Entrepreneurship Awards 2016. The awards are timely as we are about to cross a major milestone ahead; our 125-year anniversary is next year. This further demonstrates our commitment to the country. We are proud to be able to continue serving customers through our local network and global connectivity, whilst also being able to contribute to a greater cause of supporting the local communities that we operate in.”
For the very first time, HSBC Sri Lanka was awarded the International Retail Bank of the Year by Asian Banking and Finance, in its 11th year of awards. HSBC was among 65 banks from across 24 countries that participated in the prestigious awards ceremony held at Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore, marking a breakthrough year, as it honoured a record number of organisations.  
Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management Nilantha Bastian commented, “We are pleased to receive this award, as it underpins our strong position in the retail banking business in Sri Lanka. HSBC has remained a strong player in the credit card market and the affluent customer segment through global propositions, HSBC Premier and HSBC Advance, all of which connect customers to global opportunities. As a thought leader, HSBC has introduced novel banking experiences, processes and technology, leveraging on our global know-how right here in Sri Lanka. Our award-winning secure online services help customers manage banking and keep track of their cash flows from anywhere in the world. We will continue to develop our retail banking business in Sri Lanka and increase efficiencies for our customers by expanding our digital banking experience in future.”
Regionally, HSBC was also awarded the Asia Pacific International Retail Bank of the Year in Hong Kong, Digital Banking Initiative of the Year in Australia, International Retail Bank of the Year in Vietnam and Corporate Social Responsibility Programme of the Year in India.
HSBC was also named World’s Best Investment Bank and World’s Best Bank for Corporates by Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2016.
