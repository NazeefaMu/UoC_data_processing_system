A group of four UK Parliament members today said there is immense progress in the Sri Lankan government’s programmes to strengthen the democracy and the steps taken to develop the economy of the country, implementation of the special development projects as well as promotion of foreign trade.    

The members of the All-Party Parliamentary Group including its Chair  Ranil Jayawardena of Sri Lankan origin, MP, House of Commons, who represent the Conservative Party of the UK, expressed these views upon meeting President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat.

The delegation arrived in the country with the aim of strengthening the relations with Sri Lanka as a Commonwealth country as well as to promote trade and investment relations between the two countries, the President’s Media Division said.  

President Sirisena pointed out the importance of further strengthening the relations between the two countries to reap maximum benefits from the opportunities of new technology and promotion of employment opportunities.

The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is scheduled to take place in the UK in April this year, and the delegation said that in parallel to this event, the two countries are expected to further consolidate their ties.
