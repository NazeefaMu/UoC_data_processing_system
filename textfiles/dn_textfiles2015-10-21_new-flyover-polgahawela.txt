New flyover at Polgahawela

Steps are being taken to construct a flyover over the Polgahawela town railway lines in Kurunegala to ease the traffic congestion. This is a fulfillment of a pledge by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before Parliamentary elections. The plan in this regard is drawn while a survey is being conducted at present.
The estimated cost of the flyover is Rs. 1,230 million. Construction work will commence in early 2016, said a senior cabinet minister in the Kurunegala District.
