The bus driver of a 177 Kaduwela-Kollupitiya bus had been admitted to the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital.

M.K Kasun and his wife had got annoyed with the bus driver who had been continuously signalling by tooting his horn at them indicating that their parked luxury vehicle was blocking his way.

The Police arrested the couple on the spot with a 9mm pistol and five live bullets in their possession.
