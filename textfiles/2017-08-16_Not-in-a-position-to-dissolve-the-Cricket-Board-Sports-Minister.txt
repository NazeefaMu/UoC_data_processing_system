While admitting that the Sri Lanka Cricket Team is in its lowest ebb in mental and physical toughness and technical abilities, Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara today said that this was the best possible team available at the moment.

Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing, Minister Jayasekara said he has called reports from the physiotherapist, coach, doctor, bowling and fielding coaches to have an idea as to what and where it went wrong to suffer the most humiliating defeat in the history of Sri Lankan cricket at the hands of India in the recently concluded Test series.

“We must help the team. If anyone can propose a team or a cricketer better than those in the current Test Cricket Team please go ahead. I have no hesitation to bring him to the National Team if anyone can name a better bowler or a batsman. However, I don’t want to intervene in team selection or other affairs of cricket than necessary because the media will target me even for that,” Minister Jayasekara added.

Minister Jayasekara said he had a two hour discussion with the team and administration on Tuesday and will individually speak with the cricketers after the ODI series is concluded.

“I am not in a position to dissolve the Cricket Board only because our National Cricket Team gets a bashing from India. I can’t also appoint an Interim Committee as suggested by Minister Arjuna Ranatunga because it is not the correct thing to do. Don’t forget that Mr. Ranarunga was beaten at the last Cricket Board Elections,” Minister Jayasekara said.

Minister Jayasekara said all past senior cricketers and captains have given a pledge to him that they would provide their fullest support and cooperation to rebuild the Sri Lanka Test, ODI and T20 Teams into a winning combination. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
