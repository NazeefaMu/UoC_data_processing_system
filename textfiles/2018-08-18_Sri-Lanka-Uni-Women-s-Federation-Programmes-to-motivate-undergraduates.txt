Sri Lanka Uni Women’s Federation Programmes to motivate undergraduates


	

The Sri Lanka Federation of University Women 
( SLFUW) is striving to open the eyes of university students to ideas, opportunities and possibilities beyond what they may know, by conducting a series of motivation and mentoring programmes in local universities.  


When undergraduates hear stories of great achievers in their own words they are more likely to take it seriously, do better academically and behaviourally, and graduate from universities with great expectations.  

 


With this intention of motivating university students towards  the SLFUW with a long history of nearly 77 years has been organizing a special programme titled ‘Surmounting Mountain as metaphor’ with the aim of empowering youth to achieve their goals

Jaffna university students will get a chance to hear the inspirational story of  Sri Lanka’s Everest Climbers Jayanti Kuru-Utumpala and Johann Peiris as another presentation of this programme on Sunday 19.  


The event coordinators are Iranganie Bopearachchi and Delaine Weerakkody with Dr. Nirmali de Silva at the helm, while the SLFUW will be organizing the event at the Jaffna University.  


Previously the duo have addressed a packed audience of students and faculty at the University of Peradeniya, the University of Colombo and the Kotelawela Defence Academy, SLFUW council member Nirmala Ekanayake said.   At each event the students have been unfailingly appreciative, while student counsellors and administrators have hailed it as a novel and effective way of training youth in self-regulation she added.  


Jayanthi Kuru-Utumpala and Johann Peiris, who pioneered the first ever Sri Lankan Everest Expedition, shared their amazing story among university undergraduates at the Peradeniya University, at the launch of this programme on December 7, 2017.  


The SLFUW was founded in 1941, as a registered charitable organization with a large membership, and is affiliated to the International Federation of University Women. 


It undertakes charitable, social and educational activities, particularly for women, and promotes co-operation and understanding among university women.
