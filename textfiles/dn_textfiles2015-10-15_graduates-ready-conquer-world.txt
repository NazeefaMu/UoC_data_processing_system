Graduates ready to conquer the world

The Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM) at SLIIT celebrated the success of their second batch of students who graduated on October 6 at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
Fifty-six students graduated on that day where 24 of them were not able to be present as they had work or educational commitments in the Middle East, Maldives, Australia and also in the United States of America. CAHM @ SLIIT takes this opportunity to mention that some of the students at the ceremony were already employed at hotels that are recognized internationally in Sri Lanka itself and acquiring the William Angliss Institute, Melbourne, Australia qualification has given them that extra edge of recognition.
The Chief Guest of the event was Prof. Chandana Jayawardene, a renowned academic and hotelier who has been in the industry for over 40 years and the Guest of Honour was William Angliss Institute, Singapore Head of Regional Development Singapore and Acting Head of Academic Programmess Ian Nicolson. The parents and family members of the graduates and other dignitaries from the hospitality and tourism industry present at the event added the extra encouragement the students needed to see themselves through to a brighter future in the corporate world.
"For the first time in the history of CAHM we had 15 International students from the well renowned Multi National Omani Company - The Renaissance Services Group. The ties between Sri Lanka and Oman have been enriched by the friendships made and the experiences shared over the past two years", CAHM CEO Steven Bradie-Miles shared with the graduates.
The special awards for the night were one of the highlights for these young graduates where the following students won their respective awards;
