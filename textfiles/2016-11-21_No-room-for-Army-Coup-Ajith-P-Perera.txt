While decrying the claims made by MP Dinesh Gunewardane of an Army Coup in Sri Lanka, Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday claimed the whole nation would take to the streets if despotism would be prevailing in the country without considering political party discriminations.


Addressing a function in Bandaragama, Mr. Perera said they would not let despotism prevail in the country by any means and added that this country could govern only by democratic governments.


“It does not matter which party rules the country. Be it the SLFP, UNP, JVP or any other party, but democracy should be compulsorily included. This country’s development and its whole future are in the hands of the democracy. Therefore we cannot afford to lose it,” he added. (Bimal Shaman Jayasinghe)
