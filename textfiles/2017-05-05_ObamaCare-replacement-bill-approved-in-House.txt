ObamaCare replacement bill approved in House


	

The American Health Care Act (AHCA) passed with a vote to spare, after weeks of cajoling within the Republican party to muster enough support.

Democrats were unanimously opposed and their House leader Nancy Pelosi called it a "cowardly choice".

President Trump predicted this "great plan" would now get Senate backing.

"Make no mistake, this is a repeal and a replace of Obamacare," he said from the Rose Garden at the White House, soon after the vote.

Its safe passage through the US lower chamber provides the new president with his first legislative victory, three months into his term.

And it marks a remarkable turnaround after the bill was left for dead in March when Republicans were unable to agree on its provisions.

But it was a close-run thing - Republicans needed 216 votes in the House and it passed with 217. No Democrats voted in favour. (BBC)
