Will control tense situ if given Law and Order Ministry-Range


	

Minister Palitha Range Bandara told Parliament yesterday that he would bring the prevailing tense situation under control if he was given the Law and Order Ministry for two weeks.

“Clause 89 to 96 of the penal code gives police the provision to open fire at those violating the law. I heard the Menikhinna Police had opened fire in the air to control the situation. The police should fire at lawbreakers and not at birds in the sky. If police are not aware of the penal code, then it is time they study it. If I were given charge of the police for a fortnight, I will show how to control this tense situation," he said.

On a different note, he said action should be taken against the officials attached to the State Intelligent Service as they have failed in their duty of providing information regarding any impending danger. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
