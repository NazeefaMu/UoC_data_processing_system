• First commercially available Massive IoT network in South Asia, supporting both Cat-M1 and NB-IoT 

• Software activation on existing LTE network for fast deployment 

• Accelerates the proliferation of IoT devices by offering superior coverage, long battery life and cost-effective solutions to enterprises

 

Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lanka’s largest telecommunications services provider, and Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) have rolled out the first commercial Massive IoT network supporting both Cat-M1 and NB-IoT technologiesin South Asia.

 

Deployed across Dialog Axiata’s Sri Lankan network,the advanced mobile network technology will help accelerate the proliferation of IoT devices. It will further develop the IoT ecosystem in the country by offering the superior coverage, long battery life and cost-effective solutions to enterprises.

Pradeep De Almeida, Group Chief Technology Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC, says: “With this launch, we are seeking to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies by enterprises and help them create exciting new products and services for consumers. The Cat-M1/NB-IoT network will amplify opportunity for solutions such as Smart Metering for utilities, Smart Parking, Smart Bins, smart environmental sensors for smart cities, logistic solutions as well as other applications in agriculture and farming.”

 

Ericsson delivers Cat-M1(LTE-M)and NB-IoT support as a software activationto Dialog Axiata’s existing LTE Radio Access Network. Ericsson's Massive IoT solutions for Cat-M1 and NB-IoT devices have great advantages including low cost, low power consumption, deep coverage, massive connections, and more secure and reliable transmission. 

 

Vinod Samarawickrama, Country Manager, Sri Lanka &Maldives, says: “A well-developed IoT ecosystem is fast becoming key for operators to enable new services and revenue streams. Our partnership with Dialog Axiata to roll out the first Massive IoT network for both NB-IoT and Cat-M1 in the country, and notably South Asia, contributes towards this fast-developing IoT ecosystem.”
