‘Villain’ had his way in the nomination drama!


	


While the two main political parties are still trying to manage the after-effects from nomination hiccups,  inquisitive ones are making inquiries to ascertain why certain popular hopefuls were dropped and some  hardly known persons had suddenly made their way into the lists at the eleventh hour.
Last minute erasure of the name of popular teledrama actor and TV personality Kamal from the UNP’s Ratnapura district nomination list raised many an eyebrow and the inquisitive ones had found out that the party leadership had heeded a strong protest made by a young PC member well known for his bellicose behavior.
“We have been victims of assaults and other forms of violence and harassment for years. Yet we have stood by the party undeterred. You are now going to give nomination to a person parachuted here ignoring our merits,” the young UNP activist had remonstrated. His protest had the desired effect on the party leadership and Kamal’s name was deleted from the list, they say.
A Kamal’s friend said: “Kamal initially asked for nomination to contest from Gampaha. But the party wanted him to enter the fray from his home turf Ratnapura. Now he has lost both Gampaha of his choice and Ratnapura of the party’s choice.”
