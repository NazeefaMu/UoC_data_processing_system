Amãna Takaful Life (ATL Life) recently rewarded achievers of ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire’ - an achievement based reward scheme for employees who excel and perform beyond targets. As part of the programme, seven levels of new business in the ‘Prosper’ segment have been outlined and a variety of rewards were set for each level. The special programme was launched in 2014 and is running for the second consecutive year in 2015. 
The ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire’ programme, was created to motivate staff to achieve results beyond their targets. Having understood that the Life insurance industry has enough potential for larger business wins, the company wanted to motivate their insurance advisors and agents to pitch for bigger business opportunities. The new reward scheme provides opportunity to win large cash prizes and encourages staff to reach outstanding levels of achievement.  
Commenting on the programme, Reyaz Jeffrey, CEO, ATL Life, “The ‘Who Wants to be a Millionaire’ programme was carefully crafted to motivate our employees to perform at their very best. Through this programme, employees who go beyond and deliver exceptional performance will be able to reap the rewards of their hard work. The prizes vary based on the target achieved and one hard working employee was able to walk away with Rs. 1 million. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all ATL employees who participated in the programme and reached beyond the targets that were set for them last year.” 
ATL Life ‘Prosper’ is Sri Lanka’s first Shari’ah compliant Investment linked insurance plan with some of the lowest fund allocation charges in the industry. In an era of growth and prosperity, “Prosper” is a unique plan where anyone can benefit from growing markets, whilst enjoying Takaful benefits. There are three Shari ‘ah compliant funds to choose from when making the investment, understanding that individual needs for returns are different and that the individual should have the freedom to decide what level of return he or she desires. ‘Prosper’ is designed to give the investor the added advantage of a prudent investment for the future, while providing for the protection for his or her family. 
ATL Life has been recognized for its innovation and quality of service for over 15 years. Amana Takaful PLC recently transferred its Life insurance business, Family Takaful to Amãna Takaful Life Limited (ATL Life) which is now operating as a separate business entity.  ATL Life offers a variety of innovative and state-of-the-art insurance products that are convenient, affordable and reliable.
