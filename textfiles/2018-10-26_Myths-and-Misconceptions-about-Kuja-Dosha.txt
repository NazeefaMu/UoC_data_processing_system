Myths and Misconceptions about Kuja Dosha


	



 

Some of our readers, at least those who happened to read the Part 1 of this article that appeared in the Jyotisha page last week may know now that Mars occupying the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th or the 12th House in a Natal Chart of an individual causes Kuja Dosha which is also widely known as Mangalik Dosha and Bhauma Dosha. 

 

Rashi misinterretation
It is a matter for regret that there appear to be many astrologers in this country who would quickly pronounce the presence of Kuja Dosha the moment they notice that Mars is placed either in the 1st House or the 7th House without analyzing the horoscope in its entirety to ascertain whether there are planetary combinations that nullify or dilute the effect of Kuja Dosha in each case. 

 

Is half the world population Mangalik?
In this context, this writer would like to recall a very valid point that an eminent astrologer has made to demonstrate the fallacy of attributing Kuja Dosha to every case where Mars is positioned in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th or the 12th House in a horoscope.


It goes without saying that Mars being one of the planets in Astrology should occupy one of the 12 Houses in a horoscope. This eminent astrologer says that his calculation is that Mars by being in one of those Houses affects five persons out of every 12 which means Dosha afflicts about 42 percent of the world population at a given moment. He adds that if the Houses to be affected are reckoned from the Moon sign as well, the figure supposed to be liable to get affected will rise to 52 percent which works out to more than half the world population. He asks whether it is rational to believe that the Kuja Dosha ruins the marriage of more than half the world population!

 

Kuja Dosha not a myth either
The astrologer says that he would not dare make a sweeping statement that there is no affliction called Kuja Dosha. He adds that though there is a malefic yoga called Kuja Dosha, there are many planetary combinations capable of nullifying or diluting this Dosha. In fact, the sages in ancient India such as Parasara and Jaimini have explained those combinations in their celebrated works. 

 

What Mars represents
A negative Mars or a malefic Mars causes anger, intolerance, harsh speech, aggressiveness and tendency to destroy things. However, a positive Mars gives courage, boldness, drive, energy, leadership qualities and executive skills among other things. 

 

What the Houses represent
The 7th House in a horoscope represents marriage, spouse, sex drive and partnerships and the 8th House life after marriage and the longevity of the spouse. The 2nd House which is called Kutumbhasthana denotes the married life of a couple, the 4th House which is called Gruhasthana the family life settled in a permanent residence.  The 12th House denotes the status of physical love.

 

Rationale for Kuja Dosha
Mars commands full aspect over the 4th, 7th and the 8th Houses from its own position. Therefore, a malefic Mars can spoil these three Houses in addition to the House it occupies. 


Success of marriage depends on mutual love, tolerance and sacrifice and a malefic Mars could destroy all these attributes with its bad temperament, intolerance and aggressiveness leading to constant quarrels, clashes and unhappiness. This is Mars’ blemish or Kuja Dosha!
There are numerous planetary combinations that nullify or dilute Kuja Dosha. Therefore, one should not hasten to pronounce the presence of this Dosha just going by the basic definition.However, one may ascertain the dignity of the 7th House and the 8th House and their lords and the Moon and Venus for making a gainful snapshot judgment about the existence of Kuja Dosha.
