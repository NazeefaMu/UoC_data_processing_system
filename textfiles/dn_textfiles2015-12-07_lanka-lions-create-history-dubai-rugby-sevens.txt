Madisha Silva leads them to maiden triumph in Gulf Men's Open
Lanka Lions create history at Dubai Rugby Sevens

Lanka Lions created history at the Emirates Airline Dubai Sevens Rugby tournament by winning the Gulf Men's Open title for the first time defeating Heartbeat Sports Tigers 33-21 in a pulsating final.
Skipper Madisha Silva began scripting their triumph with a superb blindside dash from a scrum on the halfway line. Lanka Lions top scorer Amin Jamail virtually sealed victory with a brilliant try inside two minutes by jinxing his way through.
"I knew the game would be decided in first two minutes itself. Our strategy was very simple. We knew they were a heavy side. Anyway, we were going to attack from the corners. We scored two quick tries. We knew that they (Tigers) were not able to come back from there though it (match) opened out after," said Lanka Lions coach Richard Murcott.
"I'm proud to be coaching this team. It was a long time coming after so many years," he said.
The Tigers rallied furiously forcing a litany of errors from the Lankan side who defended grimly but could not prevent their heavier opponents barging over to close the gap 7-14.
However, the Lankans went into the break with a 21-7 cushion after Dulanka Gunasekera pounced on a loose ball and raced across over 50 metres for a magnificent try.
Fijian forward Vito crashed over the line just 30 seconds after the turn around for an unconverted try while Gayashan Wijayasinghe carried the ball over after a perfect switch with Gunasekera who made the initial break to extend their lead 33-7.
The Tigers scored a corner flag try and helped themselves to another when Lanka Lions were down to six players in the final minute of the game for sin-bin offence.
However, the result seemed almost inevitable as Lankan side sealed a perfect campaign by claiming their first major trophy at the Dubai Sevens since winning the Khanjar Trophy in 2008.
"We made history in Dubai Sevens and for Lanka Lions," said Madisha Silva, a former Peterite Sevens captain, overwhelmed with emotion after leading his side to victory.
Having swept all before them in the pool stages, the Lions secured the place in the final by defeating Kuwait Scorpions 27-12 in the semifinals earlier in the day.
Fijian playmaker Tavite scored a brace before Jamail produced an explosive 70-metre run to give them a 17-0 lead the break.
Madisha darted across soon after the turn around to touch down in the corner while Vito added another to make it 27-0 before the Lions leaked two tries late in the game.
Former Sri Lanka Youth player Jamail was the star performer for the Lankan side scoring tries with his dazzling pace and catching the opposition flat footed with his stepping and dancing skills.
"I'm happy we created history. I am going to stop for the day. No more rugby for me," said former Sri Lanka great Roger Rodrigo, 51, who played for a record 27th time at the Dubai Rugby Sevens after turning out for the Lanka Lions Veterans who lost in the Gulf Vets Plate semifinal.
Tavite attributed teamwork for the success of Lanka Lions.
"Boys just put it together.No one did it on their own. Everyone helped each other out. They've been training really hard for the past two months," said the Fijian star.
Lanka Lions rugby chairman Azarath Deen said: "They trained as a team,as one unit.With the two Fijians, it really helped and Madisha's leadership made it excellent. That sealed it (title). We all knew we had opportunity to win the cup, that's why we went for it."
Former Lanka Lions captain Achala Silva said the players were united in their goal.
"Morale was so high they wanted to win the tournament.
They had the right attitude and they trained for six months," said Achala, 37, who has been representing Lanka Lions since 2000.
"The fact is the team has been disciplined. They play for each other. They play for the pride of the country," said Murcott.
The champion Lanka Lions squad comprised Madisha Silva (captain), Ameen Jamail (Vice Captain), Mohamed Rilwan, Dulanka Gunasekara, Akalanka Dabare, Anura Perera, Philip Asinghearachchige, Tuan Zalique Jayah, Vito Tuivione, Hilmy 'Bebo' Mohammed, Ranato Tavite, Gayashan Wijayasinghe, Dilshan Kelaniyangoda and Asif Akram.
A Lankan rugby fan who flew down from Colombo for this tournament Ayub Muthaliph was elated.
"I'm very happy that Lanka Lions performed very well. I came all the way from Sri Lanka to see them. They did a marvellous job. I'm very happy for the Sri Lankan boys. I think they are playing better rugby than Sri Lanka Sevens team," he said.
Dubai-based former Sri Lanka cricketer Ajith Weerakkody felt some of the Lanka Lions players were as good as the national team.
"There are guys who deserve to play for Sri Lanka.At least they play for Lanka Lions. They are very united and play as a team. That is most important. They always have the talent but this time they really played," he said.
Lanka Lions were also boosted by the presence of Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union president Asanga Seneviratne at the Dubai Sevens.
"Personally I'm very proud because the former president of the SLRFU was also with us.Asanga has personally nurtured me along with Ana Saranapala. He is somebody who has been supportive of me and my talents. His talk to boys gave me a little boost that I needed," said Murcott.
