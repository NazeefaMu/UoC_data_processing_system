The query gets an enigmatic reply!


	



 

An envoy of a powerful country based in Colombo recently called on a Yahapalanaya top team member hailing from a main ethnic minority.

 


Customary pleasantries over, they got down to a serious discussion about the upcoming big poll.  The envoy evinced a keen interest in knowing the time frame set for the big poll.


Pressed for the desired information, the top team member confided in the diplomat a secret by way of his answer. “I know that a high authority in our government put this very question to Number One the other day. Number One’s reply was something like this: “I don’t propose to do a stupid thing like my predecessor. Let people speculate whatever they please! I mean to hold the poll at the most appropriate time!”


The envoy greeted this reply with a smile, but made no comment, they say.
