PM’s office pressuring CID: GMOA


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) today claimed that the CID had received several telephone calls from the Prime Minister’s Office pressuring the CID to speed up investigations against the GMOA.

GMOA Spokesman Dr. Navin de Soysa said the doctor, on whose complaint the CID initiated investigations had previously been a GMOA member and a strong supporter of a very powerful minister in the present Yahapalanaya government.

He said GMOA members were being questioned by the government in an attempt to silence them over a typographical error in a booklet published by the GMOA in 2012 regarding the setting up of a specialists' registry and the introduction of an evaluation procedure for foreign medical specialists due to the spate of 'unqualified' Indian doctors practicing in private hospitals.

The GMOA’s General Committee has decided to go ahead with the countrywide strike action unless the government took action to stop the CID from summoning its members.

“As far as we are concerned, this is not a matter for the CID. We did not think our CID was that jobless to carry out investigation into some printing mistake of an old booklet. This book was launched under the direction of the ministry of health in 2012. In future we may have to send the proofs to the CID to check for any printing mistakes,” Dr. de Soysa said.

He said the GMOA would not be discouraged by the summoning of its members or filing lawsuits against it when they point out the misdeeds in the Heath Sector. (Piyumi Fonseka)
