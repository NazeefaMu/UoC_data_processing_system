Amending PTA, not repealing it: Wijeyadasa


	

Introducing amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), does not mean that the Act will be repealed or replaced by a new Act and there will be nor room left for the country’s security to be jeopardized, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.

He told a media conference today that this was not a sole decision of the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Law and Order.

“This process has to involve all stakeholders including the ministries and the security forces. It is only a policy decision but nothing has been finalised," the minister said. “The situation in the country is not the same as at the time we started discussions, the environment was totally different. The countries that requested to revise the PTA, are now thinking of tightening it in their countries. Those counties are amending the Act by adding stricter sub sections. Therefore, we too need to take another look on this Act." (Chaturanga Pradeep)
