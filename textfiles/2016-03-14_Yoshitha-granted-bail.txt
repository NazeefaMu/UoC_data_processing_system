Yoshitha granted bail


	

The Colombo High Court today released Yoshitha Rajapaksa and three other directors of the Carlton Sports Network (CSN) on a bail of Rs.100,000 with two sureties of Rs.1 million.

They were also ordered to cooperate with the ongoing FCID investigations into the money laundering case against them.

They were also restrained from traveling abroad without the Court’s permission.

High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyantuduwa made this order on an application filed in court seeking the revision of the Kaduwela Magistrate's order.

The Judge also underscored that the Kaduwela Magistrate should be satisfied with the credentials of those acting as sureties for the four accused.

He directed the High Court Registrar to convey the High Court decision by fax to the Kaduwela Magistrate.

Yoshitha and four others -- former president Mahinda Rajapaksa's media secretary and former Carlton Sports Network (CSN) chairman Rohan Weliwita; former CSN senior executive director Nishantha Ranathunge and directors Ravinath Fernando and Kaushal Dissanayake -- were arrested by the FCID on money laundering charges.

The bail revision application filed by Nishantha Ranatunge will be taken up in the High Court today. (T. Farook Thajudeen and Shehan Chamika Silva)
