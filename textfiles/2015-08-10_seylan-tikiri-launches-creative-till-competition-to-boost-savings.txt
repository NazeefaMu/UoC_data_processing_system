Seylan Bank announced the launch of its ‘Creative Till Competition’, aimed at enhancing childhood creativity and promoting a culture of saving among children. 
Aimed for children below 10 years, The ‘Creative Till Competition’ is the first competition of its kind organized by any Bank in the island, and will reward the main winners with a package tour to visit   Dreamworld theme park in Thailand . The competition also offers many more attractive prizes to its participants and will go on till September 2015.
The competition consists of two aspects. First, children are expected to design and create a till (within the dimensions of length 8 inches x width 8 inches x height 8 inches) and make it as creative and innovative as they wish. 
Secondly, the competition will reward the entrant who managed to save the most amount of money within the given period of time. 
Two awards will be given – one to the most creative till in Sri Lanka and the other, for the till with the highest amount of cash which has been saved for the duration of the competition. Apart from the main prizes, a creative till winner will be selected from every branch around the country and rewarded with Rs. 5,000 Tikiri gift voucher while all participants will receive a Rs. 100 savings deposit to their Tikiri account from the bank. The competition is open to both existing and new ‘Seylan Tikiri’ Account Holders below 10 years of age.
“Creativity and out-of-the-box thinking is crucial in a child’s formative years and it is precisely this which Seylan Bank hopes to inculcate through this children’s competition. In a world where technology has taken precedence, creativity and simple innovation sometimes suffers and we hope that this competition will provide a much needed impetus to encourage originality among children,” said Tilan Wijeyesekera, Deputy General Manager – Marketing and Personal Banking, Seylan Bank, speaking about the significance of the competition. 
Wijeyesekera highlighted the importance of inculcating a mind-set of saving in children at a young age in order to prepare for the future. “Encouraging values such as saving among children helps build a strong financial foundation for them in their later years. The till was once an omnipresent object in every household at one point in time and an integral part of a family household which resulted in savings being an inevitable part of a child’s life.  This competition will help in revitalizing the nostalgic fondness for the savings till while encouraging children to start saving for the future.”
Seylan Bank’s minor savings scheme, ‘Seylan Tikiri’, has a history spanning 23 years and is one of the most sought after children’s savings accounts in Sri Lanka. It offers a benefits based savings scheme for children. Gifts for accountholders vary from video game pads, organs, scooters and remote controlled helicopters to bicycles, tabs and LED TVs, depending on their account balance. The Seylan Bank Creative Till Competition will conclude on 05th September 2015.
