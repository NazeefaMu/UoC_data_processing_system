Four Chinese nationals were arrested this morning at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) by the airport customs officers while trying to smuggle cigarettes worth Rs. 3.5million into the country, Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayaka said.

The suspects were arrested at the customs Green Channel while trying to escape customs officials.
The four suspects, two men (aged 53 and 45) and two women (aged 27 and 30) arrived in the country at 5.40 a. m from Kunming, China.

During the investigations, officers found 410 cigarette cartons made in China packed in to their luggage.

“There is a trend developing in the country for Chinese cigarettes. Several Chinese brands were seized earlier on numerous occasions confirming that there is a trend in the Sri Lankan market,” Mr. Basnauyaka said.

The raid was conducted under the direction of customs Director J.R. Uduwawala, Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake and Darshana Silva while investigations are being carried out by the Customs Director J.R. Samarakoon. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
