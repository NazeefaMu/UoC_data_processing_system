The Bribery Commission today withdrew all three ongoing cases against former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake over non-declaration of assets in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya acquitted Dr. Bandaranayake after Senior State Council Dilan Rathnayake, who appeared for the Bribery Commission, informed the court about the withdrawal of the cases.

Ms. Bandaranayake’s passport was released and the restraining order on traveling abroad was removed by the court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
