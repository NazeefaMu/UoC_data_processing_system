Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday vowed to bounce back and not to leave again, assuring to bring his followers to the ‘required places’.

Addressing the final day rally of the Jana Satana Paada Yathra at Lipton Circus in Colombo, Mr. Rajapaksa said if the people who followed him are ready, he was also ready for future political agendas.

He also said when the government was alerted that hundred thousands of people were making their way to the streets against the government, instilling fear in the government.

He reiterated that they would not stop their journey even if they were jailed for crimes, which he said were not committed.

“We should clearly say that the fate of previous dictators who ruled various countries of the world, will befall this pair too. There are also many parties that back the dictatorship of this government relying on temporary benefits according to a prepared agenda,” he said.

National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said some ‘sudden construction activities’ had been started by the Colombo Municipality, at Hyde Park Grounds where the rally was originally planned to be held.

He also threatened to surround the city of Colombo disrupting the day-to-day activities, if the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperative Agreement (ETCA) is finalized or the proposed Hybrid Court is set up in the country.

Wasudeva Nanayakkara, the President of Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) criticized the Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council for rejecting the request made by them to reserve the Hyde Park Grounds for the rally.

“Where are the people and usual trade activities in Colombo City today? We were successful because we could turn the city of Colombo into a hartal day today,” MP Nanayakkara said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
