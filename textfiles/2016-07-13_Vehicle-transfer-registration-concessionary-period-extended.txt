Vehicle transfer registration concessionary period extended


	

A concessionary period of three months had been given for vehicle owners to apply for vehicle ownership transferring, cabinet co-spokesman Gayantha Karunathilake said today.

While addressing the media at the Cabinet briefing, Minister Karunathilake said the government has lost a large amount of revenue and also it has caused several difficulties for the law enforcement authority as ownership-transferred vehicles are being used by the new owners for a longer period without being registered.

“A late fee was introduced by the Motor Traffic Regulations published in 2011to minimize the trend. But it had not achieved its target,” the Minister said.

The proposal was made by the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva to grant a concessionary period of three months and a concession on the additional late fee to encourage the vehicle owners to register transfer of motor vehicles. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
