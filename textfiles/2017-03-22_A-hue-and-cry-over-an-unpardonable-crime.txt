A hue and cry over an ‘unpardonable crime’


	



 

A large number of peasants in Uva had the ownership of their holdings regularized when they received title deeds from Number One in yahapalanaya at a grand ceremony held recently.   

 


However, the extravagant spending on the ceremony by the organizers had raised the eye brows of Number One as well as other VIPs who attended the ceremony.


It had come to light that the big council looking after the province had spent nearly Rs.10 million on the event. 


The Red members of the provincial council have already decided to raise this matter at the next sittings of the council. They say that incurring such a massive expenditure on an event like this in a country where the government has to print paper money to pay the salaries of its public servants is an unpardonable crime.
