The Cabinet gave the nod for the electoral reforms that would elect 238 members at the forthcoming Parliamentary polls, with an increase of 13 members to the current 225 member Parliament, Cabinet Spokesman and Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing, he said the number of members elected directly by the voters would be increased to 173 from current 160 with the reintroduction of multi member constituencies to give a fair representation of minorities.
“We expect to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution next week with two thirds majority and the 20th Amendment that contains proposed electoral reforms soon after that. There will be no parliamentary elections before the approval of two pieces of legislations and the next general elections will be held under the new mixed electoral system,” he said.
Minister Senaratne said a three member committee comprising him, Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera and TNA national list member M.A. Sumanthiran has been appointed in charge of preparing the draft of the new electoral mechanism. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
