The Postal Department today issued a circular immediately cancelling the leaves of all its employees from June 13 to 14, soon after postal trade unions announced that they would launch a 48-hour countrywide token strike midnight today.

Post Master General Rohana Abeyrathne told Daily Mirror that the circular was sent to all the offices across the country and that disciplinary action will be taken against those who neglect the administrative decision.

“The issuance of a circular cancelling the leaves of employees prior to a strike is not unusual. The circular was issued to avoid any disruption to the postal services. This practice is adopted by other state institutions as well,” he said.

Earlier today, United Postal Trade Union’s Front President Chinthaka Bandara said that they would conduct a 48-hour strike midnight today.

When contacted, he said they were aware of the circular but said would continue with the strike as planned.

He said 21,000 employees attached to 3,410 sub post offices, 640 post offices and around 100 control offices will participate in the scheduled trade union action. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
