Two super-vehicles belonging to a key Ministry have been released for use by private parties on the orders of the purohita in charge.

 


One of these two vehicles is being deployed to meet the transport needs at the party headquarters and the other has been released for use by a friendly backbencher.


The purohita had ordered the release of these two vehicles ignoring the objections raised by the ministry secretary, they say.
