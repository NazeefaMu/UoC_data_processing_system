BY A.S. Fernando.
Each planet has its strong and weak aspects. A well- developed mount with good markings shows its strength. Grilles, cross bars, islands and crosses weaken the good effects of a mount. A vertical line adds strength to any mount. In some hands, all mounts are found equally developed without bad signs. Such hands indicate a well-balanced character endowed with good qualities derived from all mounts. Owners of such hands are even-tempered, broad-minded, amiable persons who hold positions of eminence and prominence in society. If there are only two well developed mounts, the subject would possess a combination of qualities germane to the two mounts. In such a case, the mount redder than the other with a clear vertical line should be considered the stronger one.


In all cases, a mount should be read together with its finger. The qualities as signified by the length, smoothness or knottiness, type of the tip and the nail of the finger should be carefully harmonized with those of the mount in making predictions. Such a synthesis would bring forth the health defects of the subject.

 

Mount of Jupiter
A strong red line on the Mount of Jupiter between the first and second fingers indicates the weakness of intestines. A single vertical line on this Mount as on any other mount, adds to the strength of the mount. It is a line of success.


Two vertical lines on the mount show failure in achieving the target due to wavering between two goals.


A line crossing a branch of Line of Heart below signifies a disappointment in a love relationship. Crossed hair lines on the Mount indicate a head injury.


Star, circle, triangle, square, trident, and single vertical line add strength to the mount. Grille, cross bar, island, horizontal lines, dot or cross point to defects in health and character. A cross on the mount signifies success in marriage. A triangle on the Mount shows that the subject is a clever politician.
Health troubles include biliousness, rheumatism, nerves, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, ear troubles, predisposition to suicidal pessimism.

 

Mount of Apollo or Sun
The markings which add strength to this Mount singly or in combination are the star, triangle, square, trident or the single vertical line.


A single deep and straight line on this mount signifies wealth or fame or both and the subject pursues one single career during his life time.


Two lines mean real talent, but the full potential is not exploited. A sister line of the Sun Line portends great success.


Many confused lines show that inspiration has stopped short of realization of the goals. A spot on the mount means the danger of losing reputation. A star on the mount with a good Line of Sun assures fame as a genius. A square on the mount foretells great financial success. A circle on the mount brings the subject much fame. A triangle on it means high honours in the field of arts.


Health troubles indicated by bad signs are weak eyes, heart trouble, sunstroke and fever.
