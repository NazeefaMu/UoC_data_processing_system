Fmr. JMO’s anticipatory bail application: Court notices respondents


	

Considering the anticipatory bail application filed by Former Colombo Chief Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Ananda Samarasekera, requesting bail requesting bail anticipating arrest over the missing body parts of late Wasim Thajudeen, Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Attygalle noticed the OIC of the CID Homicide Division to respond on August 30.

Dr. Samarasekara earlier filed a Fundamental Rights petition against the imminent infringement of his fundamental rights in relation to the ongoing investigation into the death of Thajudeen.

An anticipatory bail application can be filed by an individual seeking bail in anticipation or in expectation of being named or accused of having committed a non-bailable offense.

In the application, the complainant cited the OIC of the CID Homicide Division as the respondent. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
