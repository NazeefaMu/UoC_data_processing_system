President Maithripala Sirisena should exercise Executive Powers, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of the country, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake said today.

He told Parliament that the President had claimed that he would not give Ministerial portfolios to the SLFPers, who crossed over to the Government but he offered portfolios to those who supported him.

"The President offered portfolios to those who supported to ensure his power irrespective of their party. But he is refusing to give portfolios when they are supporting another one's power," he said.

The MP said the President should exercise his Executive Powers not for his own benefit but for the benefit of the country.

Speaking during the second day of the adjournment debate on abolishing Executive Presidency, he said the Rajapaksa faction, which insulted and disgraced the Speaker was now admiring him when he accepted Mahinda Rajapaksa as Opposition Leader.

"Those who criticised and insulted Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should now apologize to him for doing so," he said.

He said the Executive Presidency was not answerable to the people and added that it had not only endangered democracy of the country but also democracy of political parties.

He said a Premiership answerable to the people and Parliament should be introduced in place of the destructive Executive Presidency.(Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
