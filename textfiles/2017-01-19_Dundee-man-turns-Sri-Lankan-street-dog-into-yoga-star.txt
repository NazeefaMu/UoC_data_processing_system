Dundee man turns Sri Lankan street dog into yoga star


	

A yoga instructor from Dundee, Scotland has told the amazing story of how the dog he rescued while on holiday has become his student.

Finlay Wilson enjoyed a trip to Sri Lanka last January with his partner, where he regularly practised yoga.

Each morning as he practised, Finlay would be joined by an inquisitive young stray dog.

Dismayed at the way local people treated the animal, Finlay grew close to the curious dog, who he later named Amaloh.

Upon leaving Sri Lanka, Finlay decided to adopt Amaloh.



After his new pet spent nine months in quarantine, Finlay and Amaloh were finally reunited and now enjoy sharing their yoga poses with fans.

Finlay revealed: “One of the videos we’ve done has had 775,000 views. Everyone loves a dog video and random yoga videos.

“Maybe it’s because it’s January as well and everyone is into their fitness.

“I would roll out the mat (while in Sri Lanka) and Amaloh would trot up, he was maybe a year or a year and a half old.



“I was shocked at the way the people where I stayed treated him. They would kick him.

“When I woke up in the morning Amaloh used to be sitting outside my room.

“I’ve always had dogs and when I saw the way he was treated and how sweet he was I decided to take him home.”

By sharing examples of their work together, the pair have gathered quite a fan base.

Finlay explained: “Amaloh is actually pretty good.

“If I put my elbows down, he puts his down. If I put my hands on the floor, he does the same.

“It’s not just that I’m exercising, yoga makes me a bit more mindful. It’s the entire well being yoga gives.

“It helps keep me human. If I’m not doing yoga you wouldn’t want to be around me.”

Finlay, who has been studying yoga for 10 years after injury prevented him from pursuing an interest in lacrosse continued:

“Loads of charities have been in touch since the video went up and now it’s creeping up to one million views.

“When I first met Amaloh he was malnourished, covered in bugs and you could see every rib.

“He arrived here in late September and in the last two months he’s become a lot more comfortable.

“When I get on the mat he cuts some shapes and sees it as play time.”(The Courier)
