AG tasked with seizing monies earned illegally


	

The Attorney General’s attention has been drawn to immediately seize the property earned through illegal means from the Central Bank Bond issuance by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL), other companies affiliated to it and other personnel, the President’s Media Unit (PMD) said.  

 It said even though the Bond Commission had recommended that civil cases be filed to recover the losses incurred by the government, the Attorney General’s Department would take action to amend the Civil Law procedures as civil cases usually take time to complete.   
To circumvent the envisaged delays, the Commission had recommended to the Attorney General that a Parliament Act should be passed to recover the money owed to the EPF and the Government without violating the Constitution.   
This was discussed at length during a meeting the President had with the Attorney General, Central Bank Governor, Director General of the Bribery Commission and other officials at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday morning.
