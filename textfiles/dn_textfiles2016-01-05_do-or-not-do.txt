TO DO OR NOT TO DO

 
“Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn” –responds Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind to Scarlett O’Hara’s question, “Where shall I go? What shall I do?”
Three hundred and sixty five days later, here we are at the dawn of yet another new year. Asking ourselves the same question, and secretly jotting down our own to-do lists
NEW seems to be a word at the tip of every tongue. The New Year comes with new hopes, new dreams and a chance to turn your life around by aspiring to become a better person. The secret resolution lists jotted down in your diary, is bound to make the new 365 days more productive as well as adventurous. By planning a to-do list, you are egging yourself on to turn into the complete person that you were meant to be.
It our chance to re-evaluate life choices, and to retrospect. And an opportunity to UT aside the procrastination, and get on the right track. Forgot something last year? Why not add it to this year’s resolution list and have a chance at making a few much needed lifetime changes.
But can you really stick to it? Can you pu t the words into action and actually make an effort, or are you just addicted to making lists?
A History of Resolutions
Recently I came across a collection of interesting lists, maintained by certain important personalities, in order to keep track of themselves, as they step into another year, full of possibilities. As human beings, each and every one of us have hundreds of hopes and dream piled away in our head, whether it is in a quiet little corner of our heat, scribbled among our diary pages or written in caps half across your bedroom wall. Making lists depend on the people. Here is a look at some of history’s more uncommon resolution lists from the journals, letters, and private effects of cultural icons.
Jonathan Swift the author of Gulliver’s Travels —gathered a list of 17 goals for his far future, titled “When I come to be old.” Focusing on intelligence, humility, endurance, and fairness. Some of which I found quite interesting, enough to add to my own list.
“Not to scorn present Ways, or Wits, or Fashions, or Men, or War, &c.” Scorning at things that you don’t agree with in life, would not get you anywhere, Swift’s witty resolution must have saved him from quite a load of unnecessary hate.

He also aspired to “Not to talk much, nor of myself.” This could indeed come in handy in the modern times. Where we find people posting the ingredients of their breakfast on social media.
The Singer-songwriter Johnny Cash was in love with the fellow country star June Carter, in 1968, 13 years after first meeting her.
Their relationship stood the test of time and they remained together until her death, 35 years later. In a famous to-do list, he aspired “To kiss June” and “Not kiss anyone else”. “Cough”, “Eat”, “Not eat too much”, were among his other things to be accomplished.
Funnily enough I came across a “TO DO LIST” or a list of “CONDITIONS”, that Albert Einstein wrote to his wife, that he assumed to sustain the wreck that was their 11 year marriage.
Among the things he had things that “You will makes sure”, “Things that you will forgo” and the “Things to obey in the relationship between the two”. In his note he goes on to say “You will renounce all personal relations with me insofar as they are not completely necessary for social reasons.”
Which made me wonder if anyone today must be writing lists of the sort!
Einstein and Milena did not survive with the help of the “demanding” to do list, and divorced a few months afterwards.
To NOT to Do
To do lists often go unnoticed, and forgotten after the hype. It has been proven that abstaining from things are easier than starting new things all over again. So why not go ahead and make a not to do list, to at least quit all those unhealthy habits that got you into heaps of trouble last year?
When making a resolution start with two questions: “Why am I not doing this already?” and “Why should I f need to do this?” It is quite practical as the first question seeks the barrier, and the second gives you the necessary motivation, to get yourself together and initiate enough desire to overcome the obstacles.
Be more specific with your resolutions. Instead of saying I will read more books this year, make a list of the books that you plan on reading or buying this year and save up and get ahead and tick each out of the list. It does not have to be a physical list that we are talking about. It could all be in your head, but as long as you are keeping everything under control, your resolutions would not go down the drain like the last year’s one did.
Set healthy and achievable goals. “I will lose all my Christmas weight” can be rephrased as “I will try my best to workout 20 minutes a day and eat healthy. It isn’t about the resolution itself, it is about how you plan to achieve it without being a procrastinator.
If you have a passion, allocate more time for it this year, make art if you are an artist, write if you are a writer, dance if you are a dancer! Follow your passions no matter what they are, you would need a little love and hope to get by in the fast pacing world among all the work and busy lifestyle you would have to lead. So give yourself some love!!!!
