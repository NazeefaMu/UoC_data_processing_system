The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga and the Cricket Board on 25 incidents of allegations including misuse of Board positions and other frauds.  
The party also charged the Cricket Executive Committee and Interim Managing Committee of the same allegations.
 JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti charged Mr. Ranatunga had appeared as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Cricket Board though he was only the secretary.
“Mr. Ranatunga received all the blessings from the former government to continue to function as the secretary as well as the CEO. This is a grave violation of laws. Mr. Ranatunga held a major role in Mihin Lanka as well as in the SLC. The broadcasting of cricket matches was also given to a private channel, in which again he was the CEO, without a proper procedure,” charged Mr. Handunnetti.
He also alleged the funds of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority had been used for the construction of the International Cricket stadium at Sooriyawewa in Hambantota.
“The action of the Cricket officials had an effect on the performance of the talented cricketers. If these officials continue to function, it will be detrimental for the wellbeing of Sri Lanka cricket.  We requested the new sports minister a meeting to discuss the problems in the SLC but so far we didn’t receive a reply,” he said.
