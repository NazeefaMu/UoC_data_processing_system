A tall order from a politico


	

A certain politician had to present a critique on a recently published book running into 845 pages. Convinced that he had no time and patience to finish reading the book, he asked a personal aide to read the book in a day and give its substance in a nutshell.



The aide who had to attend to a multitude of other duties was not able to read more ten pages of the book during the day. The following morning the politician asked the aide to brief him on the contents of the book and the latter had replied that he could not finish reading it adding he be given at least two weeks’ time to read the entire book. Highly provoked by this reply, the politician had hurled the book at his aide.
