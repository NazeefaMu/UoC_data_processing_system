TNA to Govt:You haven't fooled us


	

The Government should not think it has fooled the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), MP M A Sumanthiran told Parliament yesterday.

"Don't think you have fooled us just because we support you on constitutional reforms and vote in favour of the budget," he said.

He said the government should expedite the process of devolving power and honour its promise to the international community.

He urged the government to set up an office to probe disappearances. (Yohan Perera)
