Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) yesterday lodged a complaint at the Commission to Investigate and Alleviate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to investigate into the alleged inducements offered to MP Palitha Range Bandara and several politicians. They also produced a CD of selected voice recordings highlighting alleged offers of Rs. 500 million for MP crossovers. Pix by Damith Wickramasinghe
