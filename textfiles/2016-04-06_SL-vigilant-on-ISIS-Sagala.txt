Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday that thorough and continuous investigations were in progress to find whether ISIS operations were in Sri Lanka.

He said a dialogue had been initiated with the co-ordination of Muslim politicians, religious leaders, the Education Ministry, the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs, civil society organisations and All Ceylon Jamaiyathul Ulama and National Shoora Council to prevent the Muslim community from extremist activities.

Besides, he said immigration and emigration of Muslims to and from the countries plagued by ISIS terrorism were supervised. Also, he said action had been taken to avoid the propagation of extremist ideas through social media.

The Minister said this in reply to a question by Government MP S.M. Marikkar in this regard. He denied reports on the internet that the Special task Force carried out an operation in Dehiwala area during the last three months.

Mr. Marikkar said a grave insult had been done to the Muslims of Sri Lanka by such false propogandain cyber space by loyalists of the previous regime that ISIS operations were in Sri Lanka. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
