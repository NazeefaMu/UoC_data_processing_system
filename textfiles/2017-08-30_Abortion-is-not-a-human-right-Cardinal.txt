Abortion is not a human right - Cardinal


	

Abortion cannot be considered as a human right as claimed by some, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said over the weekend.

“Some claim that abortion is a human right. Right to kill is not a human right. Human rights are there to save lives not to end them,” cardinal said at a service in Thewatte Basilica on Sunday.

“ Even the previous government tied to ease the abortion laws and now we here that this government is also out to do the same. Catholic Bishops Conference which issued a statement on the matter has been criticized by some,” he added.

Cardinal Ranjith said all children are born according to God’s will and no one is born outside his will. He said even those who are differently-abled keep their parents together and play a role in ensuring well-being of their families.
