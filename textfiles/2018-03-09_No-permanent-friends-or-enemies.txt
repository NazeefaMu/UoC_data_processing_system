No permanent friends or enemies


	



The saying goes that the world has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests. This applies to politics as well. Seen here is UPFA Minister Susil Premajayantha, a stalwart of the government seated next to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and sharing a moment at the funeral of Ven. Daranagama Kusaladhamma Thera in Colombo yesterday. Minister Premajayantha sparked a controversy after he met Mr. Rajapaksa following the latter’s Local Government poll victory last month.
