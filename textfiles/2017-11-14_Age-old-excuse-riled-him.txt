Age-old excuse riled him


	



This purohita once held high office.  He had the other day tried to phone a colleague in the top team for an urgent matter and had abused in choice Sinhala the colleague’s aide when the latter had given the stock reply: “Sir is at a conference!” every time he called.

 


An exasperated purohita had demanded: “Umbalage amathiya sakachchakarana ekamada karanne, yako?” and proceeded to harangue him with a stream of filth. 


The colleague who wanted to make amends had rung up the purohita soon afterwards, but the purohita still simmering with anger had scolded him too and hung up saying: “I don’t want any help from you!”
