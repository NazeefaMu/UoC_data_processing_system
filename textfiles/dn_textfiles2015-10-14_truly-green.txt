Truly GREEN!

State Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Management Vasantha Senanayake's guiding light is his conscience. His principles are his rock. The Daily News features this principled politician who feels that spirituality is inside you.
Early days

Being an only child he studied at S.Thomas' Prep. He did his O/Ls there and did his A/Ls as a private candidate. He then went to England for a brief period and did his LLB there.
After coming back to Sri Lanka he entered politics for the traditional reason that many of his family members including his great grandfather D.S. Senanayake have been in politics.
"I have always acted according to my conscience. My conscience and my instinct go together. It is very difficult sometimes in politics to do that, because you sometimes feel one way and you have to sometimes toe the party line. Then it is difficult. But I have always tried my best to act according to my conscience and it is always backed with my instincts. I think I have got into politics for the right reason. Which is, you try to do something for the people. Which is what I have really tried to do. And coupled with the fact that I have worked hard, I have become successful. Hard work is always a vital component to success," says the young politician.
Vasantha has done his LLM degree at Kothalawala Defence University. At this point he is finishing his thesis and hopes to do his doctorate after that.
Secrets!
"My school years were very interesting. In our time technology was not so advanced. There were no mobile phones to text messages like what is happening today. What we used to do was write these long letters of love and poems. And in my letters I used to spray a little bit of cologne into my letters! It was the cologne I used to wear. So each time the letter was opened, the scent of cologne came out! So looking back it was quite funny. But children nowadays don't do silly things like that. But it was silly and romantic in its own way. A great meeting point those days were fairs and carnivals and places like the Liberty Plaza," he smiles.
So what next?
"The girls came at a particular time and the boys would also come there and usually there was 'the girl's' mother who followed her. We would always try to find a time to try and avoid the mother and either slip a note to the girl without the mother seeing this! Sometimes we succeeded sometimes we didn't. So this was always a very tricky but sweet issue. But it is different from what it is nowadays. I met my wife through her friends who went to Ladies College. It was a wide circle of people who knew each other. We were round about the same age, I was just one year older."
His challenges
Senanayake has faced many challenges in life. He feels that sometimes in politics you feel that you do not get the due recognition that you should have got. That is a constant factor that keeps coming out. He has often felt that he has been overlooked or ignored sometimes. But Vasantha maintains that in politics you can't let that affect you. You have to go on despite the fact that you think you do not get what you deserve. That does not mean that you should throw in the towel and quit. You have to continue, that is the reality of politics.
Another challenge this young politician outlined, that is common to many, is to sit with people whose values are very different and try to work together. He feels that this is very hard when you have a certain set of principles and a set of values.
In politics people think that you are a lot more powerful than you really are. This Vasantha feels is a drawback. As the State Minister today and as a Deputy Minister in the past, he knew the amount of things that he could do. But people sometimes expect you to be a magician who can wave a wand and do miraculous things which often you are not able to do. It is a challenge to be able to keep the people's faith in you yet understand your own limitations and try and work around it.
You have so much technology in your hands. But you need to balance or be able to balance technological advancement with the culture of this country. Understanding of the history of this country comes first. You must look at the international arena as well and not be frogs in the well and be limited with what you see around you in your community. You must look at the greater picture as well. All this has to be done with a balance. Know your history, know your culture and then embrace what is from outside and blend it in a way that suits your culture and country.
Exemplary figures
Senanayake admires the Buddha for the Dhamma he brought saying that Buddhism is a noble philosophy. Despite the fact that he is not a Christian, he is also inspired by the life and teachings of Christ. He also admires Geoffrey Bawa and David Paynter for their artistic brilliance. He admires the poet Anne Ranasinghe, Lester James Peries, Iranganie Serasinghe and Ena de Silva for their contribution to the arts and creativity.
"There are even politicians whose politics itself I may disagree with, but their commitment to their cause I may admire. Dr. N .M. Perera and Colvin R De Silva may fall into this category."
"I admire Otara Gunawardena for her commitment to animal rights and wildlife and Jezima Ismail, J.S.L Fernando and R I T Alles for their commitment to education, and also Rajiva Wijesinha, who I think is a little too idealistic for today's politics!"
Books, movies and sports
Minister Senanayake is a history buff who like reading on true life crime and mystery also. Some authors he has enjoyed reading are Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, Alexander Dumas and Leo Tolstoy and Martin Wickremasinghe's writings on country life in Sri Lanka. His favorite novel ever despite being a one off was Arundathi Roy's 'God of Small Things.' He enjoys reading about the Pharaohs of Egypt and about figures from Greek and Roman history, the Romanov's of Russia and of course Sri Lankan history. His favorite poet is T. S. Elliot.
Minister Senanayake is no fan of modern music saying that heavy metal gives him a headache! He prefers old music in English and Sinhala, and mind you this is really old music! Even before his time! Jazz is his preference when it comes to English, liking Frank Sinatra, Fitzgerald and Eta James, Louis Armstrong, Dean Martins and Marilyn Monroe. When it comes to Sinhala music it would be Chitral Somapala and the older music. Though not a fan of Michael Jackson he quite likes the Jackson Five.
His taste is mostly 50's and 60's. Post 80's is not his cup of tea except for that odd song!
"I watched one American Idol series that I quite enjoyed because a lot of the numbers they were singing were older numbers! And there was one particular artiste on American Idol that I really thought was fabulous, and I still think he is fabulous and I stopped watching American Idol when he didn't win it! He came second. The artiste is David Archuleta. He is the most fabulous performer I have ever seen in recent times and I was so sad he didn't make it. A person I consider to be very inferior - David Cook won. I was so shocked I didn't want to watch it again.

I like to listen to composers and various people playing the piano and orchestra music."
The Minister is also a huge fan of movies based on true stories that have a strong element of reality in it. Those are the movies he can relate to understand and enjoy. These are movies like the 'Last King of Scotland' which was on Idi Amin and the 'Queen' was on Diana's death and how the Royal Family and the Queen dealt with the situation. Another movie he likes is 'The Blood Diamond'. Even though the characters were fictitious it was based on an actual ongoing situation - the blood diamonds that are mined in Africa.
When it comes to sports the sports he is interested in is Badminton and Swimming. Van Gough is one of his favorite artists and he counts Van Gough's 'Olive Trees' and the 'Starry Night' as his favorites.
Spirituality
"I have my own views on spirituality. My own view is you don't need to go to a temple or religious place to practice. I think what is right and wrong is naturally in a human being's conscience. If you don't listen to your conscience for long enough perhaps you cannot hear it. But from childhood if you listen to your conscience then spirituality is inside you. You have to be intelligent enough to listen to that spirituality."
