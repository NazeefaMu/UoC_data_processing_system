The Kilinochchi Magistrate yesterday ordered the release Balachandran Jeyakumari’s daughter Vibushika who was in the custody of the Mahadewa Children’s Home in Kilinochchi.
Balachandran Jeyakumari was earlier arrested by the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) on charges of having provided accommodation for former LTTE activist Gobi.
She was later released on bail but her daughter had been handed over to the Children’s Home by the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) on a Court order.
The case which was filed against Balachandran Jeyakumari was also later withdrawn by the TID. (Subramanium Baskaran)
