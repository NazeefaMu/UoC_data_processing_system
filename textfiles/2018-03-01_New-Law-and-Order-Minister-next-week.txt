A new Law and Order Minister would be sworn in next week, sources close to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

The new Minister of Law and Order was to be sworn in this week but it was delayed because of the tense situation in Ampara.

Currently, the Law and Order Ministry comes under the Prime Minister.

“The incumbent Law and Order Minister, who is the incumbent Prime Minister, is engaged in dealing with the situation in Ampara and therefore the swearing-in of the new Minister had to be postponed to next week,” sources said.
