JANAKA BOGOLLAGAMA:

Its hard to believe that Janaka, a man full of life, the joys of spring, joie’de’virve and generosity of spirit has been gone for seven years. I was very close to this family for many years, shared in all their moments of joy, sorrow, and celebration. When he was struck down with this fatal illness, I spent much time in hospital talking to him in his room, sometimes on my own, often with Sunetra, his devoted wife, who had to be persuaded to go home and rest from time to time. In the time that we were on our own, Janaka’s main subjects of conversation were his worries about his children and his wife; he was concerned as to how they would fare without his presence which was their constant symbol of stability. He had provided for them, more than abundantly, but he knew they had to be guided on using their vast resources wisely and guiding their own destinies, with wisdom, business acumen and foresight. Next to his family, his main concern was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, he was one like me and a handful of others, whose loyalty to the PM stood firmly and surely right through, unmoved by the shifting sands of victory and defeat. I recall an instance when I was sitting by him, when Ranil came to see him in hospital, he was very ill but his face lit up with joy and he forgot his own pain and worries about his family while he talked to his distinguished visitor.  


Janaka was a rare being, always thinking of others and how he could help them to weather the storms and tempests of life. He had absolutely no deviousness and never played both sides against the middle. He was a model employer, deeply loved by all his employees, who he cared for as if they were his own family and they adored and respected him in return. His generosity to the underprivileged in all categories, the needy, injured soldiers, families of those killed in battle, victims of the Tsunami, to temples in all parts of our country, in addition to his hometown, Kurunegalla and the NWP have been of great magnitude. His death has and always will be a great loss to the UNP. He never spared time or expense if the party was in need. For me too, it is a loss of a friend who is difficult to replace. He would call me often to ask for my advice on personal matters and drop in with mangoes and coconuts for me. His love of sports was perhaps the inspiration for his unerring sense of justice and fair play towards all beings.To find these qualities today, in whatever field one might think of is like finding a needle in a haystack.

Janaka was at school at Ananda College and wad Public schools champion in tennis. He played this game right through to the end till his illness compelled him to give it up. He was President of the Badminton Association in the North Western Province,President of the Kurunegala club for 15 years and the only person from an outstation to be President of the SLTA. He was also President of the Wayamba Chamber of Commerce. Although a devout Buddhist, as a benefactor to one and many, he thought far beyond the narrow peripheries of caste, race or creed. He has helped families in Trincomalee, and later did the same after the tsunami. He sponsored almost all sports events in Kurunegala and built seven temples in NWP, but never rejected pleas from Churches and other religious organisations for help, all these were given with his kind smile. Janaka thrived on freedom and was a free spirit. His life has left a gaping vacuum in the lives of his family and all who loved him. I can think of no better words than those of Christina Rossetti, which I think Janka would be saying to his family and all those who loved him.  


‘Remember me when I am gone away  


Gone far away to the silent land.  


When you can no more hold me by the hand, nor I half turning to go, yet turning stay.  


Remember me when no more day by day, you tell me of our future that you planned.  


Only remember me, you understand. It will be too late to counsel then or pray.  


Yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember, do not grieve.   


For if the darkness and corruption leave, a vestige of the thoughts that I once had. Better by far you should forget and smile,than you should remember and be sad.’
