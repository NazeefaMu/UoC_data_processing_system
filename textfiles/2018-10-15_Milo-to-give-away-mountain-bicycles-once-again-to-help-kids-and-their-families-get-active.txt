1,000 lucky children will win brand new mountain bicycles courtesy of Milo to help kids and their families get active. To participate, all they need to do is collect a scratch card from the retailer with every purchase of a Milo RTD (Ready-To-Drink) pack and SMS the unique code to 6456 via any mobile network in the following format: MB<space>Code<space>Name<space>Age. The campaign will run till 30 November 2018 and winners will be chosen once in every two weeks through a raffle draw. The lucky winners will get the opportunity to pedal the streets of Colombo with their families at a grand bicycle parade. 

Said Mohamed Ali, Category Marketing Manager: “Milo has always been about ‘fuelling the winning spirit’ and inspiring kids to lead a healthy active lifestyle. We are encouraging children to add cycling to their daily routine, offering them a fun way to get active. Cycling has the advantage of being both a solo or group activity, and can help kids bond with friends and family and get fit together. It also helps create a sense of team spirit and promote friendly competition. This marks Milo’s fourth consecutive year of giving away mountain bicycles; we expect to receive a record-breaking number of entries this time, in comparison with previous years. The campaign’s growing popularity is a testament to the strong trust and love consumers have for the brand.”

He added that post this year’s give-a-ways, the brand would have provided 4,000 children in total with Milo mountain bicycles, through various initiatives.
