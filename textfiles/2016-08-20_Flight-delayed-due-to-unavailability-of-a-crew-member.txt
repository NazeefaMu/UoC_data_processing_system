A SriLankan Airlines flight UL554 from Frankfurt to Colombo was delayed by 15 hours due to late arrival of a flight crew member, SriLankan Airlines sources said.

The airline said it expects the flight to depart at 0400 UTC today once Frankfurt airport reopens after the scheduled night time closure.

“Due to unavailability of a flight crew member, the aircraft was unable to leave Frankfurt as scheduled last afternoon. All passengers affected by the delay have been provided with meals and accommodation. They will also be compensated as per EU regulations,” a spokesman for the airline said.
