South Asia Textile Industries Lanka is on a capacity expansion programme of Rs. 1 billion and, in tandem with that, has invested in an ERP solution in collaboration with IFS Applications.
"Under the capacity enhancement programme, we are acquiring state-of-the-art machinery for our production activities and with the connection to IFS Applications ERP, seamless production cycles are envisaged through better coordination of Machines with Information," said Madura Wijeweera, the Head of IT of South Asia Textile Industries Lanka.
IFS is a globally recognised leader in developing and delivering enterprise software for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) and Enterprise Service Management (ESM).
IFS brings customers in targeted sectors closer to their business, helps them be more agile and enables them to profit from change, said Priyantha Hapuarachchi, the Chief Financial Officer of South Asia Textile Industries Lanka, "The company is a preferred fabric supplier for some of the world's most renown brands, such Marks & Spencer, Decathlon, Levi's, DKNY, PUMA and NEXT, and with the confidence we have built with our buyers in terms of manufacturing excellence, quality and on time delivery the company has seen growth in top- and bottom-line performance in the past.
To keep up the growth momentum into the future, we are on a capacity expansion programme and the investment we have made in the IFS Applications 9 ERP solution is expected to payoff in terms of end-to-end planning and enhanced efficiency."
South Asia Textile Industries Lanka is a subsidiary company of Lanka Century Investments PLC and Ceylon Leather Products PLC.
