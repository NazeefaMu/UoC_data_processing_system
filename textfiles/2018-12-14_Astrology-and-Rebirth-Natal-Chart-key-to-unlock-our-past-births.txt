Feeling of déjà vu and strange dreams
Almost all reading this article may, no doubt, have had the occasion to experience the feeling at a new place they had visited that it was strangely familiar and that they had been there previously too.  One may get a similar feeling when one is attending a certain event as well.  How do you account for this sense of déjà vu?


You may in your dreams find yourselves in strange places meeting strange people or performing acts that are totally unconnected with your real life. How can you account for such strange dreams?


“We unconsciously carry forward experiences, attitudes and relationship dynamics from prior lives into our current lifetime…” psychotherapist Ann Borham says in her work, ‘The Past Life Perspectives – guided meditation or hypnosis’.       

 

Clues to previous birth in Vedic Astrology
There are several ways of using an individual’s Natal Chart to determine his past birth described in classical works on Vedic Astrology. According to Maha Rishi Parasara, as explained in Brihat Jataka, the past birth can be determined by the ruler of the decanate (Drekanna) occupied by the Sun or the Moon whichever is more powerful. The formula is as follows:  first determine of the Sun and the Moon, which is stronger. 


 If the lord of the decanate occupied by the stronger planet, is Jupiter, the native in his previous birth lived in a Deva Loka, in a realm of deities.  If the decanate is ruled by Venus or the Moon, the person has come from the World of Manes (Pitru Loka). There are several interpretations about what Pitru Loka is. But it is obvious that this Loka is the world of human beings.  If the decanate belongs to Sun or Mars the native is a comer from Tiriyag Loga or the world of animals. If Saturn or Mercury is the ruler of such a decanate, the person had lived in a Naraka Loka, an infernal realm or what we refer to in common parlance as hell.

 

Status of person in his previous birth
The status of the ruler of such a decanate whether it is exalted, ordinary or debilitated provides the clue to the status of the person in his previous birth; if the decanate lord is exalted, the person had held a high position in his previous birth, if the lord is debilitated, he would have occupied a menial position and the lord is ordinary, the person may have led a mediocre existence in his previous birth.
