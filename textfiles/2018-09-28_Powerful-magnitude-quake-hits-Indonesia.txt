Indonesia has been struck by a series of earthquakes today, including a 7.7 magnitude tremor, according to foreign reports.

The massive earthquake measuring 7.7 magnitude hit Indonesia today after a 6.1 tremor overnight.

The first magnitude 6.1 tremor hit 55km north west of Palu, Central Sulawesi at 3.01pm (local time), striking at a depth of 18.1km, according to data from the US Geological Survey (USGS).

This was followed by a 5.4 magnitude quake, which struck 77km north east of Palu, just minutes later at 3.03pm (local time).

At 3.29pm (local time) a 4.9 magnitude tremor hit 57km north of Palu. Tremors were felt as far as Bali.
The series of earthquakes all landed in the Ring of Fire, so-called because a huge number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions take place there.
It is not known yet if there are any injuries.

Indonesia straddles the highly volatile Pacific 'Ring of Fire', where many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

The country has been rocked by a string of deadly earthquakes on Lombok Island this summer, leaving more than 500 people dead.
About 390,000 people remain displaced after the quakes, according to Indonesia's disaster agency. (The Express)
