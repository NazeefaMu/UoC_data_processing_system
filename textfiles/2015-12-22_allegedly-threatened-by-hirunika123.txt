In a statement to the police a 26-year-old youth -- who was abducted by some supporters of parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra -- said he was personally threatened by her, the Police Spokesman said yesterday.
The drapery store employee identified as U. Priyankara told the Dematagoda Police that he was forcibly taken away by six men in a Land Rover Defender on Monday afternoon.
The victim who turned up at the police station around 10.00 p.m. that evening with injuries on his face and body said the men had forcibly taken him in a Defender to an undisclosed location where he was confronted by Ms. Premachandra.
Police said according to the victim's statement he had been asked by her to cease a relationship he was having with the wife of a close supporter of Ms. Hirunika.
However, it is unclear whether the youth had been assaulted by the gang prior to or after his confrontation with the MP. The abductors had reportedly left him on the road following the confrontation.
Although the MP had agreed to send her supporters to the police station immediately after she was contacted by the Dematagoda Police to inquire about the vehicle, registered in her name, used in the abduction, had failed to do so on even till last morning.
The Police were preparing to arrest the identified suspects when they surrendered to the Colombo Crime Division yesterday evening along with the Defender vehicle.
A Senior CCD officer said all six suspects were arrested and statements recorded and would also to record a statement from Ms. Hirunika as well.
The abducted youth who was produced before Colombo JMO on Monday night was admitted to the National Hospital. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
