ACCA Sri Lanka and BPO Academy collaborate in fostering shared finance services industry
	

The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) has launched its Global Business Services (GBS) qualifications, a suite of three qualifications which is dedicated to finance and accounting in the shared services and GBS sector.
The syllabus specifically aims to introduce the learner to the business model of shared services and outsourcing, particularly in relation to financial operations, and how such models differ from and offer efficiency benefits over, traditional central function based service provision. It also aims to teach some of the key business skills needed in a
GBS environment.
With finance and accounting having been identified as one of the key areas of excellence in the GBS sector in Sri Lanka,ACCA recently signed a strategic partnership with the Lanka BPO Academy. The agreement entails the Lanka BPO Academy to offer ACCAs GBS (Global Business Services products) qualificationsto strengthen and foster the finance talent in the GBS Sector in the country and to enhance awareness among those interested to pursue a career in the GBS sector, in finance shared services.
This agreement was formalized at a signing ceremony, with the Head of ACCA Sri Lanka Nilusha Ranasinghe and Yasas Abeywickrama, Director of the Lanka BPO Academy.
Nilusha Ranasinghe said, The GBS industry in Sri Lanka is on a trajectory for expansive growth, including in the finance and accounting services. Therefore, the ultimate aim of this partnership is to develop the accountancy and finance profession in the GBS sector in the country. With many multinational and local companies establishing their GBS operations here and with over 200,000 new jobs slated to be available in the sector by 2022, there is no better time for our young talents to build a successful and rewarding career in Sri Lanka s
GBS industry.
Abeywickrama also underlined the significance of this collaborative agreement and added that it will be a major boost to the GBS Sector which has been identified as major player in the economic growth and transformational development of Sri Lanka.
There is a high demand for finance professionals in the GBS sector and this prestigious partnership will help to accumulate more accountants to further enhance their skills and gain knowledge in the adoption of global standards in finance. We look forward to working together with ACCA on the key initiatives identified in our partnership agreement and to utilize this strategic collaboration to ensure Sri Lankas feasibility and readiness to cater to an increased range of financial services under the GBS industry, and further solidify our position within the top most globally preferred locations for GBS.

## Title: CCC slams govt. for imposing price controls on high-demand drugs

CCC slams govt. for imposing price controls on high-demand drugs
	
Sri Lankas premier trade chamber, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), yesterday in a strongly-worded statement slammed the governments move towards introducing price controls for certain medicinal drugs saying it limits the customer choice and distorts the market place. To the much surprise of the countrys pharmaceutical sector stakeholders, the Health Ministry through a gazette notification hastily introduced price controls on 48 high-demand drugs, presumably with the good intention of creating public access to medicinal drugs at affordable prices.
Though the intentions may have been good, the CCC noted that such ad-hoc moves, distorting the market, could have a lot of negative unintended consequences to the consumer, market place as well as to the overall countrys economy.
It severely impacts private sector decision making, harms Sri Lankas international standing as an open economy, restricts consumers/patients ability to make free choices based on their individual affordability, and creates overall distortionary effects that hamper a smooth functioning of markets, CCC said. And added, The CCC strongly urges the government to refrain from introducing ad-hoc, poorly designed and unviable regulations, that cause undesirable market distortions and undermines the countrys overall socio-economic goals.
As the trade chamber points out, Sri Lanka has a strong and accessible public healthcare system, complemented by a quality private healthcare system that is catering to evolving needs of the Sri Lankan people.
While all Sri Lankans, regardless of socio-economic conditions, have access to free public healthcare, patients have the freedom to seek private healthcare as well, particularly medicinal drugs from private providers. In this context, the CCC argues that the new pricing rules are hurting the efficient operation of the private healthcare market and are hurting consumer choice.
While Sri Lanka has a small local pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, it accounts for approximately less than 10 percent of the private sector supply and 90 percent is supplied by private firms who are the designated local agents for pharmaceuticals imported from international principals. It is these private providers who largely import generics or branded generics and originators.
According to the CCC the new pricing system that has been announced is one derived from the Indian model, suitable for a large domestic market with a substantial domestic drug-manufacturing base and not for Sri Lanka.
This pricing mechanism uses the median price of any drug that commands a 2 percent or more market share (by volume). In most instances, the median price is a branded Indian generic due to the large volumes of such drugs sold in the Sri Lankan market. As a result, most originator brands are faced with an unviable ceiling price, that is neither reflective of cost nor of quality.
This also means that prices of such drugs would be well below regional ceiling prices, which international providers operate on the basis of. The international firms would not want to subject their products to the possibility of unofficial arbitrage trade in the region, originating from Sri Lanka, the CCC pointed out. The trade chamber said it was aware of incidents over the past week of authorities having to seize drugs being brought illegally, as baggage goods by travellers, and all of these are items coming under the new price controls.
This is a clear indication of how economic actors will attempt to circumvent unviable controls, CCC stressed.
Meanwhile, with the majority of Sri Lankas pharmaceutical drug requirements depend on imports, where costs vary with every shipment due to exchange rate variability, fixed prices become highly infeasible, CCC pointed out.
Echoing recent statement by the country pharma chamber, Sri Lanka Chamber of Pharmaceutical Industry (SLCPI), the CCC said branded generic and originator drugs are strongly impacted by the new pricing rules, and can result in shortages as well as restrict patients choice.
Early reports indicate that several originator drug companies have signaled they would discontinue supplying to the Sri Lankan market, CCC noted.
In this backdrop, the trade chamber urged the pharma regulator to consider an automatic pass through for exchange rate volatilities, where a quarterly revision of prices is linked to Central Bank approved exchange rate.
In the absence of such a mechanism, a devaluation for instance would result in each pharma importer requiring NMRA pricing committee approval for price increases on all products stemming from a change over which the importer has no control.
Point out another possible dangerous scenario, the CCC warned that the recent gazette could prevent higher quality drugs developed with innovation in the originator countries coming into Sri Lanka
This affects not only individual choice of consumers, but also affects the countrys ability to continually access the newest medication. Moreover, price controls can lead to the proliferation of lower quality and counterfeit drugs, which is dangerous to public health, CCC cautioned.
Meanwhile, CCC said industry representatives, affiliated to the chamber, had pointed out that changes were made in an ad hoc manner and without full consultation with key industry stakeholders.
Moreover, the suggestion made by industry bodies of implementing a verifiable CIF (like in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Singapore) where it can be ensured that the CIF offered to Sri Lanka is not higher than the region, had not been given full consideration.
While the industry had clearly indicated support for a rational pricing mechanism, the process under which the new price controls were implemented is far from desirable, CCC said.

Donald Trump says he is 'last chance' as Hillary Clinton declares a 'moment of reckoning'
	
As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton criss-cross the United States in a final, frenzied burst of campaigning, the Republican has said he is the "last chance" to fix a broken country while his Democratic rival has said a "moment of reckoning" has arrived.
The two candidates in Tuesday's (local time) presidential election presented starkly different views of the nation and evoked similarly disparate reactions from crowds gathered to hear them speak.
With the cloud of an FBI investigation lifted, Mrs Clinton started her Sunday (local time) with a visit to an African-American church in Philadelphia, where she spoke of her candidacy in almost spiritual terms, as she tried to motivate black voters in the crucial swing state to support her.
Mrs Clinton ended with an evening rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, featuring remarks from Khizr Khan, the Muslim-American lawyer whose Army captain son was killed in Iraq, and soft rock from folk singer James Taylor.
"It is a choice between division and unity, between strong, steady leadership and a loose cannon who could put everything at risk".
Mrs Clinton said she was "hopeful and optimistic" about the future.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump voiced new confidence as he brought his campaign and his dark visions of a rigged American economic and political system to longtime Democratic strongholds.
In Iowa, Mr Trump said he was the "last chance" to fix immigration and trade, while later telling a rally in Minneapolis that this election "is a whole different ballgame."
"We are going to have one of the great victories of all time," he said in Virginia, comparing the US election to the Brexit vote by the UK to leave the European Union "times 50".
Overshadowing the flurry of last-minute campaigning was FBI director James Comey's latest letter to Congress, informing politicians that the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered Clinton emails  still, Mr Trump continued to seize on the issue, despite the FBI's finding.
Hillary Clinton timeline
Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump attacked one another's character as they pushed their closing arguments in the final days before the U.S. presidential election.
A psychological analysis of Clinton by Aubrey Immelman at St. John's University and the College of St. Benedict concludes that her major strengths in a leadership role are her commanding presence and confident assertiveness.
Her major personality-based shortcomings are an uncompromising, overcontrolling tendency, a lack of empathy and congeniality, and cognitive inflexibility.
Donald Trump timeline
Controversial billionaire businessman Donald Trump is expected to be nominated as the partys presidential candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. Following outspoken campaign comments the authorities are braced for clashes between his supporters and opponents.

EMP to revolutionize local medium voltage panel manufacturing
	
EMP co-founders, Chairman Chandranandana Diyunuge exchanging agreement with S.J. Park (GM- Overseas Sales Dpt. Power Distribution Business Group). EMP Managing Director Suresh Thenuwara, T.S. Song (GM - PM for Manner Project), Global Power Solution 1 Director W. Y. Han and Project Manager J.H. Maeng were also present
Electro Metal Pressings (Pvt) Ltd (EMP), Sri Lankas industry leading electro mechanical engineering solutions provider has signed an agreement with LSIS Co. Ltd., a global leader in the field of power solutions, for knowledge transfer and technological collaboration to locally manufacture Medium Voltage (MV) panel boards.
EMP, a company that has demonstrated progressive growth during the past decade of operation, is trailblazing ahead in the industry by leveraging on timely investment in state-of-the-art technology. Operating from an ultramodern facility located at Templeburg Industrial Estate, Panagoda, the company was the first to introduce CNC machines in the history of metal pressings in Sri Lanka, followed by a Research & Development unit focused on transforming the industry. EMP has already ventured into a mutually beneficial partnership with LSIS for Low Voltage (LV) products, and is now building on this brand identity by expanding the partnership to sign the agreement covering the manufacture of MV panel boards.
Head quartered in Korea, LSIS, formerly operating as LG Industrial Systems, is a local pioneer in the field of power solutions, and is today a global super power with over three decades of accumulated knowledge and experience in the industry. The company develops, produces and supplies a whole range of products and equipment related to power transmission and distribution, with a year-on-year sales increase of 30-40% across the global market. LSIS is now investing in Smart Energy, and was the first company in the world to develop a hybrid super conducting fault current limiter.
We are partnering with LSIS knowing fully well the companys focus on creating next-generation technologies, Mr. Diyunuge stated. With their R&D capacity to explore innovative products, we believe EMPs partnership with LSIS will greatly strengthen our product and service offering across the region, along with added brand value and recognition.
EMP specializes in the design and fabrication of LV & MV panel boards for all types of projects ranging from residential to commercial, from factory premises to mega constructions, adhering to the latest international standards. Leveraging on this strategic partnership with LSIS, EMP now uses LSIS switchgear to manufacture MV Panel Boards locally, another first in Sri Lanka. Prior to EMPs initiative, there were no dedicated manufacturers of MV panel boards in Sri Lanka, with the country relying on imports to curb the requirements.
Through this partnership, EMPs highly qualified and experienced engineering team will be gaining additional knowledge to up-skill themselves in the ever-evolving industry, to keep up with todays rapid pace of innovation. LSIS will be providing specific customized training to the EMP staff, transferring knowledge and competencies as per the agreement.
We have come to understand our formidable strength across the region as a high quality brand, and we are aggressively expanding to cater to the demands of our growing customer base, Mr. Thenuwara commented. Now we can explore the potential of foreign markets by introducing EMP branded MV products and we are discovering limitless possibilities with our own market reach.
EMP demonstrated their capabilities and product portfolio at the Techno 2016, the national engineering and technology exhibition held early October, and introduced these novel bleeding-edge technologies to industry stakeholders in a joint effort with LSIS representatives, Mr. H.S. Lee (Senior Manager - Technical Coordination Team - Power Distribution Business Group), Mr.C.W. Kim (Assistant - Technical Coordination Team) from Korea. The LSIS representative then went on to deliver a technical session at the Techno 2016 exhibition, sharing informative insights and new knowledge of transformational findings in the industry with all those present.
We are constantly challenging ourselves, the industry and all stakeholders by introducing new ideas, backed by the latest technologies to realize them, Mr. Diyunuge said. This agreement with LSIS is also an investment in strengthening our corporate vision of becoming one of the most reliable and trusted total solutions providers to the engineering and construction industry.

Fitch rates LBs senior and    subordinated debt totalling to Rs.5bn
	
Fitch Ratings has assigned LB Finance PLCs (A-(lka)/Stable) proposed senior unsecured and subordinated debentures expected National Long-Term Ratings of A-(lka)(EXP) and BBB+(lka)(EXP) respectively.
The issuance is to total Rs.5 billion, with the debentures to mature in five years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures are to be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange. LB expects to use the proceeds to reduce asset and liability maturity mismatches and to improve its tier II capital base.The final ratings are subject to the receipt of final documentation conforming to information already received.
The proposed senior debentures are rated at the same level as LBs National Long-Term Rating as they constitute unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company. The proposed subordinated debentures are rated one notch below its National Long-Term Rating to reflect the subordination to its senior unsecured obligations.
The rating of LB captures its established franchise, satisfactory levels of capital supported by sound profitability through its higher-yielding products. These are counterbalanced by its relatively higher risk appetite as seen from its exposure to gold-backed lending.

Improper to nominate defeated candidates to House: Madduma Bandara
	
Public Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said Sri Lanka is plagued with a bizarre political situation where even defeated candidates could enter Parliament and that he was opposed to such as these taking place.
He expressed these views at a function held to launch road construction work in Moneragala.
Minister Bandara was apparently taking a swipe at Irrigation Minister Gamini Vijith Wijeyamuni Zoysa who was defeated at the election but nominated as an MP on the national list.
This is not good for the country. Mr. Zoysa entered Parliament under the bizarre political situation that prevails here. Making matters worse he was even appointed Irrigation Minister and is now planning to develop the Katugalla Weva. It is a good move. It is a task left undone for the past 20 years. Although the tank is being constructed under our government, Mr. Zoysa has given it a political colouring. This is a UNP government. MPs like Mr. Zoysa were able to become ministers because UNPers elected President Maithripala Sirisena to office, Mr. Bandara said.
He said this government could not be toppled before it completes its full term. (KB)

She said their destructive mentality remained the same.
Ms. Kumaratunga told the media, at an event held to promote reconciliation, that she would not express her views on the allegations that former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa was connected to the Avaa gang because she did not have all the facts to do so.
I have read reports of some issues in the Northern Province because of the Avaa gang. But I am not aware of the details as to who is behind the gang. However, I am sure there are extremist elements behind it, she added.

Pensions for disabled soldiers from Feb.'17
	
Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi yesterday gave a written pledge to pay pensions to disabled soldiers who retire from service prior to completing the 12-year service period similar to the pension paid to soldiers who complete the required service period.
The pensions are to be paid from February, 2017.
The decision was taken after a discussion between Mr. Hettiarachchi and representatives of disabled soldiers held at the Defense Ministry yesterday.
The disabled soldiers who retired after completing 12 years of service and those who retired prior to completing 12 years are entitled to a basic pension and a disabled pension.
The disabled soldiers who retired prior to completing 12 years were denied the pension paid to disabled soldiers who retired voluntarily after completing 12 years. It was only this government which drew attention to this anomaly.
President Maithripala Sirisena who listened to the grievances of the disabled soldiers decided to grant their demand.
Under military law, disabled soldiers are entitled to a pension only after the completion of a service period of12 years.
The decision taken by the President on sympathetic grounds is a bonus to disabled soldiers.
The Presidential Secretariat said though the disabled soldiers never highlighted this grievance during the past eight years, the President had granted this demand by amending the relevant military regulations with the sole objective of giving relief to disabled soldiers.
In addition, President Sirisena has also taken a decision to pay a life long disabled pension to disabled soldiers even after they reach the age of 55. The disabled soldiers were not entitled to this relief until now. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

## Title: Sampath Bank September quarter net up 38% as loans and margins grow
## Section: Financial News
## Date: 7 November 2016 12:00 am
Sampath Bank September quarter net up 38% as loans and margins grow
	
Loans grow 15% or Rs.56bn during nine months
	Deposits grow 20% or Rs.83bn but low-cost funds fall sharply
	Rs.1bn growth in pawning observed but exposure under 4%
	Capital adequacy falls near industry minimums as assets grew fast
Sampath Bank PLC, Sri Lankas third largest private lender by assets increased its September quarter net profit by 37.8 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) to Rs.2.59 billion or Rs.14.65 a share due to strong core banking operations and other incomes despite rising interest rates.
Sampath Bank share gained 70 cents or 0.27 percent to Rs.263.70 at last weeks close.
The bank increased its net interest income (NII) by 29.4 percent YoU to Rs.6.21 billion despite the interest expenses rising much faster than the corresponding interest income. 
Much notable in the banks performance was that it had managed to increase the margins slightly during the nine months as the net interest margin (NIM) edged up to 3.77 percent from 3.64 percent in December 2015 when most other competitors see their NIMs narrowing.
Despite the toughened money conditions in the economy, the bank on a standalone basis grew its loan book by a healthy 14.6 percent or Rs. 56.2 billion to Rs. 440.8 billion.
Among the portfolios, rupee housing loans grew by Rs.3.4 billion, import loans by Rs.8.0 billion and overdrafts by Rs.9.9 billion.
Meanwhile, the gold-backed loans portfolio of the bank saw rising by around a billion rupees to Rs.14.8 billion during the nine months to September but the portfolio exposure stood under 4.0 percent.
Sampath Bank was among the hardest hit banks during the 2013/14 period when the precious metal lost its glitter as the prices came tumbling down after which the bank trimmed its exposure to pawning significantly.
The growth in loans put pressure on the banks capital adequacy as both Tier I and Tier II capital adequacy ratios (CARs) declined to 7.68 percent and 11.92 percent each from 7.90 percent and 12.26 percent stood at the beginning of the year.
This will require the bank to raise equity capital in the short term to maintain the growth in its assets if otherwise will have to scale it down. The regulatory minimum CARs stand at 5.0 percent and 10.0
percent, respectively. 
The banks gross non-performing loan ratio edged up to 1.67 percent from 1.64 percent in December 2015 but remained significantly below the industry average of 3.0 percent.
Meanwhile during the nine months, the bank increased its financial assets in the trading book by a massive Rs.29.7 billion up to Rs.31.6 billion. Investments held under available-for-sale assets came down by Rs.23.3 billion. The bank holds no investments for maturity.  
This probably is an indication that the bank expects the interest rates to come down leaving room for
capital gains.
However, the other operating incomes dropped by 40.5 percent YoY to Rs.687.6 million due to decline in gains made from foreign
exchange transactions.
During the quarter, the bank made a realized gain on its trading portfolio of Rs.148.2 million against loss of Rs.242.7 million during the same period last year.
By the end of September 30, 2016 Sampath Bank had an asset base of Rs.617.4 billion, an increase of
17.5 percent.
The deposits, which funded the most of the growth in loans, grew by 20.3 percent or Rs.82.6 billion during the nine months but the low cost deposits measured through current and savings accounts (CASA) ratio declined to 40 percent from 47.6 percent in
December 2015.
Besides the growth in core-banking, the net fee and commission incomes also grew by 22.6 percent YoY during the quarter to Rs.1.74 billion.
Meanwhile, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the bank made a net profit of Rs.6.94 billion or Rs.39.21 a share, an increase of
36.4 percent.
The NII rose by 22.9 percent YoY to Rs.17.0 billion while the net fee and commission income rose by 23.3 percent YoY to Rs.4.8 billion.
As of September 30, 2016, the billionaire businessman Dhammika Perera controlled Vallibel One PLC held 14.95 percent stake in the bank followed by 9.98 percent stake by
Indra Silva.
The state controlled private sector pension fund, Employees Provident Fund held 9.97 percent stake in the bank being the third largest shareholder.

Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)s committee working on the Central Bank bond issue, would consult legal and financial experts this week to decide on steps to be taken in this regard, a Minister said yesterday .
The Central Committee of the party appointed this committee on October 31 to study the report submitted by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on the controversial bond issue that took place on February 27, 2015.
