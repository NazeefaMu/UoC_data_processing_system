Big foreign investor asked to go


	



 

There is a big foreign company functioning in our country for the last 30 years. This company is engaged in producing an essential food item for our people. 

 


A state regulatory body committed to creating a vibrant business environment recently raised sky high certain tariffs levied on this big company. Despite being one with global status, the company found it difficult to bear the increased tariff burden and its head called on the chairman of the state regulatory body to apprise him of the difficult situation that they were placed in. The reaction the company head got at this meeting was something entirely unexpected. “We are not prepared to reduce our rates. If you can’t operate here, you may make your exit!” the chairman had snapped at him.


A shocked and dismayed company head had later explained his unpleasant encounter to the company’s decision-making body. “Government invites foreign investments. But these people ask us to go. Given this situation, we have to shift our operations to another country where the climate is more favourable,” he had said.
