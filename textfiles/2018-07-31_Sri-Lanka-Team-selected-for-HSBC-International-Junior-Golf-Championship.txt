Vinod Weerasinghe to Lead Sri Lanka Squad

Sri Lanka Golf (SLG), the national body for Golf in Sri Lanka together with HSBC will host for the second year running the international junior golf championship to be played among the countries in the region; Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India. Sri Lanka won the inaugural tournament played last year beating Pakistan in a cliff hanger.

This year Malaysia too have entered a two member team and it is hoped that they would send a full contingent next year to further increase the Asian participation.

This event which was created to offer a platform for our juniors to compete among the best in the Indian sub-continent and Asia, was the brainchild of the SLG Junior Sub Committee and was conceived with the singular aim of raising the standard of the sport in the country. The format structured on a hybrid version of similar international team events played worldwide such as Asia Pacific Golf Team Championship and the Ryder Cup in the USA.  

Each of the countries will field a team comprising of 2 boys and 2 girls. 

Sri Lanka team was selected by the national golf selectors headed by Captain Navin de Silva. Current Sri Lanka Junior boys champion Vinod Weerasinghe of British School has been picked to lead Sri Lanka, whilst the team also comprises18 year old Armand Flamer Caldera of St Thomas College, Mount Lavinia who is currently ranked No.2 nationally and who has also represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Championship in Sailing.

The two girls represented on the team are 16 year old Taniya Balasuriya of Sri Jayawardenapura Girls School, Kotte and 15 year old Kayla Perera of Ladies College. Both have considerable international exposure having participated in many overseas golf events. 

Preceding the International team championship an individual event will be open to current junior golfers in the country on 1st of August, which is also to be played at the Royal Colombo Golf Club. 
This will be based on four age groups and categorised as; 15-18+ years (Gold Division), 12-14+ years (Silver Division), 10 -11+ years (Bronze Division) and 9 years and under (Copper Division).

The HSBC Junior International Golf championship is supported by several prestigious event partners.
