Thai Engineers to bring artificial rain


	

A team of Thai Engineers yesterday carried out a feasibility study in the catchments areas of Castlereigh and Maussakele reservoirs to cause artificial rains in view of the prevailing drought. They had arrived on the request of the Ceylon Electricity Board.

The only organisation patented to cause artificial rains in drought affected regions is in Thailand. Engineers of the organisation said that they with the help of the Thai Government had caused artificial rains in several countries affected by droughts. A CEB Engineer said the Thai Engineers had caused artificial rains in Castlereigh and Maussakele areas during a drought in 1981.

Sri Lanka Air Force, the Mahaweli Development Authority, the Central Environmental Authority and the CEB joined the inspection. (Ranjith Rajapakse)
