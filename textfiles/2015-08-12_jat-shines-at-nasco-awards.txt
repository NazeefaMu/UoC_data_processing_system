JAT Holdings walked away with two Gold awards, a Silver award and a Bronze award at the SLIM NASCO Awards 2015, showcasing the excellence of the sales force at JAT Holdings.
In the Best Territory Manager (Industry Sector) category, JAT Holdings’ Manager Devika Gallage emerged as the winner receiving the prestigious Gold Award. A second Gold Award was received under the category of Best Front Liner (Industrial Sector) and was awarded to Nishantha Priyadarshana.
Meanwhile, under the same category, Best Front Liner (Industrial Sector), the Silver Award went to Rangana Fernando, and the Bronze Award to another employee Sanjaya Jayaweera. 
The National Sales Congress (NASCO) is the brainchild of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the National body for Marketing. 
The event is dedicated to recognize the efforts and performance of sales personnel, and is the only national level event to recognize and reward the Sales Force in Sri Lanka. 
Just as much as JAT has uplifted the Sri Lankan market with the company recently included on the Brands Finance Lanka top ten ‘Strongest Conglomerate Brands’, over the past 10 years operations have successfully expanded to an international scale with presence in countries such as India, Bangladesh, Maldives and Seychelles. Growth in these international markets has been a challenge, which the JAT Holdings team regards as a highly rewarding experience. 
There are further plans to grow the JAT brand along with its product portfolio for the future and further establish its presence overseas. Most of the company’s’ customers have expressed immense appreciation and gratitude to have been able to further their domestic and international clientele due to the higher standards achieved through the JAT furnishing and finishing range. 
JAT Holdings boasts an impressive portfolio of products across a wide range of leading international brands including SAYERLACK wood coatings of Italy, Herman Miller office solutions of US, Crown and Permoglaze decorative interior and exterior wall paints of UK, Borma Wachs maintenance range of Italy, Norton Abrasives (Saint Gobain) of France and Brush Master Paint brushes. The company believes in a philosophy of teamwork and corporate citizenship, reflected in its commitment to perfection and its zero tolerance of errors and accidents, as well as its investment in providing international exposure and training to its technicians.
