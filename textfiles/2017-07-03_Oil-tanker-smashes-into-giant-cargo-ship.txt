(Daily Mail), 1 July 2017 -An oil tanker and a cargo ship collided Saturday off Britain in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, but no injuries or spills have been reported, authorities said.  


The tanker had 38,000 tonnes of petrol on board at the time of the collision with a 720-foot cargo boat in the Strait of Dover, which is where the North Sea and the Channel meet.  


‘Although both vessels have been damaged, there is no water ingress and no pollution,’ Britain’s maritime and coastguard agency said. ‘There are no injuries and all of the crew are accounted for.’Photos released by French maritime authorities showed extensive damage to the side of the tanker ‘Seafrontier’, which had 27 people on board. The ‘Huyan Endeavour’ cargo ship was able to continue on its way.
