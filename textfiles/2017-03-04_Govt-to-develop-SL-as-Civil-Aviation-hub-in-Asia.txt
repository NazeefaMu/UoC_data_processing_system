Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday the plan of the national government was to develop Sri Lanka as a hub in Civil Aviation services in the Asian region.

He said more technical officers such as air traffic controllers and pilots should be recruited to the air force to develop technical services.

“Aircraft repairing and other technical servicing should be improved in the country,” he said.

The Minister said at the 66th Anniversary of the air force that the air force should extend their services apart from traditional services to develop national economy and tourism.
