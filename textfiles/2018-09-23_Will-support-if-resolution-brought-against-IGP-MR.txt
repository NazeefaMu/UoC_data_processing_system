If a resolution was brought in Parliament to remove IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said they would support such a resolution.

“Yes! We will,” he said in response to a question raised by a journalist at a news briefing held yesterday.

On Friday, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said a committee had been appointed to carry out an inquiry into several complaints received regarding the conduct of the IGP. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
