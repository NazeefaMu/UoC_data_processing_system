The Christmas should be celebrated by avoiding the wastage of food, cutting down trees and electricity usage for exaggerated decorations, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Sri Lanka said yesterday in its Christmas message.

Catholic Bishops’ Conference said the people had a duty to be more sensitive to the human needs and sufferings prevailing in our society while engage in various forms of charitable activities during Christmas.

“As we meditate on the value of life during Christmas we are called to condemn all that is detrimental to the promotion of life such as abortion and other forms of killing and destruction,” it said.

It said the Christmas reminded us of the need to invite Jesus into our lives and it seemingly simple birth in a stable in Bethlehem is a universal call towards conversion.

It also said the Jesus had invited all of us to experience this fullness of life he had offered and added that hence the Christmas celebrations could not be a mere recalling of a past event.

“It is an occasion to understand more deeply, the real value of life and to witness to this fullness in the society we live. Let us commit ourselves to changing all that is not in keeping with God’s holy will in our midst by becoming agents of peace, harmony and reconciliation,” it said.

It also said the people should offer their gratitude to God for the beautiful gift of Jesus and should pray that all of us would be renewed by the Spirit to be living witnesses of the Lord Jesus.

“We wish all our Faithful, our fellow citizens and all men and women of goodwill a Blessed Christmas!” it said.
