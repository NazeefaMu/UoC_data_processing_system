Ranminitenna Tele Cinema Park to be transformed to profitable institution - Gayantha

The Ranminitenna Tele Cinema Park will be transformed into a profitable institution to enable it render a sterling service to artistes involved in the tele cinema sector, Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said.
Addressing a meeting at the Media Ministry on November 17, the minister said a special committee comprising senior cinema artistes and media heads has been appointed to recommend necessary measures to facilitate this.
He said it is hoped to transform the park as an attraction to local tourists by providing lodging facilities and improving physical infrastructure under a special marketing development programme.
The park had become a loss today because it had been built haphazardly without any feasibility report, he said.
