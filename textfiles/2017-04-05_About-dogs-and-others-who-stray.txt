About dogs and others who stray…!


	



 

A certain purohita who took to heart the stray dog menace in the country got his aides to conduct a survey of the stray dog population across the country.

 


The findings of the survey further convinced this purohita (handling the subject of government at local and provincial level) of the gravity of the problem. So he submitted a proposal to the highest decision making body for rounding up all stray dogs which are not only a public nuisance but are also carriers of the deadly Rabies. 


When the proposal came up for discussion at the top table, a purohita from Wayamba, who by the way makes an occasional appearance in the entertainment field as well, laughed and said: “Putting on leash or destroying stray dogs is a very good idea. By the way there are political animals too who go astray now and again. We have to put them too on leash!”  


All greeted this sally with laughter and the purohita who was the butt of the joke looked momentarily disconcerted and then looked daggers at his tormenter, they say.
