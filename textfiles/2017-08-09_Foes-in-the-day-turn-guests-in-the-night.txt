Foes in the day turn guests in the night


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya said in public the other day that there are several JO Diyawanna members calling on him regularly under the cover of night.

 


This revelation had highly upset at least three JO members who had immediately presumed that Number One was referring to them.             


Even the JO high-ups admit at least there are three members straddling the fence and maintaining secret ties with yahapalanaya bigwigs.


According to informed sources one of these three nocturnal visitors to the palace is a vociferous former purohita from the Kandy district facing a court case. One of the other two is a shrewd character from Ruhuna. The other one hails from Colombo district and he has one leg in the JO and other on the fence and often serves as a conduit pumping information both ways.
