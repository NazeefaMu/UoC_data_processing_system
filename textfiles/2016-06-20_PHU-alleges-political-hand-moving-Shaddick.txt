The Pivithurua Hela Urumaya (PHU) today alleged that a political party electoral organizer had promised to pay Brian Shaddick, the Australian businessman, who alleged he was swindled by PHU General Secretary and MP Udaya Gammanpila.

Mr. Gammanpila was arrested on Saturday on charges of having used a fraudulent Power of Attorney to sell shares of an Australian Company owned by Mr. Shaddick.

PHU Propaganda Secretary Thushara Dissanayake told a news conference that the organiser had sent an email to Mr. Shaddick in August last year inviting him to attend a news conference in Colombo.

“The e-mail said they have already paid for Shaddick's air tickets and for his accommodation in Sri Lanka. The e-mail had also mentioned that they would pay the ‘promised amount’ to Mr. Shaddick upon arrival,” he said.

Mr. Dassanayake said their party leader Gammanpila was not arrested because he had committed any crime but for holding different political views.

Meanwhile, PHU National Organiser Madumadhawa Aravinda said Mr. Gammanpila was a man of honour who was not playing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde unlike others.  (Lahiru Pothmulla)
