‘Project Sisila’ a success


	



 

The Rotaract Club of Centennial United (RACCU) recently concluded a project that provided water for 20-30 families in Rambewa, a remote village in the Anuradhapura district. The main objective of the project was to provide water for these families who have been affected by the drought. The Rotaractors also conducted an analysis in terms of providing a sustainable solution for this problem. In order to collect funds, the club members pooled in their finances to make it a success.  RACCU plans to continue this project in future and invites donors and well-wishers to join them in this cause.
