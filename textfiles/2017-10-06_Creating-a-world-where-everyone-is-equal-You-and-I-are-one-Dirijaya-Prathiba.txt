Creating a world where everyone is equal ‘You and I are one’- Dirijaya Prathiba 2017


	

However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at, says the well-known Stephen Hopkins.  



Adhering to these words is the fact that everyone is good at something. Talent is a gift impartially bestowed on all human beings and is like a hidden gem that has to be whittled out to the open by using the opportunities given to each one of us. One such opportunity comes through a musical drama titled, ‘Dirijaya Prathiba 2017 - The Journey continues’ where the spotlight will be directed on showcasing the talents of persons with disabilities, making them seen and heard.   




This musical drama will be 

staged by the Enable the Disabled Foundation (ETD).   
ETD is the CSR arm of the Management Club, a body of professional managers. It was founded in 2003 and registered with the Ministry of Social Services.   


Dirijaya Prathiba 2017 is a step towards enabling Sri Lanka to become a disabled- friendly country



The foundation endeavours to create an atmosphere where the able and the disable study, work, play and live as one people. It strives to create a society where people are not segregated due to differences, physical or otherwise. The inaugural event was successfully held four years ago in 2013. This year, a heart warming cause has been included to the ‘Dirijaya Prathiba 2017’in addition to the showcasing of their talents. Recognizing the importance of play in a child’s development, the ETD has initiated ‘Play for all’, an all-inclusive kids park. It sprouted into existence through ETD’s desire to create a disabled-friendly nation. The event will act as a fund-raiser to build parks with equipment that provide opportunities for both abled and disabled children to have fun together.   


“I’d like to make an appeal to the people to come and support Dirijaya Prathiba 2017 and events of such nature. As people we need to intergrate those with disabilities into our society to make them feel needed and ensure them that we are here for them,” ETD President Jezaayar Hassendeen said.   


The event will be graced by the presence of many celebrities in the local music and drama scene. Some of the artistes who will be performing alongside the participants in the talent extravaganza are Mariazelle Goonatilleke, Lahiru Perera, Bathiya and Santhush, Dushyanth Weeraman, Rukshan Perera, Stephanie Siriwardane and King South are. People will also be given the privilege of witnessing a fashion show organized by local dress designers Charini and Ramona.   


This is a golden opportunity for their talents to be recognized by the world. The participants are very excited to be performing 



Musician Dushyanth Weeraman is the Brand Ambassador to the event. He spoke of his interest in the cause.  


 “Dirijaya Prathiba 2017 is a step towards enabling Sri Lanka to become a disabled- friendly country. They should be made to feel specially-abled in different ways. Dirijaya Prathiba is a platform to recognize the talents of persons with disabilities and overcome social segregations. They should not be made to feel seperate or different,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s all about expressing love, care and respect for others. I am very glad and honoured to be part of the event as we work towards achieving the event’s motto -’obai mamai samai’ (you and I are one.).”   


The participants will be from 75 schools and homes. Amila Indrajith, the oriental music teacher of the school for the blind, Ratmalana, expressing his opinion on the event said, “The talents of persons with disabilities are often neglected in society. They should be seen as valued members of the society. This is a golden opportunity for their talents to be recognized by the world. The participants are very excited to be performing and they are looking forward to the event,” he said and stressed the need to hold such events every year.
