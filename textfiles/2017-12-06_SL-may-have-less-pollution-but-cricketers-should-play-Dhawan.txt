SL may have less pollution, but cricketers should play: Dhawan


	

Though Sri Lankan cricketers may feel uncomfortable in Delhi because they might have less pollution in Sri Lanka, Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan said it was necessary for cricketers to do their duty and play regardless of the condition, the Wisden India reported yesterday.

Being from the capital city, Dhawan was understandably quizzed about the pollution – the smog – that has led to quite a few controversial episodes in the Test match. The Sri Lankans have suffered a fair bit, but on Tuesday, Shami also complained of uneasiness and asked for medical attention.

“I am born and brought up in Delhi. This is the time of crop harvesting in some of the states, this month pollution is a wee bit more,” said Dhawan. “Also this time, we haven’t experienced good sunshine. Maybe if there was sunshine, pollution would have been less. I don’t think playing cricket was a problem. As far as Shami is concerned, he is fine and you will see him in action tomorrow.

“There are a lot of players in our team who are not used to this pollution thing in Delhi as they come from other states. But if you have been assigned a job (to play), you can’t let anything come in its way. If you are playing in Delhi at some other point of time, the pollution won’t affect you. I would never say that there is no pollution in Delhi. Of course, there is pollution, but during the winters as there is a lot of smog, so whatever the situation is, we need to adjust accordingly. When you are playing for the country, you have to do your job.”

Dhawan also acknowledged that the Sri Lankans were not used to the unhealthy conditions because where they come from “the air quality is much, much better.”

“Maybe they are uncomfortable, maybe there is less pollution in Sri Lanka. There are more beaches in Sri Lanka. It’s natural that a city surrounded by beaches won’t have pollution. Of course, they may be feeling … as I said I won’t hide that there is pollution in Delhi,” said Dhawan.

“Now if it’s there, it’s there. Can’t help it. Maybe they are feeling it more, I don’t know. But still I would insist that we should do our duty – that is to play cricket.”
