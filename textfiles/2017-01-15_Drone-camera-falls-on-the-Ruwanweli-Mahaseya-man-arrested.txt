A videographer attached to a private TV station was arrested following his drone camera fell on the sacred Ruwanweli Mahaseya's base in Anuradhapura yesterday during the Kapruka Pooja, the Police said.

Police said the drone camera crashed on the base of the stupa while videoing the Kapruka Pooja.
The Police also said that the videographer had not obtained prior approval to use the drone from the authorities to use the drone to cover the event.

Last week the Police had announced that anyone operating a drone camera should get Police approval.

In addition in the sacred places such as Anuradhapura, they should get a special approval from the Attamasthanadhipathi Thera.

The man, a resident of Nugegoda, had told that he was working for a private TV station. However, he had failed to produce the media accreditation issued by the Information Department, the Police said.(Athula Bandara)
