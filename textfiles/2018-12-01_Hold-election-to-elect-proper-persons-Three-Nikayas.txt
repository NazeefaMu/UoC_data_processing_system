All three Nikayas have decided to advise the rulers to go for general election to elect the most suitable representatives to put an end to the current political deadlock, the Secretary General of the Asgiriya Chapter of the Shyamopali Maha Nikaya Ven.Dr. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said.


Speaking at the Sanga Samuluwa held at the Nelum Pokuna auditorium in Colombo to demand a general election in order to put an end to the current political impasse he asserted that everyone should realise that the present crisis is nothing but a conflict triggered by greed for power.

The 19th Amendment to the Constitution framed by a group identified themselves as the law experts without having any understanding about the peoples’ pulse targeting the Rajapaksa family has led to all these confusions, he stated.
This amendment to the constitution have been introduced to usurp the president’s power and consolidate the powers of parliament. Articles 33 ,62 and 70 have been so framed to interpret to suit the self interests of those who drafted it creating a confused situation in the country, the Thera added.

He warned that fundamentalism has crept into the politics and there are plans to defame Buddhism, grab power before February 4, discarding the Mace in parliament.  The speaker has to do a main role to avert the present political uncertainty, the Thera said.

Speaking at the event Ven. Shastrapathi Ganthune Assaji Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Chulaganthi Nikaya said that Sri Lanka have been accepted as a Sinhala Buddhist country. “Even Cardinal of Colombo and former cricketer Muttaih Muralitharan have accepted this is a Sinhala-Buddhist country,” the Thera said.
