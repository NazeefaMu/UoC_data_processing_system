Wide gulf between precept and practice!


	



 

A popular purohita has appointed his charming ladylove to a high post in a Statutory body connected to the hospitality industry.

 


This purohita, who often poses as a great stickler for the norms of yahapalanaya, has made this appointment despite the fact that the lass does not possess even the minimum qualifications for the high post. She has not so far submitted the relevant certificates pertaining to her educational and professional qualifications to the HR Division of the institution either, they say.


The lucky lass has given a Kiribat treat to the employees of the institution to celebrate her appointment spending Rs.75, 000 from the funds of the institution.
