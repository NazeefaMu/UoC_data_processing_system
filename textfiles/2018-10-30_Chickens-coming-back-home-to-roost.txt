Chickens coming back home to roost!


	

A former unpopular white-collar high-up of the august assembly, now serving a leading politico as the coordinating secretary had reportedly got an earful from a onetime subordinate of his at an evening function organized by the assembly employees.

 


This white collar one while working at the assembly had shabbily treated the male subordinates though he had always been fawning on the female employees, often going out of the way to do them favours.


He had received an appointment as the coordinating secretary of a leading politico following his retirement.


At the evening function, the white collar one had patted the back of a former subordinate and said howdy to him. However, the subordinate’s response had been an angry retort:


“When you were our boss, you glared at us even when we wished you good morning. At that, you were soft on girls and treated us like dirt…You are now giving us a pat on the back to show your goodwill…!”  


The white-collar one had faded soon after suffering this slight, they say.
