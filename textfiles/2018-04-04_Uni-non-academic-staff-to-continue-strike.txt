Uni. non-academic staff to continue strike


	

The University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) today decided to continue its strike action because the authorities had failed to issue a circular on the agreement reached with the Higher Education and Highways Minister Kabir Hashim on Monday.

It had earlier decided to suspend the work stoppage after the higher education authorities agreed to grant a ten percent increment to the lieu leave allowance of the University non-academic staff.

UTUJC Chairman Edward Malwattage said though negotiations were carried out the circular on the agreement had not been issued.

He said though the minister had agreed to grant their demands the officials keep delaying to carry out the minister’s instructions and therefore the 15,000 non-academic staff would continue with their work stoppage launched on February 27.

This has resulted in the academic activities at some 15 State universities and higher education institutions functioning under the purview of the University Grants Commission (UGC) coming to a standstill. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
