ACCA Sri Lanka Member Network Panel President Danushka Samarasinghe explained, “ACCA, while being one of the largest global accounting bodies, has identified the importance of reporting sustainable corporate initiatives and developing a framework to encourage more acceptance and participation of the same. Through this, we envisage developing Sri Lankan institutions to nurture exemplary sustainable business conduct and share their achievements with the stakeholders effectively.” 


Sri Lankan companies, over 3,000 entities worldwide, including over two-thirds of the Fortune Global 500 companies, in producing reports detailing sustainability and corporate responsibility, follow the framework set out by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).
