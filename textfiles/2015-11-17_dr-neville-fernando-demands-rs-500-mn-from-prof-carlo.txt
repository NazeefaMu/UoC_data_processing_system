Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital's Chairman Dr. Neville Fernando has today written to Prof. Carlo Fonseka demanding Rs.500 million as damages for making false statements on Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera's stay in the hospital.
Hospital's Marketing Manager Harsha Subhashana alleged that Prof. Fonseka had made statements to the media criticizing the hospital management.
“Ven. Sobitha Thera was warded at the Hospital for four days after he was discharged from the hospital at which he underwent surgery. No surgeries were performed on him at our hospital,” he said.
Mr. Suhashana said Sobitha Thera was admitted to the hospital on Dr. Fernando’s invitation, only for a period of recuperation. “He was only given the medication recommended by his heart surgeon,” he said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
