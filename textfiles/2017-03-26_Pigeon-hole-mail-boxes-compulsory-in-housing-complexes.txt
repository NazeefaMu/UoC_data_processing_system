The Ministry of Post, Postal Services has decided to make it compulsory to install ‘pigeon-hole’ postal boxes in all housing complexes, concerning the inconveniences faced by postmen.

The proposal was made to Parliament recently and the permission had been granted, the subject Minister M.H.A. Haleem said.
Minister Haleem said the decision was accepted by the Finance Ministry and Urban Development Authority (UDA), Housing Development Authority and the relevant Local Government Institutions were instructed to support the decision.
“Due to the increasing number of houses, the postmen find it difficult in delivering mails as their delivery limit is expanding each day. Therefore, we have decided to encourage housing complex owner to build pigeon-hole post boxes,” he said.
Further, they said most of the houses had not paid attention to fix a letter box. And they have to wait until a resident to come and pick the mail.
However, Minister Haleem said that they will enact the decision without delay as now they have been granted the approval by Parliament. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
