A group of politicians  busy laying the ground work for launching a new political party have hit upon a novel gimmick to advertise the party: to offer a cash donation to anyone coming forward to have the name of the party tattooed on his or her body!
The leaders of the new party have already set up a special fund to meet the cost of this publicity stunt, they say. 
Meanwhile, they have hired a band of youth to promote the tattoo idea among the people.
