The Criminal Court in Kuwait has sentenced four people to death – three Indian men and a Sri Lankan woman – for drug trafficking, the Kuwait Times reported.

The three were caught in a case related to heroin smuggling. The court found the four, including three men from Kerala guilty of possessing and selling the narcotic in the country.

A case against them was registered in April 2015 following the bust at Kuwait International Airport. All four sentenced may appeal the verdicts within 30 days and the Appeal Court will review the sentences. Customs caught one of the smugglers at the airport bringing in the heroin. He later gave the names of the other defendants who were arrested in Jleeb Al- Shuyoukh.
