"Thai Pongal is rendered colourftul by the fact that it allows us to show our gratitude to nature and renew our hopes devotedly. Making the broad span of the Hindu culture evident, they make Thai Pongal an occasion to be thankful, not only to the sun for giving us duly rain and bountiful harvests, but also to the cattle by feasting of cows, for providing us with milk" he further said.
