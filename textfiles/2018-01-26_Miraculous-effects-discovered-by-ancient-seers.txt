There are three kinds of Ruby: Sugandhika, Kuruvenda and Padmaraga. The classical works on Ayurveda have recommended wearing Ruby to restore peace of mind, enhance the brain power and to regulate the circulation of blood in the body.  Ruby also serves as an antidote against blood poisoning, insect bites etc. It helps normalize the pulse rate.  If worn on a finger, Ruby prevents contracting cholera and if held in the mouth destroys the offensive breath.
