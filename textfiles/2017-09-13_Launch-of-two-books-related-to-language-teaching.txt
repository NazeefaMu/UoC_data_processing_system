Introduced as an experiment that is ‘fascinating’ and suggested as a  book with a holistic view of life and learning by Professor Rajiva Wijesinha, Grammar through Literature is a non-traditional grammar book that uses a novella written by the author and classic poems of English literature to take students through the basic points of grammar and fundamentals of writing. The book also offers readers the opportunity to appreciate English literature. A Thousand Voiced Choir is a memoir by the author of the first two years as Head and Senior Lecturer of the English Language Teaching Unit of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, in which many issues dealing with teaching English to undergraduates are discussed and the solutions arrived at in one faculty of one university. The book is sure to create an interest for English.
