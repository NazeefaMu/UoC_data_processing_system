Ireland can be lucky this time, says Wood

Ireland have never reached a Rugby World Cup semi-final but former captain Keith Wood believes they can win the trophy if they beat France in their final pool match.
The Irish have still to play Italy and France the Canadians. But both should reach their high stakes Cardiff showdown on October 11 unbeaten.
Barring huge upsets, the loser of the contest will get a fearsome quarter final clash against defending champions New Zealand who are storming to first place in Pool C. The winner would likely get an easier task against Argentina.
However, 2001 World Player of the Year Wood -- who bowed out of Test rugby with a 2003 quarter-final loss to France -- said the Irish under coach Joe Schmidt have the quality to make a big impact on the tournament.
New Zealander Schmidt has in just two years turned Ireland from a demoralised unit into the winners of two successive Six Nations titles with notable wins over southern hemisphere giants Australia and South Africa.
"I think this competition is all about the game with France," said Wood, an ambassador for tournament sponsor Mastercard.
"The Irish are expected to win their first three games and if they win against France or lose to France there will be just a couple of points in it. AFP
