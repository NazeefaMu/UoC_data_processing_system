An artful artiste


	

We have often heard about billionaire-businessmen in our country. But has anyone heard about a billionaire-artiste here?

 


One might be surprised to hear that a billionaire artiste, a rarity here, has put up a three-storey mansion at a cost of Rs.60 million in a city suburb.


This artiste is said to have been a buddy of a former powerful politician and had been actively involved in the latter’s political propaganda campaigns. 


The artiste has also converted the modest home he was living into a posh two-storey residence.
Inquiries have already been instituted by the authorities to ascertain how this prominent figure in the country’s art circles had accumulated assets worth billions beyond his means within a short period of time, they say.
