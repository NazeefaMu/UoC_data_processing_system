She throws a spanner in the works


	



 

Electing a chair for a local body in an area of Digamadulla fame has reportedly run into an unexpected deadlock with a ladylove of an influential Diyawanna politico entering the fray. 

 


The ambitious fair one’s bid to grab the chair over the heads of several seniors well qualified for the post is likely to cause an unnecessary delay in activating this local body which has won a Swarna Purawara award about two years ago, they say.  


Highly concerned sources say that the Diyawanna politico who could intervene to head off the impending crisis has allowed his ladylove to have her own way.
