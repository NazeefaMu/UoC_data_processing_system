Minister Sharma is scheduled to deliver a speech under the theme ‘Opportunities and Challenges in a Post-Brexit World’ at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute, Colombo 07 on Friday.

While addressing the High-Level segment of the 34th Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva held in March, Minister Sharma said Sri Lanka should be given time to fully implement the UNHRC resolution.

 “We must give Sri Lanka time to fully implement the October 2015 resolution and post-conflict measures required to embed stability, reconciliation and justice,” he said.
