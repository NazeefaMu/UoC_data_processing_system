A windfall thanks to brotherly love!
	
The Head of a State Owned hello  undertaking had picked a high-end hotel in the central hills belonging to his own sibling to hold an official conference at a whopping cost of Rs. 30 million.
Employees of this establishment, who frowned upon holding this conference at a distant place involving logistical problems and heavy expenses, had pointed out that the management could have found an easily accessible venue for the conference at a much lesser cost in the city itself.
Some 300 white-collar ones had attended this conference summoned to work out the business plan for the next year and their food and lodging bill had run up to about Rs. 100,000 per head.

Amarasiri Kalansuriya:  Stuck in the summer
	
With each passing era, movies seem to demean the idea of manhood. If its difficult to think of a Gamini Fonseka today, its not only because no one can equal his erudition, its also because the film industry is fixated on a gender swap, in favour of the female, that hasnt come about completely still.
The commercial movies advertise manliness; the arty movies advertise femininity. Seya, which has the distinction of being the first Sinhala film with an all female cast, cannot be categorised in either, and yet, like the ambitious solitary filmmaker who thinks he or she can make up for his or her lack of talent by seeking refuge in the full house, its director, Kalyana Chandrasekara, moves along drably with increasingly tedious plotlines and side-plots. But the message is clear. Even in the mainstream cinema, the focus on the male has dropped, and the woman, once considered a prop, has now become more than a sidekick. This is true even of the way the male is being represented. Gamini Fonseka didnt shed a single tear, and when he did, he stopped being Gamini. Hemal Ranasinghe and Uddika Premaratne, on the other hand, dont once hesitate in lamenting for their lovers.
To consider this a recent phenomenon is a fallacy. With Gamini, the Sinhala cinema encountered the last real man of the screen. No one after him, not even Ranjan Ramanayake, could match him, and in not being able to match him, the mantle did not leave him until his passing. By that time, Joe, Tony, and Vijaya had been touted as his equal, but the truth of the matter was that they were overpowered by him. When Gamini acted, he flaunted his manhood, and was not afraid of ignoring the girl of his dreams if thats what it took to bring her back. With Vijaya, the opposite was true: it was the woman (usually Malani, sometimes Geetha) who got him to hanker after her, as with Wasana, where his character has to croon for the titular character to come back to him (Oba Langa Inna). And so, if we chart the trajectory of masculinity in our cinema, we find it progressively diminishing, from Tony, who could never be the lover or husband he badly wanted to be, to Vijaya, could never be anyone other than that lover or husband, to Amarasiri Kalansuriya, who found himself consoling both and had to fight through antagonist after antagonist on his way to his beloved.
If Gamini resembled Brando and Tony resembled James Dean, Kalansuriya resembled the heroes of the seventies, the Ryan ONeals and the Robert Redfords, who did not find it easy to win their lovers over without proving themselves, not to them, but to their forbearers.
Both ONeal and Redford played characters that came from rather privileged backgrounds and thus had to put up with the weight of their fathers and mothers in wooing, and marrying, their poorer fiances.
In Kalansuriya the opposite was true: he was the inverted Redford, always trying his luck with those who were above his position in life. Very often, he had to resort to deception, and in Apeksha (where he passes himself off as a much wealthier man to the family of his lover) and Parithyagaya (where he has to steal some money to meet the demand for a dowry from the family of the man who wishes to marry his sister), it was this that characterised him as someone who was not afraid of doing anything to be with the girl he cherished.
Amarasiri Kalansuriya suggested tragic force, but tragic force was what both Brando and Dean embodied, and Kalansuriya, who resembled neither, was not really beset by the angst of youth the way they were.

In Kalansuriya the opposite was true: he was the inverted Redford, always trying his luck with those who were above his position in life. Very often, he had to resort to deception, and in Apeksha (where he passes himself off as a much wealthier man to the family of his lover) and Parithyagaya .., it was this that characterised him as someone who was not afraid of doing anything to be with the girl he cherished.
Unlike Brando, who would have shouted and broken every chair in the room when he didnt have his way, and Dean, who would have cringed and cried and then hollered at the elders who didnt seem to feel him, Kalansuriya accepted his fate, and though he did not move on with it, he rebelled against it only when circumstances warranted open rebellion.
It is only towards the end of Parithyagaya, for instance, that he finds it necessary to commit theft in the name of his sister, and in Yasa Isuru, it is only when the plot compels it that he kills the antagonist. It wasnt just tragic force that spurred him, it was tragic force laden with irony, for once he achieved what he wanted, he was punished for what he did.


Parithyagaya ends with him and his lover, played by Vasanthi Chathurani, imagining themselves marrying one another on the same poruwa that witnessed the marriage of his sister to the iskole mahaththaya; the dream is shattered when a policeman walks in to arrest him. The two look back, and are captured poignantly in a freeze frame.
In Apeksha, the tension of the first half doesnt come from the duplicity of Samson over his relationship with Erika. It comes rather from the duplicity of Nimal, who has to pass himself off as Samson to Niranjalas father.
Kalansuriyas performance is so genuine and felt that once the farce and charade is over, and the father (played by the underrated but powerful Felix Premawardhana) kicks him out, the camera places him as a child whos been caught lying, and the father, though hes not really the villain of the plot, as the cruel, domineering patriarch. The film unfolds almost like a fairy tale, with the virtuous poor and the exploitative rich at the helm of the plot (at times it reads like an indictment on the latter, and its setting, against the backdrop of youth insurrections, is telling), and Kalansuriya becomes less than who he is because of his ability to become smaller than he is. In the history of the Sinhala cinema, I cant think of one film where the man would have fitted in as a villain, since Kalansuriya was probably our only leading actor who could not be a villain. Once the plot vindicated him, which happened very rarely (since he was almost always caught for his crimes), the film had to end, because after all, was there ever a point in going on with a story once its hero had triumphed Apeksha, in that sense, was a rarity for the man, since he had it both ways there: the bad guy is defeated and the good guy getshis girl.
It has been said somewhere that actors are not the men and women they were before they moved into the movies or onto the stage. Kalansuriya himself would have agreed to this, and in an interview he has said that his story was very different to what one comes across in the films he was in, but I sometimes wonder whether the two were really that different. Kalansuriyas most characteristic performances have him as the defeated, likeable hero. That was true of his own childhood, particularly when, after acting in Hanthane Kathawa opposite Vijaya and Akkara Paha opposite Douglas Ranasinghe, he had to leave the industry to find a proper job. Both his parents had died when he was young, leaving him with the task of fending for himself and his three brothers. He worked at various places, earning meagre salaries and teaching himself the secrets of the trades he was engaged in. When he was 17, he was a casual labourer earning less than two rupees a day. And then, one day, in an incident that could have come from one of his films, he argued with the mudalali he worked for and left that job, vowing to be his own man. Over three years, after some stints here and there, he managed to save around 300 rupees, after which he started a small business selling cloths in Kegalle and Peradeniya. He eventually owned two tailor shops, supplying uniforms for the Army. Lalith Athulathmudali was a frequent visitor.

Amarasiri Kalansuriya suggested tragic force, but tragic force was what both Brando and Dean embodied, and Kalansuriya, who resembled neither, was not really beset by the angst of youth the way they were.
Fittingly, the movie that brought him back to the industry was Apeksha, and his second outing was in Parithyagaya.
Kalang, as he was by now known, had before starred in Ahas Gawwa and Bambaru Avith, but like Hanthane Kathawa and Akkara Paha, he did not really emerge as a leading man in them. Even in Ahas Gawwa, the focus moves from him to Vijaya once the latter befriends him, and right throughout Bambaru Avith, Vijaya is the only person we care about. Perhaps it was owing to this that directors, knowing his true forte, never paired him with the man thereafter. The women who had crooned before Gamini and Vijaya, they ascertained, would never croon and swoon over Kalang, because they didnt just like him, they felt for him. He was the man who could be counted on to fight a bunch of scumbags, be they poor or rich, and yet shed away the cosmetics associated with such chivalry. Ranasinghe would have cowered before a fight of any sort, period, while Gamini and Vijaya would have turned it into an opportunity to showcase their mastery and control. Kalang, on the other hand, never bothered to flaunt his ability, since he genuinely cared. He didnt want affection. He wanted sympathy. In the end, he got both.
In one way or another, actors somehow get to shatter the myths they create around themselves. Gamini Fonseka, the hero, became the antihero in Chandiya and, decades later, caricatured himself as the villain in Loku Duwa.
Joe Abeywickrema, the man who made us laugh, thrilled us in Welikathara. Tony Ranasinghe, who cried over his lovers or repudiated them, was a gang leader in Saptha Kanya. Vijaya Kumaratunga, who came back for the woman who left him, turned into a scheming womaniser and brutal businessman in Kadapathaka Chaya. Kalansuriya, Kalang to us all, different from all of them in that the image of himself, as the taunted yet forever young idealist, remained with him right throughout, till the end. For others, the seasons passed from spring to winter. Kalansuriya, on the other hand, remains right there in the summer.

Canadian PM remembers victims of Black July
	
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that he joined with the Tamil-Canadians and members of the Tamil community around the world to mourn families and friends lost during Black July in 1983, in Sri Lanka.
On this day, we remember the victims of the 1983 anti-Tamil pogroms in Sri Lanka that took thousands of lives and displaced so many from their homes. We join Tamil-Canadians and members of the Tamil community around the world to mourn families and friends lost during Black July, and to reflect on the enduring human cost of the conflict in Sri Lanka, Prime Minster Trudeau said in a statement on the 35th anniversary of Black July
Black July was a week of destruction and horrific violence that followed decades of escalating tension. The ensuing armed conflict resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and affected the lives of many more.
In September 1983, Canada implemented a Special Measures program to respond to the violence in Sri Lanka. This measure helped more than 1,800 Tamils find their way to safety and freedom in Canada, and we thank them for contributing so greatly to the country we enjoy today.
The civil war ended in 2009, but the process of reconciliation is ongoing. Canada is working closely with the Sri Lankan government and civil society to encourage lasting peace and reconciliation, including a meaningful accountability process that will have the trust and confidence of the victims of war.
On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my deepest sympathies to those who suffered and those who lost loved ones during Black July. Together, we look to the future with hope for accountability, meaningful reconciliation, inclusion, lasting peace, and prosperity, the Cananian PM added.

China to gift frigate to Sri Lankan Navy
	
China will continue to provide various training courses for tri-forces of Sri Lanka and make preparations to hand over a gift frigate to Sri Lanka Navy, a top Chinese military official said on Monday.
Addressing a reception held in Colombo on Monday night to commemorate the 91st anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army (PLA), Senior Colonel Xu Jianwei said Chinese military attaches great importance to improving relations with the Sri Lanka military.
He said Chinese-funded auditorium complex at the Sri Lanka Military Academy would also be completed.
In the past few years, Colonel Xu said two militaries have witnessed the deepening communication and cooperation in the areas of personnel training, joint training and maritime security.
China is willing to enhance mutual strategic trust and is keen to see both countries continue supporting each other on issues for core interest. China wishes to boost the development of Belt and Road initiative to strengthen the pragmatic cooperation between two countries and two militaries, he said.
He said as a good and true friend, over the past decades, China has provided powerful support to the social-economic development and military and defence construction of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile,he said the PLA has made indelible historical contribution to the Chinese People's Liberation, socialist construction and reform, safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, maintaining world peace and promoting human progress.
The PLA has become world-famous as a formidable, civilized and peaceful military force. China adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace and development. Under the guidance of Xi Jinpings thought on diplomacy, the major-country diplomacy with Chinese Characteristics will uphold high the banner of building a community with shared future and help make the global governance system fair and more reasonable.
China's armed forces advocate a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security concept, and will continue to develop military-to-military relations that are non-aligned, non-confrontational and not directed against any third party, Colonel Xu said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Cries of  frustration  from South Eastern University
	
Sathya Gaveshana in the 23rd August 2017 edition of the Lankadeepa exposed in detail the administration mess that was prevalent at the South Eastern University. The conflict that prevailed between the Management faculty and the administration appeared to have been resolved. Meanwhile the conflict that arose between the Technology Faculty and the administration seems to have aggravated so much that the Ministry of Education had to step in and appoint a competent authority to resolve the issues. However still the issues remain unresolved. 

Students banned for ragging incidents while some denied of opportunity to sit for exams due to absence of attendance records

The current Sathya Gaveshana is probing into this unresolved crisis that exists at the Technology Faculty of the South Eastern University. 
A Technology Faculty was first opened at the South Eastern University. That was on the June 29, 2016, under a special Gazette notification number1973/28. This notification was signed by the then Minister of Higher Education and Highways Lakshman Kiriella. 
The faculty commenced functioning on December 5, 2016. The Technology Faculty, which began ceremonially under the patronage of the Vice Chancellor Prof. M.M.M. Najim, had an initial batch of 160 students. The students were enrolled for two courses. As many as 85 students were picked to follow the Agri Technology degree course while 75 students were selected to follow the Information and Mass Media Technology degree course. These students were from many parts of the country. 

Students sitting for the Information and Mass Media Technology Examination have to study ten subjects during the first semester. Students following course in the subject stream of Bio systems Technology have to study 11 (eleven) subjects
Addressing the first batch of students at the inaugural function Vice Chancellor Prof. Najim said, You are now free from all acts of suffering and you will never face any difficult situation. This University is located in the most beautiful environment in Sri Lanka. With the sea on one side and the river on the other the place is surrounded by paddy fields and other plantations. The entire environment is well suited for education. Students attending this university may have various ambitions, but their main ambitions should be education, enhancing knowledge and fulfilling the ambitions of their parents. Extracts of the professors speech have been obtained from the official web site of the University. 
This Technology faculty was established in Oluvil. Started as a temporary measure, this faculty was located in a building owned by another institution. From the beginning the students continued with their Education at this premises without issues. Problems surfaced sometime in April 2017. 
Objections to the attire of students
When female students began participating at lectures clad in skirts and blouses, the administration unit opposed it. They had suggested as an alternative that students attend lectures clad in jeans. There was also objections to students wearing slippers and a suggestion was made that they should wear shoes. However students stuck to their previous dress code for their convenience. 
This issue led to the closure of the Technology Faculty on April 25, 2017 for one week. There were queries as to why the university had insisted that female undergraduates wear an alternate dress to skirts and blouses and for them to refrain from wearing slippers Universities are set up to provide opportunities for students to pursue education in a stress-free environment. The students too have raised questions regarding the same issue from the authorities. People, who speak about ragging, refrained from commenting on the restrictions imposed on the dress code. 
Meanwhile the Dean of the Technology Faculty issuing a letter to the parents dated April 17, 2017 and referring to the temporary suspension of lectures at the university stated: As you are aware five months have lapsed since commencing studies at the University Technological Faculty. However, despite several intimations, the students have been seen supporting students in other faculties in carrying out ragging of first year students. On previous occasions the parents of students, who were alleged to have been directly involved in ragging, were summoned. In their presence the students were admonished and the situation returned to normalcy. But during the past two weeks it has been evident that certain students are directly supporting ragging. Despite repeated requests, which urge students not to get involved in ragging, they continue in ragging students of other faculties. According to the University Grants Commission circular number 946, extending support for ragging is considered as an act which makes a student subject to punishment.
We have observed that the situation exists despite no one heeding the requests of the authorities and this has had an impact on the students attending lectures. Till this issue cropped up the students adhered to the regulations imposed by the Board of Teachers. These teachers have now decided not to get involved in educational activities until such time the students adhere to these regulations. 
Sathya Gaveshana in its issue dated December 27, 2017 suggested that ragging should be banned at universities. There were enough reasons that were suggested to stop ragging the contents in the article were well supported with facts. If the students of the South Eastern University too are engaged in supporting or being involved in ragging, action should be taken according to the regulations of the University. But such actions taken should not be seen as an act of revenge and these measures should not curb the students right to education. The students maintain that they are being made victims on trumped up charges.

In the midst of all these issues the examinations of the undergrads commenced. The students of the Technology Faculty received their admission cards in July 2017. Students sitting for the Information and Mass Media Technology Examination have to study ten subjects during the first semester. Students following course in the subject stream of Bio systems Technology have to study 11 (eleven) subjects during the first semester. However with regard to an issue connected with attendance the students
Investigations should be according to the fundamentals of Natural Justice
When contacted Attorney Jayantha Dehiattage said that with regard to the process of punishing a student, first the authorities can temporarily ban such students from entering the University. Thereafter within a reasonable time a charge sheet should be given to the student. A disciplinary inquiry should also be held. 

At this inquiry the other party should prove the charges against the students who are alleged to have breached the rules of the university
Attorney Jayantha Dehiattage


If there is any protest against any member of the Disciplinary Committee it could be presented. The Disciplinary inquiry should be held in accordance with the fundamentals of Natural Justice. At this inquiry the other party should prove the charges against the students who are alleged to have breached the rules of the university. For this purpose they could provide witnesses and furnish documents to prove charges. The guilty students have the right to cross examine the witnesses and also state evidences on their part. In this manner, after hearing evidences from both parties, and if the charges are proved punishable, punishment may be advocated. If punishments have been handed without the charges being proved the students can proceed with appeals. The By laws in this regard change from university to university. This is how a disciplinary inquiry should be held. In the event of a wrongful determination being made the guilty party could request for a writ order or file a Fundamental Rights Petition before the Supreme Court. 

were able to sit for only a few subjects. Only 10% of the overall students were able to sit for the exams in all the subjects. There were only three students who were able to sit for exams in seven subjects. As a result a large number of students were prevented from sitting for exams in all the subjects. The students claimed that though they had attended lectures they were deprived of sitting for the examinations due to the absence of attendance records. As the records associated with attendance werent displayed on the notice boards there is much suspicion. As a result these students decided to continue with a protest campaign (Sathyagraha). 
Banning of students
The authorities took steps to ban a group of students from attending lectures consequent to an inquiry held over a ragging incident which involved a fresher at the Technology Faculty. Its true that those involved in ragging should be strictly dealt with. There is an act governing this type of issue. If there had been a complaint regarding ragging it should have been reported to the police and necessary court action should have been filed. But what happened at the South Eastern University ended up in a situation where their right to education was curbed. All this happened without a proper inquiry being conducted. 
As a result of these developments 29 students of the first batch of the Technology University of Sri Lanka, saw them being slapped with a one year ban which prohibited them from following lectures. Six students lost their studentship. This deprived the students from sitting for two semester examinations. A disciplinary inquiry was held after the students were served with charge sheets. The students objected as two of the three members in the disciplinary committee were lecturers of the Technology Faculty. The students maintained that these two members had earlier spoken against them and having them as members of this committee would lead to partial decisions being taken. However, the protest by students regarding this issue failed to change the mindset of the authorities and stop the punishments handed to them. Generally at an impartial inquiry the students are granted the right to present their views. But unfortunately, during these inquiries, held at the South Eastern University, the students were denied this right. During another instance the students were asked to produce affidavits affirming that they would not stage protests. However the authorities stopped pursuing requesting these affidavits when the students referring this matter to the Human Rights Commission. 
The former President of the Oluvil Technology Faculty Students Union Malinda Laxan expressing his views said, Our protest had continued for the past 210 days and we havent received a solution for our issues. Our Vice Chancellor and the newly appointed competent authority have failed to come up with any solution so far. We have made all parties aware that they are responsible. The authorities seem to be hiding these issues. The students have been subject to severe injustice. We have not sat for any examination so far. We feel that this is the first university where students were subject to so much punishment. Students had lost the Mahapola benefits. We arent engaged in politics here nor are we involved in terrorist activities. We came to study. They are trying to imprison us, a move which we strongly appose. The responsible authorities should look into our grievances. We request that this issue be viewed from the perspective of the students. Allow us to fulfill the dreams of our parents said Laxan. 
A students representative of the Oluvil
Investigation by the Ministry being conducted
When contacted Secretary of Ministry of Higher Education J.J.Rathnasiri said that a competent authority had been appointed to look into the issues at the South Eastern University. In addition there is an investigation being conducted by the Ministry too. This issue had been the outcome of a ragging incident. Those who engage in ragging, if caught, should be punished. An institute cannot function if such disciplinary action is not taken. We cant allow these issues to have a bearing on the other students. Students resort to strike action when they are found guilty of carrying out ragging and during such instances they are banned from attending classes. They are the losers. 
Asked what he has to say about students maintaining that often there is no evidence of ragging, Rathnasiri said that there is no point in arguing over the issue where there is no evidence. He said that ragging in a inhuman manner should stop. He said that he saw no reason for students to go on strike just because they are punished.

In addition there is an investigation being conducted by the Ministry too. This issue had been the outcome of a ragging incident
Secretary of Ministry of Higher Education J.J.Rathnasiri

University Yukthi Isuranga had this to say. We have come from various parts of the country to this university facing many difficulties. We were the first to enter this Technology University, but now it appears that we would be the last to leave this university. We have been deprived of all that they promised us on the first day. We were shown another Peradeniya, but now we are even denied of the earth we stand on. We have lost the canteen and the prices of goods are beyond our reach. In the midst of several issues and confrontations we continue with our studies. We are subjected to suppression. If we raise our voices against these actions we will receive charge sheets or theyll ban us from attending classes, said Isuranga.

South Eastern University

Its true that the university cant go on restricting the opportunities available to students and stop the progress of their studies. But it so happens that this type of harassment and ill treatment of the students continue at the South Eastern University. Let saner counsel prevail and the wishes of everyone is to bring back the situation at this university to normalcy. 
UGC in the process of taking action
State Secretary of State Ministry of Higher Education Jayanthi Wijetunga when contacted said that this is an issue of the South Eastern University. The University Grants Commission (UGC) is taking the necessary action in this regard. 
Our attempts to contact the Chairman of the University Grants Commission, the Competent authority of the South Eastern University, and its Registrar proved futile.

This is an issue of the South Eastern University. The University Grants Commission (UGC) is taking the necessary action in this regard
-State Secretary of State Ministry of Higher Education Jayanthi Wijetunga

When the driver pulled up, the cop asked for his driving license. Instead of producing the license, the driver asked the cop to have a look at a sign stuck on the left side of the windscreen.
I dont want to look at this and that, the cop retorted.
You ought to know that its an offence to talk over the mobile phone while driving!
Then the driver introduced himself and proceeded to give the cop a tongue-lashing for not having recognized him.
The cop who cringed said humbly:
Sir, please excuse meI didnt recognize you After tendering his apology, he saluted the driver.
The driver, thereafter, resumed the journey with the mobile phone held against his ear as before.

Failure to declare SL paid trips: British MP suspended
	
Members of UK Parliament have voted to suspend Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Ian Paisley for 30 sitting days following his failure to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government in 2013, the BBC reported a short while ago.
Speaker of the House John Bercow called it "a regrettable state of affairs".
Mr Bercow will now formally inform the chief electoral officer of the decision and she has ten working days to set up a petition which, if signed by 10% of North Antrim constituents will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley having to stand down.
Sir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, said they had concluded Mr Paisley was guilty of "serious misconduct".
Mr Paisley has insisted he will fight any by-election to save his Westminster seat if he is forced to stand down.
Mr Paisley's party plays a pivotal role in supporting Theresa May's minority government.
In June 2017, an agreement was reached that the 10 DUP MPs would back the Tories in key Commons votes.
This is one of the longest bans ever to be handed down at Westminster.
Paisley has apologised for not declaring two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.
He later lobbied the then prime minister on the country's behalf. His party is also considering if it should take action against him.

Gac fruit now in Sri Lanka
	
The Department of Agriculture introduced Gac fruit, scientifically identified as Momordica cochinchinensis to Sri Lanka, that can be successfully cultivated during both dry and wet weather seasons.

Galle stadium will not be removed: Akila Viraj
	
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, who also represents Sri Lanka as the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka National Commission for UNESCO, today rejected the claims that the Galle International Cricket Stadium would be removed and said only the unauthorized pavilion inside it would be demolished.
While addressing the media at his Ministry yesterday he said the reports circulating in the media were misleading. While accepting that the Galle Fort had been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, he reiterated that they had only requested the government to remove the unauthorized pavilion at the stadium, for which a reasonable amount of time had also been given.
The Director-General of UNESCO Irina Bokova had also pointed out the need to remove the unauthorized pavilion for the protection of the Galle Fort during her visit to the island.
No one has asked us to move the Galle Stadium anywhere. However, during the time of Mahinda Rajapaksas government, nothing was taken into consideration when building this pavilion. They did not even consider the fact that this was a National Heritage Site, Minister Kariyawasam said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Govt. to insert federal constitution to 20A: Gammanpila
	
The government was trying to incorporate constitutional changes on Federal lines as an amendment to the 20th Amendment during the committee stage of the debate, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila charged yesterday.
Addressing a press conference, he said the Bill for the 20 Amendment was published in the Gazette on July 6,2018 and will be presented to Parliament during the first parliamentary week of August.
MPs M. A. Sumanthiran, Jayampathi Wickremaratne and lawyer Suren Fernando have secretly drafted a Federal Constitution without the knowledge of the Constitutional Assembly. After finalizing the draft, the 20th Amendment will be tabled for enactment and the Federal constitution will be incorporated to 20A at the committee stage, he said.
He said, in such a situation the Supreme Court would not have the opportunity to determine the constitutionality of the whole process.
It will be an opportunity for the government to enact the Federal Constitution without intervention by the Supreme Court , MP Gammanpila added.
He said the Joint Opposition had decided to oppose granting leave for the 20A when it would be presented for the first reading. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Human Trafficking: Skin removal and online porn the latest crimes
	
Next Monday, the United Nations marks the World Day against Trafficking in Persons  a crime that exploits women, children and men for numerous purposes including forced labour and sex. 
According to the UN, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that about 21 million people are victims of forced labour globally. This estimate includes victims of human trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation. While it is not known how many of these victims were trafficked, the estimate implies that currently there are millions of victims in the world. Every country in the world is affected by human trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims. Children make up almost a third of all human trafficking victims worldwide, according to a UN global report. Additionally, women and girls comprise 71% among victims of human trafficking.
The UN General Assembly has adopted a global plan of action to combat trafficking in persons. It urged member States to take coordinated and consistent measures to defeat this scourge. The Plan calls for integrating the fight against human trafficking into the UNs broader programmes to boost development and strengthen security worldwide. 
The UN says, in the coming years it aims to prioritize victims coming from a context of armed conflict and those identified among large refugee and migration flows. It will also focus attention on victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, organ removal, forced begging, forced criminality and emerging exploitative purposes including skin removal and online pornography. How cruel. Indeed we remember the words of Shakespeare,O! Judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts and people have lost their reason. In 2013, the General Assembly held a high-level meeting to appraise the Global Plan of Action. Member States also adopted a resolution and designated July 30 as the World Day against Trafficking in Persons. This resolution declared that such a day was necessary to raise awareness of the situation of victims of human trafficking and for the promotion and protection of their rights.
In September 2015, the world adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and embraced goals and targets on trafficking in persons. These goals call for an end to trafficking, violence against children and the need for measures against human trafficking. The goals call for the elimination of all forms of violence against and the exploitation of women and girls.
This year, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has chosen responding to the trafficking of children and young people as the focus of the World Day. This years campaign highlights that almost a third of trafficking victims are children. The theme draws attention to the issues faced by trafficked children and to possible action initiatives linked to safeguarding and ensuring justice for child victims.
In a major initiative recently, Pope Francis called on all world religions to come together in a battle to defeat this scourge of human trafficking. This came after the Pope held a summit of world religious leaders to identify issues where they could work together. These include poverty alleviation, the battle against climate change and a campaign against nuclear weapons because the United States and Russia are today known to have thousands of smart nuclear weapons some 50,000 times as powerful as the atom bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. 
According to the UN, trafficking in persons was a serious issue in Sri Lanka during the war. There were a variety of factors which contributed to the vulnerability of children, increasing the possibility of them being trafficked, including displacement caused by the armed conflict, the devastating effects of the 2004 tsunami, domestic violence and loss of traditional family structures due to increasing female labour migration.
The crisis now may not be so serious, but the government needs to intensify its battle against this crime. Yesterday, the US announced it was giving 183 million rupees ($1.2 million) to counter trafficking in persons in Sri Lanka over the next three years. The funds will be used to directly assist Sri Lankan men, women and children who are at risk and those who are victims of human trafficking at national or grassroots level.

Japan heatwave declared natural disaster as death toll mounts
	
Japan's weather agency has declared a heatwave sweeping the country a natural disaster, with at least 65 deaths recorded in the past week.
An agency spokesman warned that "unprecedented levels of heat" were being seen in some areas.
More than 22,000 people have been admitted to hospital with heat stroke, nearly half of them elderly, emergency officials say.
The heatwave shows no sign of abating, forecasters say.
On Monday, the city of Kumagaya reported a temperature of 41.1C (106F), the highest ever recorded in Japan.
In central Tokyo, temperatures over 40C were also registered for the first time.
The Japan Meteorological Agency warned that temperatures of 35C or higher would continue until early August.
"We are observing unprecedented levels of heat in some areas," spokesman Motoaki Takekawa said, adding that the heatwave was "a threat to life and we recognise it as a natural disaster".
In Ibaraki prefecture, north of Tokyo, a 91-year-old woman was found collapsed in a field and later pronounced dead in hospital. In nearby Saitama two elderly women were found dead in their homes.
With less than half of Japan's public schools equipped with air conditioning, government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the summer holidays could be extended to protect pupils.
"As a record heatwave continues to blanket the country, urgent measures are required to protect the lives of schoolchildren," he told a news conference on Tuesday.
The public is being advised to drink plenty of water, to use air conditioning and to rest often. (BBC)

Landmark in the history of Lankas  Fight against kidney disease
	

Largest kidney hospital in South Asia
	The hospital is a brainchild of President Sirisena
	President Sirisena has included the private sector through the Sanjeev Gardiner Foundation

A landmark in Sri Lankas fight against kidney disease due to unknown causes, known in medical language as Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown etiology (CKDu) was created on July 21, when the President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, laid the foundation of the National Nephrology Hospital in Polonnaruwa, in the North Central Province.
The largest kidney hospital in South Asia, which is being built with a grant of LKR 1.2 billion (US$ 7.6 million) from China, will have state-of-the-art equipment, beds for 200 patients, 100 dialysis machines, six modern operating theatres, and residential facilities for the staff. The hospital is expected to come up in 24 months.
The hospital is the brainchild of President Sirisena, who has been deeply concerned about the wide prevalence of CKDu in Polonnaruwa, which is both his native district and political base.
Chinese Ambassador, Cheng Xueyuan, said that the hospital would be a major kidney treatment centre in the region and will certainly be a major event in the history of Sino-Lankan relations.
According to the Sri Lankan Presidential Task Force on CKDu, CKDu is a widespread disease caused by wide range of precipitating factors. According to available health statistics, there are over 28,000 admissions or re-admissions of patients with renal failure in Government hospitals with approximately 5,000 deaths annually.
CKDu is a toxic nephropathy causing tubular necrosis. CKDu differs from the pathophysiology of CKD caused by hypertension and diabetes.
It was first detected in the early 90s in the North Central Province. Subsequently, it has been found in the Ampara, Badulla, Kurunegala, Matale, Mullaithivu, Trincomalee and Vavuniya Districts as well.
Sirisenas Extraordinary Contribution
For the steps he had taken to tackle the scourge, affecting mostly poor farmers in his native district, Sirisena was given an award in December 2016 by the International Society of Nephrologists (ISN).
It was given by the ISN President, Prof. Adeera Levin, at a function to launch the ISN-Gardiner Fund (ISN-GF), a private initiative meant to fight CKDu not only in Sri Lanka but the South Asian region and the world at large.
Levin said that the Sri Lankan programme to fight against CKDu is the first national level program in the world.
The Sri Lankan model emphasizes not only treatment but prevention, care of patients and their families, research and education. The program is coordinated and led by a Presidential Task Force.
Public-Private Model
Breaking away from past practice, President Sirisena has included the private sector through the Sanjeev Gardiner Foundation in his fight against CKDu.
The Gardiner Fund (GF) is a Sri Lankan fund initiated by Sanjeev Gardiner, the well-known entrepreneur and proprietor of the iconic Galle Face Hotel in Colombo. In 2015, President Sirisena had appointed Gardiner as the Ambassador for the fight against CKDu.
Gardiner set up the Gardiner Fund with a personal contribution of LKR 30 million. It has set up Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in the affected areas for people to drink purified water as impure water is said to be one of the causes of CKDu.
The task handled by the Gardiner Foundation is huge. According to Sanjeev Gardiner, CKDu is endemic among poor farmers in 11 districts and villages under 60 Divisional Secretariats in Sri Lanka.
With 20,828 patients and 5000 deaths per year, CKDu is a national disaster, he says.
The Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa Districts in the North Central Province (NCP) have the bulk of the patients with 9,005 and 4,369 respectively. Kurunegala, Matale and Vavuniya have over 1,000 cases each.
Families Of Patients
Looking at the disease from a peoples representative, Sirisena has stressed the need to look at the economic impact of CKDu on the families of indigent farmers.
Apart from treating patients, the government and others involved in the eradication of CKDu should take steps to alleviate the suffering of the patients families, the President has said.
This is why under the Sri Lankan national programme envisages the building of houses, the grant of educational scholarships and aid for self- employment.
According to Dr Chula Herath, President of the Sri Lanka Association of Nephrologists, Sri Lanka has come a long way since the 1980s when there were only two nephrologists in the island. Now as many as 350 transplants are done every year.
The Sri Lankan Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease is engaged in formulating a National Plan or Policy for eradicating CKDu. It is to promote inter-ministerial, departmental and institutional coordination; intervene in legal and policy matters; ensure the welfare of patients and their families; facilitate, supervise, guide and review all activities in regard to CKDu.
A critical task of the Presidential Task Force is to crack the u or the unknown aspect of the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu). The disease has been identified and treated to an extent, but if the cause is unclear, and that is the case despite a great deal of research, treatment and prevention cannot be effective.
 Existing Findings
Rajapakse, S, Shivanthan MC, Selvarajah in their 2016 paper (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27399161) say that in Sri Lanka, the incidence of CKDu is highest in the North Central Province (NCP), where approximately 45 % of the countrys paddy fields are located.
During the past decade, a number of groups have investigated this disorder using different methodologies and reported various correlations, but have failed to find a cause.
Several nephrotoxins prevalent in the region, including medications, leptospirosis, toxic herbs, illicit alcohol, locally grown tobacco, and petrochemicals, as well as the effects of changed habits which have occurred over the past four decades, have not been studied to date.
However, taken together, the geographical distribution and overall findings indicate that combinations of factors and/or their interactions are likely to precipitate CKD-mfo.
Much anecdotal evidence from this region suggests that consumption of contaminated water is the most likely source.
Irrigation systems with demonstrable seepage to the wells are correlated with CKDu compared to communities without irrigation seepage into wells, the researchers say.
High levels of cadmium and fluoride, and complex interactions between the ratio of dissolved sodium and calcium in the presence of fluoride have been hypothesized to cause CKDu. However, the results have been mixed. In another recent important study, subjects from endemic regions had higher concentrations of excreted heavy metal and glyphosate in the urine, exceeding the reference range, the authors of the paper said.
Prevention Easier
Although the aetiology is unknown, prevention seems relatively straightforward, the authors say.
Solutions include (a) preventing environmental pollution, (b) stopping the irresponsible use and decreasing the usage of agrochemicals, and encouraging the use of environmentally friendly agricultural methods, (c) taking proper precautions when using agrochemicals and safe disposal of their containers, (d) changing the risky behavior of farmers and educating them to preserve the environment, and (e) providing clean potable water to all affected regions.

## Title: No kunu  Beira Lake clean up a success

No kunu  Beira Lake clean up a success
	
As one of the main attractions of the city, the Beira Lake is a landmark overflowing with history. It was artificially created many decades ago and served as a defensive moat, transporting goods and eventually became a boating centre as it was connected to many canals within the city. With todays skyrocketing real estate value, a property around the Beira Lake is worth many millions. But quite unfortunately, the Beira Lake is now known to be one of the most polluted lakes in the city. Embraced by algae, the water needs to be cleaned daily to avoid its unbearable stench. Although several attempts are made on a daily basis by the Sri Lanka Navy and the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) to clear its banks and clean the water, garbage also gets piled up on a daily basis. Sewage from the surrounding offices, residences, hospitals and hotels are directly dumped into the Beira, making its cleaning task a mighty challenge.
 Cleaning the Beira Lake was another goal which the No kunu Team achieved recently. Also known as the Guardians of the city, the team managed to gather many corporates, the tri-forces, the Colombo Municipal Council and the general public to achieve this task. They gathered at Beira Lake last Saturday and cleaned the banks as the first step of their initiative. So far the Nokunu Team has visited over 2000 slums educating people in these shelters on the importance of segregating garbage and how it is being done. The Nokunu campaign, headed by Sumi Moonesinghe, is a citizen engagement initiative to keep the city clean. 
Hence, the Daily mirror spoke to several volunteers who joined this cause to make it a success: 

Cleaning in progress

Were also looking at having canal transport
Speaking to theDaily mirror Mayoress of Colombo Rosy Senanayake said Sumi Moonesinghe has been a great strength to me. We have done many projects of keeping the city clean because I have a huge issue with regard to garbage. Even though we collect garbage, dumping isnt in our hands because we have to depend on the Central Government for dumping space. We collect about 600 metric tonnes of garbage on a daily basis out of which 50 metric tonnes come in the form of mixed waste. Mixed waste cannot be dumped in the Government dumping yard because they dont accept it.
Although we have created awareness among people to segregate garbage some people dont and these happen in the underserved settlement areas. They would give excuses such as the lack of space, but on the other hand there are groups of residents who are very responsible and they go beyond our request and segregate the garbage and even turn the garbage into compost. Mrs.Moonesinghe along with the private sector and the CMC got together and we did a lot of advocacy with regard to segregating garbage. Its important that we change the attitudes and mindsets of people towards the environment and how we treat garbage.
We eat something and throw the wrapper on the road in our country, but when we go to another country we would think twice before doing that. So what is it that makes us behave in an unacceptable manner in our country, but adhere to all rules in another country So its a matter of training the mindset and changing peoples attitudes and mindsets and changing their thinking and perception. We have several lakes in the city that need to be cleaned because due to the slightest rain Colombo gets submerged with water.
This is because our lakes and canals arent cleaned and our people arent responsible. There are people who live on either side of these canals and they dont think twice before throwing all the garbage into them


This is because our lakes and canals arent cleaned and our people arent responsible. There are people who live on either side of these canals and they dont think twice before throwing all the garbage into them. In turn canals get blocked and it isnt only unhygienic its a hazard as well.
I must thank Podi Hamuduruwo of Gangarama Temple and the Defense Secretary because the tri-forces and the Police have come together in addition to the SLLRDC and the Municipality, the private sector and the general public in keeping the city clean. Were also looking at having canal transport. Countries like Singapore have canal transportation to reduce traffic and be more environmentally friendly and that is the bigger picture we are looking at. The lake is one of our prime properties and it is one of our treasures, she said.

We got our staff involved

When we spoke to Ganga Wanigarathne of CSR Team  NDB Bank this is what she had to say, We got our staff involved and were cleaning our perimeter today. This is a project that some activists have started. If we can have some assistance from the Municipality we will definitely continue with this project.


Cleanliness is directly linked to good hygiene
When we spoke to S. G Sudarshani, Nawaloka Hospital this is what she has to say We have to keep our city clean, but some people dont understand. Cleanliness is directly linked to good hygiene and health and therefore it is important to keep the environment clean. If somebody is cleaning a polluted place like the Beira Lake, its a good move especially when looking at the diseases that are being spread nowadays. 

We clean all the canals in the city
When we spoke to Captain Nilantha Hewavitharana, Sri Lanka Navy this is what he had to say, There are 84 Navy personnel working from 6.00am in the morning in five places along the Beira Lake. In general we clean all the canals in the city. We need to educate the people around the Beira Lake about keeping it clean. People should segregate their garbage and dispose them accordingly


The authorities should educate people
Premachandra of the CMC speaking on the issue said, These projects are good for the city and they allow people to be clean. The authorities should educate people about segregating garbage and we are happy to be a part of this project.



When theres no rain theres more algae
Pradeep of SLLRDC speaking about the issue said, When theres no rain theres more algae forming in the lake. It isnt poisonous to the fish as they are anyway living beneath the surface of the water. But if they ingest in the plastics and other waste they will die.

Sampath Bank Makes Life saving Donation to National Hospital
	
Reaffirming its commitment to give back to society, Sampath Bankrecently donated a critically needed ventilator to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. The donation was made as part of their Hope for a Life initiative and marks the second phase in a series of planned strategic activities .The aim of the initiative is to provide some relief to the overburdened public healthcare system in Sri Lanka.
We are delighted to have Sampath Bank reiterate its commitment to public health and well-being with this lifesaving donation, said Dr. Himashi Kularatne, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon, National Hospital. These machines are invaluable in saving patient lives and we were in need of one for some time. Understanding our need and the great positive effect it would have on patient care, Sampath Bank stepped in to endow the National Hospital with a ventilator. We are thankful to them and their continued dedication to bettering the life of every Sri Lankan.
Ventilators assist people with breathing when they are unable to do so themselves which in the ICU can be a life or death situation.
We are proud to be able to make this donation to the National Hospital and know that it will enhance their ability to save and care for lives. As a national bank our responsibility is to the people and we believe that our continuing partnership with the National Hospital has greatly benefited the people of Sri Lanka, said Aruna Jayasekera, Group Chief Human Resource Officer, Sampath Bank PLC.Through our Hope for a Life initiative we continue to look for ways to elevate the standards of Sri Lankas health sector and address some of its most critical issues.
As part of the Hope for a Life initiative Sampath Bank had previously donated a fully-fledged Neuro Navigation System to the National Hospital at a cost of Rs. 49.7 million. This was the first such system donated to a Government hospital by the private sector. It helps neuro surgeons to view the interiors of the brain accurately and identify the precise locations where nerve related surgeries should be performed. It also makes the surgery faster and less complicated.
The Bank had also undertaken a landscaping project at the National Hospital with the aim of increasing the mental wellbeing of patients. Trees and flora were planted over an acre of land thus revamping the look and feel of the hospital. This is expected to provide patients with a sense of calm during their time at the hospital. In addition, Sampath Bank also installed an ATM at the entrance of the Emergency Unit to provide medical staff, patients and visitors with access to banking facilities thereby providing them with greater convenience and reducing any added stress.
Established in 1987 Sampath Bank has become a state-of-the-art financial institution that continues to be a market leader today thanks to their constant innovation and customer focused approach to business. Their unique tailor-made solutions, superior services and convenience of access have allowed Sampath Bank to further differentiate themselves from the competition and make them the bank of choice for many in Sri Lanka.

Sewing machines rusting for one year!
	

A stock of sewing machines and some other equipment worth Rs. 2.5 million purchased more than a year ago with the funds of a local body in Rajarata for distribution among the select low-income families under a poverty elimination project are still lying idle, a report says.

The members of this mini-council had received an allocation of Rs. 2.5 million each under this project.
The sewing machines and other equipment are rusting inside two rooms in a building standing close to a place where the water-cutting ceremony of a Perahera pageant is annually held, they say.

A fair second-in-command of a department collecting revenue for the Government, who was unduly rude to trade union delegates at an official confab had to lock herself inside her office room for several hours, they say.
The fair deputy who too had sat with the departmental head at the talks held to discuss a transfer issue had jumped on the union delegates saying, Who are you to tell what we should do Go fly a kite if you dont like our decisions!
The irate trade unionists had later insisted on thrashing out the issue with the fair deputy who, finding that she had gone too far, had rushed into her office room and locked herself up.
However, after making several unsuccessful attempts to force-open the door, the unionists had remained outside for a long time shouting and demanding that she come out to answer their questions, they say.

Unless Federal set up established,  the majority community will gobble us up
	

Economic benefits will not solve the ethnic problems
	There is nothing for me to respond to TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran
	In the absence of US, there are others like UK conscious of Sri Lankan Tamils issue
	Public perception that there is nexus between Ava group and the security forces
	I have no proof of that
	South must grant our request
	Difficult to gauge Indias role
	Tamil Nadu is no longer a factor

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, in an interview with the ,Daily mirror airs out his views on the political situation in the North and his plans for the future. He responds to the question about the crime wave created by Ava group. Excerpts from the interview:

QHow do you look at the current political situation in the country
It is not satisfactory. There are unfortunate differences of opinion between the Presidents group and the Prime Ministers group. The third group of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is calling the shots from outside.
Both in power are not prepared to move forward for fear of the opposition. Those who brought this Government to power have been completely forgotten. If not for the fact that there would be a sitting in Geneva in March 2019 this Government does not feel obliged to solve the ethnic problem. There is no will to solve the problem. Now they are talking of economic benefits for the north and the east. Those benefits will not solve the ethnic problem. The Tamils know that all the death, damage and destruction during the war were prompted by the successive Sri Lankan Governments not wanting to accept the rights of the Tamil speaking people. No armed group would have been born except due to the insensitivity of successive majority community governments.
Since no concrete steps are being taken by this government to solve the Tamil problem and since they are infighting in Parliament, it is my view that this Country will get into more and more difficulties in the future.
QThere are reports about a move to postpone the Provincial Council elections. How will you react to it
Postponing in other areas is different from postponing in the north and the east when the north and the east are clamouring for full devolution. Postponing would mean a Sinhala Governor will run our Province.
Already the Army consisting mainly of the majority community is in occupation of our areas. Colonization is taking place in a big way in the Northern Province with the help of the Army. If a Governor with a Sinhala oriented perception takes over reins of the office until the next Provincial Council Election, our northern and eastern provinces would lose even the meagre benefits hitherto earned. I am against any postponement. There could be a Provisional Government consisting of locals until elections if the law is changed accordingly.

Since no concrete steps are being taken by this government to solve the Tamil problem and since they are infighting in Parliament, it is my view that this Country will get into more and more difficulties in the future

QTNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said that the nomination of you as the Chief Minister candidate was a failed project. What is your view
He is stating his view. What is there for me to say Do you want me to assess him as an MP and be critical of his conduct He was my student. I am happy to allow him to talk and keep quiet for the moment.
QHow hopeful are you of the Constitution-making process
Unless pressure from interest groups makes it incumbent on the part of the Government to proceed with the constitution-making process, no Sinhala majority government would be interested in providing a reasonable and workable constitution, granting equality to the minorities let alone the Tamil speaking who are a majority in their own areas, the north and east.
QYou seek extensive power-sharing under a Federal structure and the merger of the north and east. How realistic is it without the support of the south
We are saying unless a Federal set up is established, we would be gobbled up by the majority community. Already the process of cannibalization of the north is on. Are you advising us to seek the support of the south which is interested in cannibalizing us, to obtain a Federal Constitution which would put a stop to the activities presently taking place
When the time comes the South must grant our request because our requests are reasonable and justified. Meanwhile, the South will never grant any reasonable solution to the Tamil question. Do you want us, therefore, to cringe and ask for a few crumbs from the Souths plate I doubt my people opting for such an eventuality.
QIf it is impossible, how will you pursue your political goals
Leave it to us to pursue our political goals. But please be reminded the longer you take to solve the Tamil problem the greater your problems will be in this Country.

We are saying unless a Federal set up is established, we would be gobbled up by the majority community. Already the process of cannibalization of the north is on
QTamil people voted overwhelmingly for President Maithripala Sirisena. How do you think of that decision now
We still have a great regard for President Sirisena as a humane person. But he is caught up in his party and his community and his religion.
He should never have looked upon himself as a party leader and acted as a party leader in recent times. He is President. We all voted for him. He should have evolved into a Statesman rather than a Politician. Our decision in 2015 was correct. But the benefits have been negligible. Of course, a democratic ambience is in place throughout the country. We have to accept that.
QWhat is your view on the next presidential election
That is a long way off. Let us wait and see.
QHow do you calculate the international situation with the United States pulling out from the UNHRC process
They are still ordinary members of the World Body. There are others like the UK who are conscious of their duties towards those affected in Sri Lanka. I believe the pressure on our Government to fulfil its obligations under the Consensus Resolution, will not be any lighter just because the US has pulled out.
QRecently, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara came here along with senior Police Officers to discuss the law and order situation here. Actually, how do you look at this criminal group called Ava group
Nobody really knows who these Ava Group people are. Now, they have come to know that many of these people are young men aged between 17 and 22. They move around on motorbikes carrying swords to do various criminal activities. Our question is that why this is not controlled. It can be controlled. That way, there are 150,000 Army personnel and so many Police Personnel. When we ask, why are you unable to control them They have no answer to that question.
We do not know whether there is a connection between the forces and these people. The general perception of people is that there is a connection. I do not know to what extent. There are also people involved in drug peddling here. They are supposed to be having the backing of the Forces and Police. This is a general perception. I have no proof of that. The fact remains that there are so many forces, but the criminal gangs continue to operate. They operate at a particular time. At certain times, it becomes very prominent. Then, the Police take action. It goes down afterwards. It erupts again after some time.
QSome people say these young persons have been inspired by violent scenes in Tamil films to carry out violence in this manner. What is your view
I do not think people are looking at films and doing these things. I will put it the other way. These things are happening. Films portray what is taking place in life.
QHow serious is the problem
I asked this from Jaffna Senior DIG, Roshan Fernando. His answer is very important to be taken into consideration. He said, We have various statistics regarding the number of offences. The offences that have been taking place are not any different from what they were earlier. But, there are a few things your paper is taking into full focus. Then, the whole Northern Province looks like a place without law and order.
These are a few matters that have cropped up. These are given a fair amount of press coverage. He does not agree that there is any latent increase in criminal activities.
QWhat are the impediments you face in arresting the situation
Kelum, if you ask me that question, my position is that we have not been given Police Powers. There is a certain amount of rights given to us under the 13th Amendment. There is no way of using those rights even. Up to the level of Police ASP, we have certain rights.
The Police Commission must allow that. That is not happening. As a result, we depend on the Police forces sent by the Central Government. They do not know our language. They have a different perception of what the people say. There are 150,000 Army soldiers here. There is no central authority to look into all these. If you give me these powers, I will make sure what should be done and looked into. If we have full power, we can easily bring this to an end.
QThere are reports about you trying to form a new party in view of the Provincial Council elections. How are you proceeding with it
Reports are misleading. I was asked the question. If you are not given nomination, what will you do I have three options as I said. I can go home. Secondly, I can join another existing party. The third one is to start up a new party. The press reports that I am going to form a new party. We have not decided on any such thing. This is an option.

Now, they have come to know that many of these people are young men aged between 17 and 22. They move around in motorbikes carrying swords to do various criminal activities. Our question is that why this is not controlled. It can be controlled
QYet, the TNA says your nomination for the last time is a failed project.
The TNA had been saying all such things earlier. They come to wrong conclusions. My student comes to a wrong conclusion. Then, everybody comes to a wrong conclusion. When I did not help them at the elections, they accused me of helping the party led by Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam. I had nothing to do with it.
My position was that certain things have not been taken into consideration by the TNA leadership. They should look into it. We have already promised to the electorate. We must conform to that. If you conform to that, I have no problem. They are changing it according to whims and fancies of various politicians in the south and among themselves.
QThe TNA is quite active in the South as the Main Opposition in Parliament. What is your view
If the Constitution-making process starts up, we will welcome it. It is not happening.
QHow hopeful are you of the process
Even if it starts, the Central Government will not grant a suitable, adequate political solution to the north and east.
QIf there is no support from the south for Constitutional changes, how are you going to pursue your goals through other means
There are lots of other options. You have to give your report to the UNHRC in Geneva in March 2019. They have to come to grip with the question whether the Tamil national question is solved or not. I do not think our future is bleak as such.
QHow do you look at the role of India
The role of India is very difficult for us to gauge. They are, more or less, taking a very non-interfering type of attitude.
QHow important is Tamil Nadu factor
It is irrelevant now. They have their own problems now. There is nothing for us to talk about Tamil Nadu as far as our problems are concerned.

## Title: Why death sentence would be a disaster to the country and the economy
## Section: Opinion

Why death sentence would be a disaster to the country and the economy
	
President Maithripala Sirisena has vowed to reintroduce the death sentence on drug offenders, ending 42 years of moratorium. His desperation at his governments failure to decisively respond to the resurgence of the underworld is understandable. His desire to project himself as the strongman in the mold of his predecessor was also palpable.
In a way, the presidents approach is not much different from that of UNP MP Vijayakala Maheswaran and the high priest of Kandy, both offered their own quick fixes to complex social problems. One wanted Prabhakaran, the other Hitler. The Head of the State ought to have done better.

Public opinion in this country on death sentence is divided, still it has not reached the point of extreme political polarization seen in some places, such as certain American states, where the debate over the death sentence is more of a political issue than a law and order matter or in Pakistan where a more arbitrary form of capital punishment for blasphemy is fiercely defended by the religious right. The Presidents remarks have nonetheless provoked a debate and the religious, political and civil society leaders were seen both endorsing and opposing the death sentence. The Prisons Department has called for applications for the post of hangman.
Abeit the new found enthusiasm, the empiric truth about capital punishment is that it does more to generate bad press than deterring crime. That is not something Sri Lanka can afford as it tries to rebuild its image. The case of Indonesia is an example. The 2014 election of Joko Widodo popularly known as Jokowi who defeated the old guard generated a worldwide enthusiasm for the South East Asian state. Then the new president spoiled the party by authorizing the death sentence against a couple of drug smugglers, despite widespread international calls for a reprieve. Jakowis desire to project himself as the law and order strongman did not quite generate results. Indonesia, which has prided its multicultural identity even under Gen. Suharto is now threatened by invasive salafi extremism, which has already banished Jakartas Christian mayor to prison over trumped up blasphemy charges. When politicians indulge in simple populist solutions to complex problems, they do effectively empower the gutter, which would overtime swallow up the saner quarters of the public.

In places where there is a track record of more arbitrary pattern of administering death sentence, there are instances where executed prisoners were found to be innocent lately
Statistical data do not support the notion of death sentence as an effective deterrent against violent crime. Murder rate in Americas Southern states where 80% of death sentence is carried out is twice as high as north eastern states where less than 1% of death sentence is carried out.
The death sentence is also irrevocable once it is carried out. In places where there is a track record of more arbitrary pattern of administering death sentence, there are instances where executed prisoners were found to be innocent lately. In one such incident, a court in Chinas Inner Mongolia in 2014, declared as innocent a teenager who was executed 18 years ago after being convicted of rape and murder.
President Sirisenas proposal of death sentence is far more calculated and selective. He wants to execute convicts who have already been sentenced to death for drug smuggling and distribution and continue to oversee the illicit trade from behind the bars. There are19 convicts whose death sentence has not yet been commuted to life imprisonment and are said to be running underworld operations from their prison cells. Some others have their appeals pending, and it would be a longtime before the president can sign their death sentence. For others whose death sentence has already been commuted, the presidential directive has no legal effect. They can continue their business from the prison.
Within his constitutional remits and subject to recommendation of the attorney general, the president can go ahead with his threat and hang a couple of death row prisoners. That would hardly solve the drug menace. Their will be plenty to fill in their shoes and to take over the trade. Most likely, by hanging a few, the president would create a global outcry -- already, the EU delegates have expressed opposition -- and could probably damage the livelihood of many hundreds of thousands in the garment industry which has been given new lease of life by the GSP Plus.
The President and the government need to be little more commensensical in devising an effective means to combat the underworld and drug trade.
If the problem is imprisoned drug barons running the show from the prison, the solution should be to step up prison security. In fact, placing violent hard core criminals with everyday petty criminals and drug addicts lead the latter to advanced criminality. Instead, the government should relocate hardcore criminals to a high security prison, where certain restrictions should be placed on the inmates.

Placing violent hard core criminals with petty criminals and drug addicts lead the latter to advanced criminality. Instead, the govt must relocate hardcore criminals to a high security prison
If the problem is rotten prison guards, the solution should be to set up something similar to the military police as a branch of the Prisons Department, which would keep a tab on nefarious elements.
The bigger problem however is underworld activism outside the prison walls and its regenerative capacity. Its resurgence is due to the fact that it has not been met with sufficient retributive cost. Think of this as a mini counter insurgency campaign and increase the cost of underworld criminality to the extent it is no longer cost effective for the criminals. How to do that is commonsense, but, the challenge is doing so without a tidal wave of negative publicity. Proportionality is the key. And whatever the security arm of the state that is assigned to the task should both be monitored so that it would not step out of its mandate, but also be given immunity through a Parliament act from future criminal prosecution in carrying out their mandate.
If the government hit hard enough, the underworld would crack like an egg. The government should do it before gangs become hardened. But death sentence is unlikely to help in pacifying the underworld.
