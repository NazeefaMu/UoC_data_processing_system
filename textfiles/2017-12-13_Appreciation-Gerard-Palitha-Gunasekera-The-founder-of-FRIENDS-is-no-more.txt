Appreciation: Gerard Palitha Gunasekera The founder of ‘FRIENDS’ is no more


	



Gerard Palitha Gunasekera was born on 13th December 1961. He was the 8th out of nine siblings. His father was a Major in the Sri Lanka Army and his mother a housewife. Palitha attended St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena, since the school was in close proximity to the family home. His entire school career was at St.Benedict’s where he made many friends the majority remaining lifelong buddies.   

By nature Palitha was an easy going, fun-loving individual with an infectious smile. But his greatest asset was his pure heart. His leadership qualities along with honesty and integrity added to his strengths. He was always looking to lend a helping hand to others – including people he met for the very first time.   

Palitha’s personality attracted people whenever and wherever he went. He also had the rare ability to win over even strangers of all ages and walks of life with his charming smile and affable personality. People who met him for the first time became friends with this charismatic person.   

While still at school, Palitha decided to join the Colombo YMCA – one of the most important decisions he made in his life. His leadership qualities blossomed at the YMCA Youth Department where he persuaded some of his school mates to join him. And together with other members, Palitha started a host of new programmes and activities that attracted more youth to the YMCA. His rapid climb to the position of the Youth Work Secretary was an early testament to his people-handling skills. Although Palitha was a devout Catholic, he enjoyed learning and respecting other religions and cultural traditions too.   

In 1986, Palitha formed “FRIENDS” – an organisation to support underprivileged youth in Sri Lanka to overcome social barriers. It targeted financially insecure school going children deprived of parental love living in care centres run by Government and the private sector. Even today, more than 30 years after its inauguration, Palitha Gunasekera’s inspiration, ‘FRIENDS’ continues to have a positive impact on the lives of the disadvantaged youth of Sri Lanka.   

Palitha took another important decision; this time to settle down in Australia. Based in Sydney, he initially worked in the banking sector and later ended up employed in the Australian government railway. Although he became an Australian citizen, Palitha also held citizenship of Sri Lanka. With the backing of his Sri Lankan colleagues Palitha formed the first ever overseas branch of FRIENDS in Sydney in 2000.   


FRIENDS will be dedicating the 13th SENEHASA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CAMP for  disadvantaged youth from 15th to 17th December 2017 to the late founder  at the Lama Sevana Children’s Home , Halpathota, Baddegama.   


From time to time he used to visit his motherland and renewed old friendships; he never forgot FRIENDS and its beneficiaries either. With the loyal support of his most trusted friends and colleagues, back in Sri Lanka, he revived FRIENDS in 2008 by holding a 3-day residential camp for over a hundred children. The success of that effort prompted him to visit Sri Lanka more often and to stay for longer periods.   

In the year 2014 Palitha was instrumental in organising a memorable charity dinner dance in Sydney to raise funds for FRIENDS. The record turnout and financial collection at this event made Palitha the happiest individual that night.   

During the last few years of his life, he travelled to most parts of Sri Lanka and experienced conditions and situations as never before. He became an avid nature lover and enjoyed outdoor life and visited wildlife and nature parks.   

Palitha’s love and affection for his mother was unlimited. It was the main-perhaps the only reason he went back to Australia at least once a year. It is rarely in one’s life that one comes across a human being of exceptional and rare qualities such as Palitha. Those who associated closely with him can count themselves lucky.   

The greatest respect we can pay Palitha is by continuing to engage in the good deeds he did. It is the least we as a grateful public, friends and colleagues could do to carry 
forward his legacy.  

Gerard Palitha Gunasekera left this world on 4th September 2016 in Sydney.   

FRIENDS will be dedicating the 13th SENEHASA YOUTH LEADERSHIP CAMP for disadvantaged youth from 15th to 17th December 2017 to the late founder at the Lama Sevana Children’s Home , Halpathota, Baddegama.
