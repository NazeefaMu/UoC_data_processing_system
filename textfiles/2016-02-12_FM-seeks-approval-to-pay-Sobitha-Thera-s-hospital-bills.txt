In addition, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sought the approval of the House to spend Rs 18.8 million to purchase flag cars for the Sri Lankan missions in Brussels and Kuwait, and Rs 9.1 million to purchase official vehicles for the Sri Lankan missions in Geneva and Chennai.

Approval of the House was sought to spend Rs 12.2 billion -- pay for the helicopters procured under a Russian Credit Line in 2013. This payment is to be made by the Sri Lanka Air Force.
