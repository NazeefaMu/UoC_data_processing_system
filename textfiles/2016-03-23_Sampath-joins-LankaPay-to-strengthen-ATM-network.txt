Pioneering in innovation and convenience, Sampath Bank once again strengthens its position in the banking industry by joining the LankaPay Common ATM switch (CAS) operated by LankaClear Pvt Ltd. which is Sri Lanka’s largest ATM network. 


This partnership now enables Sampath Bank customers and patrons of member banks of LankaPay with access to over 3,000 ATM’s island wide. Sampath Bank’s alliance with LankaPay enables customers of all LankaPay member banks namely Bank of Ceylon, HNB, Commercial Bank, People’s Bank, NDB, Seylan Bank, NTB, Standard Chartered, Union Bank, Cargills Bank, Habib Bank, Regional Development Bank and Pan Asia Bank the convenience of cash withdrawals and balance inquiries from any of the Sampath Bank ATM’s available island-wide. Similarly, Sampath Bank customers are also provided with the same benefits that enable them to access any LankaPay CAS integrated ATM of its member banks to withdraw cash and obtain balance inquiries.


Eliminating the norm of higher surcharges previously experienced by customers, LankaPay CAS enables customers the ease of access, secure transactions as well as offers the privilege of convenience at a nominal fee. Whilst taking pride in joining hands with LankaPay to expand its services to Sampath customers, this partnership is a true testament of Sampath Bank’s commitment to the Nation as it now sets out a secure platform of convenience and seamless connectivity to customers from partnering banks as well.


Sampath Bank continues to launch many technologically advanced products that have strengthened the bank’s portfolio of electronic banking services which continue to position Sampath Bank at the forefront of the banking industry. As such, this alliance is yet another depiction of Sampath Bank’s commitment to offer its customers with products and services that not only enhance customer convenience but further increase customer satisfaction today, tomorrow and into the future.
