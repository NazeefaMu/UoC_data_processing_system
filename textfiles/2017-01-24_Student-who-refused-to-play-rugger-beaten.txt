A rugby coach and four students from a school in Dematagoda were arrested for beating a 14-year-old student of the same school when he refused to play the game.  

A complaint had been lodged at the Dematagoda police stating that a grade 10 student was assaulted by four other students and the rugby coach in the schools’ rugby room.  

Police said the victim was practicing badminton in the school premises last Friday (20) when the coach had approached him with the request to play rugby.

When the student refused, he was forcefully taken to the rugby room by the four students who were instructed to beat him with clubs if he did not hang on an iron bar and go around in circles.

The student was admitted to the Colombo National Hospital and is being treated for his injuries.

The Dematagoda police arrested the 47-yea-old coach and the four students, aged 17 and 18, on charges of assault.  

The suspects were identified as residents of Dematagoda and Borella and were produced before the Hultsdrof Magistrate Court today. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
