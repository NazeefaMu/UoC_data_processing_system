Will it boomerang on her?


	



 

The government office handling the onerous task of promoting post-war reconciliation has kicked off a number of programmes designed to achieve this goal. 

 


Most programmes launched on the initiative of the former Madam who is heading this office have received the patronage of diplomatic sections.


The drama extolling the virtue of national unity and harmony is one of the main strands of the roadmap and a drama now being produced in the Kandy area is expected to create a sensation in the country, they say.  Meanwhile, serious doubts have been raised by informed ones as to whether this drama will ever go on the boards. The reason they adduce is that it conveys a kind of message that the former Madam will not take kindly to. The message says in clear terms that certain populist measures taken during the regime of the Madam’s father set in the rot of disunity and disharmony in the body politics in the country.


Some people involved in the implementation of the roadmap on reconciliation are said to be waiting with bated breath for the former Madam’s reaction to this drama when she comes to hear about it!
