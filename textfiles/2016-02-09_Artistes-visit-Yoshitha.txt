Several artistes visited Yoshitha Rajapaksa at the Welikada prison today.

“We came here to witness good governance and reconciliation from Welikada. War heroes who dedicated their lives to bring peace to the country have been jailed. We believe that our country needs a new party under the guidance of Mahinda Rajapaksa,” former MP Anurudda Polgampala said.
