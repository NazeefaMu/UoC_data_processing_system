The Colombo High Court today served indictments on UPFA MP Namal Rajapaksa and two other directors, Sujani Bogollagama and Senani Samaranayake of Gowers Corporate Services (Pvt) Limited on charges of money laundering involving a sum of Rs.30 million transacted through the company.

The Colombo High Court later released them on the previous bail conditions imposed by the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.

Two other company directors, Indika Karunajeewa and Iresha Silva who were indicted by the AG were not present in Court when the case was taken up for hearing.

The Counsel appearing on behalf of these two suspects informed Court that they were out of the country.

On an earlier occasion, the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court had issued international warrants for the arrest of two suspects.

The AG had filed indictments on the five suspects on eleven counts of money laundering.

The FCID had launched investigations into this matter on a complaint made by Voice Against Corruption Convener Wasantha Samarasinghe.
