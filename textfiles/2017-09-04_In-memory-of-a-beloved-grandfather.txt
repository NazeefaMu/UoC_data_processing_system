In memory of a beloved grandfather


	

Born in healthy climes of Hatton on December 12, 1943, my grandfather was named Tuan Hadjie Jaldin by my great-grandparents Zainul Abdeen Jaldin and Gnei Seenar Jaldin. 

He was married to Zareena Meedin (grandmother) in 1967 and they were blessed with five children. I wish to write a few words in memory of my beloved grandfather on the 6th death anniversary, which fell this Saturday (September 2).
My grandfather obtained his primary education at Royal College Colombo and entered Greenlands College (Isipathana) where he was a standout performer in sports and was the first rugby captain of the school. 

Thereafter he played for CR&FC for many years and subsequently was the rugby manager of CR & FC for several years. Whilst at CR&FC he associated and was in the company of many Sri Lankan and European players. He used to relate many stories about the game during that era. Especially, about the rivalry between CR and Havies. Being a reputed athlete in school my grandfather’s pet event was the 400 metres and took part in the Asian Veterans Games held in Singapore in 1986 finishing fourth in his event.

He was a very caring husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. He was such a caring person and loved us the grandchildren more than anything he could have, whenever a visitor came to our place he used to relate our mischievous deeds with them. We used to address him as ‘Kakey’ and he was always there to support us showing his love at all times. His grandchildren (numbering 15), some of whom he was not fortunate enough to see because they were born after his demise, do resemble him and have qualities in them similar to his.

We are indeed fortunate to have him in our lives since he shared all his stories and memories of his playing career and work experience. We will not meet any other person like him and we all miss him so much. May Almighty Allah grant him Jennathul Firdouse
