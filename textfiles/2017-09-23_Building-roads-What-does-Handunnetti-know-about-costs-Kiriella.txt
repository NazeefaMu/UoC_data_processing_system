Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said yesterday he was prepared to answer any questions asked by the Auditor General with regard to the estimated costs on the highway projects because it was he as subject minister who had the necessary inputs to do so.

He said this whe addressing a group of officials of the Ministry and the Road Development Authority (RDA) and asked what knowledge COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti had to calculate the estimated costs involved.

He said a meeting headed by Speaker was held in Parliament recently which was also attended by himself, the Auditor General and the COPE Chairman.

“We are ready to answer any questions posed by the Auditor General. Some people go to news briefings and speak about the monies spent on building roads. I ask whether they have the knowledge to do so? Are they skilled enough to estimate the cost of building a road? In the presence of Speaker, I asked Mr. Handunnetti what skills he possessed to evaluate the cost of a road. The the Auditor General has that skill. We are ready answer any of his questions,” the minister said and added that the COPE Chairman could not ask questions citing Standing Orders.

“Let’s say it is the Central Expressway. The detailed accounts on the expressway should be tabled in Parliament first and then the Auditor General should examine the accounts. If he points out any shortfall, then the COPE Chairman can ask questions based on those observations. He can’t simply ask about something which was handed over to him by someone else. I told Mr. Handunnetti that. Can he calculate these costs? COPE was convened yesterday and for the first time in years, questions were asked based on observations. Our officials too provided detailed answers and there were no issues,” the minister said.

Ministry Secretary D.C. Dissanayake, RDA Chairman Nihal Sooriyarachchi and RDA Director General Rohitha Swarna also attended the meeting.
