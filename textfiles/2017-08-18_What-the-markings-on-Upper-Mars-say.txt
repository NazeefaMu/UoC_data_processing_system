The signs which add strength to the Mount of Upper Mars singly and in combination are the Star, Triangle, Circle, Trident, Square, and the Single Vertical Line. The Cross, Island, Cross-bars, Dot, and the Grille show defects in the health and character of the subject.


Crosses in the plain of Mars point to a volatile temper.


The signs on the Mount of Lower Mars should be read as lines of influence inside the Life Line.

Martians or those with well-developed Upper and Lower Mounts of Mars are usually hot- tempered people. They are inclined to over-excite. They are prone to intestinal, throat and bronchial troubles, blood disorders, apoplexy, skin diseases, and inflammation of inner organs. They run the risk of getting killed in conflicts.
