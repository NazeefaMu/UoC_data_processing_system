America must ‘rebuild trust and confidence’:Jordan’s King


	



 

Jordan, (Daily Mail), 22 January 2018 -King Abdullah of Jordan has he appealed to US Vice President Mike Pence to ‘rebuild trust and confidence’ in the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   


Jordan’s king made the request in the wake of the fallout from the Trump administration’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.   


In response, Pence tried to reassure the monarch that the US was committed to a two-state solution, if both sides agree - the condition a marked contrast to the long-standing US belief that the approach is the only possible outcome of any peace deal.   


Trump’s announcement on Jerusalem last month infuriated the Palestinians, who seek the Israeli-annexed eastern sector of the city as a future capital.   


They accused the US of siding with Israel and said Washington can no longer serve as a mediator.   
Jerusalem is the  centerpiece of the long-running conflict, and Trump’s policy shift set off protests and condemnation across Arab and Muslim countries.
