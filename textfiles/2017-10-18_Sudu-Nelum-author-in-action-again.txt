A new electronic media channel dedicated to the cause of promoting national reconciliation is set to be launched shortly, reports say.

 


Preparations are now underway to construct special studios both in the North and the South and tenders for some work in this connection have already been called.


The proposed electronic media channel, they say, is yet another initiative by the Innocent One of Sudu Nelum fame for promoting national reconciliation ahead of the adoption of the proposed new Constitution and holding of a Referendum or an overdue national poll.


However, according to those directly involved in the project, the completion of the project is likely to take three to four months and the chances of meeting the deadline set by the purohita are remote.   
The new electronic media channel is estimated to cost some Rs.180 million, they say.
