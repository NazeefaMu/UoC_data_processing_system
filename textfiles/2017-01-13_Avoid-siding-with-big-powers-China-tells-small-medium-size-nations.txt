In a white paper which its stance on Asia–Pacific Security, China has stressed the need for small and medium-size countries in the region to refrain from siding with big powers.

Outlining China's concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, the white paper explained the Chinese approach to achieving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.

The policy package includes the promotion of common development; the building of partnerships; improvement of existing multilateral frameworks; rule-setting; military exchanges; and proper settlement of differences.

Noting the role that major countries in the region play in maintaining peace and development, the white paper urged them to reject the Cold War mentality, respect others' legitimate interests and concerns and to pursue positive interactions.

"Small- and medium-sized countries need not and should not take sides among big countries," the white paper said.

All countries should work toward a new dialogue system instead of confrontation, and pursue partnerships rather than alliances, according to the white paper.

China said it supported the creation of international and regional rules set through discussion with all countries concerned rather than being dictated by any particular country.

Rules of individual countries should not automatically become "international rules," and countries should not be allowed to violate the lawful rights and interests of others under the pretext of rule of law, according to the white paper.

China is prepared to take on greater responsibilities for regional and global security, and provide more public security services to the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large, it said.

The white paper said China will increase military exchanges and cooperation, which would support peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. China will build a strong national defense force that is commensurate with China's international standing.

"Its security and development interests is a strategic task in China's modernization drive, and provides a strong guarantee for its peaceful development. China's armed forces support the country's development and contribute to the maintenance of world peace and regional stability," the white paper said.

China remains committed to resolving disputes peacefully through negotiation and consultation and upholding peace and stability as well as freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, the white paper said. (KB)
