Independence incomplete sans economic, cultural freedom: Prez


	

In his Independence Day Message, President Maithripala Sirisena today said our independence is not complete until economic and cultural freedom is achieved.

“We must remember that true freedom does not comprise only of political freedom. As a country, our future successes lie in our commitment to achieve long term goals with firm determination, as we have done in the past. Completion of the Moragahakanda reservoir as the last massive step in the Mahaweli development programme is a testimony to our perseverance and commitment to meet such long term goals,” he said.

In terms of achieving human development, President Sirisena said the progress we have achieved is laudable amidst various social, economic and political challenges we were faced with.

“I believe that a nation with a unique identity, we have what it takes to overcome any challenge. We have proven it throughout our history. Today we must show once again that Sri Lanka is a nation that can rise within a short span of time,” he said.

He said many missions including achieving inclusive green growth, national reconciliation and uplifting the quality and competitiveness of our human capital in a global scale, have been undertaken.

President Sirisena also said the nation is grateful to all our heroes who sacrificed their lives in order to restore and sustain our nation’s independence.

“On a day like today, when the value of freedom is commemorated, the nation pays tribute to its true patriots whose contribution to our motherland is invaluable. On this occasion that we celebrate seven decades of independence, I pledge to fulfill all my duties towards mother Lanka, and I emphasize that our true strength is in our unity and determination,” he said.
