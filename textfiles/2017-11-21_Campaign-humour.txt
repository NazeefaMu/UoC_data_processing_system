A verbal duel being carried out in public by a certain chief provincial purohita and a former Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman is reportedly providing much amusement to the people in the province these days, they say.

 


The former PS chairman has incurred the wrath of the chief purohita for throwing his weight behind a political grouping that is expected to field a candidate against the latter at the upcoming PC elections.  The chief purohita is reportedly claiming at public meetings that the former local body head had now forfeited his civic rights and he had no right to engage in active rights. 


The former chairman is reportedly saying in reply to this claim: “Our Chief is sadly mistaken. Both my praja aithiya (civic rights) and prajanana aithiya (reproductive right) remain unimpaired!”
