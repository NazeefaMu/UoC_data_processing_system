Namal’s travel ban temporarily lifted


	

The Fort Magistrate’s Court today permitted Namal Rajapaksa to travel abroad.

He was previously not allowed to do so because of the magisterial inquiry into the alleged misappropriation of funds in the 'Krish' deal.

Permission was granted on the basis of a request he had made to attend the Commonwealth parliamentary conference and two youth conferences in Nepal and Russia. 

Mr. Rajapaksa has been allowed to be away from February 24 to May 18. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
