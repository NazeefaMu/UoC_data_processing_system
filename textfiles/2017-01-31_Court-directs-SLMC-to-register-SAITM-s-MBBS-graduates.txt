Court directs SLMC to register SAITM's MBBS graduates


	

The Malambe Private Medical College better known as SAITM, hailed the Appeal Court ruling which allows the provisional registration of SAITM's MBBS graduates.

Chief Executive Officer Dr. Sameera Senaratne said in a statement that according to the laws of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) was always obliged to register students with a degree in Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery from a degree-awarding institute, as per section 29(1)(b)(i) of the Medical Ordinance, amended in 1988, in the same manner as a student with a degree from a State medical faculty.

"The refusal by the SLMC to grant due provisional registration to SAITM's MBBS graduates was subsequently successfully challenged in the Appeal Court vide Case No.: CA/WRIT/187/2016," he said.

“Today’s decision also reaffirms the legal basis of SAITM as per Gazette Extraordinary No.1721/19 dated 30/11/2011 and subsequently No.1829/36 dated 26/09/2013 in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978, and tabled in Parliament, to award the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS).” “SAITM has always confidently asserted that its MBBS degree programme is on par with or even better than similar programmes offered by some state/foreign medical faculties”.

Dr. Senaratne said the historic ruling by the Appeal Court was a victory for SAITM's MBBS students who can now take their rightful place as fully-fledged doctors in this country.

"They have endured many hardships from opposing parties and now we are happy that justice has finally been served. We will continue to uphold the standards of the medical education in Sri Lanka in collaboration with all relevant authorities to produce doctors of highest standards,” he said.

Dr. Senaratne said the ruling is a just recognition of the rights of all institutions such as SAITM and the people of this country, who have steadfastly fought for the freedom of education in Sri Lanka. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
