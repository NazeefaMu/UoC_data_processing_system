China and Sri Lanka celebrate diplomatic ties with Kung Fu show
	
The Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu Show will be held in Sri Lanka for the first time from December 12 - 17. The five day programme is organized by the Association for Sri Lanka China Social and Cultural Cooperation, Sri Lanka China Friendship Association, Sri Lanka China Society and the Sri Lanka China Journalists Forum. 
The Shongshan Shaolin Temple Warrior Monks Training Base is considered to be the cradle of Kung Fu martial arts in China. This mythical, but practical style of martial arts was formed by studying the behavior and the survival skills of the wild animals. 
The Kung Fu relates to survival, which matters the most when in the Jungle. It is said that the Shaolin Monks spend time in the jungles in meditation with no apparent safety tools, such as weapons, being used. Martial arts arent used offensively to hurt anyone, but are put to use only to defend and protect oneself and also to protect those who are unable to defend themselves. Martial artists believe that this is the law of the nature. 
Whats special is that this is the first occasion where Sri Lankans will get to witness a display by actual Shaolin Monks
Long history
The origins of Kung Fu dates back to 1500 years ago. However the world has got to know of this art of self-defence only in the recent times. The Chinese culture and history were discovered by the Wes in recent centuries. Thanks to many famous martial arts specialists Kong Fu is now considered to be a famous martial art in the world. Kung Fu has been included in movies made all over the world. 
This art and style of Kung Fu will come alive in Sri Lanka with an exceptional performance to be produced by members of the Zhengzhou Song & Dance Theater as well as students from the famous Songshan Shaolin Temple Warrior Monks Training Base. What is special about this show is that this is the first occasion where Sri Lankans will get to witness a display by actual Shaolin Monks. 
An elaborate five-day show is organized in collaboration with the Peoples Government of Henan Province and Ministry of Culture, China Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Sri Lanka, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development. 
The embassy of the Peoples Republic of China has also partnered with the organisers with the vision of cultivating a lasting relationship between China and Sri Lanka. 
This event becomes special to all the associations and institutions working towards maintaining a stable bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and China as the two countries are celebrating the 60th Anniversary in diplomatic relations. The occasion will also be used to mark the 65th Anniversary of the Signing of the Rice & Rubber Pact. 
The visit of the Chinese to Sri Lanka will further establish the friendship between the people of both countries specially at a time where One Belt One Road Initiative is promoted by China. Today, China and Sri Lanka are at a new starting point of strategic cooperative partnership with Sri Lanka becoming a significant trade and cultural partner in the new Maritime Silk route. 
China is ready to join hands with Sri Lanka to brave the winds and waves along the 21st century maritime silk route, bringing the culture of both countries much closer to its peoples.

Don't take John Amaratunga remarks seriously: Dayasiri
	
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday asked journalists not to treat seriously the remarks made by Tourism Promotion and Christian Religeous Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.
Journalists questioned the rationale of threatening remarks allegedly made by Minister Amaratunga targeting political opponents of the UNP saying that the government is ours and the police therefore also ours.
Minister Jayasekara: Dont take much notice of these remarks. This is not the policy of the Yahapalana government. We are committed to uphold the concept of good governance, free and fair elections and the rule of law.
Journalist: But these remarks are an indication of what political opponents of the UNP could expect during this election time.
Minister Jayasekara. No no, please dont make judgements on these flimsy utterances. Besides, Minister Amaratunga is a person with a big frame. He may have said those things without much thinking of the repercussions.
Journalist: A number of DIGs have complained to the Police Commission against the IGP. What is going on in the Police Department.
Minister Jayasekara: I am not aware. However, if such complaints have been made, the Police Commission will investigate it for sure.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne: Anyway, it is true that if you have the power, you have the Police force under you also.
Journalist: Do you think it is proper for Minister Amaratunga to say this.
Minister Senaratne: We dont do all what we say all the time.
Journalist: The US government has accepted Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the US embassy will be moved to Jerusalem from Tel-Aviv accordingly.
Minister Senaratne: No. Sri Lanka will not accept it and Sri Lankas embassy in Israel will not be moved to Jerusalem.
Journalist: Do Sri Lanka accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
Minister Senaratne: Not at all. The entire Muslim world, EU, Russia, China and many other countries have already condemned this decision by the US. The Palestine Solidarity Movement of Sri Lanka has organized a rally in support of the Palestine on next Friday in Colombo. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Facebook hits back at ex-executive Palihapitiya
	
Facebook has responded to former executive Chamath Palihapitiyawho said Facebookand other services alike are ripping society apart.
According to BBC, Chamath Palihapitiya made the comments last month but were circulated widely online on Monday.
Facebook has issueda statement to defend itself.A spokesperson said Mr.Palihapitiya had not worked at Facebook for more than six years.
When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realised how our responsibilities have grown too.
Mr.Palihapitiya, who was Facebook's vice-president for user growth, is now a prominent venture capitalist.
He is the latest member of an influential chorus worried about the true impact of the likeculture - a feeling that too many people turn to social networks for validation and happiness.
We have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,Mr Palihapitiya said.
Sean Parker, Facebook's first president and the architect of much of its early commercial development, recently expressed regret about the part he played in Facebook's history.
God only knows what its doing to our childrens brains," he told Mike Allen from US news site Axios.
"We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve," Facebook's statement continued.
"We've done a lot of work and research with outside experts and academics to understand the effects of our service on well-being, and we're using it to inform our product development.
"We are also making significant investments more in people, technology and processes, and  as Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call  we are willing to reduce our profitability to make sure the right investments are made.
Despite these prominent figures voicing their concerns, Facebook's business strategy is pressing ahead.
Last week it launched Messenger Kids, its first app for children under the age of 13, a group previously not officially allowed on Facebook.

GMOA urges President not to implement Cabinet proposal
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday urged President Maitripala Sirisena not to implement the Cabinet proposal on minimum qualification for entry into medical education until the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) would announce its stance on the matter.
The Cabinet paper was yesterday put forward by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathne declaring the minimum qualification for entry into medical education as two credit passes and one simple pass in the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination in one sitting for subjects of Chemistry, Physics and Biology.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soyza told a news conference that the SLMC should gather and arrive at a decision on this matter before the next Cabinet meeting and added that this could be considered as the second instance where Minister Senaratne had gone against the technical decision of the SLMC.
The SLMC should have a firm stance on this matter at this juncture. Even the GMOA would stand in line with the SLMCs stand. The SLMC should not consider about any private medical university or Minister Senaratne during this procedure. President Sirisena should not approve this Cabinet proposal, he added.
He said that the earlier approved minimum qualification for entry into medical education was three merit passes in 2017 which was calculated by the minimum result of the student who had qualified for the State medical faculties in the said year.
He also said Minister Senaratne was in an attempt to stand for the profit-earning institute like South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) with his proposal to degrade the minimum qualification to three simple passes which was finally decided as two credit passes and one simple pass.
Minister Senaratne does not have the authority to do so, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

IMMUNOTHERAPY Can it be implemented into your  treatment plan  
	

Parkway Cancer Centres Dr. Patricia Kho discusses improvements in immunotherapy which can increase the rate of survival for several types of cancer. Immunotherapy is a type of treatment that uses certain parts of a persons immune system to fight cancer. This works in two ways, one of which is to stimulate the immune system to attack the disease at a cellular level. 
Using vaccines is one of the earliest forms of immunotherapy, where a weakened version of bacteria is introduced into the body, so that the immune system can learn how to fight off the actual disease. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is the current ground-breaking therapy, releases the brakes on ones immune system and harnessing ones immune system to recognise and attack the cancer cells. 
The second way that immunotherapy works is by providing the body with immune system components, such as man-made immune system proteins. The advent of technology, especially in the area of cancer treatment, has allowed for the advancement of immunotherapy where drugs can specifically target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells undamaged. 
Types of immunotherapy
Immunotherapy drugs are used to treat a wide variety of cancers, including lung, melanoma, head and neck, gastrointestinal, breast, kidney, bladder and Hodgkins lymphoma. The main types of immunotherapy used now include monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and cancer vaccines. 
The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer could be more effective than chemotherapy or targeted therapy in certain cancers as it has higher response rates with longer disease control periods and has fewer incidences of side effects. 
How does immune checkpointinhibitors work
Our immune system has checkpoint proteins, such as PD-1. Specifically, it is a checkpoint protein on immune system cells called T-cells and prevents them from attacking healthy cells. It does this when it attaches to a protein called PD-L1. Cancer cells sometimes have large amounts of PD-L1, which help them fool our T-cells into leaving them alone. 
PD-1 inhibitors include drugs like Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab. These drugs block the binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and allow our T-cells to recognise and kill tumour cells. These drugs are administered via intravenous injection, intravesical therapy or applied topically.
Who is suitable for immunotherapy
This depends on the type of cancer you have. Although it is effective for a wide range of cancers, you may have to undergo other types of therapy before starting on immunotherapy. For example, in non-small cell lung cancer, if your cancer is EGFR mutation-positive, you will require targeted therapy first as it is the most effective for mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, if your cancer is mutation negative, you may benefit from immunotherapy first. Speak to your doctor to determine if immunotherapy can be implemented into your treatment plan. 
Side effects and other considerations
Rare immunotherapy does have side effects. These include pneumonitis (inflammation of the lungs), colitis (inflammation of bowels), and endocrine disorders such as thyroid abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. Fortunately, if side effects are detected early and treated early, most of these side effects can be managed. Hence, it is important that they are administered by experienced oncologists.

IOC allegedly brought down substandard A1 Fuel
	
The Indian Oil Company (IOC) imported a stock of 14,000 metric tonnes of substandard aviation fuel into the country on Monday (11), the Petroleum Trade Union Alliance claimed yesterday.
According to Alliance spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara the oil-tanker "Meadows had reached Sri Lankan waters carrying Jet A1 Aviation fuel which was later found to be of low-quality as it failed the first quality test carried out by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC).
He said despite the recent bitter experiences of suffering a fuel shortage, blamed on the IOC, the government has not leant its lesson.
Mr. Kumara said the fuel samples would be re-tested for the second day running today.
He also said the ministry had imported the aviation fuel through the IOC ignoring tender protocols and said severe consequences could arise in future if the tender is awarded to the Indian company.
When contacted IOC Managing Director Shyam Bohra said he was not in the country and was therefore not aware of such an issue.
Meanwhile speaking on the matter Alliance Convener D. G . Rajakaruna said that the country has the storage facilities for all types of fuel for upto 14 days.
As such he said talks on leasing out the oil tanks in China Bay, Trincomalee should be put on hold and the CPC should have the right refuse such an agreement put forward by the IOC. Petroleum trade unions will meet on December 20 to decide on what action to take in order to stop such an agreement being signed. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

MYTH: Eating an egg everyday is bad for your health.
BUSTED: This is not true. It depends on the physiology of the person. Eggs are high quality proteins and are important in the diet. The white of the egg contains protein whereas the yolk has Vitamin A and contains a high amount of cholesterol. It is important for growing children and healthy adults. A child should have an egg a day. An adult, with high cholesterol levels in his or her blood, those with hypertension and heart patients should be careful.
They can have it once in two days or two eggs per week. If they eat only the white of the egg there should be no problem. Furthermore, eggs are also a cheap protein in comparison to meats, explained Dr. Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health.

Nita Fernando and the parameters of fame
	
Before she and her husband left for Canada and settled down there, actress Nita Fernando put on hold what was considered to be a promising film career. She returned to acting almost 20 years later, continuing to exude and exemplify a freewheeling, idealistic, innocent girlishness that no other actress here could match.
This girlishness, and the navet of idealism, crop up in her two best performances from her first phase; in K. A. W. Pereras Wasana (one of her first hits) and Vijaya Dharma Sris Duhulu Malak (which marked her breakthrough). Its a testament to how serious she was about her portrayals that these two directors and movies never succumbed completely to the tropes of the commercial cinema, especially Duhulu Malak. Probably thats why and how Nitas girlish idealism caught us so quickly, and immediately. 
She wanted to be a stage actress. Naturally then, her entry to the film industry was accidental, having been selected to act opposite Gamini Fonseka in Parasathumal
A brief biographical sketch might help us understand this phase of her career. Nita was born in Katuneriya in Chilaw and was educated at Holy Family Convent, Wennapuwa, where she took part in stage dramas that inculcated in her a love to go out there, perform and show her face to the world. I was once fed with these memories by none other than Nita herself. Chilaw at the time had a veritable performing arts centre (a Kala Ayathanaya) and this she joined right after leaving school. B
ut like most people from her generation, and the generations that preceded hers, she didnt want to enter the cinema. She wanted to be a stage actress. Naturally then, her entry to the film industry was accidental, having been selected to act opposite Gamini Fonseka in Parasathumal, but having had to give the offer up because of her parents disapproval. One thing led to another, though, and she found herself in R. T. Studios, headed by the formidable Robin Tampoe (who had earlier groomed and initiated Swineetha Weerasinghe). 
Getting noticed
But it wasnt Tampoes films that she was featured in. It was K. A. W. Pereras, with Wasana and Lasanda, followed by Sathischandra Edirisinghes Rajagedara Parawiyo. By the end of her first 10 years in the industry she had taken part in more than 40 movies, most of them forgettable and a few of them notable. Those few  including Wasana and Rajagedara Parawiyo, as more than a secondary player  got her noticed by Vijaya Dharma Sri, who selected her for his Duhulu Malak. Partly (and crudely) inspired by Lady Chatterleys Lover, Duhulu Malak was touted by contemporary critics and even audiences as being ahead of its time.
It was a deeply sensitive production, and its theme  the immutability of love and of the family institution  was rather controversial. In it Nita was the wife (to Tony Ranasinghe, who became a lifelong friend) as well as the lover (to Ravindra Randeniya, who like Nita was cast in his breakthrough role). The controversy of the theme notwithstanding, I find the morality of Duhulu Malak rather muddled up, if not confusing, and I discern that most clearly in Nitas astute, idealistic, but naively ecstatic portrayal of Nirupa Suraweera. 
While vaguely reminiscent of Lady Chatterleys Lover, Dharma Sris film repudiates the sexual indifference of Lawrences novel and instead uses the theme of adultery, not to emancipate the woman at the heart of the love triangle (caught between the husband and the lover, Nirupa can only confess to her close friends, who while sympathetic implore her to choose wisely), but to affirm the family institution she wants to escape from. The husband is characterised solidly; busy, but caring, indifferent, but infatuated.
Not even two song-and-dance sequences that show this conflict between family ties and personal feelings (Bonda Meedum and Ran Kenden) are, in my opinion, enough to set aside the forced, contrived morality of the script, and Nitas lovable, doll-like fragility, threatened most poignantly in that last sequence where the husband imagines shooting and killing her, serves to compound this self-contradictory morality. In the end Dharma Sri resorts to depicting the husband as an irrational, angered crybaby and the lover as a careless playboy who refuses to give up, and despite the confused morality of the plot, the only strong character who comes out is Nirupa herself. On her hinges the thin line between personal feelings and familial obligations, and she finally chooses, not the former, but the latter. 
Girlish idealist
The strength of a film like Duhulu Malak comes from the solidity of its characters, and all three characters  the wife, the husband, the lover  were depicted squarely, with enough complexity to make them seem less the types they could have been and more the fleshed out individuals they were: Nita as the girlish idealist; Tony as the condescending husband who learns to care more for his woman; and Ravindra as the almost boyish prodigal who only at the end learns to grow up.
That Duhulu Malak gave her the breakthrough and it was confirmed by the fact that she left the country, with her husband Elias, soon after production wrapped up
(His final act, of throwing his shoe to the sea, is a contrivance by the script to make us forget everything that preceded it, but in that act we see him mature: hes no longer a rabid, obsessive stalker, but a youthful idealist whos lost his love.) And perhaps its the writer in me, but in her performance I see in Nita the schoolgirl aspiring to be a star. I put to her that even in Duhulu Malak, we come across a woman beset with little to no problems, who isnt, but should be content with her station in life, and who, even in the most mundane pursuits, displays a naive and innocent attitude to the world around her. She agreed and replied, When I was a girl, I wanted to be an actress because I wanted to act in everything. And by everything, I mean EVERYTHING. 
That Duhulu Malak gave her the breakthrough and it was confirmed by the fact that she left the country, with her husband Elias, soon after production wrapped up, and that when she returned 18 years later she was taken in for qualitatively different roles. I didnt even get to read reviews of the movies I had acted in, after I departed. I regretted that very much and I complained frequently.
But Elias was a very understanding man. Very down to earth, in fact. He got me acquainted with the issues and the problems people from that part of the world, especially expatriates like us, faced, she said. Perhaps those experiences account for her transformation from the girlish idealist to a self-conscious, responsible woman, exemplified most vividly in her first outing after her return to Sri Lanka in Prasanna Vithanages Pawuru Walalu. Again cast as a woman (the widowed Violet) caught between personal feelings and familial obligations, Nita nevertheless tempered her performance and became more vividly and solidly realised.
Vithanages films, with one or two notable exceptions, delve into a rigid, but textured Catholicised worldview, teetering between guilt and pleasure. That confused morality in Duhulu Malak, therefore, doesnt quite come out in Pawuru Walalu, especially since in the former the transgression of moral boundaries is depicted flippantly, almost casually, as an innocent interlude on the part of the woman, whereas in the latter it provokes a crisis of faith in both the woman and her daughter (Sangeetha Weeraratne), along with her closest friends (at one point, in a Church, she admits to a friend that she has become a sinner), which not even a poignant ending can resolve. 
That Nitas portrayal was more fleshed out was confirmed when she won the Best Actress Award at the 11th International Film Festival in Singapore. Pawuru Walalu was a landmark for her for another reason: it was the first movie she produced. To a considerable extent, this opened her to the cinema in ways that her acting career had not, as she herself put it: The art of making movies is more difficult, yet more rewarding, than the art of acting in them. I am not belittling my earlier career, but the truth was that I was able to finance films which appealed to my conscience and my priorities.
I have unfortunately not seen this phase of her career completely, apart from a few performances in serious forays like Saroja and Bambara Walalla, the latter of which she produced. In Saroja she comes out as the most complex character in the story, as the mildly racist yet concerned wife to the protagonist, an idealistic schoolteacher (Janaka Kumbukage),who decides to shelter the daughter of a LTTE soldier. At times her maternal instincts for the forlorn girl conquer her, while at others she pushes her husband to give in to what the villagers want; force the girl away.
Pawuru Walalu was a landmark for her for another reason: it was the first movie she produced. To a considerable extent, this opened her to the cinema in ways that her acting career had not
Its an inversion of all her previous roles, because shes likeable and dislikeable and also because in that act of being both at the same time shes easier to relate to, as a flawed onlooker. As for Bambara Walalla, as the mother she occupies less screen time, but the intensity of her portrayal comes out. In any case, her penchant for serious, socially conscious themes were articulated in every film she had a hand in shaping  patriarchy in Nisala Gira, societal violence in Bambara Walalla, and the stigma of AIDS in her latest production, Swara, which clinched awards at the Jaipur Film Festival two years ago. 
I sincerely believe Nita has done what she can to make us aware of certain things. Important things. Wed be indifferent not to acknowledge the performances shes dished out to us, and more pertinently, the films shes financed out of a desire to propagate pressing issues. She herself affirms what shes done with a reference to her faith: I dont think God says, Go to church and pray all day, and everything will be fine. For me, God says, Go out and make a change, and Ill be there to help you.

No confidence in management - SriLankan Airlines Unions
	
The Alliance of Unions of SriLankan Airlines in a letter addressed to its Chairman Ajith Dias had claimed that they had no confidence in both him and the Board to be in charge of the National Carrier.
For the first time in the long history of our National Carrier, you as a Chairman, having enjoyed all the benefits of your position for the last 3 years, have made an unprecedented statement that the lives and sustenance of nearly 7000 employees and their families is now in jeopardy, through no fault of their own" the letter stated.
The letter was a response to a recent communique sent to the employees of the national carrier by the SriLankan Chairman. The Communique warned that SriLankan Airlines was facing closure and that this was inevitable and in the larger interest of the countrys economy if tangible and sustainable restructuring cannot be achieved.
In response, the letter signed by the Pilots Guild, Aircraft Engineers' Association, Executives' Association, Flight attendants' Union, Aircraft Technicians' Association and the Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya of the National Carrier said that the communique substantiates previous assertions.
"Your communique on the present status of the Airline now serves to substantiate what has been echoed on many occasions at numerous forums; that your Board does not have the prerequisite competencies or the attributes to manage our airline, leave alone bring any stability to it," it said.
The Unions further said that the Board had been acting in violation of its duties owed to the Airline. "The task entrusted and accepted by the Board and yourself was not to compromise the livelihoods of nearly 7000 employees and their families by giving yourselves priority to stature, travel benefits, bonuses, or having dealings which could be viewed as a conflict of interest for a director of the company. You are well aware that there has been a formal request through the RTI by the ALPGSL for information regarding the benefits enjoyed by individuals of the top management as well as details pertaining to the exorbitant lease agreements and its eventual cancellation, which have been denied on the grounds of Confidentiality, the letter said.
The letter was copied to the President, Premier and Cabinet of Ministers.
.."The Board and specifically the current CEO had absolutely no business or managerial experience of any significance to be appointed for a task of this magnitude at a critical time such as this. It needs to be stressed that all these controversial decisions were implemented during your tenure as the Chairman and that you too must bear the responsibility for what is going to transpire in the coming months" the letter added.

Party to seek legal consultations for some LG bodies
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), which got its nominations for six local government (LG) bodies rejected, said yesterday it would seek legal consultations to reverse the decision not for all but for some of the LG bodies.
SLPP Chairman G.L. Peiris said different reasons resulted inthe rejection of their nominations.
However, we will seek legal consultations to take further action to get the decision reversed for some of the LG bodies, he told the Daily Mirror.
Accordingly, the party nominations for the Maharagama Urban Council was rejected due to a technical issue. The gender of a female candidate had been marked as male in the list.
The SLPP nomination for Weligama had been rejected by Matara District Returning Officer Pradeep Ratnayaka on the grounds that the nomination had not been submitted by a member of the party or an authorized agent.
The returning officer had taken the decision after considering the objections raised by Provincial Council Minister Jayantha Pathirana (JVP) and other authorized agents of political parties.
Meanwhile, Badulla District Returning Officer Nimal Abesiri had rejected the nomination list of Mahiyanganaya based on a technical issue of selecting opposite gender of a candidate.
The list for Badulla had been rejected because one candidate's signature had been included without the name.
The nomination list for the Agalawatte Pradeshiya Sabha had been rejected because the date of the list had been mentioned as December 17 instead of December 14.
The party had failed to mention the date of signature for the Panadura Urban Counil resulting in the list being rejected.
Prof. Peiris said the people should realise the genuine opposition was the Joint opposition and anyone who is against the conduct of the government should support the JO backed the SLPP.
The Party had submitted nominations for 84 LG bodies out of the 93 under the SLPP lotus bud sign, for seven LG bodies under the boat sign for Bandarawela and Beruwala from Independent lists.

Suspicious aviation fuel: It didnt conform with specifications, says CPC Chairman
	
While responding to the trade union claims of IOCs alleged importation of a stock of 14,000 metric tonnes of substandard aviation fuel into the country, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Chairman Dammika Ranatunga today said the stock received did not conform with the specification at the first quality test.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror Mr. Ranatunga said the suspicious Jet A1 Aviation fuel which failed to meet the standards in the first quality check was an extra stock and could have been contaminated during the transportation.
He said the CPC never imports substandard fuel into the country; However it is possible to contaminate these stocks during the transportation. It can only be confirmed through the second detailed quality test, he added.
Under no circumstances CPC will import substandard fuel into the country. If the arrived stocks not conformed to CPC specification we will return those, he said. 
However, he said that the CPC has a stock of 16,000 metric tonnes of aviation fuel and therefore there was no possibility of any shortage.
Mr. Ranatunga, said the CPC will import a replacement stock if the suspicious Jet A1 fuel fails in the second quality test.
Also rejecting the social media reports of an alleged petrol shortage Mr. Ranatunga said there is no basis for such rumors and confirmed that the CPC has sufficient stocks. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

US shows finding on Ram Setu reaffirms our stand, says BJP
	
The claim made in a new show of a US science channel that the 'Ram Setu' between India and Sri Lanka is man-made has reaffirmed BJP's stand on the issue, the party said on Wednesday, asserting that it believes in the existence of Lord Ram.
"It is unfortunate that Congress has always been apologetic when it came to respecting Hindu religion. I wish once and for all this debate (on Ram Setu) is settled. We should respect Ram Setu and no damage should be done to it," Union minister Piyush Goyal told a press conference.
His Cabinet colleague and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at the UPA government for an affidavit in the Supreme Court which had questioned the belief among Hindus that the land bridge was built by Lord Ram to reach then Lanka to rescue his wife Sita, as depicted in the epic Ramayana.
"Those who filed the affidavit should explain now. The research has supported what BJP has been claiming all along...The setu is part of our cultural heritage," Prasad told reporters here. In a promo for its upcoming show, the channel quotes an archaeologist that the rocks on top of sand pre-date the sand. "This is what BJP has been saying all along," minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju said here.
BJP, Goyal said, is not apologetic about its love for Lord Ram and for the party functionaries he was an ideal human being. "A secular democratic framework allows each Indian to respect his religion. We are proud of our religion and we are proud of every religion in India," he said. (Times of India)

Walking the Talk Echoing the message that women are powerful!
	
Rotaractors of National School of Business Management create platform of power
When beauty and brains combine the result could be a formidable force! The effect of the combined synergies of Dr. Janaki Kuruppu, Rosy Senanayake, Kaishika Rodrigo and Stephanie Siriwardhana caused a ripple effect in the hearts and minds of those present at a forum at LakshmanKadirgamar Institute on November 25.
Setting the pace for the event, held under the theme Women of Change, were the Rotaractors of National School of Business Management, who paved the way for the interesting, thought-provoking and radical ideas to be shared from womb-to-tomb transition of women and also men in contention.
This event was a success due to the patronage of Youth Magazine Sri Lanka (the strategic partner of the event), Brandix Lanka Limited and Millennium IT (Platinum Sponsor).
Powerful themes
Themes ranging from girl-child to motherhood, parenting patterns, part-time and professional work, societal attitudes, taboos, stereotyping and empowerment in essence were discussed in order to feed the minds of youth and society at large. These topics have the power to serve as change-agents and empower women. The topics also have the potential to positively influence the thinking of men.
Dr. Kuruppu reiterated the strong influence of her father as being contributory to her professional success in perceived male-dominated realms such as mathematics, which enabled her to step out of traditional cocoons and compete on equal footing with men. 
Dr. Kuruppu champions the ideals of motherhood and the power of a mothers love. She is invited to corporate meetings, corporate boards and has been at the helm of commerce and enterprise in Sri Lanka, at Tea-Board and Mother Lanka, owing to her brilliance, business acumen and resilience.
Echoing her sentiments Siriwardhana, who having grown-up with three brothers, a supportive father, and now a fiance, as well as a mother who championed her dreams and ideals, is a unique example of a woman whose brains and beauty have showcased Sri Lanka at international beauty pageants, as a contestant and judge.
Championing her intrinsic talents in Latin American dance, she is undeterred by societal criticism or norms and has delved into Pole Dancing, with elegance and fervour.
First Sri Lanka female comedian Contrary to Siriwardhana, Rodrigo faced challenges to champion her plethora of talents, which ranged from drama, music, public speaking, debating and sports. She was finally able to fund her unique niche of being a stand-up Comedian; a first for a Sri Lankan woman!
She endorses the fact that siblings of different gender should ideally be brought up by parents on an equal footing and given opportunities for talents to emerge and develop, rather than be kept dormant.
Touching a chord with children and women, a globally well-known face in the spheres of beauty, deportment, grooming and also in politics, Senanayake commands respect. She has an inimitable persona which speaks of courage, compassion and yet takes on the every challenge and battle with strength and zeal. Her forthcoming initiative Think Equal will be mooted in schools, montessori and will permeate across society to parents, teachers and caregivers.
Its envisioned as a powerful tool set to shatter mindsets that debar positive thinking and progress. There is hope that a new paradigm shift in thinking will benefit for the girl-child and boy-child alike.
Her many citations of being discriminated in politics, degraded and side-lined struck a chord of sympathy for the marginalised women in Sri Lanka, India and the rest of the world.
Her determination and strong voice for equality and justice, through policy and legislation should be applauded.
Alles in her address to the gathering spoke of heroines, such as women who trudged for miles to fetch water, to feed their children and then went to work.
She shared an emphatic story of a selfless woman, who shared her property and erected a tube-well; the memories she recalled capturing the imagination of the affluent men and women who formed the audience.
The event generated much interest and thought-provoking new ideals for empowerment, action plans for change and the power of a collective voice to resonate around the world, through media and like-minded forums, to benefit all Sri Lankans.
Ushan Samarakone, Brand Activation Manager, was present on behalf of Youth Magazine Sri Lanka to endorse the event. The event was organised and executed by Rtr. Farshard Samsudeen and Rtr. Tabit Jeffrey and their Women of Change Team from Rotaract Club of National School of Business Management
The public is invited to collaborate with the organisers for future themed events which will be catalyst in positive change.

We are one: Palestinian Christians and Muslims unite against Trumps Jerusalem call
	
REUTERS, 13th DECEMBER, 2017- Less than an hour after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israels capital, Palestinians protested by turning off the lights on the Christmas tree outside Bethlehems Church of the Nativity, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
It was a timely reminder that while headlines focused on Islamist calls for uprisings and Trumps references to Jewish historical ties, the presidents words also stirred deep feelings among the Palestinians small Christian community.
Coming out of the Sunday service in his Assyrian Catholic church in Jerusalem, Fredrick Hazo accused Trump of dragging all the world into trouble, and called on the U.S. leader to reverse his decision.
We are united - Christians, Muslims, we are one, said the 59-year-old Palestinian musician, standing in an alley in the heart of the Old City, surrounded by shops selling religious trinkets.
