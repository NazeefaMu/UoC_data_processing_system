Big Vig does it again


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya recently invited the provincial chiefs to a confab to be followed by a dinner.

 


The main purpose of this meeting was to seek the support of the provincial bodies for the passage of the 20th Amendment. 


However, the Northern chief was conspicuous by his absence at this confab. Only the governing one was there to represent the Northern body.


At the outset there was a big question mark over the Northern one’s absence, because the political party he represents had already decided to back the Amendment. However, it transpired later that Big Vig had really boycotted the event because he and his cohorts who had embarked on a political journey of their own had already decided to defeat the proposed Amendment. 


Given the indications that several other provincial bodies too are set to defeat the Amendment, the latest design aimed at making a further postponement of the polls might go haywire, they say.
