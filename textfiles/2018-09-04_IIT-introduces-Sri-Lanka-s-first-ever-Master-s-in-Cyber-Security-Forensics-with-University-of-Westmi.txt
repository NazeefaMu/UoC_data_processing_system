Commenting on the newest addition to the institute’s portfolio, Naomi Krishnarajah – Dean of IIT stated, “In today’s high-tech world, computers play a vital role in all aspects of our daily lives. Numerous industries and institutions – from hospitals, banks, power plants, telecommunication companies and many more – rely heavily on them for virtually every aspect of their operations. Unfortunately, while the world is becoming increasingly inter-connected, there is not enough attention paid to the security aspects and therefore computer systems and the huge volumes of data onthem are vulnerableto attacks by malicious parties. Therefore, the need for improved computer security has never been greater and will only continue to increase into the future. Weare introducing this Master’s programmeto increase the number of skilled professionals in the country to cope with this fast-changing field of IT.
