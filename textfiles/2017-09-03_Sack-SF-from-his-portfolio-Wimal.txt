National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said today Minister and Field Marshal, Sarath Fonseka should be removed from his portfolio for making a traitorous statement on former army commander Jagath Jayasuriya just as former minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was removed for violating collective Cabinet responsibility.

He told a news conference that if the government failed to do so one could then assume that the statement made by Mr. Fonseka was its view as well.

“The government should take action against the minister. Former minister Rajapakshe was removed for making a statement against the sale of the Hambantota port. So why should Mr. Fonseka not removed for making a traitorous statement,” Mr. Weerawansa asked.

He said if he had evidence against Mr. Jayasuriya, he should have complained to the police to take legal action against him without making allegations before the whole world and added that several military personnel had been punished on such complaints.

“Channel4 is making allegations against Mr. Jayasuriya. Mr. Fonseka’s allegations would fuel such sinister moves. If there are any complaints, there are ways of taking action against the wrongdoers. It is not his duty or responsibility to make statements which betray the army,” Mr. Weerawansa said.(Ajith Siriwardana)
