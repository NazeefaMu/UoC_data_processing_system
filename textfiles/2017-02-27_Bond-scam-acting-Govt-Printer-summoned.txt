The acting Government Printer (GP) has been called before the Presidential Investigation Commission today to be questioned about the problematic issue of the publication date of the gazette notification about the Treasury Bonds issue which took place under the present government.

The secretary of the Commission, Sumathipala Udugamasuriya notified acting GP D.L. Gangani Kalpana Liyanage to appear before the commission at 10.00 am today.

The former additional superintend of the Public Debt Department of Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Dr. Mohamed Azeem has also been summoned to appear before the commission as a witness today.

The chairman of the Commission directed the investigating officers last Thursday to immediately record a statement from the GP about the publication date of the relevant gazette notification.

Accordingly, the investigating officers had recorded a statement from the acting GP.

The problem about the date of the gazette notification arose when the secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Dr. L.H.S. Samarathunga, was giving his evidence before the commission on Thursday.

Gazette No. 1895/19 had been issued on 1 January 2015, when former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was the minister of finance. (Ranjan Pathmasiri)
