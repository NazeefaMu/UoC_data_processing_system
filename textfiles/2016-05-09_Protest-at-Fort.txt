Sri Lanka’s Frontline Socialist Party staged a protest at Colombo Fort today against the recent increase in taxes. They charged that while the government is squeezing every penny out from the poor by way of taxes, the rich and the politicians are living in luxury, enjoying privileges on people’s tax money.
