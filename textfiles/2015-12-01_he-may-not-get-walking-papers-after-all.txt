This white collar one functioning at a secretarial level under yahapalanaya may have to go home soon, say informed sources.
The white collar one has come under a cloud following the exposure of his complicity in a shady deal carried out during the previous regime. Another white collar one, who was once close to this bigwig has spilled the beans before the law, they say.
Given the gravity of the charges against this bigwig, his continuance in the key post he holds has raised eyebrows in many quarters.  Meanwhile, some people in the know of his close ties with the authorities in the highest echelons in yahapalanaya wonder whether he will get his walking papers after all.
