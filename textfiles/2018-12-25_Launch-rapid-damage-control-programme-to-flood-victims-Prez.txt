President Maithripala Sirisena today instructed relevant authorities to launch a rapid damage control and compensation programme to flood affected people who were returning from safety locations in the North while continuing the relief programme.

The President instructed the Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray to launch a relief programme in coordination with all government institutions in the Kilinochchi and Mulaitive districts to provide food, dry ration, drinking water and sanitary facilities needed for the affected people.

The Presidential Media Division (PMD) said in a statement that compensation amounting to Rs. 250,000 would be paid to renovate damaged houses after estimating the loss.

More than 8000 acres of paddy fields have been inundated by the floods and the government has decided to pay Rs. 40,000 per damaged acre of paddy lands as compensation. More than 60,000 people who have been displaced by the floods have been housed in 37 temporary welfare camps, according to the President's media division.
