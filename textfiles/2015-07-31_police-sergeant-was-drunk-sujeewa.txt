Deputy Justice Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe today rejected the allegation that he had threatened a sergeant attached to the Athurugiriya Police and said he had advised the sergeant not to consume alcohol while on duty.
The deputy minister accused the police sergeant of being under the influence of liquor and had tried to disrupt an event where he was to address a small gathering of people using sub-woofers.
“When I came to the scene, I realised that the sergeant was drunk and when he spoke his mouth smelt of liquor. I advised him not to turn up for duty if he was drunk because the police service was a responsible profession,” he said.
The deputy minister said the sergeant had dragged one of his supporters towards the police station causing heavy traffic congestion on the road.
“I informed SSP Mahen Gunasekara about the sergeant's the behavior and asked him to carry out a spot check-up to determine if the sergeant was drunk. Later I came to know that the sergeant had complained against me,” he said.
In a complaint, the sergeant said deputy minister had threatened him when he requested the deputy minister to refrain from holding a road show using sub-woofers at the Habarakada Junction in Homagama on Thursday night.
However, the deputy minister said that SSP Gunasekara had allowed him to continue with the event because there is no ban on using sub-woofers for electioneering . (Piyumi Fonseka)
