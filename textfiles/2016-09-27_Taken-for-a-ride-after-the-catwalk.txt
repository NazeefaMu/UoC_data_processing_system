A story has gone viral about how a group of five fashion models hired to participate in a big show abroad have been cheated out of their fees amounting to a total of Rs.5 million by a prominent politico.



A sister of a wellknown artiste very close to the politico had taken the five models to the show abroad promising them a fee of Rs.1 million each for their performance, on the strength of an assurance given by the politician. However, the politician himself had pocketed the money obtained from the organizers of the show abroad leaving the five fashion models high and dry.
