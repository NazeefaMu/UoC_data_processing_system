Winning votes the easy way


	



 

A high-up of a statutory body looking after air traffic had presented a New Year gift with a difference to their purohita at the top table. 

 


Believe it or not! The gift was a large stock of footwear!


This state-run body had been in the thick of flood relief activity in the past and this stock of footwear accounts for a collection received as donations from the public which the white-collar bigwigs had failed to distribute among the flood victims. They had later decided to present the entire stock lying idle to the Deputy purohita. However, the purohita of the top team, on hearing about the proposed move had told the white collar ones that he could put the stock to good use.


By the way, the purohita’s constituents in cool climes will receive these footwear as gifts shortly, they say.
