Thiran – Bhavan feud threatens a split in the party


	



 

The main political party in the North is too plagued by internal dissention these days, they say.

 


There had been a recent attempt by a ‘Bhavan lord’ commanding much media clout to oust the party’s virtual second-in-command Thiran.


The Bhavan lord while quietly planning the ouster had given phone calls to several Diyawanna members of the party and one of the call recipients had taken the trouble to send a recording of the call to Thiran. Fireworks in the party had followed with the cat getting out of the bag!


The Thiran- Bhavan feud has led to a split in the party right down the middle, they say.
