MR meets Prime Minister

 
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday. The meeting took place after Rajapaksa sought a meeting with the Prime Minister, highly placed political sources told the Daily News.
The meeting took place at the Parliamentary complex, they further added.
It was speculated that the meeting took place in the backdrop of JMO reports claiming former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen had been murdered. The JMO reports were presented to the court on Thursday.
