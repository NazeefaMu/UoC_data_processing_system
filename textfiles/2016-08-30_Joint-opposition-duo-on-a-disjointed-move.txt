Two Diyawanna members from the so-called joint opposition had recently presented some ‘demands’ to the secretary of a main political party. And the party secretary had conveyed these ‘demands’ to President Sirisena. 

 


However, the President had rejected the ‘demands’ saying that he was not prepared to grant perks and privileges to anyone by way of preferential treatment.
