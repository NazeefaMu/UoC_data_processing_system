Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said that the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) had become more powerful than government service in the country today where activities of government servants and politicians were monitored by NGOs and media.

He expressed these views at a meeting held with the staff of the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry last Monday.
“When we started doing politics, there were no websites or facebook, but today the country is governed by a group of people from a faraway country and have a website and capable of hacking a facebook,” he said.

Minister De Silva said those who work in government service were bound to carry out their duties and responsibilities whichever government comes to power.

He said the government servants should realize that there was another group to look into the shortcomings when carrying out government service.

He further said that government servants get too many holidays and added that when there was additional holiday on a week day, it is difficult to get things done.
