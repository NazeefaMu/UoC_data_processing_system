Won’t allow to abolish executive presidency: NFF


	

The National Freedom Front (NFF) today said it would never allow the JVP proposal on abolishing the executive presidency to be approved in Parliament as it would lead to a divided country .

“The government headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has induced the JVP to submit a proposal to abolish the executive presidency so that it can fulfil the agendas of foreign countries. The Prime Minister failed in his attempt to create a federal State because of the lack of support from other political parties. This time, however he is using the JVP as the cat’s paw to fulfil his ambitions,” National Freedom Front (NFF) Organiser Jayantha Samaraweera told a news conference yesterday.

Mr. Samaraweera said the NFF will join other patriotic civil society groups to educate the people on the dangers of this proposal. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
