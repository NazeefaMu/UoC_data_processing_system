Leave of all the Ceylon Electricity Workers (CEB) employees have been cancelled until September 20, due to the service requirement, the CEB announced.

The decision has been taken after the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Workers’ Union announced that they would launch an indefinite strike from today over several demands including the revision of the salary ratio from 1:6 to 1:9

They warned that no repair work will be carried in the case of a breakdown or power failure except at government hospitals, during the strike.
