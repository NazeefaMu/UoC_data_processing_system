If MP Geetha Kumarasinghe disqualified to be a Member of Parliament due to her dual citizenship, former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran’s duties should also become null because he is not even a citizen of Sri Lanka, the Joint Opposition (JO) charged yesterday.

The Appeal Court on Wednesday ruled MP Kumarasinghe was disqualified to function as an MP owing to her dual citizenship of Sri Lanka and Switzerland.

Addressing a news conference, MP Bandula Gunawardane said the currency notes signed by Arjuna Mahendran, who holds a Singapore citizenship, might also become null. He said there are several MPs who hold dual citizenship and attempt to conceal theirs.

Meanwhile, Prof. G. L. Peiris said the former CB Governor had not even sworn-in for the post he had held because he was not a Sri Lankan citizen.

He also said Ms. Kumarasinghe will file an appeal in the Supreme Court next week against the Court of Appeal's ruling, and she had already informed the Speaker in this regard through her lawyers. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
