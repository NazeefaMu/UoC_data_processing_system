Seven Sri Lankans were caught at Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore while attempting to smuggle in over 2 kg of gold valued at over Rs. 65.70 lakh.

According to Customs Air Intelligence Unit, the group comprised six women. They had arrived at 8 p.m. on Sunday. Six of them had concealed gold biscuits in their rectum while one lady had crushed gold bangles and hid it in her hair bun.

“They are part of an international gold smuggling racket that operates from Chennai and has links with South Asian countries,” said a senior customs official.

Interrogation revealed that the group was to be taken from Bengaluru to Chennai by a handler, who was waiting for them outside the airport. They were given Rs. 20,000 each for smuggling the gold, apart from airfare and accommodation. (The Hindu)
