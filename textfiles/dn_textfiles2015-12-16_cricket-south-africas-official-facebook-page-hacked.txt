Cricket South Africa's official Facebook page hacked

Followers of Cricket South Africa's official Facebook page were in for a rude shock as the Cricket team's new feed started filling up with explicit content. The page, that has over 30 lakh likes, had links titled ‘What Happens During Sex In The Human Body’, ‘Kendall Jenner puts her NIPPLES and BUTT on display in See Through Outfit!’, ‘How to do “friends with Benefits”. The Board was forced to issue an apology on their official twitter account and said they are working to resolve the issue.
