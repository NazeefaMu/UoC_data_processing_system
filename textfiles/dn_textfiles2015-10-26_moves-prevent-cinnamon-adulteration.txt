Moves to prevent cinnamon adulteration

The Agriculture Export Crop Department will formulate a National Policy for cinnamon to prevent adulteration of export oriented cinnamon.

This has created a big demand for cinnamon produced in Galle, Matara and Hambantota districts, a spokesman for the Agriculture Export Crop Department said.
