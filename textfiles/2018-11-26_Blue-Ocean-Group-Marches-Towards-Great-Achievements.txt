Blue Ocean Group, Marches Towards Great Achievements…


	



There is a general speculation in the real estate trade that Sri Lanka has no promising future because a very high competition prevails among a large number of construction companies. But Blue Ocean Group had negated this theory with its tremendous success in this trade. The Group had proved beyond any doubt that the demand for condominium apartments in Sri Lanka is on rapid increase and the industry has good prospects in the long run.

People prefer to go for condominiums in consideration of their highest security, low maintenance costs and trouble free life.  Many Sri Lankan families are now moving into cities like Colombo for better employments, business and higher educational opportunities for their children. As it is rather difficult and time to find separate houses for such purposes, condominiums become their easiest and quickest solution while saving their money, time and energy. 

Commenting on the group’s continuous success in the real estate trade, Group Chairman SivarajahThumilan (ACA, ACCA, ACMA (UK), CGMA, CPA (AUS), MCSI (UK), FM AAT (SL) ACS - Chartered Accountant) said,

It is true that there is a high competition in the real estate trade in Sri Lanka but we have achieved tremendous success through our untiring efforts to the extent of conquering many international awards. We dedicate this chain of success to our clients as we take these achievements as the reflection of the unshakable trust they have kept in us.  We have established our brand name firmly since our inception by which today we have become the first choice for anyone who thinks about owning an apartment in Sri Lanka.

Our member company Link Engineering is currently handling 35 private, projects and 38 public projects all over the island. Meanwhile, Blue Ocean is doing 35 large projects in 10 cities, targeting 1250 residences at a stretch. For year 2018 alone we handled nearly Rs.55 Billion worth of projects which is supposed to be a historic record for a private construction company.It is the first- ever record in Sri Lanka’s real estate history for a single group to undertake such a large number of projects, at one stretch.

As another feather to its cap, Blue Ocean Group had set an impressive record of completing the six multiple condominium projects simultaneously. Within the last 3 – 4 months we have completedover 175 condominium units in De Alwis Avenue, Mount Lavinia, Barnes Avenue, Mount Lavinia, Lillan Avenue, Mount Lavinia, Beach Road, Mount Lavinia, De Alwis Place, Dehiwala, Inner Flower Road, Colombo 03, Gregory’s Road, Colombo 07. In addition, another 125 Condo Units to be completed within the next 2 months.

There are many reasons behind this situation. Firstly, we give high importance to the locations we select for our complexes. We give maximum focus on a trouble free,decent, secure, hygienic and uncongested environment suitable for a peaceful living. Our general idea is to create an atmosphere for the residents that they are far away from the dusty, noisy and disturbing city life.

Also, to suit the customer’s financial capacity we have taken an additional step to classify our apartments into three categories – First Class, Business Class and Economy Class and carry out our construction works with a highly qualified team and using high quality materials. 

With our experience, technical expertise and manpower we provide a constructive customer service with our own team of professionals, comprising 05 Chartered Architects, 08 Chartered Engineers, 04 Chartered Accountants, 42 Civil Engineers, 25 MEP Engineers, 58 Quantity Surveyors and 335 Staff of other professions in the Construction trade. 

Our Group is now technically further strengthened with the joining of M.R. Jeyachandran (MPM(Aus) ,MBA(Aus) ,PG.Dip(B&F.Mgt), B.Sc(Hons), C.Eng.MIE(SL) as the new Chief Executive Officer.  Being the former Director General of the Buildings Department and former Chairman of C.I.D.A, Jeyachandran is a highly experienced and successful team leader.  His wide experience in the construction related field will be of a definite advantage to our Group.

The Group’s consistent year on year improvement in financial results is a clear indication of the financial sustainability of our business model. To ensure the sustainability of the social and environmental aspects associated with our business, we continue to embrace best practices for social and environmental management. From a social perspective, our infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and has improved the standard of living of our stakeholders. Our work to empower these communities has made Blue Ocean Group a brand name and an exemplary corporate citizen of Sri Lanka.
