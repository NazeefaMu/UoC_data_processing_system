Tough tide ahead

Three months after the general election, the government's crackdown on various acts of commission and omission during the previous regime is gathering momentum. As if in response to mounting public criticism about inaction against corruption, there are many investigations underway and hardly a day passes without a stalwart of the former administration making headlines for alleged misdeeds.
Within the last week former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga, former Minister Janaka Bandara Tennekoon, former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan (Pillayan) were all brought before law enforcement authorities.
All this is in keeping with the promises made by President Maithripala Sirisena during the Presidential election and the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) which promised yahapaalanaya or good governance and a return to the rule of law during the general election. However, this drive to 'name and shame' alleged culprits is politically a double edged sword.
The hiccups in the processes are quite evident. When former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga and another senior official of the previous regime, Anusha Pelpita were granted bail, an explanation was called from Police as to why they were afforded that privilege.
Political agenda
Elsewhere, D.M.S. Dissanayake, Senior Assistant Secretary in the Defence Ministry and the officer-in-charge of Civil Security has come under investigation over the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde Maritime Services Limited. Then there was feverish speculation in some sections of the media that there would be developments regarding massive amounts of money stashed away in a bank in Dubai, leading to a public denial by parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
Clearly, it is no easy task to clean the Augean stables. On the one hand, the government is being accused of not doing enough, quickly enough, to institute action against wrongdoers. It has also been accused of being selective in its prosecutions, implying there was a political agenda underlying the targeted individuals.
On the other hand, the government is also hamstrung by several factors: in keeping with the tenets of good governance that it preached, it has to adopt a 'hands off' approach to the prosecution process, allowing the law to take its course. This may at times not yield the expected results. A case in point was the investigation into Kumaran Pathmanathan, better known as 'KP', financier to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and a most wanted man. The Attorney General was to inform courts that, despite his chequered history, there was no evidence against him to justify a prosecution!
There may be legal technicalities that led to this conclusion, but a government which came into power comparing the fates of KP (being mollycoddled by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government) and Sarath Fonseka (jailed during the Rajapaksa era) now finds that it cannot prosecute a man with known terrorist credentials.
Ministers have also expressed their displeasure about senior officials in the state bureaucracy. Most of these officials attained their position during the previous government and were beholden to their political masters to ensure that they kept their jobs, in keeping with the political culture of that time.
When the Sirisena government took office in January, while there was much reshuffling, there was no mass scale purge of state officials.
When questioned about this, President Sirisena reportedly said that if all officials loyal to the Rajapaksa regime were to be dismissed, there would be no one left! Now though, the government is encountering obstacles in implementing its policies and investigating its predecessors because these officials are either hampering inquiries or creating difficulties for the new administration.
There were reports that an official of the Defence Ministry was a stumbling block in the Avant Garde inquiry. Similarly, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was perturbed by the pronouncements of our envoy in Geneva during the recently concluded sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and had to intervene personally. These are just two instances where officials whose loyalties still lie with the previous regime are believed to have been 'difficult'.
August general election
Another obstacle encountered by the government is its own composition. Because the UNFGG did not win an absolute majority at the August general election, it was compelled to form a 'national government' with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of which the leader is President Sirisena.
Although the UNFGG could have cobbled together a coalition either with the support of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) or by obtaining the support of a handful of SLFPers (both of which were reportedly forthcoming), both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were keen on pursuing the national government option, with an eye on introducing key constitutional reforms that would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
This political marriage of convenience has however led to snags primarily because it has allowed the stalwarts of the previous administration to gain ministerial and deputy ministerial status, while still having allegations of corruption and abuse of power against them.
These individuals have been accommodated either because they were known as Rajapaksa loyalists and their allegiance has been sought to strengthen the President's grip on the SLFP or because they command significant support at the electorate level, despite the charges pending against them.
Although the President has publicly pledged that investigations against these individuals would continue, this is easier said than done. Officials conducting investigations are in a quandary and fear consequences because their 'targets' are presently holding office.
This is hampering the investigation process, because the country's bureaucracy still subscribes to a culture of serving the political masters of the day instead of acting independently.
President Sirisena must also be mindful that, despite the power he wields as Executive President, his hold on his own party, the SLFP, will be constantly put to the test by Rajapaksa. For now, the former President is content to maintain a low profile as a parliamentarian for the Kurunegala district, resorting only to releasing the occasional press statement, as he did on the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka.
But there is little doubt that given half a chance, Rajapaksa will not hesitate to seize the initiative and attempt to wrest control of the party. Hence, President Sirisena has the unenviable tasks of co-habiting with a United National Party led government, keeping his own party men happy lest they desert to Rajapaksa's fold and at the same time honouring his election promises of punishing those guilty of corruption and abuse of power.
Prosecuting wrongdoers
The latter is also not an issue that could be resolved with the prosecution of a handful of cases. There are many politicians who have earned a reputation for being corrupt and the unrelenting exposure in the media - including social media which has proved crucial in recent times - demands that all of them be dealt with, especially if they continue to represent the masses in the country's legislature.
So, it is a saga that will continue for some time to come. In the meantime, the government has a few short term challenges to overcome. Its first 'proper' budget is due in a few weeks. Local Government elections are scheduled for March next year.
Through all this, the 'national' government is tasked with providing a stable administration while at the same time prosecuting wrongdoers without fear or favour. Indeed, the polls in March might provide an indicator as to how the general public rates the major parties in the performance of these responsibilities.
