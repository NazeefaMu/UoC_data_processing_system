Govt. mustn't deride Steering Committee report: JO


	

The joint opposition (JO) said today the Steering Committee report containing Constitutional proposals is an essential requirement in the parliamentary resolution outlining the procedure to devise the new Constitution and as such the government should not deride it to deflect public outrage.

It said this when the government reiterated that the report was not the final draft and therefore people should not be alarmed unnecessarily.

Former UPFA MP G.L. Peiris told a news conference that the submission of reports by the six sub-committees and the Steering Committee was a requirement in the resolution adopted by Parliament on Constitution-making.

He said the report contained the building blocks of the new Constitution in relation to key areas such as the unitary character of the country, status accorded to Buddhism, powers of provincial governors and the concurrent list. (Kelum Bandara)
