[Up & Under]
Rugby can learn a lot from cricket

Cricket has cracked a World Cup after much pain and achievement purely on the skill and talent naturally born around this bountiful island. We have broken that imposing psychological barrier of being intimidated by other international teams ....we hold our own and the luxury of putting pressure before competition. This is a luxury of reputation based on skill and pure achievement.
Rugby has a few steps on this platform ...and the luxury label of a warrior belief and respected for their dedication and passion. We can learn bloodlines from the impressive Fijian, Samoan, Tongan and ultimate warriors ...the New Zealand All Blacks ...champions in all formats of the international game.
The heart for more...the mind to be relentless and an attitude in training mind and body ...that goes beyond conventional human beings. Does SRi have those warrior hearts to go beyond ...a question I asked the All Blacks guru of 7s Sir Gordon Titjens - 19 yrs coaching NZ ...and easily the best the world has ever seen. A win record that is jealously guarded including World Cup current champs ...Commonwealth Games champs, World Series 7s most consistent winners since it started. Sir Gordon or Titjh ...has been there and continues the legend in 2016...long may he reign.
Dialog league
A weekend of agonising score lines that speak of team mentality and endurance. Kandy nearly playing into CR's hands much to the shock and disbelief of the Nittawela faithful. The first round nearly upset the unbeaten tag ...round 2 was a closer finish ...Kandy surviving 15/12 to relief and a note to the rugby chairman Lasantha to have space cleared in their trophy cabinet.
Coincidentally all the matches right down to the wire ...tantalizing conclusions that could have swung either way till the final whistle.
Army-Navy 32/35..the sailors nearly sinking despite the on field effort, especially the Navy forwards ...Army have themselves to blame this weekend too.
Havies v Police...The much improved Police also stepped up with Reza Mubarak, Rehan Weerakoon, and no 8 Radeesha Seneviratne who had a storm...hounding in defence and lethal in attack; final score - 27/24 to Havelocks. Havies certainly missing Niroshan Fernando...Dulaj Perera and Danushka Ranjan ...on injury recovery.
The league all wrapped up: 1. Kandy 67points. 2. Havelocks 59. 3. CR 47. 4. Navy 41.5. Police 31. All hail the Dialog league!
Rugby nation in radar
St Peter's honoured its sons at a glittering ceremony at the college hall ...rugby honours on national caps Danushka Ranjan, Dulaj Perera, Lee Keegal, and Ishan Noor. Big hand to all and much credit to coaching staff and the SPC old boys rugby foundation.
The U18 schools 7s successfully grabbed the attention and a platform for skills showcased ...defending champs Science College narrowly beating an inspired and much improved Trinity side 12/5 in the final. Eyes on for Trinity and their performance this season in all formats. Big hand to Science and a *7s reputation that grows with intensity.
If the game demands warriors in the middle ...it also demands support and facilities for conditioning and preparation. The practical thinking sometimes a little short on sense and more on sensation and massive pressure to resort to supplements as food and nutrition alternatives.
My humble opinion ...not an expert but as a former player and knowledge gained from survival on the world stage - keep it natural, trust the normal food groups, increase the volume of consumption and frequency of snacks...eat healthy fuel for mind and body, work on the major proteins good carbs: and necessary fat ...a balance is the ultimate key.
The mind to play this game separates the warrior from ordinary men and women. ...an honour to represent your badge ....The privilege to play for school, club and eventually your country. This honour is singular and distinct ... it's a reputation for life and a badge of rugby courage worn through life. Blessings to all those who have worn those colours and played against the world champions without much hesitation.
Sri Lanka's rugby history is a list of such warriors and gladiators from its earliest days ...wishes to all of them and respect for the effort and pride.
Bula bula those special SRi islanders...long may their performance be remembered.
