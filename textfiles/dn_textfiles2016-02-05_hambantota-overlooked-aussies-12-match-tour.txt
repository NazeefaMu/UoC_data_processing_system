Hambantota overlooked for Aussies 12-match tour

The Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium at Sooriyawewa, Hambantota which was built at enormous cost to Sri Lanka Cricket has been overlooked for Australia’s full tour of Sri Lanka which will take place in July-August.
Hambantota which is normally used to host T20 Internationals does not find a place in Australia’s provisional 12-match tour itinerary.
Australia start the tour with two warm-up matches at NCC and CCC before moving onto the three-match Test series starting on July 27 at the P Sara Oval.
Colombo will host two of the Tests with Galle being given the other. Traditionally Galle hosts the first Test of a series but in this instance they have been given the second Test. Due to the Kandy Perahera in August, Pallekele fails to get a Test match instead the third Test will be played at the SSC. Pallekele will host the fifth ODI and the first T20I.
Dambulla gets two ODIs both of which will be day games and the R Premadasa Stadium will host the first two ODIs and the second and final T20I.
Australia last toured Sri Lanka for a full series in 2011 where they won the Test series 1-0, ODI series 3-2 and lost the T20I series 0-2.
