Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa questioned the country’s law and order stating that there is no purpose if it doesn’t protect the people.

While expressing his condolence on Saturday over the tragic assassination of cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva’s father - Ranjan de Silva, MP Rajapaksa said authorities should take the matter serious as the incident could add a black mark to the country.

He said the tragedy had occurred due to the actions of these drug kingpins who were operating under the shade of money and political umbrella.

“Without bending the country’s law and order IGP Pujith Jayasundara should take immediate actions to curb the drug menace and eradicate crimes,” he added. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
