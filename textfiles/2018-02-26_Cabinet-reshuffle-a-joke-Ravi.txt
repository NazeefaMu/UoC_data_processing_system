United National Party (UNP) MP Ravi Karunanayake told journalists yesterday the Cabinet reshuffle was a joke and an eyewash.

He said at an event held in Central Colombo that it would have been better if such an exercise was not carried out.

He said a proper programme of work should be carried out to fulfil the people’s aspirations. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
