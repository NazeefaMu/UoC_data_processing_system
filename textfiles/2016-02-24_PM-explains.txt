PM explains


	

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the opposition were engaged in an argument in Parliament yesterday over an Indian ambulance service which is to be begun shortly in the Southern and Western Provinces.

The argument was triggered when opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena asked why the government had allowed an Indian NGO to start an ambulance service in Sri Lanka without informing anyone or even Parliament. The MP charged that this had been done without even advertising for local organisations to submit applications to provide such a service.

Mr. Wickremesinghe said India and Sri Lanka would conduct the service jointly for two years and it would be handed over to Sri Lanka after that.

Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked whether the Sri Lankan government was making some payment to India for the service. The Premier said a certain sum would be paid.

Responding to another question from the opposition (as to whether the government could not find any local partner to run this service) the Prime Minister said the opposition should name a local partner who was willing and able. (Yohan Perera)
