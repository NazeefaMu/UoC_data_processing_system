Indian Leaders flay SL for seizing TN boats
	
Strongly condemning the taking over of boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen by the Sri Lankan government, political leaders including DMK treasurer M.K. Stalin sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take steps for releasing the boats and fishermen arrested by the Island Navy.
Stalin said the move to take over the boats of Tamil Nadu fishermen is against the decision taken in the six rounds of talks held between the fishermen representatives and governments of the two countries. The Island government is not giving the importance for the relationship between the two countries, he alleged.
Expressing shock at the island government's decision, he said the Centre had not come forward to rebuke the Lankan government and protect the rights of Tamil Nadu fishermen. The state government too had not exerted enough pressure on the Centre, he added.
Several rounds of talks had been conducted between the fishermen representatives and governments of India and Sri Lanka till now, but no solution had been found. Tamil Nadu fishermen are insisting on fishing rights in their traditional fishing area for which artificial boundaries had been drawn, but the Island government is adamantly refusing to accept the demand.
TNCC chief S. Thirunavukkarasar said the Lankan government's move showed that it did not respect Narendra Modi's government and added that the Island government's announcement also betrays its lack of interest in solving the fishermen issue.
Describing the move as a direct challenge to the Indian government, MDMK general secretary Vaiko alleged that the BJP government at the Centre has been sacrificing the interests of Lankan Tamils for the Island nation's friendship. The approach of the Indian government is the reason for the Lankan government's arrogant action, he charged.
CPI state secretary R. Mutharasan said while India is claiming that Lankan is a friendly country, but the Island nation had arrogantly come out with such an announcement. The Lankan government's arbitrary announcement stems from the Indian government's move of acceding Katchatheevu to Lanka, he complained.( Deccan Chronicle)

Full text of the Secretary-Generals message
On my first day as Secretary-General of the United Nations, one question weighs heavily on my heart.
How can we help the millions of people caught up in conflict, suffering massively in wars with no end in sight
Civilians are pounded with deadly force. Women, children and men are killed and injured, forced from their homes, dispossessed and destitute. Even hospitals and aid convoys are targeted.
No one wins these wars; everyone loses. Trillions of dollars are spent destroying societies and economies, fueling cycles of mistrust and fear that can last for generations. Whole regions are destabilized and the new threat of global terrorism affects us all.
On this New Years Day, I ask all of you to join me in making one shared New Years resolution:
Let us resolve to put peace first.
Let us make 2017 a year in which we all  citizens, governments, leaders  strive to overcome our differences.
From solidarity and compassion in our daily lives, to dialogue and respect across political divides From ceasefires on the battlefield, to compromise at the negotiating table to reach political solutions
Peace must be our goal and our guide.
All that we strive for as a human family  dignity and hope, progress and prosperity  depends on peace. 
But peace depends on us.
I appeal to you all to join me in committing to peace, today and every day.
Let us make 2017 a year for peace.
Thank you.

## Title: Sri Lanka ponder changes for second Test

Sri Lanka ponder changes for second Test
	
Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews spoke about the need for his team to be mentally tough when they meet South Africa in the second Test starting at Newlands, South Africa on Monday -- but they may need also need some changes in personnel.
In losing the first Test in Port Elizabeth by 206 runs, Sri Lanka showed weaknesses in both batting and bowling.
While South Africa seem certain to go into the match with an unchanged team, Mathews admitted there would be debate in the Sri Lankan camp about the composition of their side.
Kusal Perera's role as an attacking number three batsman could come in for particular scrutiny. He was out for seven and six in Port Elizabeth, on both occasions playing ill-judged cut shots.
With Perera having been compared to Sanath Jayasuriya, on whom he has based his game, Mathews said he would not like to see the young left-hander abandon his attacking instincts.
But Mathews said that slashing at South Africa's fast bowlers on pitches with pace and bounce "wasn't the right game plan".
He said he was not sure whether changes would be made but acknowledged that Upul Tharanga, a more conservative left-hander, was an option. "He can bat from one to seven."
Whereas in sub-continental conditions Sri Lanka usually base their bowling attack on spin, they opted in Port Elizabeth for three pace bowlers and only one specialist spinner in veteran Rangana Herath.
Although Suranga Lakmal bowled well, taking five wickets in the first innings, the fast bowlers seldom threatened in the second innings, when South Africa made 406 for six declared.
Dusmantha Chameera was disappointing, taking only one wicket in the match and conceding 153 runs at more than five runs an over.
Mathews indicated, however, that Chameera could be given another chance.
"He is coming back from injury," said Mathews. "He has not got his rhythm back but he can do better in the second Test."
Although there has been an extended period of hot, dry weather in Cape Town, the pitch is still likely to offer more pace and bounce than Port Elizabeth, although spinners could play a role later in the match.
An option for Sri Lanka might be to play to their traditional strength by picking two spinners, with off-spinner Dilruwan Perera coming into the side.
Perera would also strengthen what in Port Elizabeth proved to be a lengthy batting "tail".
Newlands has been a fortress for the South African team, who have won 19 of the 29 Tests played there since 1993, with their only four defeats all having been against Australia.
The New Year Test is traditionally the biggest occasion in South African cricket and the ground is sold out for the first day.
Coming on the back of a series victory in Australia last month and a convincing win in Port Elizabeth, South Africa will be favourites to wrap up the three-match series.(Sports24)

Terror attack on Istanbul nightclub leaves 35 dead
	
At least 35 people have lost their lives in an attack on a nightclub in Turkey, Istanbul's governor has said.
Among the dead at the Istanbul club is one police officer, Vasip Sahin stated, adding that it was a terror attack.
At least another 40 were injured in the attack which took place in the Reina nightclub, in the Ortakoy area, at about 01:30 local time (22:30 GMT).
The Turkish authorities have imposed a media blackout on coverage of the attack.
One attacker was involved, the governor said, while CNN Turk reported he was dressed in a Santa Claus costume.
"A terrorist with a long-range weapon ... brutally and savagely carried out this incident by firing bullets on innocent people who were there solely to celebrate the New Year and have fun," Mr Sahin told reporters at the scene of the upmarket Reina nightclub, which sits on the banks of Bosphorus in the city's European side.
The club was popular not only with Turks, but with foreigners as well, according to the BBC's Selin Girit in Istanbul.
She said it was unclear what had happened to the gunman at this stage - adding that some eyewitnesses spoke of there being not one but two attackers.
There were reportedly as many as 700 people in the nightclub at the time of the attack, some of whom have jumped into the water to escape.
Dogan news agency reported that some witnesses claimed the attackers were "speaking Arabic" while Turkish television channel NTV said special force police officers were searching the nightclub.
US President Barack Obama, who is on holiday in Hawaii, was among the first international leaders to make a statement after being briefed by his team.
"The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted," White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement.
The Turkish government has ordered a temporary media blackout in the wake of the attack, citing security and public order concerns.
This is not the first time such an order has been made.
Istanbul was already on high alert with some 17,000 police officers on duty in the city, following a string of terror attacks in recent months.
Many were carried out by so-called Islamic State (IS) or Kurdish militants.(BBC)
