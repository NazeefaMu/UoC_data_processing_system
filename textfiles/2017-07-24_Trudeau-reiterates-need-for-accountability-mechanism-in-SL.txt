Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday reiterated that Sri Lanka should establish a process of accountability that will gain the trust and the confidence of the victims of the war.

Issuing a statement on the anniversary of Black July, Prime Minister Trudeau said Canadians join Canadians of Tamil descent and members of the Tamil community to commemorate the 34th anniversary of the events of Black July.

“As we pause to reflect on the dark days of the Sri Lankan Civil War, we must continue to work to heal the wounds of all those who suffered. We welcome international efforts underway to achieve long-term reconciliation and peace for all Sri Lankans, but we reiterate the need to establish a process of accountability that will have the trust and the confidence of the victims of this war,” he said.

The Premier said Canada’s cultural diversity is one of their greatest strengths and sources of pride.

“As we mark the 150th anniversary of Confederation, let us take the time to recognize the contributions of all who have made Canada their home regardless of their cultural, religious or linguistic backgrounds. On behalf of the Government of Canada, I extend my deepest sympathy and support to all those who have suffered immeasurable loss during the Sri Lankan Civil War,” he said.

He said anti-Tamil pogroms were carried out in Colombo and other parts of Sri Lanka resulting in thousands of deaths and the displacement of countless victims between July 24 and 29 in 1983.
