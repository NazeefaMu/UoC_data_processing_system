A/L exam timetable in a muddle
	
Several candidates have lost the opportunity to sit for two subject papers with the alleged bungling of the GCE Advanced Level examination timetable, it is learnt.
The timetable had been published in the official website of the Education Department in two occasions on May 16 and June 25, and one of them appears to be inaccurate. Students who had followed the incorrect timetable have faced this issue and a group of them missed the paper on Buddhist Civilization on August 7 and the Sinhala Language paper on August 11.
When inquired about the matter, a senior spokesperson of the Education Department said every student had been sent a copy of the correct timetable along with the admission form, and therefore it was obligatory for them to adhere to the correct timetable.
Responding to a query, Examinations Commissioner General Sanath Pujitha said a tentative timetable was published in the departments website to receive comments from private candidates, and upon receipt, school principals and directors of education prepared the final and official timetable and sent copies of it to each candidate.
A private website has copied the tentative timetable from the departments website and published it in their domain to gain publicity. However, attention is now drawn to provide some relief to candidates who missed the opportunity to sit for some papers, he said. (Ranjan Kasthuri)

The IELTS-British Council partnership scheme, ADDvantage, enables individuals and organisations across the country to register IELTS candidates on behalf of the British Council, and in turn offers members a number of benefits, including access to information sessions, promotional material, as well as teacher, brand, and registration system training.
British Council representatives with IELTS partner award winners
A total of 31 awards were given away to the IELTS registration centre network of the British Council. A key highlight of the event was the performance by a dance troupe of Sunera Foundation, advocating and promoting disability arts in Sri Lanka.
Winners at the ceremony were judged based on innovation, teaching practices, IELTS volume contribution, loyalty, and IELTS ambassadorship displayed throughout the financial year.
Categorised into individual tuition providers, institutions, and corporates, awards were meted out to various migration consultants, international higher educational consultants as well as IELTS teachers  all committed to furthering the cause of providing internationally recognised English language education to candidates in Sri Lanka.
National Partner of the Year was secured by the International College of Business & Technology Ltd (ICBT).

Buying votes, the easy way!
	

A certain State body taking a hand in providing shelter for the homeless has now embarked on a programme to distribute housing assistance to the peasants, who have fallen victim to the Chronic Kidney Disease.

The deserving people have already been asked to apply for the monetary assistance by perfecting a specific printed form, copies of which are to be obtained from the Divisional Secretariat of the area.
However, a Yahapalanaya heavyweight from the District is said to have taken over the bundle of application forms intended for the Kandiya Division and distributing them even among his constituents, who are not affected by the disease with an eye on their votes, they say.
By the way, this politico said to be nursing a grudge against the female white-collar high for the Kandiya Division had once kicked her office chair to give vent to his anger at her refusal to bend the rules to meet his unreasonable and unlawful demands,they say.

Capitalism, liberalism and  their discontents
	
Britain, the most powerful industrial nation was a pioneer in protectionism

Economics is not an easy discipline. As a friend recently pointed out, take out the references to real world examples and all you are left with are hard to remember, harder to apply equations. Sure, thats a given in any profession (its the job of the professional to appear smarter than his/her client, lets not forget), but its particularly infuriating in economics owing to the fact that this is, after all, a field that has real world implications. Foggy, obscure, sometimes obscurantist, as a discipline it has been subjected to myths and falsities which by being repeated and promoted over and over again have acquired the status of honest-to-god-truth. Probably thats why Ive learnt to put up with my distrustof economists.
On June 19, Advocata Institute, an independent policy think tank based in Colombo, dedicated to economic development through free markets, hosted a lecture titled Capitalism in Asia and What It Means for Sri Lanka delivered by the inimitable Razeen Sally. Professor Sally, as those who have attended his seminars (in particular, his Night Watchman lecture, What makes a classical liberal), is in favour of free markets and less red tape and has displayed a general aversion to the Left (which explains his belief that in Sri Lanka, public and economic policy has been permeated by socialism). The June 19 lecture was no different, and it was more of the same, but it compelled an interesting riposte from an outfit calling itself (tongue-in-cheek) the Avacado Collective, which challenged the Professors worldview in clear, concise, convincing terms. 
Advocata is dedicated to free markets. So is Professor Sally. Like all advocates of free markets in the subcontinent and the developing world in general, they espouse the gospel according to Smith, Ricardo, Say, and Malthus, the fathers of classical political economy, believing it to be the only way out for the problems of our societies. But free markets are not always free and free trade is not always fair. There are myths attached to these theories and philosophies which have come to define the trajectory of economic history in the West.

Myths paraded as truth
The Sri Lankan economic experience, post-1977, has mostly been that of promises made and broken by administrators, of powerful industries being sold to the free market in the name of efficiency and eventually being turned into worthless replicas of their former selves. (Does anyone remember, as the Avacado Collective does, the Werahera CTB Workshop and the Thulhiriya textile complex) But consider that it is not just in policy seminars that myths have been paraded as truths, and that they have formed what we assume to be the only economic reality, one which a good part of the world has rejected. We are still stuck in the golden era ofclassical liberalism. 
Of course, this is just one way of looking at the issue. There is another way. A recounting of history. The history of capitalism, free markets, political economy, and classical liberalism, as gleaned from the transition from the manor to the market. 
Why capitalism developed in Western Europe, no one has fully ascertained. It was born in the 16th century and was the child of the Reformation and the Enlightenment. It accelerated in the 18th century through the use of technologies that were invented by, as Professor Ha-Joon Chang points out in his perceptive work Economics: The Users Guide, practical men of good intuition. It accelerated more so when Europe began colonising the rest of the world, forcing the conquered countries to enter into trade agreements. India was virtually castrated here; as Will Durant once wrote, there would not have been an Industrial Revolution were it not for the resources plundered from the Crown Colony of the Empire: From Plassey to Waterloo, 57 years, the drain of Indias wealth to England is computed by Brooks Adams at two-and-a-half to fivebillion dollars. 
This dualistic economy, of mass exploitation on the one hand and minority privilege on the other, was supplemented by a State that was all powerful and had a vested interest in the continuation of unfettered industrialisation (given that the parliament was populated by industrialists). In fact there was very little that was free in the market: as Fernand Braudel, the eminent historian, has observed more than once, capitalism was the product of large corporations and monopolies vying for power against each other, and not of the eternally touted image, projected in textbooks today, of islands of small shopkeepers in a perfectly competitive market. Britain, the most powerful industrial nation was a pioneer in protectionism.


British Government intervention
Paradoxically, then, there wouldnt have been capitalism in Western Europe without the State, that harbinger of bureaucracy which horrifies free market advocates today. British Government intervention, which picked up after Robert Walpole became the first Prime Minister, provided tariff protection and subsidies to strategic industries, a method resorted to by the Miracle Economies of the 20th century. (When I come across tirades hurled at the land ownership scheme of the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government, I can only smile at the irony, given that while that regime limited land ownership to 10 hectares, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea, which were geographically larger than ours, limited it to as little as two orthree hectares)
Classical liberalism, with its emphasis on property rights and economic freedom, was born of all this. But liberalism, more specifically liberty, is a notoriously hard to define term, and in the early days, it had a different connotation. Again, I refer to Braudel; he traced its evolution from liberties, which was the liberty of powerful groups wielding hegemonic power over a multitude to liberty. Unfettered capitalism, through this, gave rise to unfettered individualism, which then gave rise to a dilemma: if everyone is free, how will society survive 


"Why capitalism developed in Western Europe, no one has fully ascertained. It was born in the 16th century and was the child of the Reformation and the Enlightenment"

Rene Descartes seemingly resolved the issue as follows: individuals are parts of a whole, and so, if the part is to survive, the whole must too. The interests of the part had to, in other words, coincide with the interests of the whole. From the 17th century then, Western society not surprisingly hardened its attitudes towards elements of society which could not maintain the unity between the one and the other: right until the Middle Ages, the peasantry had been sanctified (Christ, after all, was the son of a carpenter), but in the heydays of capitalism, they would be demonised. Hence the workhouses, capitalisms equivalent of Stalinist gulags, which crop up so harrowingly in Dickenss novels. The rise of classical liberalism over these decades could not have been a random affair.

Cochin airport closure: SriLankan offers other options to passengers
	
SriLankan airlines has introduced a series of measures to mitigate inconvenience to its valued passengers from the closure of the Cochin International Airport due to flooding.
Cochin Airport authorities yesterday announced they were extending the airports closure until August 26, a statement said.
Accordingly SriLankan is offering passengers booked to travel from Cochin to Colombo and onward destinations, the option of departing from Trivandrum or any other destination in South India served by SriLankan, at no extra charge. In addition, passengers booked to fly from Colombo to Cochin may fly to Trivandrum or any other destination in South India served by SriLankan, at no extra charge.
Sri Lankas national carrier acted immediately to temporarily increase its capacity between Trivandrum and Colombo to cater to the expected requirement. Passengers who were awaiting flights when the airport was closed down on August 15 were provided hotel accommodation and those who agreed were rerouted to Trivandrum.

## Title: Discipline these errant bus operators!

Discipline these errant bus operators!
	
Sri Lankans in general wish the law to have loopholes. In places where the law is effective theyll try to bribe government officials and in some instances even the law enforcement officers. When they cant have their way theyll stage protests. This is what some private bus operators (Drivers) are doing at present. At the time of writing several people have been slightly inconvenienced by the actions of these bus operators who have decided not to ply their vehicles. 
They are protesting, among other things, against the increase of spot fines; specified for indisciplined driving. These protesters are making it very clear that for them earning money supersedes obeying the law! In other words they are demanding an unlawful world to exist when they drive their vehicles. 
Commuters now have to hold back celebrating this decision taken by the Government because strike action in Sri Lanka produces results, especially when a government is not strict. The majority of the countrys citizens commute by bus and a strike can cripple their day-to-day activities. At present only six unions representing bus operators have joined the strike and many more such unions are expected to join in these strikes. Those who havent joined the strike have done it on humanitarian grounds because they dont wish to hinder candidates sitting for the ongoing A Level Examination. 
The revision of spot fines makes the minimum fine Rs 500 and the maximum fine Rs 3000. The Government has specified 33 traffic violations which are subject to fines. On the other hand these protesters have requested not to impose these fines till the necessary technical equipment is fixed on the roads. But a statement made by the spokesperson for these striking bus operators has made us ponder where this country is heading in terms of becoming a disciplined nation. This spokesperson was quoted in the newspapers as saying that the excessive fines would severely inconvenience their operations. 
Bus operators hogged the roads till the bus priority lanes were introduced. Bus operators offered resistance to this move, but later complied with these regulations. Now there is some order with regard to how buses pull over to the side of the road to pick-up passengers. There was a time when buses were stopped in the middle of the road for passengers to embark on to the vehicle. Its good if these bus priority lanes are brought into operation in other parts of the country. 
The Ministry of Transport has said that these fines were raised to make drivers more disciplined. If one stands on the New Kandy Road, where the Panadura-Kandy bus plies, a frightening sight of reckless driving by these bus operators can be witnessed. The Government passed a law where no overtaking can be done on the left, but these private bus operators keep doing the same.
The law makers of this nation must also consider banning the showing of music videos inside buses because blaring music isnt the taste of the majority of commuters who are returning home after a tiring day in office. There was a time when bus operators forced commuters to listen to the sad stories of people who have experienced rape, betrayal and domestic violence by switching on their radios. There is a sigh of relief that this programme is no more!
Private bus operators have the guts to appose moves to discipline them and have a platform to raise their grievances. But poor commuters have grin and bear during instances where they arent given tickets for the fare they pay and also when the entitled balance isnt returned before they disembark from the vehicle. 
The Government was lenient with those who initiated a recent trade inion strike and crippled the operating of trains. Its the wish of commuters that the Government pulls up its socks and deals sternly with these protesters and at the same time works on strengthening the bus service during this month of exams and school holidays.

## Title: Fatty Liver from an Ayurvedic perspective

Fatty Liver from an Ayurvedic perspective
	

The liver, the largest organ within the human, performs an array of tasks that are vital for the bodys functioning. These functions include regulating the amount of sugar, protein and fat entering the bloodstream, manufacturing proteins, detoxifying blood, metabolising drugs and secreting bile to
digest food. 
It is normal to have a little fat in your liver But when this fat exceeds the limit and become too much, the condition is called Fatty Liver. 
According to a research paper from the Harvard Medical College, fatty liver disease is becoming more common in Asia. Nature, international science journal says that researchers have found a strong connection between Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the bacteria that inhabit the intestines. They say the condition is starting to be seen in children probably due to their genetic susceptibility and high - fat diet. According to American Liver Foundation, patients with the most cases associated with fatty liver fall between the age group 40 - 60. 
We spoke to Dr. Ranjith Abeywardene, former Ayurvedic Advisor to the Tourism Ministry and Tourism Promotion Bureau, to find out why fat deposits in the liver.
Excess fat stored in the liver damages it. The majority of patients do not know whether they have fatty liver or not. This condition is usually detected during certain scans, done to check the possibility of other diseases or the ones done due to mere suspicion. 

Liver damage starts with a swelling in the liver and fluid builds up in the abdomen. Untreated Grade 1 condition eventually becomes Grade 2
But according to Ayurveda, a doctor does a physical exam focusing the abdomen. He presses the right corner of the abdomen and checks if there is an enlargement. An obese person will have the urge to vomit and difficulties in digestion. These are the symptoms of fatty liver. An experienced Ayurvedic practitioner will soon discover a person with fatty liver when the above symptoms are visible. He will also check the pulse. They will also check the nails and eyes, to see whether they show signs of yellowing (Jaundice) Dr. Abeywardene said. 
Middle aged people are the most vulnerable to develop fatty liver. In the long run, the functioning of the liver might start to fail. The fatty liver disease is quite common among people above 40 years of age. Usually around age 35, both men and women are prone to this condition. Children are susceptible to this disease at any age. Some medicines used in treating mental and skin disorders can increase the risk for a person to develop fatty liver.
Gallbladder and pancreas are vital in the digestion of food. If this process is impaired, it can lead to other complications with regard to the processing and absorption of food. These complications lead to cancers and as a result liver transplants are neeed. But this critical stage can be easily avoided by consuming healthy and local food and also by following a healthy routine. Dr. Abeywardene noted.


Two basic types of Fatty liver
The extra fat in the liver might distrupt its functioning and since the liver is purifying the blood by filtering toxins, you might become seriously ill due to disturbed filtering. 

Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (AFLD)
An enlarged liver, pain or discomfort in the upper right abdomen might be AFLD, which is preventable and gets better if alcohol consumption is stopped. Regular use of alcohol exposes your liver to risk since it can trigger alcoholic hepatitis.
This will result in fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea and jaundice. Scar tissue building up in the liver is called alcoholic cirrhosis. It can cause the same symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis and enlarged spleen, high blood pressure and liver failure. The worsening of liver damage can only be stopped if one quits drinking. If one has reached the maximum level of harm, a liver transplant is done. You are in danger of developing AFLD if you are obese or if you are a woman who consumes more than one drink a day he said.


Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)
This is a range of liver conditions affecting people who consume a little alcohol or none at all. Too much fat storage in the liver cells, in the long run, can turn into cirrhosis or liver failure. This condition is increasing throughout the world.
The simple fatty liver is the beginning of NAFLD and it does not cause inflammation in the liver, but has the potential to become Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis with inflammation. During this stage, the above symptoms can grow into Cirrhosis (scars in the liver that dont heal) which leads to liver failure and liver cancer. Meanwhile, some people have fatty liver Grade 1 during their entire life but are unaware of it. 

Grade 1 fatty liver
There is fat stored in the liver in small amounts. However this is not a life-threatening condition. But this is a clear warning to avoid eating oily food, sugars, salt, processed food (including sausages and meat), genetically modified food, broiler chicken (treated with hormones), all baked food (wheat flour) and sugar.
People are advised to do a lot of exercises daily and reduce weight. If not, grade 1 will become grade 2. Alcohol must be avoided if you observe signs of fatty liver. Continued alcohol consumption damages the liver the doctor said. 
Signs of Grade 1 fatty liver
Obesity, sudden weight gain 
	Digestive problems 
	Tiredness 
	Vomiting 
Grade 2 fatty liver
Liver damage starts with a swelling in the liver and fluid builds up in the abdomen. Untreated Grade 1 condition eventually becomes Grade 2. Liver cells begin being destroyed at this level. Limiting the calorie intake and engaging in regular exercises can lower the risk of fatty liver. 

An enlarged liver, pain or discomfort in the upper right abdomen might be AFDL, which is preventable and gets better if alcohol consumption is stopped

Treatment
Medical treatments, exercises and a controlled diet are mandatory to survive a sick liver. There are no specific medications to this disease. 
Chickpeas, green gram, green vegetables, Kola Kenda (Heen Bovitiya {octandra}, Monarakudumbiya {little ironweed}) and fish consumption can lower the risk of fatty liver. Changing the lifestyle would help in controlling or reversing fatty liver disease. Regular exercise and keeping the body weight under control helps a lot. Food should be prepared in a healthy manner with less oil, sans artificial sweeteners. 

Is Arishta harmful to the liver
Dr. Abeywardene commented on the myth that Ayurvedic syrup (Arishta) damages Liver. It is untrue. This fake news is purposely spread to drive fear into patients make them move away from Ayurveda treatments. Taking the prescribed dose will never harm the liver. I have never seen a patient falling sick by consuming this medicine according to the doctors prescription. Do they know how much harmful substances are there in western medicines How many of them have fallen sick due to the excessive use of western drugs and medicine 
It is a sarcastic question asked by some alcohol addicts when they are prescribed medicine. Once we found a person who had consumed an Ayurvedic syrup called Dasamularishtaya for 30 years; consuming the syrup daily. It had damaged his liver. It is true, but he had done it according to his own will. These are stories spread by rivals to sling mud at Ayurveda. Sadly, the authorities responsible for the administration of Ayurveda dont stand up against whats been said. 
During modern times we have seen liver diseases becoming common. In the past, people consumed Ayurvedic medicine more often and were healthier Dr. Abeywardene concluded.

Gearing to meet challenges of the century
	
Vajirarama Dhamma School in 1920s

seed that was planted with good intentions as far back as 1895 has grown into an impressive tree today. It is one of the biggest assets this country possesses and needs grooming. No other Buddhist country could claim what Sri Lanka offers in this regard. 
The system of temple based formal Dhamma education for school-going children started with Vijayananda Dhamma School, established at Weliwatta, Galle on August 03, 1895. It was a felt need at the time because Buddhist children were left in the lurch even in general education by both the colonial Government and the Christian missionaries. Since then we saw a steady growth in the number of temple based Dhamma schools during the 20th century. According to the Performance Report (2016) of the Department of Buddhist Affairs there are 10,712 Dhamma Schools registered with the Department, with 2,195,956 students and 124,817 volunteer teachers, a ratio of one teacher for eighteen students. I find that the student teacher ratio is the same as in Government Schools. 
The table below gives details of the student population according to grade with aggregation at Kindergarten (Grades 1 and 2) Primary (Grades 3-5), Junior Secondary (Grades 6-9) and Senior Secondary (Grades 10 and 11) levels according to published data provided by the Statistics Division of the Ministry of Education and the Performance Report of the Department of Buddhist Affairs for the year 2016. The strength of Dhamma School education is very evident from this data. 
As is evident from the Table above, it is very heartening that 84% of Buddhist children in the Kindergarten, Primary, Junior Secondary and Senior Secondary levels (i.e. grades 1-11) are enrolled in Dhamma schools. A micro-study in a few Dhamma schools indicated, however, that there is a disparity between the number enrolled and the number attending, which is far less. Moreover, when we take absolute figures the number of children in grades 1-11 not even enrolled in Dhamma Schools is nearly 400,000. The number not enrolled has been analysed further in the Table above for any remedial action. Accordingly, the highest percent not even enrolled were from Senior Secondary grade (30%) followed by Junior Secondary (28%). The highest enrolment was in the primary level, viz., grades 3, 4 and 5. 
Religious education, unlike when the writer was attending school, is compulsory in all government schools. Besides, some major religions have their own religious schools. However, when one appraises what is happening today in the society outside one gets the feeling that something, somewhere is wrong. Many may be more knowledgeable of their religion but could we state with all sincerity that we have achieved the objectives of religious education. 
The Most Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Mahanayaka Thera in his writings had emphasised that more than imparting knowledge, what was required in a Dhamma School was character building of the children. Towards this the Ven. Mahanayaka Thera formulated five principles, which are reproduced below:

1.Observe the five precepts always and endeavour to observe the Eight Precepts on full-moon Poya days; 
2.Encourage to respect the Sangha, parents, teachers, and elders; 
3.Train to sustain a simple lifestyle and to promote good neighbourliness; 
4.Develop restraint, good behaviour, and a sound knowledge of the Dhamma; 
5.Produce a generation of students who are kindled by devotion to the Buddha-Dhamma, inspired by what is indigenous, motivated by national pride, and enlivened by a love for ones language. 

Staff of Vajirarama Dhamma School

The bane of this pleasant land of ours is not the dearth of good people, nor the dearth of good ideas and proposals. These are in plenty. It has been a good practice to appoint special committees and Presidential Commissions to study specific issues or problems and make recommendations. However, when recommendations are made after spending much time, energy and resources they are usually pigeonholed for all times. No one cares even to read them, far from implementation. With changes in government, or even ministerial portfolios and officers, these reports are buried forever. 

Presidential Commission
In 2001, a Presidential Commission was appointed of members of the Sangha and lay persons to make recommendations for the uplift of the Buddha Sasana. I too was a lay member of that Commission. Item (i) of the terms of reference was to make appropriate recommendations for a positive change of direction after comprehending the current situation relating to Buddhist bhikkhus and lay society, which is often stated to be in the decline. A comprehensive study was made and its recommendations are at Chapter 8 of the Commission report. Among the many recommendations made were those pertaining to Dhamma education in ordinary schools and Temple based Dhamma schools. A translation of three relevant paragraphs is given below. 
8.14 We recommend that there should be very close relationship between the teaching of Buddha Dhamma in daily schools and Dhamma schools. The Commission is of the view that a suitable solution could be found if this issue is addressed not from the point of view of institutions but from that of students. We recommend very broadly that a common syllabus should be developed giving priority to imparting Dhamma knowledge in the daily schools and on developing Buddhist practices and wholesome life-skills for leading a moral life in the Dhamma schools (Emphasis mine). If this recommendation is implemented the Buddhist children in daily schools will attend Dhamma schools without fail.

Vajirarama Dhamma School.


"Religious education, unlike when the writer was attending school, is compulsory in all government schools. Besides, some major religions have their own religious schools"
 
Moreover, it will be possible for daily schools to continue having two periods for religious education without increasing the number of periods as is recommended in paragraph 8.12 above. Another positive outcome would be to improve the subject knowledge received from text books used in daily schools. When preparing the text books for respective grades it will be possible to do it in an integrated manner. Children will also get an opportunity to enhance their Dhamma knowledge and be of service to others by activities like receiving basic knowledge of the Pali language, by reading additional books relevant to Buddha Dhamma and practicing meditation. 
8.15 As a corollary to the recommendation made above, we recommend that there should be a revision of the scheme of examinations for Dhamma schools. Holding of examinations for all grades above grade six annually by the Colombo YMBA and issuance of certificates has resulted in students developing a sort of examination phobia. Compulsory schooling ends at the age of 14. Taking this factor also into consideration we recommend that it will suffice if the Colombo YMBA holds only the examination for the 9th grade of Dhamma schools. Like at present the Dhamma School Final Examination and the Dharmacarya examination should continue to be held by the Commissioner General of Examinations. 
8.16 As a motivation for students to attend Dhamma schools, it is recommended that Principals of Dhamma schools should allocate about one hour, divided into periods, to impart Dhamma education in the English language. This should be done after grading the students according to their proficiency of English. If there is a difficulty in obtaining services of a competent English teacher on a voluntary basis, a fund may be created with contributions by parents to pay such a teacher. 
Sixteen years have lapsed since the recommendations of the Buddha Sasana Presidential Commission. With regard to grade examinations of Dhamma Schools the Department of Buddhist Affairs and the Sasanarakshaka Mandalaya have replaced the Colombo YMBA in conducting the examinations. According to the Performance Report (2016) of the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs, Rs. 17.5 million has been spent on holding examinations that year. For printing of Dhamma School text books the expenditure has been Rs. 150 million. These are only direct costs. A similar amount or more would be the expenditure by the Ministry of Education. Dhamma education has become a mere subject that is assessed by a system of examinations at great expense both in time and money. 

Change
The time for change has come and the responsibility to bring about that change is not that of ministries or departments, but the members of the Maha Sangha who invariably are Principals or Advisors of Dhamma Schools. The Ministry and the Department should be facilitators of that process. One area they could concentrate on and find resources is to establish in every district in collaboration with all other stakeholders a residential training facility for volunteer teachers of Dhamma schools. A ten-day training module should be developed to enhance training skills according to age of students, for building up awareness of the role of Dhamma School teachers in society and for providing a good grounding on Buddhist practices and wholesome life-skills for leading a moral life, a challenge faced by modern day school-going children. 
The management of the Siri Vajirararamaya Dhamma School, celebrating its centenary year under the stewardship of the Most Venerable Titikunamale Ananda .Mahanayaka Thera has pioneered measures to orient the Dhamma School in the required direction. The structure of the Dhamma School was examined and a new constitution was adopted with a clear vision and a mission based on the five principles enunciated by the Most Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Mahanayaka Thera referred to earlier. Programmes are being conducted for teachers, parents, and students separately to build awareness of their respective roles. 26 teachers were provided a three day befriending programme to build competency in understanding the problems faced by children. Teachers in the primary and the junior secondary and senior secondary sections were provided training separately on the psychiatric needs of a growing child and the use and abuse of modern technology. A counselling / befriending unit was set up since with free access to students and parents. 

We believe that Dhamma education should be built on a firm foundation and this should be the focus of early education. Accordingly, the first two grades of the primary section are taken as a separate unit. A syllabus was developed after identifying the skills a Buddhist child in the 5-7 age group should be having through guided practice e.g. correct way of salutation to the Buddha, parents, elders etc., correct way of addressing elders, importance of sharing with others and good neighbourliness, undertaking small tasks with responsibility, use of Buddhist terms, good health practices, ability to identify good and bad actions. There are no tests, written or otherwise, but the development of the child to meet basic standards of competence with individual attention will be the responsibility of the teacher in charge. Teachers are expected to build correct rapport with the children in their respective classes and monitor progress after identifying each childs strengths. 
Another important event was the introduction of the Sati Pasala, which has been translated into English by its initiators as Mindful School, into the morning Buddha vandana session of the Dhamma School. Several training sessions were held at the Siri Vajirarama temple of which one was conducted by Most Venerable Uda Eriyagama Dhammajiva Maha Thero himself, the initiator of the Sati Pasala programme. In the Foreword to the book Mindful School introducing this concept, the Maha Thera has made the following remark. We wish to introduce Mindfulness as a wholesome life skill that will benefit students in the classroom, when interacting with teachers and other school authorities and with their families, neighbours and friends. We should not confuse mindfulness in this training exercise with developing mindfulness as a factor of enlightenment. But as the Most Venerable Thera has pointed out it is a wholesome life skill that could be further developed and will always stand in good stead. 
Life as a child is undoubtedly the best part of a persons life. Dhamma education is to relieve stress. If on the other hand it makes a childs life more stressful with examinations and competitions, I feel that we have lost our mark. We should aim at making the life of a child richer through Dhamma education. It should be a via media between formal and nonformal education, with a bias towards nonformality.

Govt. gazettes new revenue proposals
	
The government has gazetted a series of amendments to the Finance Act to give effect to several revenue proposals in the budget 2018, including taxes on cellular towers, luxury motor vehicles, vehicle entitlement and carbon emissions.
Further taxes have been slapped on annual renewal of company registrations while all financial institutions have been called to pay a Debt Repayment Levy in a bid to reduce the countrys debt burden.
According to the gazette notification issued last Friday, the mobile phone services companies will have to pay Rs.200,000 per year for every tower they own on a quarterly basis in four equal instalments from January 1, 2019.
The telco operators had lobbied against this proposal at the time it was proposed saying that it could possibly result in major foreign investors in the local telco sector exiting the market.
Nearly 6,750 towers are used by the five mobile operators to support the needs of a population of 20 million.In April this year, Hutch and Etisalat announced a merger, which will result in the number of operators in the market coming down to four.
Meanwhile, any assembled or unassembled diesel motor vehicle of which cylinder capacity exceeds 2,300cc or a petrol motor vehicle of which the cylinder capacity exceeds 1,800cc or an electric vehicle of which motor power of the engine exceeds 200 kW will be liable for Luxury Tax, which should be paid at the time of importation to the Director General of Customs.
This one-time tax will not be applicable to vehicles imported by diplomatic missions and dual-purpose petrol vehicles with the cylinder capacity not exceeding 2,200cc.
A tax called Vehicle Entitlement Levy has also been slapped on every importer of motor vehicles while a Carbon Tax, as proposed in the Budget 2018, will be levied on motor vehicles based on their age and fuel type.
Electric vehicles are exempt from the tax. The vehicle owner should pay the tax for every year other than for the first year of registration of the motor vehicle to the Divisional Secretary, on or before the due date of renewal of annual registration.
Meanwhile, amendments to the Finance Act also propose to impose an Annual Company Registration Levy for every company incorporated or registered under the Companies Act.
A public listed company will be charged a fee of Rs.1.5 million on annual company registration while a private company will have to pay Rs.30,000. However, this tax will not be applicable to off-shore and limited by guarantee companies.
The amendments to Finance Act further propose to slap a 7 per cent Debt Repayment Levy on financial institutions that will be charged for every month commencing from the date of commencement of the act, on the value addition attributable to the supply of financial services by these institutions.
A levy of 25 cents has also been proposed on each mobile short message (SMS) on bulk advertisement through SMS.
The amendments to the Finance Act are to be presented to Parliament for first reading shortly.

Gunmen attack intelligence service centre in Afghan capital
	

KABUL REUTERS Aug 16- Gunmen attacked an area around a security base and training centre for Afghanistans intelligence service in the capital Kabul on Thursday, holding off security forces for hours before being killed. 
The incident comes at a time of high tension after a series of attacks across Afghanistan, including a full-scale assault on the city of Ghazni by the Taliban last week that killed as many as 150 civilians and destroyed houses and a local market. 
There was no immediate word on any casualties or claim of responsibility for Thursdays attack, the latest in a long series to target military and intelligence facilities in Kabul. 
Staff and officials at the training centre took shelter in a protected area of the compound as gunfire came from a half-finished building near the site. 
Afghan Special Forces, backed by advisers from the NATO-led Resolute Support mission, surrounded the site and kept the attackers in a standoff for hours, with the occasional sound of gunfire or explosions.  After some seven hours, officials said the two attackers were killed. 
Separately on Thursday, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Kabul that tore through an educational centre on Wednesday where teenagers had been studying for a university entrance examination. 
In Ghazni, heavily damaged by five days of heavy fighting this week, there were still problems with water and power but otherwise the situationwas calm.

History of Antibiotics How a mistake saved lives
	
Even though the word antibiotics wasnt invented until less than a century ago, the use of substances with antibiotic properties has a much longer history. For an example, its said that in preparing for battle, the army of King Dutugamunu, famous Sri Lankan King who ruled during Anuradhapura era, used to prepare Kevum (Oil cakes) months in advance and keep them exposed to air so the mould can grow on them. Later, they were used to prepare a poultice to apply on battle wounds to prevent them from festering. 
The exact timing of the discovery of antibiotics is a bit controversial, because various scientists during various time periods discovered substances that could kill bacteria. But the discovery of penicillin; the very first synthetic antibiotic substance which is widely used even today, has an interesting story behind it. 

From mistake to cure
Sir Alexander Fleming was an army physician and a renowned researcher who had made significant contributions to the medical community in the early 1900s. He was conducting yet another research on his lab on a bacterial type called Staphylococci.
Even though he was a distinguished scientist, he wasnt known for his tidiness. One day, in 1928, he stacked all his petridishes which contained the cultures of bacteria on a bench at a corner of the lab, before going on holiday with his family. Upon returning, he wasnt surprised to see one culture was contaminated by a common fungus (mould), effectively ruining its value for the experiment.
But he was intrigued to see that the bacteria colonies surrounding the area of invasion by the fungus have been destroyed. He isolated the mould and grew it separately, experimenting and discovering that the fungus, named Penicillium notatum, effectively killed many bacteria, even at lower doses. 
This discovery effectively changed the history of medicine, because it triggered not only the isolation and mass production of penicillin, but also inspired and provided guidance in the discovery of numerous other antibiotics which save the lives of millions of humans as well as animals each day.It is difficult to imagine that all this happened thanks to an accident, isnt it 
Imagine how different the world might be today, if Fleming threw that culture away, as another failed experiment! Some of us even may not be alive, because without antibiotics, a disease like pneumonia or a wound infection may have killed our parents or grandparents at a young age. Therefore, take Sir Fleming as an example.
Every time you are ready to cast aside an experience, a thought, a person, as a failure, look again with a different view, because that may have the power to open up a wonderful new pathway for your life. 
About Antibiotic Resistance
But why do we need different antibiotics to treat different diseases Just as we as humans are different from other animals in various ways, so are disease causing micro organisms. They prefer different parts of the body and have their own individual weaknesses. Therefore different antibiotics use different strategies to attack microbes. 
Even this sounds like great news, doesnt it If we can use different antibiotics for different pathogens, and if we use them regularly, we can sweep them off the face of earth, right 
Wrong. Two factors stand against us. One, Mother Nature doesnt take a side. Just as she gave us antibiotics which will help our species survive longer, she gave antibiotics the ability to evolve, causing antibiotic resistance. In every sample of bacteria which respond to a certain antibiotic, there are a few different ones which have mechanisms that can withstand the effect of antibiotics. When exposed to antibiotics unnecessarily and for prolonged periods, these resistant bacteria survive and reproduce. They are then spread to other carriers causing disease, especially in environments like hospitals.

Since these new super species now do not respond to the previous group of antibiotics, we have to treat these patients with stronger antibiotics which can go past the defenses of the new species. Methicillin-res istant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) and Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR TB) are some such super-species. 
This brings us to our second problem with antibiotics. Even though the resistance to the limited classes of antibiotics is rapidly increasing, the discovery of new antibiotics happens at a very slow rate. Its said that there are only six new classes of antibiotics which were discovered after 1960s and all of them act only against a limited group of microbes. 
Even though we are focusing mainly on anti-bacterial agents in this article, these facts are true for anti-fungal and anti-viral agents as well. 
The end of Golden era nears
You and I were fortunate enough to be born in what is referred to as the Golden Era of Antibiotics. This meant that we could fight through infections that killed or crippled our ancestors, like Tuberculosis, Leprosy, which accounted for 30% of deaths in the Pre- antibiotic era. But this era is rapidly declining due to antibiotic resistance and if we are not careful the next generation will have to go through the challenge of more fierce and advanced infections without the defense of antibiotics. 
The only viable solution is the rational use of antibiotics. This has to be done starting from industrial level, going down to the individual level. 
As conscientious human beings, its our duty to use antibiotics only when indicated, in the duration of time its indicated and to choose the most appropriate antibiotic to the condition. By avoiding taking unnecessary antibiotics, we will be contributing to saving hundreds of lives tomorrow.

India monsoon floods 'kill 106' in Kerala
	
More than 100 people are thought to have died in devastating monsoon floods in India's southern state of Kerala, the worst in almost a century.
Rescuers battled torrential rains to save residents, with nearly 150,000 reportedly left homeless.
The state government said many of those who died were crushed under debris caused by landslides.
With more rains predicted and a red alert in place, the main airport has reportedly been shut until 26 August.
A state official told AFP that 106 people had now died, while the Economic Times in India reports 114 have been killed.
Hundreds of troops have been deployed to rescue those caught up in the flooding, alongside helicopters and lifeboats.
The government has urged people not to ignore evacuation orders. It is distributing food to tens of thousands who have fled to higher ground.
"We're witnessing something that has never happened before in the history of Kerala," Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters.
"Almost all dams are now opened. Most of our water treatment plants are submerged. Motors are damaged."
He added that the failure of the state government of neighbouring Tamil Nadu to release water from a dam had made the situation worse.
Kerala has 41 rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea.
Parts of Kerala's commercial capital, Kochi, are also underwater, snaring up roads and railways across the state - a popular tourist destination.
India's Prime Minister and Home Minister have both offered federal support.
Schools in all 14 districts of Kerala have been closed down and some districts have banned tourists citing safety concerns. (BBC)

India warns of extremely grave crisis as flood toll rises
	

KOCHI AFP Aug16, 2018 - Hundreds of troops led a desperate operation to rescue families trapped by mounting floods in Indias Kerala state Thursday as the death toll reached 86 with dozens more feared perished.

Helicopters airlifted stranded victims from rooftops and dam gates were thrown open as incessant torrential rain brought fresh havoc to the southern state that is a major international tourist draw. 
The regions main airport has been ordered closed until August 26. 
State authorities said 21 more deaths had been confirmed Thursday taking the official toll to 86. Media reports said up to 30 more people were feared dead in landslides and rivers that burst their banks, flooding scores of villages. 
At least eight people were killed when an irrigation dam burst and a landslide hit three houses in the town of Nenmara, Palakkad district, authorities said. 
Vijayan said 80 dams have reached danger levels and appealed to the population not to ignore evacuation orders. .

Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa today claimed that the government was using journalist Keith Noyahrs abduction and assault to achieve its political ends and described it as yet another case of political revenge.
He told the media who had gathered outside his residence that five CID detectives had questioned him for about three hours in connection with this incident.
The CID must have been instigated by government leaders to record my statement. They asked me whether Karu Jayasuriya had telephoned me and whether Keith Noyahr was released after Mr. Jayasuriya had telephoned me. I cannot remember whether he telephoned me or not. So many people telephone me, Mr. Rajapaksa said.
He said he asked the CID officers whether it was wrong to release Mr. Noyahr and added that they were used to this kind of political vengeance.
The government is doing various things to achieve its political ends. This is one such incident. This shows the governments vindictive actions. They must be thinking that this sort of things will not happen to them, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Lovers of justice and fair play
	Gifted with eloquence, intelligence and skills in science and literature
	Discerning, discriminating and analytical
	Tend to fall in love at a very young age
Those born in the Solar month of Virgo running from September 17 to October 16 are called Virgo people. Virgo is the sixth sign in the Zodiac and it is ruled by Mercury, the planet of intellect.
Persons born during this Solar month are lovers of justice and fair play and are gifted with qualities such as eloquence, intelligence and skills in the fields of science and literature governed by Mercury.
Virgo people are also discerning, discriminating and analytical. They are rational and clear in their thinking.
Virgo persons are normally cool-headed, but once provoked, they would not easily cool down. They are shy and retreating by nature. They prefer to work alone away from hustle and bustle.
Virgo people acquit themselves well in tasks requiring analytical skills and critical faculty. They are also adept at jobs related to higher sciences.
Virgo being an earthy sign, they develop a liking for agriculture and horticulture. They make good executives and directors of companies.
Virgo people would normally suffer from health problems during childhood. Virgo persons do not normally have a smooth love life. In countries where separation and divorce are commonplace, chances of a Virgo person going in for a second marriage are not remote. These people tend to fall in love at a very young age. But their attachment is not enduring.
   Virgo people travel a great deal and achieve their goals in life by hard work applied with intelligence. One of their children would fall victim to an accident.
In old age, Virgo people may suffer from ailments connected to their bowels, sympathetic nervous system, abdomen, liver, the gall bladder and gall ducts.
Virgo persons are advised to marry persons of the same sign or those of Taurusor Capricorn.

The first phase of the Southern Railway Expansion Project -- the stretch from Matara to Beliatta, will be completed by the beginning of next year, a Chinese construction company consultant said yesterday.
H. Piyadasa, who is a Senior Engineering Consultant for the China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) on this project, said they had completed 90 per cent of the work.
He said railway lines were being laid and the construction of railway stations was being carried out simultaneously.
This is the most modern railway line in Sri Lanka where a train will be operated at a speed limit of 120 kmph. Operations will begin in four-five months, Mr. Piyadasa told a group of journalists visiting the construction site of the Kekunadura Railway Station.
The main railway stations are being constructed at Kekunadura, Bambarenda, Wewrukannala and Beliatta while there will also be two other substations along the new railway line.
Meanwhile, the construction company said the longest bridge in Sri Lanka Railway which is 1.5 km in length was being constructed at Wattegama while the longest tunnel -- 615 metres in length -- has been built at Nakutiya.
The Matara-Beliatta stretch of the Southern Railway Expansion project is 26.75 km long and is being constructed by the CMC on a concessionary loan of US$278 million obtained from the Exim Bank of China.
The second phase of the Railway Expansion project from Beliatta to Hambantota and the third phase from Hambantota to Kataragama will begin during the next few years. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

A close female relative of a high political authority is in the thick of a racket of blocking out coconut lands for sale under the hammer.

This fair one actively engaged in this lucrative business in a fast-developing district in the Coconut Triangle brazenly violates the law that requires obtaining due permission for fragmenting a coconut land exceeding 10 acres in extent, they say.
A former employee of a vehicles sales centre, this businesswoman who did not own even a three-wheeler is said to be having now two expensive jeeps to cruise around.
The high political authority, who often exhorts his constituents to protect their coconut crops from rampaging monkeys, has turned a blind eye to the greater damage caused by his close relative by fragmenting extensive coconut lands into small plots for sale, mostly for commercial purposes, they say.

	Countrys military needed to face not only internal threat but also external threat
	
	PM should be next candidate
	
	There are corrupt Police officers harassing my people
	
	No point in complaining to Law and Order Minister

Just because these people are doing political work for us, the Police are throwing them behind bars. They are innocent, having families with children. The Police get hold of them, plant some drugs or cartridges and arrest them. If it is more than two grams of drugs, they will end up in jail for life. That is very sad

When I undertake visits to the national parks as the Subject Minister, a lot of my constituents seek to come with me to see wild animals. Then, a few youths get into a vehicle and follow us. A group came with me to Wilpattu recently in this manner. There was an accusation made by one media channel. I was accused of keeping underworld figures as my bodyguards. That is nonsense. After that, the Police started going after these people. I know for sure these people are not involved in any criminal act now.

If they wanted to do what the Police do now, they could have introduced some drugs and sentenced my people to life. It never happened. Today, we are unable to control these corrupt Police officers.

Excerpts:

QHow do you view the current political situation
The political situation continues without any major event. The Government will continue to operate.
The Opposition is also weak although they try to make a hue and cry, criticizing the Government.
They have their own skeletons in the cupboard. They cannot forget what they have been doing in the past. The Government can continue. There is no problem in the United National Party (UNP). Yet, the Government will have to deliver during the next one-and-half years. People are not happy about what has been going on for the last three years. People indicated their displeasure at the last Local Government Elections.


QIn what areas did the Government fail in your view
The Government was unable to look after the interests of their supporters, who were ill-treated during the previous regime. They were expecting job opportunities, grassroots level development work etc.
There are people who put their maximum effort to unseat the previous regime. If these people cannot get their problems solved, they will not be happy.


QThe Government is to launch Gam Peraliya Programme to revive the rural economy. Are you happy about it
Gam Peraliya is ok. We are trying to fathom what kind of development work we can do. There are some suggestions from the Treasury and the Finance Ministry. Some of these things are not applicable to our areas.

QLike what
If you take the Western Province, projects such as electrification and tank renovation are not applicable. Here, the requirements are different. In Gampaha, we do not want electricity. We want water. We cannot renovate even playgrounds in our area with just Rs.1 million allocated. We can only mow grass with that amount of money at a playground here. Any repair will cost at least Rs. 10 million.


QYou broke ranks with the previous ruler citing several reasons. Today, you sound unhappy with the present system as well. 
Not that I am unhappy. Everybody in the Government is unhappy. Everybody has understood the shortcomings I just mentioned. Our complaint against the last Government was that they were corrupt. There were a family rule, dictatorship, and nepotism. There was no freedom for the Judiciary, the Police, and the Elections Commission. We have to put these things on right track. Actually, there are problems at the grassroots level.


QI am asking about your concerns then and now. How do you compare and contrast
What I just mentioned are the complaints against the previous regime.


QThe present Government is also facing corruption charges. Isnt it
The bond issue is the only thing against the present Government. We cannot go on talking about it the whole time. It is one case. Action has been taken against it. Just because of one case, we cannot say the whole Government is corrupt. There was unlimited corruption at that time under the last Government.


QRecently, you told the media that the Rajapaksas did not arrest your supporters on false charges of keeping drugs, but on the contrary, it happened today. What is the message you tried to convey
We have given freedom to the Police. There is the Police Commission. There is no political interference. But, we have lost control over the Police.
As a government, we have to ensure that the Police, Judiciary or any organization operate in the right direction if we give them freedom.
If some corrupt DIGs are doing all sort of irregular, unruly things, it will have a lot of adverse effects. There is a bunch of Policemen. They are trying to do politics. They are harassing our supporters. They are on a political agenda. The Government should be able to stop this nonsense. If the Government cannot stop these things, I will say, at least, the Rajapaksas had control over the Police, though they did some wrong things. For the right thing or the wrong thing, they had control over it. We have lost control over it. That is what I am complaining about.


QDoes it mean that the Rajapaksas were better than the present ones
They had control. Whatever it is, we were the opponents of the Rajapaksas. They arrested a lot of my people. Some people were kept behind bars for four months, others for 400 days. But, if they wanted to do what the Police do now, they could have introduced some drugs and sentenced my people to life. It never happened. Today, we are unable to control these corrupt Police officers. Just because these people are doing political work for us, the Police are throwing them behind bars. They are innocent, having families with children. The Police get hold of them, plant some drugs or cartridges and arrest them. If it is more than two grams of drugs, they will end up in jail for life. That is very sad. If the Government cannot stop it, then there is a problem with the Government.


QIn your view, who is instigating these things in the Government
I have not suspected anyone in the Government so far. There are political forces in my area that is Kelaniya. I am suspecting an SLFPer there. He has got hold of some corrupt Police officers ranging from the DIGs to Inspectors. Already, there is a DIG, who was sentenced to death. Two other DIGs are in remand jail. I am not blaming the whole of the Police Department. There is 10-15per cent of corrupt people there. They will do anything for money, alcohol and food.


QThe present Inspector General of Police (IGP) is accused of doing politics by the Opposition. What is your view of him
I do not know whether he is politically biased. I know there have been some complaints against him. If these sorts of things happen in the Police, the IGP has to take the blame. He is not controlling it properly.


QIs it because he is inefficient or politically biased
I know him as a middle-rung Police Officer at that time-in 1990s; he had worked as an SSP. He was a very good Police Officer at that time. Yet, in his present status, there are people critical of him obviously. Some people must be having valid reasons to be critical. If the Policemen behave like this, I have to blame the IGP and others down the rank. He is a good man. I have nothing against him.
qAt that time, you were surrounded by the Army Commandos as your guards. Now, some politicians accuse you of hiring underworld criminals to guard you. What do you feel in this regard
No civilian is guarding me. I have the Police guard for me. There are 17 Policemen. Five of them are from the Special Task Force (STF). They give me security wherever I go. In the Kelaniya area, there are some elderly and young people. They had faced charges in the past. Some had been exonerated even. None of these charges are related to drug dealing or anything. Some people had been involved in cases like fisticuffs and shootouts. That is the past. Once I went to Kelaniya, people of all sorts are supporting me.
There are criminally charged persons, who contested the elections from the UNP and got the highest number of preferential votes once. There is one in Ratnapura. After that, he was sent to the gallows. There are MPs against whom there are numerous charges. Everybody has the right to do politics. We cannot chase them out.
Interestingly, when I undertake visits to the national parks as the Subject Minister, a lot of my constituents seek to come with me to see wild animals. Then, a few youths get into a vehicle and follow us. A group came with me to Wilpattu recently in this manner. There was an accusation made by one media channel. I was accused of keeping underworld figures as my bodyguards. That is nonsense. After that, the Police started going after these people. I know for sure these people are not involved in any criminal act now.


QDidnt you raise this matter at the Cabinet or with Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara
I spoke to the Minister on a number of times. One day, he got down STF DIG M.R. Latheef and told him about this. The very same day, Latheef went and arrested a person. Another one was arrested after four or five days later. Complaining to the Minister did not do any good for me. I had made complaints to the Minister four times. Today I met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and complained to him. I requested the Prime Minister to assign the CID to do investigations. The Prime Minister asked me to give it in writing. I will give a letter to him. The Prime Minister promised me to direct the CID. I have faith in the CID.

QIn your view, who should be the next presidential candidate
It must be Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is our party leader. I was fielded in 2010 as the candidate. That was soon after the war. The UNP was down at that time. Nobody had the courage to contest at that time. If I did not come forward, Mahinda Rajapaksa would have won uncontested virtually. Last time, I had a discussion with Mr. Wickremesinghe. Every time, I met him, I asked him to contest. He did not contest. He wanted the common candidate for his own reasons. I had 375,000 votes for my party at that time. I had 17 Provincial Councilors.

QWhat are the chances of winning
If the party works hard, it is possible. I have told the Prime Minister. In certain areas, he has to change his attitudes.


QLike what
He must get involved with grassroots level politics. He should look into the interests of electoral organizers. If he does that, he can ensure that he will win.


QThe UNP is relatively weak in the Sinhala majority areas. What do you propose to correct it
The UNP must start improving certain areas. We must have the Buddhist monks organization and get it more and more involved in the party matters. Some of our organizers are not active in villages.


QPresident Maithripala Sirisena is also interested in contesting next time. What do you think of him
If he is interested, he will be contesting representing his party. We cannot support that party anyway. We have to support the UNP candidate.


QIn the north, there are talks about the possible resurgence of the LTTE. As the Army Commander who led the military to win against the LTTE, what is your assessment

We eliminated the LTTE. We created the background for peace and reconciliation and to develop those areas. Some development has taken place. It is not enough. There are some Tamil politicians trying to play it to the gallery. They still try to talk about separatism. That cannot be allowed. Sinhala people in the south will not agree to that. As for power devolution, we will have to go for a referendum if it is to be done. The majority of the people are against it. Tamil people are interested in economic development not in politics. We have to know what the people are asking for. We should meet the requirements of people, not of the politicians. Some Tamil politicians talk about removing the military from the north. We cannot give into such pressure without any basis. You cannot remove the military from the country.


QIs there any need to downsize the military
The military needs presence everywhere in the country. You cannot say the military must be in the south not in the north. Downsizing is not required in my opinion. In my personal view, the minimum strength of the Army should be maintained above 150,000. It is not only an internal problem. The countrys military must be ready to face any threat including the external threat.
Singapore is a very small country. They have a military force of three million personnel though. Every citizen is trained to fight. They are not mobilized, though. The total removal of the military from some areas in the north should not be done.
I have heard the Army Commander boasting about the reduction of land occupied by the military, handing over land back to people and closing down so many camps. That is stupid. You cannot be so proud that you close down every camp and hand over every inch of land back to people. We must study, listen to people on the ground and do a proper assessment.


QDoes it mean that you are not in agreement with the latest release of militaryoccupied lands
You must not do it due to political pressure. You must do it methodically. Now the Army Commander is trying to please the politicians by pulling out the military. I hear from some of the ground Commanders that some are not happy about the way he is closing down camps. That is a problem.

QThe Army Commander must be doing it at the orders of the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces who is the President. Isnt it
It is not the duty of the Army Commander to please the bosses all the time. The Army Commander is responsible for the security of the country.


QCan he ignore or disregard the President as the Defence Minister
Politicians are not educated on military deployment. They do not understand it. Long ago, in 2002, I was the Jaffna Commander. I was asked by the Government to close down some areas of the High Security Zones. I was a Major General at that time. I refused it considering the security situation.


QToday, you are with those who governed at that time..
That is a different thing. Now, they have accepted my way of doing things.

Recording war history : a challenging task Or just an opening of a can of worms
	
It is not clear as to what exactly prompted President Maithripala Sirisena at this juncture to think about compiling the history of the three-decade war between the Armed forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
According to the political column of our sister paper, The Sunday Times, he had convened a meeting of retired and serving military leaders on August 6 apparently to plan and execute the recording of the history of the war.
The President, according to the newspaper report, has attributed the twisted versions of war history by many people including retired military officials, to his move to record the true history of the victory of the armed forces over the LTTE, the outfit that had been described by many analysts as the worlds most ruthless terrorist organization.
It would be an interesting and politically, militarily and historically important document if one can compile the history of the war impartially and giving it the due political and historical weight, as the conflict did not break out in a vacuum.
Some have written books on the war, but they have been accused of being influenced by party politics, ethnic prejudice and personal agendas. Besides, the concerns raised by the Sunday Times over the lopsided composition of attendees of the very meeting the move raises many other questions.
One might question the timing of the Presidents move as the meeting had been convened at a time critically important for the Government, and especially for the President.
Following the humiliating defeat at the February 10 Local Government elections, the Government is obsessed with the forthcoming national elections. Hence, one can infer that this move is also a part of the preparation for the election.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has been exploiting the military victory over the LTTE at every election after 2009  the year in which the war came to an end, as if it was he, who had taken all the strategic decisions during every battle while being in the battlefront.
His claim for the war victory has been so successful that even the war-winning Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka was humiliated at elections by the people, who once, during the last phase of the war venerated him.
It was the war-victory that was mainly marketed by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna during the last LG Elections as well and it is definitely going to be so at the forthcoming Presidential and Parliamentary elections also.
President Sirisena seems to be attempting to counter this situation. Earlier, pushing Rajapaksa to an awkward and envious position, President Sirisena annulled two 19th Century Gazette notifications issued by the British Empire, which declared as traitors a large number of local chieftains, who rose against the empire during the 1818 Uva-Wellassa rebellion.
And now he seems to have opted to find the real heroes of the three-decade-long war.
The Presidents meeting had not been attended by former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, two veterans without whose contribution the war victory would not have been a reality.
It is not clear as to why these two very important persons did not participate in this meeting. In spite of the experience and the knowledge of the commanders of the three Armed Forces, who served before Fonseka being vital in compiling the war history, nobody would contest the fact that it was the last phase of the war that was most important.
Hence, to think about recording the war history without the contribution of Fonseka and Gotabaya Rajapaksa is ludicrous and clearly a political project of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
History is always written by the victor, they say. The dedication, commitment, bravery etc. of the loser or his side of the story would largely be left unnoticed or intentionally suppressed.
EPDP Parliamentarian Ramesh Nadaraja, who was shot dead in the mid-1990s in Wellawatte had been writing the history of the Eelam War in the Dinamurasu Newspaper, he was editing at the time of his death.
A reader had written to him protesting that he was giving too many credits to the LTTE and Nadaraja replied that he was writing the history and not party propaganda. He argued if the LTTE had excelled the other Tamil groups there must be reasons which cannot be blacked out when it comes to recording the history.
And also the armed conflict between the Armed Forces and the Tamil Armed Groups did not break out in isolation in the late 1970s.
It was not totally devoid of politics.
As VI Lenin described it was a continuation of politics pursued by both Sinhalese and Tamil leaders of the previous several decades.
Also, the misery of the people especially those living in the war theatre is also an important aspect that has to be recorded.
Therefore a war history recorded only from a military perspective would not tell the future generations what really happened.
In a country where everything including religion is politicized, one cannot expect the intentional as well as unintentional contributions of the political parties that are not involved in recording the history to be included in that version.

"Some have written books on the war, but they have been accused of being influenced by party politics, ethnic prejudice and personal agendas"
Therefore the contribution of the 2002 Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) in the war victory, irrespective of its highly dangerous flaws is likely to be unnoticed if the history is to be compiled.
For instance, the CFA showed the outside world to Vinayagamurthi Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman which ultimately resulted in the breaking of the LTTE.
The CFA exposed the unreliability of the LTTE to the world as the rebels had shot at even the international ceasefire monitors and thus 25 European countries designated it as an international terrorist organization.
CFA did not cover the sea and it was during that period that majority of the LTTE ships with military cargo were destroyed by the Sri Lanka Navy, with foreign intelligence support.
D.B.S.Jeyaraj, the Senior journalist once wrote how a large number of LTTE cadres had entered into the wedlock during the CFA and how it had, in turn, affected their commitment towards the separatist war.
In fact, the LTTE itself had largely contributed toward its decimation. The very notion of a Separate Tamil State close to Tamil Nadu, the southernmost State of India that houses 60 million Tamils is against the geopolitical realities.
Besides, the organization antagonized India by killing its celebrated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
They lost their friends among the Sinhalese Leftists by killing Sinhalese civilians.
Killing Muslims and expelling them from their original habitats in the North and the East dissociated them from the Muslims.
Also, the Tamil intellectuals left the area either to the south of the country or to the Western world, leaving the organization to rely only on themselves and their weapons.
There is no agreement between senior-most military Officers, who actively participated in the last battles of the war on many issues that contributed to their victory.
One says that it was the Army that provided intelligence to the Navy to destroy LTTE ships, while another says that Navy obtained the necessary intelligence from the Foreign Sources.
In the light of such disagreements it is doubtful that in the process of the recording of history, due recognition would be given to the contribution of some of the past battlefield victories, towards the final victory.
If the President can persuade the compilers to cover all these and such other aspects it would really be a comprehensive history.
Otherwise, it would just be an opening of a can of worms.

Sri Lankan leaders pay tributes to Vajpayee
	
Sri Lankan cabinet minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella will attend former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's funeral on Friday, as an envoy of Sri Lanka, authorities said.
Various Sri Lankan leaders paid rich tribute to the three time-PM, hailing him as a friend of Sri Lanka.
In a tweet on Thursday, President Maithripala Sirisena said: Today, we have lost a great humanist and a true friend of Sri Lanka. Former Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a visionary leader and an ardent defender of democracy. My condolences to his family and millions of his admirers around the world.
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said India has lost one of its most regarded intellectual and statesman. He served the great country of India with humility and honesty, and he was much loved and respected by millions of people across the world. Former three-time Prime Minister Vajpayee is also an exceptional orator and a leader with a great sense of humour, his speeches within the Indian parliament and outside will always be remembered, he said in a statement, extending his condolences on behalf of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka.
Recalling Mr. Vajpayees contributions to bilateral ties between India and Sri Lanka, Foreign Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said India-Sri Lanka relations were blessed by Mr. Vajpayee's futuristic policies. I was privileged to have met him as the Deputy High Commissioner at the time. The India-Sri Lanka FTA, the first free trade agreement for both countries, stands testimony to his visionary leadership, the top official tweeted.
In his condolence message Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Mr. Vajpayee played a vital role in ensuring the stability of Sri Lanka. I am deeply saddened by the death of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee who was a true friend of Sri Lanka. Shri Vajpayee led India during the transition of global geopolitics and ensured that his country rose in International stature. He also followed proactive policy of reaching out to Indias neighbours in South Asia and South East Asia," Mr. Wickremesinghe said in a statement. I have had the privilege of knowing Shri A.B.Vajpayee since 1975. Furthermore, we had a close working relationship during my tenure as Prime Minister from 2001 to 2004," he said, adding: "I will continue to treasure the memories of my friendship with this great man."

## Title: The dangers of Trumps worldwide trade wars

The dangers of Trumps worldwide trade wars
	
Trade between nations makes them interdependent and lessens the propensity to war. The more trade any two nations have, the more peace will there be between them. Building peace is one of the goals of the World Trade Organisation, the premier international body set up in January 1995 to ensure free and fair trade between nations.
But instead of peace, we are now witnessing a world war or, to put it more precisely, a world trade war. Unlike in shock-and-awe hot wars, in economic wars, killer weapons such as bunker-busting missiles, banned white phosphorus, depleted uranium and napalm bombs are not used. Yet economic wars kill  kill millions. In Iraq during the decade-long United States-sponsored international sanctions, one million Iraqis, half of them children, died due to lack of medicine and food. Asked about the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children due to sanctions, the then US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, This is a very hard choice, but the price is worth it.
The present world trade war has nothing to do with the WTO. Rather, it was solely the work of one man, Donald Trump, who appears to be thriving in chaos. Unfortunately, he is also the President of the United States and is increasingly proving that he is a misfit to govern a country that has produced great statesmen such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson, to name a few.
The tentacles of his trade war have reached many fronts  China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Iran and, this week, Turkey, for he thinks trade wars are good and winnable.
Sounding more like a trade-war version of an Adolf Hitler, than a knee-jerk protectionist, Trump tweeted on March 2, 2018: When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, dont trade anymore--we win big. Its easy!
Trump triggered what is termed by some analysts as the world historys biggest trade war when he slapped in January a 25 percent tariff on imported steel from China, Europe, Canada and Mexico, prompting tit-for-tat measures from the affected countries. The escalation of the trade war is shaking the foundation of free trade.
Last month he imposed a further US$ 34 billion worth of tariff on imports from China. In retaliation, China also imposed US$ 34 billion worth of tariffs on US goods and warned Beijing would not hesitate to hit back dollar-for-dollar if Trump took further action.
If this was not enough, Trump this week targeted Turkey, imposing punitive duties on that countrys aluminium and steel exports. The measure was connected to Turkeys refusal release a US preacher, who Turkey says is complicit in the 2016 botched coup attempt against the Recep Tayyip Erdogan government. Following Trumps punitive measure, Turkeys economy has taken a beating, with its currency, lira, losing 20 percent of its value.
Adding more chaos to the world trade order, Trump has reimposed sanctions on Iran. Apart from dealing a blow to Irans economy, the sanctions have also hit developing nations owing to soaring fuel prices. Last week, the Trump administration also imposed sanctions on Russia over the alleged nerve-agent poisoning of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter in the British town of Salisbury. Russia has described the sanctions as a declaration of economic war and warned of a fitting response.
Why is the US waging a trade war Probably, Trump and his hardline advisors are caught up in a Thucydides trap, a term popularised by American political scientist Graham T Allison. Quoting Thucydides, the fifth century Athenian historian, Allison in a New York Times article last year explained that when a rising power  in this instance, China -- causes fear in an established power  in this instance, the US -- it escalates towards war. Thucydides wrote: What made war inevitable was the growth of Athenian power and the fear which this caused in Sparta.
With the world powers being armed with planet-pulverising nuclear weapons which only guarantee mutually-assured destructions (MAD), the US cannot afford a military war with an equally powerful China. Hence the option is the economic war.
Since the end of World War II, the US had been the beacon of free trade. It scoffed at centrally controlled economic policies of the Soviet Union and other communist nations. Be it the historic Bretton Woods talks in 1944, the decision to end the gold standards in 1971, or the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT) deliberations that led to the formation of the WTO, the US had hit out at protectionism and championed free trade and liberal monetary and economic policies. Many a time, Washington had accused Japan and China of deliberately devaluing their currencies and adopting unfair trade practices.
But today, under Trump, the US sees WTO, which it had helped set up, as a hostile organisation. The WTO has been a disaster for this country, Trump ranted in March. It (WTO) has been great for China and terrible for the United States, and great for other countries, he said.
Today, instead of the US, it is China which appears to be pushing for more open borders, with its Belt-and-Road Initiative being promoted as a world trade booster.
In China, policymakers, academics and the people see Trumps trade war as part of Washingtons strategy to check Chinas rise and urge the government to take tough countermeasures.
The currency war is, probably, one such countermeasure, though the yuan has suffered a nine-percent drop due to Trumps trade war salvos. Undercutting the US dollar, countries such as China, Russia and Iran are increasingly doing business bypassing the dollar. China is considering a move to price oil in yuan linked to a gold-backed futures contract. The yuan officially became a world reserve currency in November 2015. Meanwhile, Russia and Iran have signed an agreement to avoid the dollar in their transactions. To overcome hurdles related to US sanctions, countries such as India have decided to buy oil from Iran by paying in local currency.
These developments have posed a serious threat to the US dollar as a world currency. The consequences could be devastating not only to developing countries, but also to the US itself. In addition, a slowdown of Chinas economy could generate worldwide tremors or lead to a global recession. Trump should wake up to these dangers.

The game has begun!
	

A provincial political authority for transport with close ties to a bigwig at the centre has now turned his office into a virtual employment exchange, they say.

 He is said to be generously offering appointments as clerks, timekeepers, mobile inspectors etc. to party supporters regardless of educational and other qualifications when there are hundreds of unemployed graduates and educated youth in the province among the applicants.
It has come to light that most of the party supporters have secured employment under this Ministry by producing forged certificates and providing false information, but the politico had ordered the Ministry high-ups to go easy on such cases, they say.

Universal Rights challenged People and their Politics
	
Drowned in sordid socio-political culture, Sri Lanka not geared for a better future

In post WW II modern world, democracy is accepted as an uncompromising way of private and public life. During the half Century we spent after WW II, the modern world has universally accepted Democratic Rights of all people. Declared Human Rights in a well-defined Charter that in its preamble says .recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. accepted by all member States as a primary Constitutive document of the UN adopted by the General Assembly in 1948. Thereafter the ILO, the Tri partite (States, Employers and Employees) global body of the UN system, diligently worked out and adopted Conventions that further explained human rights in terms of employment that in general are called Labour Rights. Together the Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Charters lay down principled conditions that guarantee the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. A human family that includes children, adults, ageing populations, gender, all ethnic and religious communities, youth and employees, leaving out none.

"Sri Lanka as a UN member bound to treat all its 20 million plus people without divisions and discrimination"
Sri Lanka is a member State of the UN from December 1955 and is bound to treat all its 20 million plus people as members of the human family without demarcations, divisions and without any form of discrimination.Yet the problem remains, that we dont have a social and a political culture with long and established traditions to uphold such Rights andValues and we lack social structures that can hold people and organisations accountable and responsible in honouring those Rights and Values.
Most recent exhibition of such arrogance against people was the intimidating selfish behaviour of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).With total disrespect for human life, threatening with strike action and then though unsuccessful, resorting to strike action over 05 times during the past 24 months,their attitudes and approach in gaining what they wanted, displayed how low even the once respected noble medical profession has descended to. They worked in tandem with the Faculty of Medical Teachers Association that promoted student protests for 10 long months, encouraging and supporting student boycott of lectures and protests on Colombo roads.
The elite professionals and the university academia being so, the Railway employees or any other cannot be expected to be any better. All live in a socio-political culture of threats, power and force thats taken for granted as the shortest route toanswers. This gets more chaotic with the populist albeit foolish stand of President Sirisena reversing most decisions arrived at even in Cabinet meetings. When the Finance Minister stood his ground as per the decision at the Cabinet meeting, President Sirisena hastened to give striking Railway unions a hearing and a promise to increase their salaries. On Monday last, they declared the strike called off on Presidents promise. The irony is the absence of People as the most important factor in any of these decisions.
On the flipside of these irresponsible and anarchic protests and strike actions, this Yahapalana government led by the UNP, ignored their responsibility in resolving issues and allowed them to drag on at the inconvenience of people. The SAITM medical degree issue was thus muddled up for over 02 whole years, allowing street protests over weeks and months.Though people blamed the government for all that as inefficiencyof an ineffective, spineless government, the political leadership of the UNP enjoyed the growing public anger against medical doctors, the university students and striking railway unions that demanded suppression, use of force and called for privatisation without trade unions. While the JO led by Mahinda Rajapaksa expect to politically gain from the chaotic instability they plan, demanding this government should be dissolved for their inability to provide answers, the UNP leadership tend to believe the anti-union, pro privatisation social psyche goes well with their investor led completely liberalised free market economy.

"The tug of war between Rajapaksa campaigns and UNP politics is not about politics for democracy"
The tug of war between Rajapaksa campaigns and UNP politics is not about politics for democracy. It is not about restoring a democratic society that guarantees the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. No, it is not. Its about regaining political power for all members of the Rajapaksa family at the cost of democracy and for businessmen with the UNP leadership, it is about unrestricted exploitation of labour without union rights.
Ever since the economy was turned into an export manufacture economy with FDIs by Jayawardenes UNP government 40 years ago, businessmen have been asking for relaxing of labour laws on the argument, investors cannot be attracted with a labour law regime that protects labour rights.They dont face the fact that with all the 55 pieces of law the Labour Department works with, there are multi-national corporations like Uni Levers and CTC in this country that worked for good profits, negotiating and working with trade unions. Yet the BOI was established to curb Right to association and collective bargaining through administrative mechanisms and for 40 years with all incentives given for FDIs, there is no development for over 90 per cent of the people. Janavasiya was brought in for poverty alleviation and was expanded as Samurdhi thats still running and this government is promising development with Grama Shakthi, Gamperaliya and with many different policy statements by both the President and the PM, each on his own.
Politics of this government that live on the mystic belief that development and FDIs are inseparable twins, allowed employers to resort to extremely uncivilised labour practises in busting trade unions. This was highlighted in a letter addressed by the FTZ & GSE Union to PM Wickremesinghe on 10 August 2018.The letter reveals how this yahapalana government keeps mum over such issues. Reminding past complaints it says, With almost 2 months without any measures taken to mitigate issues mentioned in our letter addressed to you, one of the issues raised therein, has taken a very serious turn of events with the top management of one of the companies deciding to hunt down employees they arbitrarily sacked from one of their factories. And it goes on to say, the company has resorted to lifetime revenge from employees sacked for organising a trade union. The FTZ & GSE Union letter says, Addressing letters to other employers, the company has requested them, not to employ workers sacked from the factory for organizing a trade union. This they say, is how a garment factory then owned by leading politician arbitrarily sacked workers for collectively raising their grievances,with an e-mail sent to all employers in the EPZ by an unknown sender Protect Apparel Industry with photos and names of all sacked employees carrying one of the most disgusting captions Beware of this kind of Dogs.
It is for such ruthless exploitation of labour this government accepts social chaos in developing a social psyche that allows de-unionising and suppressing of democratic and labour rights.A social psyche that allows destroying of universally accepted principles of human and labour rights. A government economic policy that demands investor friendly rule in violation of decent civilised life in a democracy.

"Its about regaining political power for all members of the Rajapaksa family at the cost of democracy and for the businessmen with the UNP leadership"
We are no more in a world that accept slave employment. Today employment comes with accepted rights and decent working conditions, Sri Lanka is bound by ILO Conventions 87 and 93 and by its own Constitution that guarantees human rights including right to association.Thus Decent Work is not about wages alone. It is about human dignity in employment. 
In polar opposite to union busting and de unionising the labour force this Yahapalana government promotes as necessary for economic growth,In Europe, unions werent destroyed  they thrived. Deals between unions and companies are brokered formally or informally by governments. But thats just the beginning. In Germany, for example, workers representatives sit on company boards.
In France, collective bargaining is a right, negotiated by sectors, for example, among all waiters and restauranteurs  not individual companies and employers. In Scandinavia, companies have to account for their social costs and benefits. [Umair Haque on How Capitalist Utopia became Everyone Elses Dystopia -https://eand.co/ July 2018] The point is Haque says,Europe developed better mechanisms for economic interaction fuller ones, if you like, which ensured more stable, opportune, and empowered societies. Average people had genuine power to demand a fairer more of an economys gains  as they should, not just for moral reasons, but also socio-political ones.
Drowned in a sordid socio-political culture, present day Sri Lanka is not geared for a better future that ensures a more stable, opportune, and an empowered society. Politics in Sri Lanka is on reverse gear. Political campaigns are sadly mobilising people to destroy their own democracy and social stability.In allowing industrial arrogance for looting and not industrial peace for growth. In short, we are heading towards socio economic anarchy, with no alternate political discourse. The two major political players wanting power at the expense of the people and their future. The people too joining in to help create despots on the way.

Vanity and Sanity!
	

A prominent politico had got quite concerned when he heard that a family member of his, a chief of a mini-council had gone on a spree of implementing a series of unpopular measures such as dismantling unauthorized structures and forcibly removing pavement vendors, hurting several sections of the local folk.

Following numerous complaints from affected party supporters, the politico had advised the family member not to rush into doing things that hurt their loyal supporters.
However, the mini-council head had turned angrily on him and retorted: You better mind your own business. Though you have been riding high you have not done anything for my sake so far. Now that I have got some power and authority with my own efforts, I will do things as I please. I dont care for anybodys advice!

We thank MR for saving Keith Noyar: Ajith P. Perera
	
We must be thankful to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his intervention to prevent the killing of journalist Keith Noyahr in 2009, State Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.
State Minister Perera told a news conference that Mr. Rajapaksa intervened to stop the killing of Noyahr when his abductors were about to assassinate him. We thank Mr. Rajapaksa for his intervention, Mr. Perera said while adding that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also played a role in saving the life of Keith.
At the same time, the State Minister said Former President knew very well that who had abducted the journalist. Several journalists were killed and assaulted under the previous regime. However, there is freedom for journalists under this regime.
Responding to a question raised by journalists on the recent incident where former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had preventing the media from covering a certain event, the State Minister said chasing the media away was wrong, especially if they were invited to cover the event. State Minister Perera also focused on the situation with regard to the judiciary, said the first High Court with Trial-at-Bar will be opened on August 24, 2018, and said the remaining new High Courts under the Judicature Amendment Bill also be opened within a few months.

Work-to-rule campaign from midnight to replace bus strike: ACPBWA
	
The All Ceylon Private Bus Workers' Association (ACPBWA) said they will stop the ongoing strike and launch a work-to-rule campaign from midnight today, unless the President intervenes to solve their issues.
ACPBWA convener Kumararatna Renuka told Daily Mirror that they had decided to call off the strike tonight following threats received by the workers, from bus owners.
Now we are depressed and 40 per cent of bus operators have reported for work as they were forced to do so by their bus owners, he said.
Therefore, our association decided to call-off the strike and launch a work-to-rule campaign tonight. We advised workers to refrain from overtaking vehicles on the road by crossing white lines.
The bus owners never think about their workers but only about their daily income. If we overtake and cross the white lines, we have to pay the spot fines from our daily salary.
Therefore, we have decided to deduct the spot fines from the bus owners fixed daily amount at the end of the day and return the balance, he said.
We do not care about the bus owners' income anymore and will not overtake any vehicle on the road. That will take a long time to reach a destination. We have also advised the workers to mark their log sheets accurately, Mr Renuka said.
We request the responsible authorities to implement the rules such as wearing of uniforms, he said.
Meanwhile, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva addressing a media briefing yesterday said that no one could oppose the new traffic fines once they were passed in Parliament and gazetted. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
