The Comtrust Equity Fund declared a dividend of Rs.2.00 for the year ended 31 March 2015 (FY15), one of the highest dividend payment for the current year by an Equity Fund in the Unit Trust industry.  Incidentally, this is also the fifth consecutive year that the Fund has distributed Rs 2 per Unit as dividends.
Comtrust Equity Fund, a balanced fund investing in both equity and fixed income, rose 32.9 percent for FY15, recording an over performance of 18.6 percent vs. the benchmark All Share Price Index (ASPI), which rose 14.3 percent during the same time period. The Fund also beat the more liquid S&P SL20 index, which rose 17.5 percent for FY15. 
Over the past three years, the Fund has achieved a CAGR of 14.4 percent, whereas the ASPI recorded a 3-year CAGR of 8.0 percent and the S&P SL20 recorded an 8.9 percent performance. 
The All Share Total Returns Index (ASTRI), which is inclusive of dividends, has posted a return of 10.7 percent for the corresponding time period. 
“Tactical asset allocation, combined with a strategic sector focus and investing in fundamentally sound undervalued shares has enabled the Fund to beat both indices during the last couple of years” said Thinushka Soysa, Senior Fund Manager at Comtrust Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd.
