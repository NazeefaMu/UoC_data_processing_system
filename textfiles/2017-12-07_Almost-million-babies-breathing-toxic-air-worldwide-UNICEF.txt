DPA, 06th DECEMBER, 2017- Almost 17 million babies across the world are breathing toxic air, which could be damaging the development of their brains, according to a report released by UNICEF on Wednesday.


There are 136 million children under the age of 1 globally, which means one in eight are being exposed to toxic air, the UN children’s 
fund said.


Satellite imagery analysed by UNICEF indicates that 12.2 million of these children live in South Asia. The East Asia and Pacific region is home to some 4.3 million babies living in areas with pollution levels at least six times higher than international limits.


“Not only do pollutants harm babies’ developing lungs - they can permanently damage their developing brains - and, thus, their futures,” said UNICEF executive director 
Anthony Lake.


Lake called on countries exceeding international limits to step up efforts to reduce 
air pollution.
