US and India want Port City project stopped - Wimal


	

National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa claimed yesterday that it was the US and the India that wanted to stop the Port City project and that the present government was attempting to do it.
Speaking at a public meeting in Kandy organized to pressurize the SLFP to field former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the forthcoming Parliamentary election, Weerawansa also sarcastically questioned Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe whether he was able to stop the Port City project.
The NFF leader challenged the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to reveal the number of people attended the meeting he was speaking.
“This is the struggle to bring Mahinda Rajapaksa back to win the freedom we are losing now. We are not attempting to break the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). It was broken by somebody else,” he stated.
He ridiculed the SLFP parliamentarians by saying that the members of the party that has the majority power in the Parliament were licking the feet of Mr. Wickremesinghe and questioned as to who allowed the SLFP to be so undermined.
The former Central Province Governor Tikiri Kobbekaduwa who had attended the meeting defying the ban by the SLFP leadership preventing its members from attending meetings of other parties read out the special message sent by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the meeting.
The former President said in his message that mistakes and misdeeds had to be identified to make sure that they won’t recur and added that those mistakes should not stand in the way while fulfilling the responsibilities towards the motherland.
“The punishments for our wrongdoings are punishments while the punishment for what we had done to the motherland is a pride,” Rajapaksa had said and had pledged that he would do whatever the people would demand from him in this struggle.
Former Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Southern Provincial Council member Ven. Baddegama Samitha Thera also addressed the gathering.( J.A.L.Jayasinghe and Shane Seneviratne)
