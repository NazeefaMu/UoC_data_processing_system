SLIM inaugurates Strategic Brand Management Diploma for 2018


	

Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) is the foremost strategic branding qualification in Sri Lanka introduced by the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing. 

DSBM students are bestowed with the knowledge on theories of Branding and how to apply that knowledge on the Brands that they work on. Students will eventually be groomed to become Brand Managers who will rub shoulders with their rivals in the present exigent marketing arena. A unique and integral part of the SLIM DSBM programme is that students have to carry out a practical brand unveiling session as their integrated assignment. With this innovative approach, SLIM has made a unique reputation to itself as the leading professional body who creates future brand leaders to Sri Lanka. 

The 12 month part time DSBM programme is ideal for young executives interested in branding, trainee brand managers and professionals/marketers in the corporate sector as well as entrepreneurs who want to develop brands to the nation. 

SLIM had the first inauguration of the Diploma in Strategic Brand Management (DSBM) for 2018 at SLIM Home, which was attended by a cross section of prospective DSBM students and personnel in the corporate sector. Intakes are now on and prospective students are welcome to enrol at their earliest to avoid disappointment of limited seats. Students may complete the course at SLIM Business School in Colombo.

The theme of SLIM-DSBM 2018 is ‘The Art of Branding’, and covers vital areas such as the role of a brand manager, brand marketing, brand planning and strategic implications in branding and managing brands overtime.

SLIM President Pradeep Edward, the CEO of Lanka Hospital Diagnostics, said that DSBM endows necessary skills in marketers to build valuable brands by utilising internationally proven, innovative branding strategies and best practices. “Branding not only helps position products and services but also individuals. One specialty of SLIM DSBM is that the students are able to experience practical aspects of learning. They will go through hands-on experience of practically launching a new brand. Such fresh and innovative brands have made them employable and created many opportunities in the corporate sector”.



He further said, “The cream of marketing personnel in the country, who hold senior positions in the corporate sector with vast experience, are employed by SLIM as resource persons to conduct DSBM lectures that are benchmarked with global standards. In addition, visiting lecturers will share their industry experiences with students”.

SLIM Vice President Education, Suranjith Swaris shared a special message with the prospective students. In his speech, he demonstrated the power of branding and its manipulative effect on consumers. “Branding is a vital tool which marketers can use to surpass competitors and have an edge over rival products. Brands such as Fedex, Coca Cola and Nike have made unique reputations. They have become top-of-the-mind brands, while earning reputation and recognition. As the National body for Marketing we want you to develop many brands to the Mother Nation”.

Lanka Grills Proprietor Remo Issac Rajamoney who is a SLIM-DSBM past student attending the inaugural session made an insightful presentation on how the DSBM programme helped him to excel as an entrepreneur and start his own brand, Lanka Grills. Rajamoney commended “I followed DSBM and today I have developed my own brand. There were many DSBM students like me who started their own brands after following DSBM. The courage, enthusiasm and confidence given throughout DSBM learning, definitely pushes you to build your own brand one day”. 

SLIM CEO and Executive Director Sanath Senanayake expressed, “We enhanced the practical value and real world application of DSBM by identifying industry needs to ensure that we produce marketers who could cater to the demands of modern marketing and branding”. He noted that the SLIM- DSBM course content, syllabus and text books are benchmarked with the evolving global marketing atmosphere while feasibly catering to current local industry requirements.
