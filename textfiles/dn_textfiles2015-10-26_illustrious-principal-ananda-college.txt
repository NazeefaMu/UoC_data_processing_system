S.A. Wijayatilake
Illustrious Principal of Ananda College


S.A. Wijayatilake is recognised as an illustrious Principal of Ananda College, Colombo. His views and suggestions expressed without fear and favour were generally accepted by all heads.
Samarapulige Ariyaratne Wijeyatilake was born on December 22, 1901 at Matale. He was the fifth in a family of nine siblings, born to S.M.P. Wijeyatilake and Leela Wijayatilake nee Gunasekera.
Young SA started his primary education at the Buddhist Institute (Now Wijaya College), Matale. He completed his primary schooling at Christ Church in Matale. Thereafter he was admitted to St. John’s College, Panadura. He joined Ananda at Grade seven. After completing his secondary education he entered the Ceylon University College, reading English, History and Western Classics for a B.A. degree from the University of London which he obtained in 1921.
S.A. joined the staff of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, as a teacher to which profession he devoted his life.
After about two years at Dharmaraja he joined the staff of Ananda College where P.de S. Kularatne was the Principal. In 1924, Kularatne inaugurated Nalanda Vidyalaya and transferred some of the most versatile and dedicated teachers from Ananda to the new institute. They were C.E. Strange, S.A. Wijeyatilake, J.N.Jinendradasa, V.I. Perera, D.C. Lawris, and C.E.P. Kumarasinghe (father of the writer). G.P. Malalasekera was appointed Principal of Nalanda.
In 1947, Wijeyatilake returned to Dharmaraja as Vice Principal and in due course was appointed Principal. He served in this capacity for nearly eight years.
In January 1955, Wijeyatilake was selected to succeed L.H. Mettananda as Principal of Ananda. In doing so, Wijeyatileke earned the signal honour of being the first old student of Ananda to become its Principal. Wijeyatilake always espoused high principles even at the risk of being unpopular. He did not hesitate to say what he believed in and stood, steadfastly by his principals. He was an able writer as well and once edited the Buddhist Annual with his brothers.
At Ananda he continued the development commenced by Mettananda his predecessor. The Olcott Memorial Buddha Jayanthi Building was duly completed, after which a similar block named Leadbeater Memorial Building was constructed in memory of Ananda’s first Principal.
Towards the end of his stewardship as Principal in 1962, Ananda became a state institution.
After retirement, Wijeyatilake served on the Board of Regents of the University of Ceylon and was a member of the Police Commission and the Industrial Disputes Commission.
He also served as an honorary capacity in several other organiszations.
He died at the age of 70 on June 22, 1971
