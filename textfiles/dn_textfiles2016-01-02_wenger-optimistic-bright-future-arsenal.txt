Wenger optimistic of bright future for Arsenal

 
LONDON, FRIDAY: Whatever happens when Newcastle United visit the Emirates Stadium on Saturday, Arsene Wenger can be satisfied Arsenal have ended 2015 in a much better shape than they started the year.
Twelve months ago, the Gunners slumped to a 2-0 defeat at Southampton that left them in sixth position in the Premier League, 13 points adrift of leaders Chelsea -- a dismal situation that led to a confrontation between Wenger and an angry supporter during the game.
This time around, Arsenal will start the new year at the top of the league table and bolstered by the growing confidence this could be the year they deliver a first English title since 2004.
Wenger's side have grown stronger the longer the season has gone on and it would be a major surprise if they failed to record a fifth win in six league games against Steve McClaren's struggling Newcastle.
The 4-0 defeat at Southampton a week ago demonstrated the north London club still have the capacity to stumble unexpectedly.
But with German midfielder Mesut Ozil in outstanding form and Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey getting better with every game, the impact of a succession of injuries to key players including Alexis Sanchez has not been felt as keenly as they might have been.
The title race, though, remains finely balanced, with only goal difference separating Arsenal from Leicester City, who lie second with Manchester City a further three points behind. Wenger insists this is the most exciting season at the head of the table for several years and the immediate challenge for his side is to ensure they maintain their slender lead. And on that count, the Gunners manager believes Arsenal's performances have offered grounds for optimism at the Emirates. "Being top on goal difference doesn't make a big difference, it is just down to how well you play," Wenger said. "Your performances dictate all that and you have to be guided by your performances.
"After that it is reassuring to know that if your performances are right you do not need bad results from somebody else.
