The book ‘ Janadhipathi Thaththa’ penned by President Maithripala Sirisena’s daughter might disappear from the shelves at bookshops after the statements made by opposition MPs in Parliament with regard to it, UNP MP Ashu Marasinghe said yesterday.

Mr Marasinghe said the book had become a best seller after the statements made by MPs on it.

“People should purchase and read it before copies of it are taken out of book stores” he said.

The MP said what is written in the book are true as the author speaks abut the dictatorial regime which existed before 2015. (Yohan Perera)
