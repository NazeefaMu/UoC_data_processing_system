Lankaputhra Development Bank (LDB) is making plans to conduct an award ceremony that recognizes the achievements of the bank’s entrepreneurs. 
The event, which is scheduled to be held on 8th January, will recognize one hundred entrepreneurs who have obtained loans from the bank’s eight branches and built successful business ventures. 
The recipients of these awards will be selected from small and medium-scaled as well as large-scaled industries. First, second and third placed winners will be selected from various categories and presented a valuable certificate together with an award.
  The entry forms of these entrepreneurs for the awards are carefully evaluated using a customized selection process developed by the bank. As the first step, the manager of each branch will evaluate each entrepreneur and will pass on the entry form to the special selection committee at the Head Office, at which point the entry form is further analysed and the first, second and third placed winners are selected.
  Commenting on the award ceremony, Lasantha Goonewardena – Chairman of LDB stated, “This special award ceremony will be held along with the 10th anniversary celebration of LDB. Since this is the first time that the bank has organized such an award ceremony, it is a new, unique experience for the bank. The objective of this event is to recognize the outstanding achievements of the bank’s top entrepreneurs and to motivate them to aim even higher in the future. Additionally, we believe that this event will bring these entrepreneurs closer together, help them share knowledge and build better relationships that will undoubtedly help each and every one of them in their business ventures.” He added that the organizing of such an event highlighted the fact that the bank’s commitment to the entrepreneurs goes beyond disbursing loans.
  The Minister, special invitees, the bank’s senior management as well as a large number of businessmen are expected to participate in this event.
   LDB provides attractive interest rates for savings and a high interest rate for senior citizens’ fixed deposits. In addition to this, the Bank also offers microfinance loans, pawning services, “Sandaliya” savings account for women and “Shasthree” higher educational loan scheme specially designed for the benefit of students interested in pursuing Graduate, Post Graduate, Academic and Professional studies in locally and internationally-recognized educational institutes.
