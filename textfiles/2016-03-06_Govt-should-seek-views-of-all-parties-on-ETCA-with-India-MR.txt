Govt. should seek views of all parties on ETCA with India: MR


	

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today urged the government to table the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) in parliament, and seek the views of the trade chambers, professional associations and the general public before making a decision to enter into the agreement.

Releasing a statement the former President said the arrogant attitude the government had taken in this matter may end up ruining the chances of forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with our neighbour.

“The government has indicated that they intend to sign an Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India this month. Neither the Parliament, nor the general public have been officially informed about the contents of this proposed agreement. From the draft that has been unofficially released to professional associations by Minister Malik Samarawickrema, we gather that the proposed ETCA is not a detailed document but only a framework agreement which would leave the specific details on the trade in goods and services and investment to be worked out later,” the statement said.
