Perpetual Treasuries Ltd owner Arjun Aloysius had interfered with the witness who was supposed to testify at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on behalf of Pan Asia Bank, it was revealed today .

It was revealed when Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager Aruna Benedict Dias' evidence was led by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilaka.

Before calling for evidence, the witness was summoned to make a statement recorded by the police at the PCoI on July 4. Later based on that statement, Mr. Dias appeared before the Commission on July 5 to give evidence.

The witness said Mr. Aloysius had called him on his mobile phone on June 30, prior to him giving evidence at the PCoI and wanted to meet him for some reason. "Initially I refused but he kept asking me for at least 10 minutes”, witness said.

Subsequently, Mr. Dias had visited Arjun Aloysius’ house based on his request. “During the discussion we had in his house Mr. Aloysius told me that now we are in the last two crucial weeks of the proceedings of PCoI, so I need your support…” witness said.

The witness also revealed that Mr. Aloysius had guaranteed him a place in his company should he leave Pan Asia Bank because of this matter.

When the PCoI questioned his decision to go Mr. Aloysius’ residence, the witness was of the view that it was concerning his personal and professional matter and therefore had the intention of obtaining more information from Mr. Aloysius.

The witness said despite rejecting such proposals, Mr. Aloysius continued to contact him making several phone calls prior to and after him giving statements to the police on July 4.

He said former Pan Asia Bank Chairman Nimal Perera had also contacted him after he made statements to the police and assured him a place in his future Money Brokering Company if something happens to his current position at Pan Asia Bank.

“I assume they wanted to prevent me from disclosing the truth at the PCoI," the witness said.

Subsequently, Commissioner, SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked Additional Solicitor General Dappulada Livera to check for any legal provision which derives criminal aspects regarding such interference with the witness.

The Witness said that he first met Mr. Aloysius on June 2015 at the place of former Pan Asia Bank’s Chairman in the presence of PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.

That discussion was relating to the Pan Asia’s role as an intermediary between Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and PTL for the transactions in the secondary market.

According to the witness, the Pan Asia Bank had acted as an intermediary between EPF and PTL transactions in the secondary market during the latter part of 2015 based on the instructions of former Chairman of Pan Asia Bank, since EPF and PTL had certain counter part restrictions to deal between themselves according to some laws.

During the previous evidence led by DSG Gunathilaka, it was said that the PTL had dictated such intermediary bond transactions by deciding on Price, Quantity and Settlement dates to the Pan Asia Bank.

Additionally, the witness also said that he had another meeting with Mr. Aloysius in March 2016 in the presence of former Pan Asia Bank again.

“The PTL was having a financial funds issue in settling payments regarding the bonds that they had obtained at the auctions took place on March 29 and March 31, 2016, therefore the discussion was based on whether the Pan Asia Bank could facilitate PTL with ‘intraday inject of cash”, said witness.

The witness was of the view that he was highly rejecting to provide such facility to PTL because it was a high risk to the Bank. “Former Chairman of the Pan Asia Bank and Mr. Aloysius was attempting to convince me towards taking such decision but I was not happy”, said him.

Meanwhile responding to an argument that had taken place between the DSG and President’s Counsel who appeared for PTL, SC Justice Prasanna Jayawardena ascertained that the Commission has no friends or respect towards any individuals during the proceedings. The witness will continue testifying on Monday.  (Shehan Chamika Silva)
