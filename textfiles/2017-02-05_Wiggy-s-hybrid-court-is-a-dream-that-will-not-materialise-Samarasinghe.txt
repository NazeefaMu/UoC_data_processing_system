Northern Province Chief Minister C. V Wigneswaran’s moves to establish a hybrid court in the province is a dream which will never materialize, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
 
Speaking at an Independence Day ceremony in Kalutara, the minister went on to say that some politicians had become slaves to foreign powers and organizations and were only working towards obtaining certain privileges.
 
“We will not betray our soldiers and police officers. I saw a news report which said a hybrid court will be established in the Northern Provincial Council. I want to say that this is just a dream of the Chief Minister which will not be accomplished. We have faith that President Maithripala Sirisena would not allow anyone to betray our soldiers,” he said.(Darshana Sanjeewa)
