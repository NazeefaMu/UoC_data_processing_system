A Blue party organizer in a district north of the sacred city in the hills who is said to be having close ties with the other main party as well had been keeping his mobile phone switched off during the past few days.

 


Despite being a Blue party organizer, the man is functioning as a key assistant to a former Chief Minister as well, they say.


Finding that the double role that he had been playing is no longer a secret, the politico had decided to go into oblivion at least until he could see a clear picture of the political situation, which is now in the throes of a deepening crisis, informed sources say.
