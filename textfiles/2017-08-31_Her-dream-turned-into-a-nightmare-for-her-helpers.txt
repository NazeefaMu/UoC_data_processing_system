Her dream turned into a nightmare for her helpers


	

An incident where a woman's dream woke up her neighbours as well as brought her relatives to her house at 4 in the morning was reported recently from Dankotuwa.

The woman's husband had set off in his vehicle at 3 a.m to buy fish and after setting the alarm for the time she wanted to get up the woman in question had fallen into a deep sleep. In a dream she had seen her husband's vehicle crash into a bus and woke up screaming. The woman then took a call to her husband's mobile phone but received no answer.

She was so worried that the dream was real that she proceeded to call out to her neighbours to come to her aid. She had also telephoned her relatives and pleaded with them to come to come there to help her locate the place where the accident involving her husband had occurred. It was 4 a.m in the morning.

Fearing the worst she asked those who had come to her aid to accompany her to the town to check on her husband's whereabouts.

However, try as they might they were unable to locate the crash-site she had seen in her dream. Thereafter they had given up the search and returned back to where the woman lived. On their way back they were greeted with the sight of the woman's husband driving back home safe and sound, bringing with him the fish that was bought for an alms-giving. Realising that the woman had wasted their time because of what she had seen in a stupid dream and on a holiday at that, they went their separate ways cursing her for her haste.
