Fresh seating arrangements will be in place in Parliament tomorrow to accommodate the 16 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) MPs who opted to sit in the Opposition after relinquishing their portfolios, Parliament Secretary General Dammika Dasanayake said yesterday.

He told Daily Mirror that the senior-most members of this group would be accommodated in the front row of the opposition benches.

Parliament will meet for the first time tomorrow after it was prorogued last month.

President Maithripala Sirisena will inaugurate the session and outline the government's policy for the remaining period of its term of office. (Kelum Bandara)
