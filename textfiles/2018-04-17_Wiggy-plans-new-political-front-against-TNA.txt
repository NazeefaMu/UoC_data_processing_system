Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran is hoping to form a new political party as an alternative to the Ilankai Tamil Arachu Kachchi (ITAK) to contest the upcoming provincial council elections, a source close to him said yesterday.

He contested the 2013 elections under the banner of the ITAK-led Tamil National Alliance (TNA) though however, he fell out with the ITAK leaders later.

The source said the chief minister would form a new party move for a broad political alliance as an alternative to the TNA to contest the elections.

The TNA leaders are on record saying the TNA would not nominate Mr. Wigneswaran.

When asked about the latest political development, Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Leader Suresh Premachandran said the chief minister had expressed his interest in forming a united political front as he was not pleased with TNA policies.

When asked whether the EPRLF would join hands with him, he said, it would depend on how the Chief Minister played his cards. (Kelum Bandara)
