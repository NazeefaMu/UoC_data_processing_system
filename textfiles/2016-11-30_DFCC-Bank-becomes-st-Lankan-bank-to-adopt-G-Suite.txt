DFCC Bank PLC recently announced that it has commenced the process of adopting Google’s cloud-based collaboration and communication suite, known as G Suite, to further enhance the bank’s productivity and drive innovation. 


DFCC will be the first bank to migrate onto Google Cloud with over 1,500 employees adopting G Suite which includes: Gmail, Google Hangouts, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Groups and Google Sites. These cloud-based tools will support communication, real-time collaboration, productivity and workflow within the organisation. 


DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando commented, “We are excited to announce DFCC Bank’s adoption of the Google cloud-based platform. Businesses around the world are increasingly embracing cloud-based suites globally and we are proud to be the first bank in Sri Lanka to do so. This will introduce a new way of working giving employees access to information across desktop and mobile devices with seamless web and mobile applications, thereby enabling greater flexibility and mobility. Whilst increasing productivity and cost efficiency, our customers will also benefit greatly from improved systems and processes, faster response times and product and service innovation.”
He added, “We are especially happy to work with a technology partner like Google, as we have the confidence that they will continue to invest in innovation and bolster businesses for future shifts.”
“We are excited to support DFCC’s digital transformation. As the first financial institution to move onto G Suite in Sri Lanka, they are leading the way by tapping into smart cloud technology that increases employee productivity while lowering IT spend and keeping information secure,” said G Suite Southeast Asia Head of Sales Inam Hussain.


Employees will also be able to reap the benefits of using advanced collaboration tools such as Google Hangouts and Google Docs. These tools will support them to collaborate in real time and share ideas more quickly and easily. For example, Google Docs allows many people to work on one document simultaneously, removing the need to constantly update different versions of a document, thereby increasing productivity.


DFCC Bank is committed to using the platform of robust technology to drive service excellence and product innovation. In the recent past, the bank has taken many steps to significantly improve the reliability of its delivery systems and deployed new products to simplify the process of banking. Some new innovations include, the Supplier Settlement System, Lanka Money Transfer and Vardhana Virtual Wallet. With growth through innovation and continuous improvement high on the agenda, DFCC is well positioned to deliver exceptional value to all stakeholders.
