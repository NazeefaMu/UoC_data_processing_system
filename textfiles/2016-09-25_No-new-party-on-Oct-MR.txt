While ruling out plans of the Joint Opposition to form a new political party, former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa today said that it is the people who should decide on the establishment of a new party.

He said this as a response to the media after attending a religious event held in Urapola Temple in Pilimathalawa.

“The rally of the Joint Opposition which will be held on October 8 is not about the formation of a new party,” he said.

However, it was reported that the inaugural rally of a new political front headed by the Joint Opposition is slated to be held at Eheliyagoda town on October 8.
