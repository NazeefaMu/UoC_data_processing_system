He puts his foot down against tax discrimination


	



 

A powerful purohita in yahapalanaya received summons from a Big Boss recently.

 


The Big Boss had received a number of complaints saying that tariffs and some other levies imposed on a certain industry were highly discriminatory in that they favoured a few big companies and placed the small players at a severe disadvantage. 


The Big Boss told the purohita that it militated against the core principles of yahapalanaya to impose discriminatory taxes and asked him to make necessary revisions to ensure competitive equality in the industry. 


The purohita had later instructed his officials to make necessary changes to the tariff regime.  Two tycoons who reigned supreme in the industry got highly upset on hearing this news, 
they say.
