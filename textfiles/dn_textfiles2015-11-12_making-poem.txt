Making of a poem

Some years ago I had the chance of reading a few past issues of the much discussed English literary periodical published in the UK titled as Partisan Review. The literary reviews were mostly directed to interpret some of the unknown areas in creative process where the emphasis was laid especially on poetry.
One of the writers happened to be the famous English literary figure who commenced his career during the post war days known as Stephen Spender.
He was well known for his poetic creations as well as for his other interpretations. He happened to be the writer who fished out the well known poems of T S Eliot, W H Auden, Walter de la Mare and W.B. Yeats. Writing a long account on Eliot's The Wasteland, he emphasised it as a poetic creation that belongs to the entire world where the countries are torn between the need for peace versus the terror of the living conditions in warfare. Writing a stimulating piece on the 'making of a poem' Spender says that the creation of poems is an activity which makes certain demands of attention on the poet and which requires that he or she should have some social qualifications by way of inspiration and mindfulness also termed as concentration.
Need for poetry
He tried to interpret these three terms with examples and tried to interpret them in terms of the need for poetry and why one should write poems sensibly. As Spender emphasized the creation of poems is essentially a personal need based on the commitment to social awareness. It is the poetic expression as he underlined that creates a sense of sharp observation which supersedes all other literary activities like writing stories, parables and play scripts.
As regards the social awareness, he laid emphasis on the personal attitude based on one's learning and knowledge. As regards concentration he said that it is the concentration that is required for writing or the expression of an experience. It is a focussing of the attention in a special way, so that the poet is aware of all the implications and possible developments of his idea.
He compares the process of developing an idea as the growth of a plant. As regards the inspiration he says that it is similar to the warmth the plant gets from the sun and water and the care it gets from the planter. Going back to the interpretation of The Wasteland by Eliot, the main point he drives in is the latent talent of the poet to combine the human state of life in a frame of peace and harmony. Eliot has derived inspiration from the spiritualism which in the hands of Eliot becomes a live thread.
As stated by the great psychologist Carl Jung, creativity like the freedom of the human will, contains areas still hidden from any scientific analysis. As such the very act of creativity lurks in mystery Jung says that poems could be regarded as the best example to discern the inability to interpret in simple terms. He quotes examples from the much discussed Faust and shows that the in depth studies lead one to understand the hells and heavens which the human have failed to fathom. Furthermore creativity still remains as riddles especially in the case of poetry.
Views
Spender says that we lack very much a whole view of poetry, and have instead many one sided views of certain aspects of poetry which have been advertised as the only aims which poets should attempt. He seems to challenge the movements such as free verse, imagism, surrealism, expressionism, personalism and so on. They according to Spender tend to make people think that poetry is simply a matter of not writing in metre of rhyme or of free association or of thinking in images or of any other form. The most debatable factor is the writing of free verse which according to the poet Robert Frost is the most difficult creation. The reason why it is difficult to create in a formless form is determined by the poet himself.
It is compared to the tennis playing without a visible net. Spender refers to the age old parables and ballads written the form of verses devoid of the conventional forms of poetic creations. For the poet to express his thoughts and feelings in a way other than the poem demands, is to swim against a current in which he is likely to lose both himself and what he is trying to create. Robert Frost once said that a poem planned in advance never came off. But the well known poet who translated poems from Greek sources Robert Graves added that 'real poems appear unexpectedly and at a time when the poet is in a a so called state of grace which could be expressed as a mood of meditation or concentration.'
Clear mind
This is nothing but the state of a clear mind clear healthy heart and no worries about fame money or other people but only the excitement of a unique revelation about to be given. There are poets living in the Orient as well as in the Occident who wish to address a wider audience via their poetic creations. But has this ever happened well is the question paused by poets themselves. It is also a linguistic barrier lying underneath. No poem according to Spender could be translated to any other language retaining the original flavour of the creator in his own language. The only visible success according to him is the translations of ballads or the story poems. It is not the spirit of the ballad that gets translated but the embedded story.
Thus the fables written by Aesop translated from Greek sources may retain the original flavour determined by the creator. Spender emphasises the uses the changing patterns of language used by the poets. He says that different poets concentrate in different ways depending on the changes ensued in their respective cultures.
A poet can feel that he is either old fashioned or new fashioned perhaps with the use of language he is familiar with. But this is just one factor in the making of poems for the eternal value lies in the sensibility that overpervades the language barriers. He records that as Paul Valery, the French Poet said 'one inspiring line is given to the poet by God or by nature, the rest he has to discover for himself' summing up he says that 'if the art of concentrating in a particular way is the discipline necessary for poetry to reveal itself, memory exercised in a particular way is the natural gift of poetic genius'.
