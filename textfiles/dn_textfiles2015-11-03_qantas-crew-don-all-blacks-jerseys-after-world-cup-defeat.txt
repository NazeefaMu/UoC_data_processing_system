Qantas crew don All Blacks jerseys after World Cup defeat

Australian airline Qantas has settled its wager with Air New Zealand after Australia's Rugby World Cup defeat.
The crew of Monday's Sydney to Auckland flight wore All Blacks jerseys,honouring a bet born on twitter.
The wager was inspired by some social media sparring - an earlier suggestion was for the losing airline to repaint its fleet in opposition colours.
The Kiwis became the first team to defend the Rugby World Cup on Saturday, defeating the Wallabies 34-17.(dailymail)
