“Today we celebrate the results of the fruitful teamwork and more importantly, a roadmap that will guide our operations in the next three years.The plan acknowledges the changing environment and the need to convert from a red ocean player into a blue ocean player in the financial industry. This informed our new strategic direction which is to: “Making the competition irrelevant and creating new market space”.”
The Chief Executive Officer of MBSL, Thilak Mutugala presented the overall strategic plan 2017-2019 to the audience which was comprised of board of directors, corporate management, regional managers and branch managers. Under its unique, customer centric, blue ocean growth platform MBSL will provide a range of new and exciting opportunities for both existing and potential customers in the form of enhanced customer touch points, new products, better and more customized services and greater market penetration with a focus on the corporate and rural segments. MBSL has also been cognisant of the importance of ensuring operational stability and has renewed a 3-year collective agreement with its employees’ union on January 16, 2017, laying the groundwork for smooth rollout of its three-year growth strategy. A key component of the company’s strategic blue print for future growth will be a modern core banking system, which will provide a significant technology boost for all operational aspects. Currently in the implementation stage, the technology overhaul within the company will see all internal processes becoming automated, contributing significant cost savings, together with speed, efficiency and productivity gains for the company and its customers. The new IT system will come into full operation towards mid-2017 further enhancing customer value.
