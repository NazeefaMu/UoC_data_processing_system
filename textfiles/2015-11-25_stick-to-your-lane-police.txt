The traffic lane law would be strictly implemented starting today especially along the Sri Jayewardenepura Road from Jayanthipura to Colombo, the Police said yesterday.
Police Spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said extra Police officers would be deployed to oversee that the law was being implemented and that drivers follow the rule from 6 a.m. today.
“The law will also be implemented on the entrance roads to Colombo. We expect to file cases against those who drive carelessly neglecting the traffic lane law and also jaywalkers. We will file more cases in court against these people with intention of reducing traffic and road accidents,” he said.
