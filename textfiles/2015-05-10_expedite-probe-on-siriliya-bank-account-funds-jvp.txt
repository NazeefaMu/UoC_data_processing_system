The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today urged the government authorities to question former first lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa immediately on the misuse of Siriliya Bank account funds.
There are allegations of misuse of funds in the bank account of Siriliya programme and several persons involved in them have been questioned so far.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the former first lady should also be questioned. He said this should be done as she was the head of this programme.
He also said an investigation has to be done on the death of a Rugby player at Isipathana Mawatha as there are evidence to suggest that it could be a murder.
Mr. Dissanayake who defended the setting up of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) said as this division was set up as there had been serious financial crimes in the country in the past.
He said new investigation divisions or institutions have to be set up when the need arises. Citing examples, he said a Terrorist Investigation Unit was set up when terrorism began in this country while the Narcotics Bureau was set up after narcotic drugs started coming in. (YP)
