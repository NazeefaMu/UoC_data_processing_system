Celebrating birthday at no cost


	



 

The top cop in the Western province celebrated his birthday on a grand scale, they say.

 


He was inundated with gift parcels containing various valuable items and there were food and drink too in plenty supplied by the well-wishers themselves.


As the high-up had informed all stations in his area about the important event on time, his subordinates had arrived in a long stream carrying gift parcels which he had later sent to his residence.


The well-wishers who were seen in small groups chatting to one another were in general agreement that making offerings to appease those above them was something they had to do for their own good.
