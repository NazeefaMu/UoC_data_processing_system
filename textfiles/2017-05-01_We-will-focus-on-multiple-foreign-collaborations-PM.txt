A new port will soon be constructed North of the present Colombo Port with Japanese assistance along with several other projects, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.

Addressing the United National Party (UNP) May Day Rally at Campbell Park last evening, the Prime Minister said Japan and India would assist Sri Lanka to construct a floating natural gas storage in the sea.

“Sri Lanka will go in for a joint venture with India to develop the oil tank farm in Trincomalee. There will be a huge demand for oil in a few years and Sri Lanka will be the main supplier. Sri Lanka will get both storage fees in addition to a huge profit share. Thailand and India will assist in setting up industrial zones in the South, West and the East. This is what we have already begun to do," he said.

Outlining several UNP proposals aimed at enhancing the living standards of the people, the Premier said some 6000 items would be exported to Europe after gaining the GSP+ facility..

The proposals read by Public Administration Minister Ranjith Maduma Bandara included ending of political victimization, empowering and giving women more opportunities to engage in politics, providing employment to graduates and the youth, providing technology know-how to school children and ensuring a 13-year education and providing lands and houses to all citizens.

Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the lease period of the Trincomalee oil tanks would be limited to only 20 years. "The opposition is alleging that we are selling the oil tanks when we are only going to lease them out for 20 years" he said.

Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said the coalition government of the UNP and the SLFP would continue beyond 2020.

"We will not allow the Rajapaksas to come into power once again," he said. He said opportunities that are available for development should be made use of at least now unlike in the past where the development was sabotaged.

Health Minister Rajith a Senaratne said all corrupt individuals in the previous government including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be penalized before next year’s May Day rally.

Minister Senaratne said the President had decided to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka for the purpose of probing corruption. “Some including Minister John Seneviratne was panicking when this was published. People such as Mr. Seneviratne are the ones living on the fence with one foot with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the other foot with President Maithripala Sirisena,” he said.

He also said trade unions and others have taken an upper hand today as both the President and the Prime Minister were too lenient.

Field Marshal Sarath Foneseka, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim and Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa also addressed the gathering. (Yohan Perera)
