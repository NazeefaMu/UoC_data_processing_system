National Food Production Plan to be introduced on October 5

The National Food Production Plan 2016-2018 will be introduced to the country by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 5 from Iranamadu, Jaffna, said Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said the Agriculture Ministry has already taken measures to implement this programme through provincial and district level programmes.
He was addressing the Provincial Agriculture Minister's Meeting at Hotel Blue Waters, Wadduwa recently.
"We are already aware of the importance of preparing a National Agricultural Policy. Through an Agricultural Policy, the state and private sectors would be able to work together under a common plan to achieve future development goals," the minister said.
He also said the absence of a proper nation-wide crop planning programme has resulted in various issues relating to the price and the availability of agricultural products.
"Abundant food production is good for consumers. But yielding the same crop in the same season could bad affected the well-being of farmers, as they cannot get a good price for their produce. But, if we can work under a proper cultivation plan, we will be able to protect both farmers and consumers" the minister said. He further added that the main objective of introducing the National Food Production Plan is to strengthen national economic growth through national food production. The programme cannot be implemented within a day.
"We have to work under short term, long term and medium term plans to realize this goal.Each and every employer of the agriculture sector should be dedicated to supporting this national programme and enhance food production to save a large amount of money that is spent for food imports.
