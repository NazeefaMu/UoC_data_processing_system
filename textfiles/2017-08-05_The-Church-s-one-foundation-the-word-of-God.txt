The Church’s one foundation: the word of God


	



 

Sri Lanka’s cream of singing voices gathered from leading Christian school choirs and sang in unison of God’s wonder in the presence of over 1,500 at the Cathedral of Christ the Living Saviour for a worthy cause-the Education Fund for the less privileged children. 


Raising their voices, feeling the presence of Jesus Christ with feel of the Holy Spirit, feel for one another, feel of compassion, feel of spiritual love and the feel of oneness, the youngsters and the not so young, poured out of their hearts to the wondrous conducting of the popular De Lanerolle brother, who spared no pain to make it a success. 


They were joined by Organists Dr. Jonathan Clarke (London) Neranjan de Silva (Sri Lanka) and Battista Prada (Italy) as Orchestra Conductor. 


In between the programme, the Vicar of the Cathedral, Ven. Perry Brohier made a brief appearance to thank and praise the magnanimity of all who thronged to make the event a great success. He thanked all for their dedication and commitment.


After the heavenly strains died down and a sense of spirituality prevailed, the Lord Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. Delo Canagasaby wound up the evening’s praise to the Lord, when everyone sat to listen in 
pin-drop silence.


In his usual style delivered with simplicity and clarity, the Bishop emphasised on the unfinished Word of God. 


Step by step he led us on the unfinished journey towards its spiritual meaning and when ready to complete his mission, he said:-


“This church represents the symbol of God and therein lies His deliverance, His word. This is where he abides until he is ready for our ultimate salvation and when the time is right, it will be wholesome. No danger, no fear within but as strong as his word: Beautiful Home he has prepared for all his followers, all Christians: As his children we have to have faith in his word.”


Many times when I worshipped at the Cathedral, my eyes strayed around the massive structure of the church, so imposing in all grandeur and architecture. Strong and steadfast but not complete and why the church is not putting to right where it matters: The dripping and dried cement flow from its columns, the need of plaster in many places, the dome half opened to the sky and many more 
unfinished work.


The more I looked at them, the more puzzled I became, but forgot the issue when I Left the church. Did the church have no money to complete it? And the Bishop had the answer.


Then it dawned on me as I listened to our shepherd when he spoke of the unfinished work of God like our church, the walls though strong, have to wait. They represent and remind us of our long wait for salvation until He is ready.


That evening I got the answer of the incomplete church that had puzzled me. Bishop Canagasaby is the Father, the gentle and genial shepherd to all Christians no matter to what Christian sect one belongs as he look upon one and all with infinite, undivided love for all as well as for non- Christians in trouble, who seek compassion and strong and sturdy as his , this towering Cathedral where God abides.

 

How great Thou Art
De Lanerolle Brothers
O Lord my God , when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds thy hand have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed:

Choir –
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to thee
How great thou art, 
Great thou art
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to thee
How great thou art, 
How great thou art.
(GH)
