Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader R. Sampanthan today urged Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran to take early remedial action in regard to the two ministers who were not found guilty by the board of Inquire of the chief minister.

In a letter to Mr. Vigneswaran, the TNA Leader said the board of inquiry conducted investigations in respect of the four council ministers but only two ministers have been found guilty and two others have not been found guilty.

"You stated in the Provincial Council that you would act on the basis of the report of the board of inquiry. You have called for the resignations of the two ministers found guilty. No one has complained about that decision.The complaint is about the action taken by you against the other two ministers in regard to whom there is no finding of guilt by the board of inquiry. This action is being seen as a violation of the principles of natural justice and unwarranted," the MP said.

The letter sent by the TNA Leader

16.06.2017

Hon.  Justice CV  Wigneswaran,
Chief Minister Northern Province

My Dear Wignes,

Thank you for your letter of 14.06.2017 with copy of speech made by you.

I wish to state the following. The board of inquiry appointed by you conducted investigations in respect of four ministers. The inquiry had been concluded and their report submitted to you. Two have been found guilty and two others have not been found guilty.

You stated in the Provincial Council that you would act on the basis of the report of the board of inquiry.

You have called for the resignations of the two ministers found guilty. No one has complained about that decision.

The complaint is about the action taken by you against the other two ministers in regard to whom there is no finding of guilt by the board of inquiry. This action is being seen as a violation of the principles of natural justice and unwarranted.

I called you on Tuesday the 13th to convey to you that such action could be resisted by the two ministers not found guilty and the members of the provincial council and suggested caution.

I also expressed concern that while you had been in touch with the other leaders of constituent parties in the Tamil National Alliance you had not discussed this matter with Hon. Mavai Senathirajah Member of Parliament and Leader of the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK).  You have called him later in the day and he had conveyed to you that action should not be taken against Ministers not found guilty.

On Wednesday the 14th  you announced punitive action even against the two ministers who had not been found guilty.  Whatever that happened thereafter was as a result of your aforesaid action.

It is my view that to bring things to an end it is necessary to first take remedial action pertaining to the two ministers who have not been found guilty.

Unwarranted action should not be the cause for promoting disunity and disturbing the functioning of the Northern Provincial Council.

I would urge you to take early remedial action in regard to the two ministers not found guilty by your board of inquiry. This would not deter you from holding any further inquiry.

Sincerely,

R. Sampanthan
Leader of the Tamil National Alliance
