Media should highlight political speeches of substance - Gayantha

 
The media has a significant role to play by highlighting political speeches of substance rather than giving prominence to mud slinging speeches, Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.

The Dean of the Moratuwa University ICT Faculty Dr.Lochandaka Ranathunga was the key-note speaker at the event organized by the Parliamentary Journalists’ Association.
“Once I congratulated a MP in Parliament for the fine speech he made in the House,” Minister Karunathilake said.
“But, he told me that it was pointless in making such speeches in Parliament as the media does not give prominence to them. He also said if he had spoken in a derogatory manner against a MP, it would have been highlighted in the media,” Minister Karunathilake said.
He added that plans are afoot to set up housing schemes in all districts for provincial media personnel. He also added that they to meet the journalists in North during the tour to Jaffna on March 25 to 27.
The minister further said that three houses are to be granted to the members of the families of the deceased media personnel in Jaffna. He added that the ITN, Rupavahini and the Lake House (ANCL) has promised to construct these houses while the Derana Institute promised to provide welfare facilities to those family members.
Moratuwa University ICT Faculty Dr.Lochandaka Ranathunga said that with the development of technology, digital news has surpassed the newspapers and the radio.
