Provincial Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday said the entire family of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should be imprisoned because they have committed many crimes and frauds.

“From what I know and according to my opinion, everyone in the Rajapaksa family should go in. All the family members and the brothers of Rajapaksa have done crimes, frauds and committed murders. They should not just be remanded but imprisoned,” he said responding to a journalist during a news conference held at his ministry.
