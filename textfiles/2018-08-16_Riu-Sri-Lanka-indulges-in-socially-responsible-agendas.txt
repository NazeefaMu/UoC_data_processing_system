Riu Sri Lanka indulges in socially responsible agendas


	



Riu Sri Lanka, the country’s largest all-inclusive resort with a stunning 501 rooms, recently held a tree planting and beach cleaning programme as part of its social and community responsible activities. The resort is ambitious and confident to actively take part in a number of similar initiatives in future. 
One of the greatest problems that the world is facing today is environmental pollution, which is occurring on a vast and unprecedented scale around the globe. Thankfully many individuals, organizations and businesses are choosing to help out by putting a percentage of their time and profits aside. 

Riu Sri Lanka with a motive to contribute to a ‘cleaner and greener’ environment focuses on two major challenges- air pollution and water pollution, and strongly believes in giving back to the local community. The hotel planted many king-coconut trees along the shore with the participation of government officials, staffs and locals. Planting trees undoubtedly produce clean air, reduce carbon, and provide shelter to birds and other wildlife.

The hotel also recently spent a whole day together with its staffs in a beach cleaning activity with unlimited food and beverage spread out at the shore, and surprisingly many of their guests volunteered for this worthy cause too. Tons and tons of rubbish especially plastic find its way into the world’s oceans every year and it is causing significant threat to marine life and sea birds. Riu Sri Lanka managed to collect a total of around 126kgs of trash on that day with plastic accounting to over 30kgs. 

With the privilege of being the first and only all-inclusive hotel in the island and probably the largest resort with 501 rooms, the five-star rated Riu Sri Lanka is the ideal destination for a family break, an unforgettable honeymoon or a holiday with friends. In fact, right now is the best moment for locals to book the ‘Riu experience’ since the hotel has excellent rates with a 30pct discount and kids stay free up to 5 years old, and from 6 to 12, they only pay 25pct of the rate (riu.com, reservations.srilanka@riu.com or 0 915 22 00 22)
