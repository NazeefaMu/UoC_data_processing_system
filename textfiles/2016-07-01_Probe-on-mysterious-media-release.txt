The Government Information Department’s Director General Ranga Kalansooriya today said a probe has been launched under the directives of Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka and Secretary Nimal Bopage on the release of a media statement without the approval of a high ranking official.  

A media statement on the appointment of the next Central Bank Governor under the letter-head of the Government Information Department was issued earlier today.

However, Dr. Kalansooriya said the statement was false and they had already launched an investigation to find out how a statement under the letter-head of the Department was issued without the signature of his or any other high ranking official.
