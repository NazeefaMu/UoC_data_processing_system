Due to the impending construction of a four-lane fly over spanning 533 metres in Welikada Rajagiriya, the Road Development Authority (RDA) warned of congestions in the area commencing today.

Vehicular traffic will have to use alternate routes on the Jayawardhanapura Road, in Welikada Rajagiriya, due to do certain lanes being closed for traffic until December 2017, the RDA said.

Meanwhile, the Expressway Operation Maintenance & Management (EOM & M) Division yesterday requested the public to not to fly kites in the area near to the expressways.

They said several reports had been reported relating to difficulties faced by expressway vehicle drivers because of flying kites.

The Director of the EOM & M Division S. Opanayaka said he requested parents to advise their children to not to fly kites near expressways.

“People used to fly kites in the areas near the expressways such as Kadawatha, Athurugiriya, Gelanigama,” he said.

“Most of the accidents occur due to the sudden fall of kites on to vehicles,” Mr. Opanayaka said.
