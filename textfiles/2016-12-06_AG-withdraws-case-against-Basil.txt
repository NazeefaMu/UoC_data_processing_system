AG withdraws case against Basil


	

The Attorney General today withdrew the indictment filed in Colombo High Court against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawake over the Rs. 29 million alleged misappropriation taken place in the printing and distribution of New Year almanacs using Divi Neguma funds.

Senior State Counsel Sudharshana de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed court that due to a technical legal reason the indictments filed against the accused needed to be withdrawn.

According to the prosecution, when the indictment was served on the accused earlier, the Attorney General had not tendered the ‘consent letter’ with the indictments in court.

Senior State Counsel also said that the Attorney General would serve the indictments on the matter again in due course after correcting the technical legal fault.

Subsequently, Colombo High Court Judge Pathmini N. Ranawaka discharged former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former Director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawake over the case in which they were indicted on charges of misappropriation.

And consequently, all the orders given by the Court against accused pertaining to this particular case, including travel bans, now would be nullified. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
