SL Navy’s Southern Command moving to Hambantota – PM office


	

The Prime Minister office today said that the Sri Lanka Navy is moving its Southern Command to Hambantota.

Issuing a statement over a media report regarding Prime Minister’s speech made at the Dr. Saman Kelegama memorial conference held on Friday in Colombo, the PM office said that at this conference the Prime Minister stated that he negotiated with Prime Minister Li and President Xi of China and came up with a proposal which was beneficial for both parties. 

“Sri Lanka also informed the Chinese that Hambantota cannot be used for military purposes. The Sri Lanka Navy is moving its Southern Command to Hambantota. There is no need to be frightened as security of the port will be under the control of Sri Lanka Navy.”


“Once an American has asked him, “what would you do if the Chinese troops land in Hambantota”. The Prime Minister has responded saying that there is a full army division stationed at Hambantota. The Prime Minister never mentioned that we will not be resisting any invasion. Further, no Navy in the region has the capacity to land an army division in Sri Lanka,” the statement said.


As far as Hambantota port is concerned it will only be a commercial port which will trigger off much needed economic development of backward districts of Hambantota and Moneragala very soon, it added.
