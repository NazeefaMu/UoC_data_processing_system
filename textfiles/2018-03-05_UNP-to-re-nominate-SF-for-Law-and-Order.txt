The United National Party (UNP) has reportedly decided to re-nominate Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as Law and Order Minister, it is learnt.

When the UNP nominated him to the post the first time it was turned down by President Maithripala Sirisena. Thereafter, the UNP sought to assign the subject to another member of the party but no one was ready to accept it.

Against this backdrop, the party had taken a decision to re-submit his name to the President. Already, SLFP ministers had been against appointing Mr. Fonseka to this post a sentiment shared by many senior police officers.(Kelum Bandara)
