Truffles sell out to enthusiastic food lovers

Waters Edge together with its food and wine consultant Leonardo Ricci and Italian culinary maestro Chef Simone Gobbo showcased the classic white truffle in a series of authentic dishes at the recently concluded Truffles & Truffles promotion.
The special evening featuring rare White Truffles dubbed by many as the most expensive ingredient in the kitchen was held at The Link, Waters Edge.
The event hosted by Waters Edge General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle was sold out to selected high profile guests who have a keen interest on gastronomic delights from around the world.
Truffles paired with the Perfect Vines
The menu put together by maestro Chef Simone included dishes like poached eggs served with white truffle, pumpkin soup, baby lobster with white truffle shavings, Prosecco and casatella D'Altamarca risotto, slow cooked beef cheek tenderloin, leeks foam and crushed potatoes with black truffles and passion fruit meringue, vanilla bavarois, almond and candied fruit sponge topped with white truffles for dessert. To add a touch of class to the evening, Sommelier and Consultant Leonardo Ricci with his refined knowledge of fine wines coupled all the dishes with the right accompaniments.

White truffles which are extremely rare and found in select regions of Italy were specially shipped down by Waters Edge ensuring that local guests had a truly gourmand experience. The wines for the night were supplied by Global Brands.
