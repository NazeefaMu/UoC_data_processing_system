Nearly 90 per cent of the drugs recovered are known to find their way back to the market, Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne told a news conference today.

He said they should be burnt publicly as done in several countries worldwide. When asked whether the recently recovered haul of cocaine had been released into the market, the deputy minister said as far as he was aware it had not happened but such things had taken place in the past.(Yohan Perera)
