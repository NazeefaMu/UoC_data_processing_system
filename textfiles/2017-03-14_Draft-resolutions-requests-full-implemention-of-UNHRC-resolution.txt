A follow-up draft resolution titled ‘Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka’ had been submitted to the ongoing 34th session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) by five main sponsor nations on Monday requesting the Government of Sri Lanka to fully implement the measures identified in UNHRC resolution 30/1 of 1 October 2015.

The resolution; A/HRC/34/L.1, which was submitted by Montenegro, Macedonia, UK, Northern Ireland and US, welcomed the steps taken by Sri Lanka to implement resolution 30/1.

For further significant progress, the resolution requested the Office of the High Commissioner and relevant special procedure mandate holders, in consultation with and with the concurrence of the Government of Sri Lanka, to strengthen their advice and technical assistance on the promotion and protection of human rights and truth, justice, reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.

Reaffirming that it is the responsibility of each State to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of its entire population, the resolution requested the Office of the High Commissioner to continue to assess progress on the implementation of its recommendations and other relevant processes related to reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, and to present a written update to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-seventh session, and a comprehensive report followed by discussion on the implementation of resolution 30/1 at its fortieth session.

The resolution welcomed the positive engagement between Sri Lanka and the High Commissioner since October 2015, as well as the relevant special procedure mandate holders, and encourages the continuation of that engagement in the promotion and protection of human rights and truth, justice, reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka.

It also reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s commitment to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity.
