Joining a people's struggle my favoured option-Wiggy


	

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran said yesterday he would most favour quitting politics and joining a people’s movement to struggle for the rights of Tamils.

Mr.Wigneswaran told Daily Mirror yesterday that he had four options and joining a people’s movement would be what he favoured most.

Total retirement from politics, formation of a new party and joining another existing party are the other three options he mentioned.

Asked whether he had met with Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Leader

R. Sampanthan to discuss policy issues, he said he could not do so as planned. He said the meeting could take place after Mr.Sampanthan returns from a trip overseas.

He said following critical remarks made by him to the media there appears to have been a further polarization that had taken place within the TNA. (Kelum Bandara)
