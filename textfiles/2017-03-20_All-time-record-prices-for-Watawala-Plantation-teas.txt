At this week’s tea auction, the invoices from Abbotsleigh Estate and Carolina Estate in the Hatton region achieved an all-time Colombo tea auction record price of Rs.670 and Rs.660 per kilogramme, respectively for a PF1 grade in the CTC High and Medium category, respectively. 
These two invoices were purchased by M/S. Uni World Teas (Pvt.) Ltd on behalf of its overseas client. 
These two plantations practice good manufacturing techniques to ensure that a top-quality product is maintained whilst preserving worker prosperity, so stated the estate Managers Mahinda Ranaweera and Prasanna Premachandra. 
These teas were sold through the catalogues of M/S. Lanka Commodity Brokers Ltd. These plantations come under the purview of Watawala Plantations PLC, whose parent company is Sunshine Holdings PLC.
