Ajith's revenge saga rakes Rs 27.5 crores in two days!

The release of an Ajith film is always celebrated as a festival by fans. And with Vedalam's release coinciding with Diwali this year, the craze around the film is sky high and the response has been earth shattering.
On Day 1, Ajith's Vedalam set the box office on fire by becoming the biggest opener in Tamil Nadu beating Rajinikanth's Lingaa and Vijay's Kaththi. After minting Rs 15.5 crore on Day 1, the film managed to mesmerise audience on Day 2 too. On the second day, Vedalam raked approximately Rs 12 crore making its grand box office total as Rs 27.5 crore.
Senior journalist and trade expert Sreedhar Pillai said, "It has broken all records. He has a huge fan base and he could well be the superstar in the making although there are few others in the race."
Despite of having to compete with Kamal Haasan's Thoongaavanam, Ajith's Vedalam has managed to surpass extraordinary box office figures. With a long weekend ahead, Vedalam seems set to cross Rs 50 crore mark soon. But will Vedalam manage to join last year's Diwali release Kaththi in Rs 100 crore club? Lets wait and watch.
