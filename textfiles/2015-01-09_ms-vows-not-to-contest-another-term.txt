	Taking oaths as the 6th Executive President of Sri Lanka at the Independence Square, President Maithripala Sirisena today vowed not to contest for a second term.

President Sirisena stressed the need to revise the country’s foreign policy by strengthening friendly diplomatic relations with all countries and organisations. 
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday pledged to implement what he pledged in his 100-day programme as published in his election manifesto and presented to the entire country.
Addressing the nation soon after taking oaths before Senior Supreme Court Judge K. Sripavan, President Sirisena said he had to endure many difficulties, challenges and obstacles during his election campaign and the time was now right to introduce an enlightened political culture to the country.  
He said no other presidential candidate had been subjected to such a hate campaign carried out by the state media. He recalled the violence that was unleashed in several parts of the country including the Kahawatta shooting that killed one of his supporters. 
Quoting the words of the Buddha he said that whatever might have happened, he had no hatred in his heart and mind.
He also thanked outgoing President Mahinda Rajapaksa for arranging a peaceful transition of power. The event was attended by United National Party (UNP) leaders, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and leaders of all other political parties that supported the common opposition candidate.(Sandun A.
