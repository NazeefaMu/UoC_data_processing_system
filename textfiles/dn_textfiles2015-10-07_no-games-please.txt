Each story has a reason, hers too
No games please!

Parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra believes everything happens for a reason. A self- confessed workaholic she admits that she is passionate about what she does. Over the years she has grown into a charismatic and highly popular politician. The Daily News brings to you this young lady who has won the trust of the people.
Student life
Hirunika went to Visakha Vidyalaya from Grade 1, and did her A/L in the Arts Stream. She followed political science, logic and economics. She got 2 As and 1 C and got selected to the Arts Faculty in Colombo University. But being passionate about politics and law she went to Kingston University in the UK and did her LLB there and completed her LLB in 2010.
"I am doing a Forensic Science and Forensic Medicine diploma. This is because my major is criminal. I am thinking of doing that and criminal law together, then it is easy for me to practice after my politics, because I feel that politics and all this fame won't last long. The education we have gained will last long. Maybe after politics if I don't have this fame anymore and power anymore I can switch into doing law and that is my plan," said Hirunika
Twist
Her father took care of everything in the household. Hirunika was very naïve at the time of his death. "I remember after we got the electricity bill my mom asked me: 'where should I pay this?' We didn't even know where the bill should be paid! We didn't even have that kind of knowledge! My father did everything. The only thing my mom had to do is to cook and be a good wife. And all I had to do was study! From being such a spoiled girl and then becoming this responsible woman took very little time because I always knew I had that responsibility within me. So I took the responsibility of head of the house."
Realized dreams
Hirunika says that everything happens for a reason. She is where she is now because she has overcome her challenges and achieved her goals. Getting into politics was one of her dreams and it has become a reality.
In the UK she worked as a nanny. Her father told her he would pay only for her education and not for her accommodation and expenses. So once she went abroad, she worked as a nanny to an autistic child and she worked in the library as well.
True story
She came back to Sri Lanka in 2010. In 2011 there was an advertisement in the paper for Ms. Sri Lanka and her mother applied on Hirunika's behalf. Subsequently Hirunika received a letter asking her to come for the interview. Her father saw the letter and he was really upset.
"He asked me if I were really serious about politics. And I said yes. And he said if I am serious about politics better not to go for this competition. And I asked him why? He said that in these competitions they take different pictures in different outfits and you will have to pose for them. So he told me that people will take those pictures and turn them against you.
And I was laughing and asked him if he was serious and told him that this is the 21st century. Anyhow I went to the competition and I was the Ms. Sri Lanka for Ms. International, and I was supposed to contest for Ms. International Competition on October 19. My father got killed on October 8. And after his assassination the media threw my pictures everywhere on the Internet saying that I was a model and based on one of the pictures they tried to say that I was a very bad person."
Love story
Hirunika and Hiran got to know each other a year ago. He was in an on and off relationship. And he was not sure about that. And then it broke up. Having talked to each other, they got connected as they had a very good relationship as friends. After a while Hiran said that he had feelings for Hirunika. By that time she was also really fond of him. They are Buddhist s and the horoscopes matched.
After schooling she had a boyfriend. And he is the one who she was supposed to get married to. And after her father's death it broke off. Hirunika believes that if something is not meant to be it is not meant to be. She went on a few dates, lunches and dinners but nothing serious happened. Many guys asked her out, but she never gave them a word. But when Hiran asked her out, she knew that this was it!! She now has a wonderful husband. "I am so glad I found him because he is the perfect match for me."
Serious thoughts
Hirunika believes that when getting married, it is not about how big your wedding is. It is how you love each other and how you treat each other and respect each other. Hiran too is likeminded when it comes to this. They both wanted the relationship to be very secretive. They wanted to invite well- wishers who are the family and relatives, cousins and friends.
Communication is their formula for a successful marriage. They take a lot of time to talk to each other. Hirunika says that this physical attraction will go away in a few years. She says at the end of the day it is all about communicating and that most couples split up because of lack of communication. "We always manage to eat at least one meal at home because we both are busy. So all these things strengthen our relationship. As a wife I have a dream of having a lot of kids and my husband loves kids as well."
Do not play games with her!
Straightforwardness is her defining attribute. She learnt early that women have to learn to say 'NO' to people who are asking for advantages. Hirunika always makes sure that she is very clear about what she says. Most people may think she is very rude, but actually it is not rudeness at all, it is just that she is very straightforward.
Hirunika is a true friend to those who are genuine with her. But do not play games with this lady! She hates liars and cheats.
Leaders whom she admires!
Hirunika admires mainly four leaders. She admires Margaret Thatcher, who like Hirunika was very straightforward and who did well in her roles as woman, wife, mother and a ruler.
She calls President Maithripala Sirisena one of the most intelligent leaders in history having achieved his goals without violence. She believes we can learn patience from the Prime Minister and that as a politician 'patience' is the main thing. And she admires Martin Luther King for his humanity.
Passion for reading!
Hirunika likes to read adventures and thrillers. At the moment she is reading a book called 'Blink.' It is about how you face life and its challenges, written by Malcolm Gladwell.
Her favorite singer is Adele, and she likes the song 'Set fire in the rain.' She listens to all of Adele's music saying that the songs have a soothing effect. She listens to a lot of Sinhala music and she also likes Michael Buble and Maroon 5.
Movie fan
She has been watching Hindi movies from the age of 10! And from the English movies she thinks 'Gone girl' is amazing which she recommends for any woman saying it is very intense.
Success Tips
Hirunika advises the youth never to give up on education. She feels that you have to learn how to change this country. Her message is that the youth have to get together to change this country. The youth need to learn how to care about other people and always stand up for the truth. People trusted her. They gave her the chance to become a provincial counselor and now a parliamentarian. In conclusion Hirunika wants to keep that trust forever saying that most politicians fail because of the lack of accountability and that you have to have that transparency with people.
