Minister to address SLTB workers' grievances

Officers and employees of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) should be brought to one platform to address their grievances, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said. He said so during a meeting with SLTB employees recently.
There are 36,000 employees in the SLTB with a ratio of six employees to one bus. The workers will be protected only if the SLTB is protected.
Workers must work hard to make it profitable," the minister said.
