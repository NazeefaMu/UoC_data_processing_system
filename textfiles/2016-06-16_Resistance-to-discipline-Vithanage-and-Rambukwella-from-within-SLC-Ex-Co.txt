Resistance to discipline Vithanage and Rambukwella from within SLC Ex-Co


	

Sri Lanka Cricket which is pressing for disciplinary action against Kithuruwan Vithanage and Ramith Rambukwella over their late night brawl with a group of people at a hotel in Battaramulla has received strong resistance from a group people within the cricket executive committee.   

Vithanage and Rambukwella were both named in the Sri Lanka A squad for the forthcoming series against England but SLC wanted both to be withdrawn on disciplinary grounds after their recent off-field frolics. SLC sources said they would be withdrawn from the tour.   

However, an administrator with a strong connection to one of the players and also a member of the national selection committee have vehemently opposed the SLC decision to withdraw both from the tour.    “These people certainly have vested interests and wants these two in the team. But there’s a serious case of misconduct and we need to deal it before it’s too late,” SLC sources said. 

SLC disciplinary committee which met on Tuesday night issued a ‘show cause letter’ to Vithanage who was present at the inquiry but his partner in crime Rambukwella had not been present saying he had not received a letter.   

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday denied rumours that skipper Angelo Mathews engaged in a heated argument with chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya and Coach Graham Ford over the axing of all-rounder Milinda Siriwardane from the limited over side to face Ireland and England. Siriwardane was sent back home at the conclusion of the three match Test series against England despite a decent record in limited over cricket. Sources say Mathews was unhappy with selectors’ decision to axe him and had confronted the chief selector at the dressing room at the end of the Lord’s match.
