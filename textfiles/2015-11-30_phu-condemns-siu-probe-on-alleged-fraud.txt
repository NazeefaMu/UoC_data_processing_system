PHU condemns SIU probe on alleged fraud


	

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya today condemned the manner in which the Police Special Investigation Unit (SIU) was investigating the fraud alleged to have been committed by PHU General Secretary Udaya Gammanpila.
It said two SIU officers had been sent to Australia, the country of residence of businessman Brian Chaddick, to carry out their investigations into the fraud. Mr. Chaddick had earlier alleged that he had been deprived of assets and interest worth Rs.110 million because of a fraud committed by Mr. Gammanpila.
“When officials of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) visited ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa's residence in Mirihana to record a  statement on a matter concerning the ITN TV station, the so-called Yahapalanaya government’s supporters were disappointed and condemned the move.
How can the government then justify the decision to send SIU officers to another country to obtain a statement with regard to an investigation into a matter linked to Mr. Gammanpila? These all are well planned moves to take revenge on him. I am certain that these actions are being carried out under the guidance of a particular Cabinet Minister who is imagining he can destroy Mr. Gammanpila’s political career,” PHU Media Secretary Thushara Dissanayake said.
