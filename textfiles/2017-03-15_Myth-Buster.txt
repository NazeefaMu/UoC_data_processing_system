BUSTED: “When you have a nosebleed, you should sit up and bring your head forward in order to spit out blood. When you hold your head back, there is no effect and when you lie down it is worse. Holding your head back makes the blood flow into your throat and you can swallow it, which is dangerous, as you can choke. Some common instances where you can experience nosebleeds include picking your nose with your fingernails or when children put foreign objects inside. Drugs and alcohol are also a cause. A high intake of alcohol can cause a platelet problem; platelet dysfunction doesn’t allow the blood to clot. Platelet problems also appear when one has dengue fever which can also cause nosebleeds. Another cause is humus, which is not visible from the outside. It is visible only when we examine them.”
