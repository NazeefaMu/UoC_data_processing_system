Healthcare services in hospitals countrywide came to standstill today because of the 24-hour strike launched by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.

GMOA Secretary Naveen de Zoysa told a media briefing that all state medical officers including ayurvedic doctors, dental and veterinary surgeons stopped work from 8.00 a.m. today to 8.00 a.m. tomorrow.

“Doctors would not engage in private practice till next morning. Members of other trade unions held demonstrations and protest marches in several parts of the country,” he said and added that if the government continues to remain silent even after this strike, the GMOA would in future, harness all trade unions, and launch a massive strike which would affect all service sectors in the country.
