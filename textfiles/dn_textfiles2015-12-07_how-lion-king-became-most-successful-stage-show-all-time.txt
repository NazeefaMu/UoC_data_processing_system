How The Lion King: Became The Most Successful Stage Show Of All Time

The Lion King celebrates its 15th anniversary at London's Lyceum Theatre with a flurry of remarkable statistics swirling around it. This is the highest-grossing stage show in history, having already grossed some £3.8 billion globally - more than the previous record-holder Phantom of the Opera. Or, to place it in a broader context, more than the combined global revenues of the six most popular Harry Potter films.
But does The Lion King still speak to our times? Has it retained its power and visual majesty over the years, or is it now more of an obligatory staging post for foreign tourists to London?
At the weekend I took my seat feeling faintly unnerved by another statistic: since its opening at the Lyceum in 1999, 12 million people, no less, have done precisely the same thing.
I was keeping my expectations in check. Musicals do not always date well. I looked in on Phantom of the Opera a second time for professional reasons in 2004, when the ill-judged film version was released. It was 18 years after its original London opening, and a dispiriting evening; it felt clapped out and past its sell-by date.
I also wondered if anything could replicate the sheer sense of slack-jawed awe at seeing the astonishing opening of The Lion King for the first time. Set to percussive African rhythms, it features gigantic elephants tramping down the aisles, joining other animals on stage. These inventively designed creatures are propelled by actors: on stilts as giraffes, astride a bicycle device from which antelopes prance gracefully, holding long bendy poles with high-flying birds on their end.
The huge shimmering saffron sun rises over an unmistakably African plain, and Pride Rock, from where the lions survey their kingdom, rises like a corkscrew from beneath the stage. The scene has remarkable visceral power. It's rooted in the collective nature of the experience; all around you, everyone else is gaping and holding their breath too.
Well, 15 years on, it still works brilliantly - as does the ensemble opening of the second act: One by One is sung by the ensemble cast with extraordinary drumming, which catapults the audience once more out of their surroundings.
It's easy to overlook, what with all the trumpeting of huge grosses and audience figures, what a radical piece of theatre The Lion King is, and always was.
Credit for this goes to the prime mover of this stage version, director Julie Taymor, who came from avant-garde, ritual and experimental theatre, and had already used masks and puppetry in other productions. Taymor also helped design the costumes for the Lion King, and even wrote the lyrics for one of its songs, Endless Night. She has created a world that is fiercely non-literal, often to moving and wondrous effect. She makes no attempt to disguise the fact that these animals are moved and performed by humans. A drought on the African plain is conveyed by a circle of blue silk gradually vanishing by being pulled through a hole in the stage. When a lioness weeps, she pulls lengths of white ribbon from her eyes. Taymor evokes a waterfall using a huge sheet of billowing silk. A score of actors stride on stage, boxes on their head with long grass sprouting from them; this is Taymor's way of representing the African savannah. All of which seems a long way from the animated film and video of The Lion King, which proved immensely successful for Disney in the 1990s. They're agreeable entertainments, based on a hero-myth story redolent of Hamlet. As a young lion cub, Simba is hoodwinked by his malevolent uncle Scar into believing he was responsible for his father the king Mufasa's death. Simba flees before returning as an adult to reclaim his birthright from Scar, who has installed himself as king.
This is all fine as far as it goes, yet there's a cosiness and reassurance about the film that Taymor withholds; in the stage version there is simply more at stake, along with a recognition that life is fragile. She also gave far greater emphasis to the film's female characters. There's a tough-mindedness about her method of story-telling; it's surprising that Disney, to its great credit, approved such a radical reboot of the film.
But it works superbly. The performances in the London production are outstanding, starting with Brown Lindiwe Mkhize as the extraordinary shaman-mandrill, Rafiki, a glowering, wildly strange presence with a singing voice that can shake the Lyceum's foundations. Shaun Escoffery and George Asprey both excel as, respectively, a kind-but-stern Mufasa and a slightly camp, Bill Nighy-esque Scar.
There's an amusing piece of stagecraft when the darting boy Simba (Ezrae Maye) leaps offstage and is immediately replaced by his muscular adult self (Jonathan Andrew Hume).
A comic element is supplied by a double act, John Hassler as Timon the meerkat and Keith Bookman as Pumbaa, a flatulent warthog, both of whom befriend and advise the young Simba. Delightfully, Frame adopts the persona of a Jewish-American stand-up comic, sardonically commenting on the action.
Second only to Taymor's vision, meanwhile, is the music of South African composer Lebo M, which makes the crucial difference between The Lion King's film and stage versions. He has augmented the serviceable original pop songs of Elton John and Tim Rice, creating new ones and rooting them in a distinctly African tradition.
We suspend disbelief when confronted with this version of Africa, and a story of eternal truths that makes specific period irrelevant. Ingeniously, The Lion King is brought to life in a space that is impervious to trends and fashion.
It will not date easily; indeed, one can imagine it still packing out the Lyceum 15 years from now.
