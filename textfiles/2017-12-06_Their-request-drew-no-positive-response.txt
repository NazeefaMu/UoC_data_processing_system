Three leading civil society activists who played a prominent role in the people’s movement for social justice largely responsible for ushering in yahapalanaya called on Number One the other day.

 


The trio explaining their mission appealed to Number One not to take   a drastic step following the unveiling of the report of the Treasury Bond Commission which, they pointed out, could lead to the fall of the yahapalanaya government. 


“Despite all shortcomings bedeviling yahapalanaya, it is much better than the previous regime. And it is your prime duty to ensure the continuity of yahapalanaya while rectifying its shortcomings,” the trio told Number One.


Number One gave the three activists an attentive hearing, but did not commit himself, informed sources say.
