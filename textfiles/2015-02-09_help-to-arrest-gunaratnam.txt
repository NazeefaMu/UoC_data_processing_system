	The Department of Immigration and Emigration has sought the assistance of state intelligence services to locate Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Central Committee Member Kumar Gunaratnam whose visa had expired ten days ago.
	Immigration sources said Gunaratnam arrived in Sri Lanka on January 1 on a 30-day tourist visa which expired on January 31 and since then he is said to be in hiding.
	Gunaratnam, a citizen of Australia, was summoned twice by the Department of Immigration to record statements about his involvement in local politics.
	Sources said the department had confiscated his passport and asked him to return before January 31, to be sent back to Australia but he did not show up and his whereabouts are not known.
	On Tuesday the department wrote to Police Chief N.K. Illangakoon requesting that Mr. Gunaratnam be arrested on sight. A special report was submitted to the Ministry of Public Order with regard to the progress of the inquiry.
	Meanwhile, FSP Political Affairs Committee Member Pubudu Jayagoda they had not received any official warning from the police about the arrest of their Leader Kumar Gunaratnam.  
	He said as such there was no question about Gunratnam surrendering but that his party would seek legal advice and take appropriate action if an official warning was given by the police.
	Mr. Jayagoda he said there won’t be any risk of his arrest in Australia in the event he returned there. (Kevin Kariyawasam and Yohan Perera)
