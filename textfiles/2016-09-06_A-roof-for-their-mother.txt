A roof for their mother


	



We live in a society where children abandon their parents by roadsides. In this backdrop, we heard a story of two Buddhist novice monks making bricks to build a permanent house for their sick mother in Aralaganwila, Dimbulagala. Their father has left the family when they were small and the mother was rendered homeless. Pix by Nimal Jayaratne
