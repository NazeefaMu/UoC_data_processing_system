Thirty five new MPs have requested semi-automatic pistols (instead of revolvers) of the type issued to ministers and senior MPs -- in a letter sent to the Parliament authorities.
These MPs, including 2 women, have signed a letter to say they should be provided with same type of 9mm pistols that are given to senior parliamentarians and the ministers, as .38 revolvers are obsolete.
35 (of the 61) first time MPs have sent applications for firearms under parliament members' privileges to the Ministry of Defence through the Parliament authorities.
The Defence Ministry had approved the issue of .38 revolvers to them and informed them of it through the Secretary General of Parliament
A two day training course, on October26 and 27, in the use of firearms, at the Police Special Task Force Training School in Kalutara had also been arranged for these MPs.
The Defence Ministry's letter had also asked them to collect the assigned revolvers from Police Field Force Headquarters prior to the training.
Parliamentary sources said the authorities had arranged to send the letter signed by the new MPs requesting for semi-automatic pistols to the Defence Ministry. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)
