Some legal experts are of the opinion that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not debarred from contesting the Presidential Election for the third time, it is learnt.

These legal experts believe though the 19th Amendment barred anyone from seeking the Presidency for the third time, it did not have retrospective effect.

That they believed, it did not apply to the past Presidents, who served two terms.

Therefore, they opine that Mr Rajapaksa had the legal eligibility to contest the Presidential polls if he is interested.

However, the Supreme Court has to give its opinion in this regard. For that purpose, it is likely that a voter will make a Fundamental Rights application to the Supreme Court in the future. (Kelum Bandara)
