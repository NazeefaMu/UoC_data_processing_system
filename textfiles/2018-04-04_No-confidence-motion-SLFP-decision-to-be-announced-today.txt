Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody said yesterday President Maithripala Sirisena requested all the MPs of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) serving in the government to take a common stand regarding the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

The President had a late night meeting with the SLFP Ministers and discussed the matters. Mr. Weerakkody told Daily Mirror the SLFP position would be announced this morning after another meeting at the residence of Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.

“The President asked the members to take a decision as a party rather than going by individual positions,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
