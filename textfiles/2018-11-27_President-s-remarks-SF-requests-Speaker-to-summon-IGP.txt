United National Party (UNP) MP Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka today requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon IGP Pujitha Jayasundara to Parliament within 48 hours, over the recent remarks made by the President with regard to the alleged assassination plot. 

The MP said President Maithripala Sirisena had recently said that ‘Sarath Fonseka’ was plotting to kill him.

“This is a serious allegation which raises privilege issues since I’m an MP. Therefore, I request you to summon the IGP to parliament within 48 hours to give answers to this. Either put me in jail or summon the IGP to parliament,” he said.
