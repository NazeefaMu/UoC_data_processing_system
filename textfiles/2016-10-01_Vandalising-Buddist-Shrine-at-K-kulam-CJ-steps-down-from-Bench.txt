Vandalising Buddist Shrine at K'kulam: CJ steps down from Bench


	

Chief Justice K. Sripavan yesterday declined to be a member of the Bench hearing the fundamental rights petition on the vandalisation of a Buddhist Shrine at Kanagarayankulam in Mankulam.

The Bench comprising the Chief Justice, Justices Buwaneka Aluvihara and K.T. Chitrasiri directed the petitioner to re-issue notice on the respondents indicating the date for support on October 24 for granting of leave to proceed.

The petitioner Dharshana Weraduwage had filed a fundamental rights petition seeking a comprehensive strategy to protect and foster the Buddha sasanaya against any future mischief, attack or threats.

It came in the backdrop of the incident of vandalism of the Buddhist shrine room.

Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, Law & Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray and the AG for President Maithripala Sirisena were cited as resposdents.
Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

The petitioner said this was not in any way an isolated incident and over the past few months or even before, there have been many constant demands of the removal of Buddhist Temples, Buddha Statues and shrines located especially in the Northern Province.

He is asking Court to rule that no one can be allowed to interfere negatively or act against the affairs of the Buddha Sasana except as provided for by the Constitution.

He is seeking Court to direct the respondents to take immediate action to investigate the incidents reported and to re-build, restore and refurbish all movable and immovable properties of the Buddhist Shrine. (S. Selvanayagam)
