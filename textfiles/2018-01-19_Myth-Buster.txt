MYTH: Eggs are bad for your heart.  

BUSTED: “The white of the egg contains protein while the yolk of the egg contains Vitamin A and a high amount of cholesterol. Whether an egg is good for you or not depends on the physiology of the person. Eggs are high quality proteins and are a vital part of one’s diet. Further they are also a cheap protein compared to meat. It is important for growing children and healthy adults. A child should have an egg a day. And adult with high cholesterol levels in the blood, those with hypertension and heart patients should be careful and should avoid the yolk of the egg. If they eat only the white of the egg there is no problem. They can have it twice a week or even once in two days.” Explained Dr.Shanthi Gunawardana, Consultant Community Physician, Non Communicable Diseases Unit, Ministry of Health.
