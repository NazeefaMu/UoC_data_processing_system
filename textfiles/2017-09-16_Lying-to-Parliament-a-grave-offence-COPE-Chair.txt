Lying to Parliament a grave offence: COPE Chair


	

Parliament Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) Chairman JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday that lying to Parliament was a grave offence.

He expressed these views in response to the evidence given to the Bond Commission by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) CEO Kasun Palisena that its owner Arjun Aloysius had lied to the COPE.

The MP said Parliament represented the sovereignty of the people and therefore lying to it was a punishable offense.

“These are officers and not politicians to come up with funny stories. They should behave responsibly. They have ultimately lied to the people of the country. However, this development is not the end and we have to wait and see how things proceed,” he told the Daily Mirror. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
