CIMA Convocation to be held tomorrow


	

CIMA’s second Convocation for the year will be held tomorrow (September 9) at the BMICH, commencing at 5.00 pm.  
This Convocation will celebrate the success of 9 national prize winners, 205 exam complete students, 146 Associate members and 7 Fellow members.  
With its unique blend of management accounting, financial accounting and business-focused subjects, the CIMA Professional Qualification produces integrated thinkers who look beyond the numbers, and add long-lasting value to their respective organizations.  
As such, this Convocation is aptly titled “Geared to lead businesses for national success.”  CIMA’s exam complete students and members are qualified to work in any organisation, and work across a range of industries in Sri Lanka from banking, finance, engineering, HR, IT to marketing, with the convocations being a reflection of this.  
The qualification and professional experience requirements are constantly updated, to ensure that CIMA students and members stay relevant and are amongst the top choices for employers.  James Dauris, British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, will attend the event as the Chief Guest.
