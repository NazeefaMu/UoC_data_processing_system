The minimum fine of Rs. 2,500 was intended for driving under the influence of liquor and driving without driving licence, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said today.

Addressing media at the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Parliament Complex Minister Karunathilaka said the minimum fine proposed in the budget presented by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake targeted those who drove under the influence of liquor and those drove without a licence.

“However, there is an increment of road accidents at least 10 per day, which has come to the level of road terrorism,” he said.

“The decision was taken to reduce the number of accidents and protect the people,” he said.
“Now the question is that, whether the penalty of minimum fine was reasonable or not,” the Minister said.

“These offences will not come into operation until the budget is passed in Parliament,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
