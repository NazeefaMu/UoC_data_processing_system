Political clout knows no boundaries


	

While a heated argument over a disputed boundary line of a certain piece of prime land was going on, a provincial politico had got a gang of goons to descend on the scene and put up a boundary fence arbitrarily.




The provincial politico is said to be a close kinsman of a top team purohita in yahapalanaya. 


The disputed land is located close to a leading university and one party to the dispute is a Buddhist monk and the other party is a buddy of the provincial politico. The provincial politico had sent his thugs with barb wires and boundary posts to the scene shortly after receiving a phone call from his buddy, 
they say.


The thugs had erected the boundary fence as directed by the politico’s buddy ignoring the protests by the other party.
