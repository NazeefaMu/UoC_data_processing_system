Pan Asia Bank reaches 200,000 Facebook fans


	

Pan Asia Bank recently crossed the 200,000 fan base on the popular social media network, Facebook.


This places Pan Asia Bank among the few domestic banks which have over a 200,000 fan base and is a clear indication of the bank’s intention to leverage social media to bring the banking and financial solutions much closer to today’s digitally-connected customer.
The bank’s ability to reach this milestone within a very short span of time is also a testament to the effective manner in which the bank engaged and interacted with its social media enthusiasts. One of the main reasons for the rapidly increasing popularity of the bank’s Facebook page is the lively and engaging manner in which it interacts with the public.


As the fastest growing commercial banks in Sri Lanka, Pan Asia Bank places great emphasis on realizing the true potential of the social media as a powerful tool that helps to connect with customers. As such, it is committed to maintain presence in all the other popular social media platforms in the Sri Lankan context such as Linkedin, Twitter and Youtube. 


Having well recognized the characteristics of the audience that each social media platform is patronized by, the bank engages them for specific purposes. For example, Linkedin – the world’s largest professional network – is used to announce new and upcoming vacancies in the bank and Youtube, the popular video depository and streaming platform, is used to give the public access to company-related videos such as TV commercials.
Most importantly, the bank has made the arrangements to set up the operational platform to receive queries, complains and feedback from the public via these social media platforms and answer them instantly. This has allowed the bank to stay closer to the customers understanding their requirements effectively and offer superior service. 


 “As one of the fastest growing banks in Sri Lanka, digital marketing is a vital part of our marketing activities; we use social media as a platform to engage and add value and we are grateful to our fans for their continued support. We are extremely humbled and proud that 200,000 people have chosen to be part of our social media endeavours and help in creating a robust and thriving banking community with true engagement as opposed to simply becoming fans,” said Pan Asia Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing and Card Products Nalaka Wijayawardana.
