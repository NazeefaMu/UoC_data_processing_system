A historic move  to save lives and protect  public health
	
The second Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), conducted in India confirms that Indias package of public health laws are working pretty effectively to reduce tobacco use and save lives, states Matthew L. Meyers, President of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, Washington DC. 
Thus, a dramatic decline in tobacco use has been highlighted in India. Since 2010, India has reduced tobacco usage among adults by 17 percent. As a result, there are currently over 8 million less tobacco users than there were just seven years ago, despite the growth in the Indian population, according to new data released last week by the Indian government. The percentage of adults using tobacco in India fell from 34.6 percent in 2009-10 to 28.6 percent in 2016-17. 
There has been a major decline among young people as well. The prevalence of tobacco use among Indians aged 15 to 24 fell by 33 percent, from 18.4 percent to 12.4 percent. Among youth aged 15 to 17, tobacco use fell by 54 percent. 
The Indian government has taken many effective measures in regard to important policy decisions favourable to reduce tobacco consumption in the country. The most recent was the decision taken during this month to tax cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and cheap, hand-rolled cigarettes called bidis at the highest rate of 28 percent under a new Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure. 
The percentage of adults using tobacco in India fell from 34.6 % in 2009-10 to 28.6 %in 2016-17
Indias new tobacco tax rate is a critical step forward in a country with 275 million tobacco users  the second highest in the world after China. It will encourage current tobacco users to quit, prevent potential tobacco users  especially young people  from starting and help reduce the one million deaths tobacco use causes in India each year. 
This decision is especially significant for its treatment of bidis. Known as the poor mans pleasure, bidis consist of shredded tobacco, hand-rolled in a tendu leaf. Bidis had been previously omitted from tax increases on tobacco products due to a powerful and well-connected bidi industry. Extremely popular, bidis are used by two-thirds of all adult smokers in India and far outsell regular cigarettes. Like other tobacco products, bidis exact a deadly toll on health, causing various types of cancers and contributing to chronic bronchitis, tuberculosis and other respiratory diseases. 
Smokeless tobacco will also be taxed at the highest rate under the GST. Smokeless tobacco use kills more than 200,000 people in India each year, making India the oral cancer capital of the world. 
According to Article 6 of the WHO-Framework Convention on Tobacco (FCTC), increasing tobacco taxes is the most effective and direct way to reduce tobacco use. By raising the price of tobacco products, higher taxes encourage users to quit and discourage potential users. Studies have shown that a price increase of 10 percent worldwide would reduce the number of smokers by 42 million and save 10 million lives. 
The GST negotiations in India featured intensive lobbying by every sector of the tobacco industry, including major cigarette companies, bidi barons and smokeless tobacco manufacturers. By subjecting tobacco to the highest GST rate, the Indian government has shown that public health is more important than tobacco company profits. This decision should serve as an example for governments around the globe, including its neighbouring country, Sri Lanka. 
Meanwhile, the Chairman of HealthCare Global - Cancer Hospital and President of APHI - Karnataka chapter Dr. Ajai Kumar said, Categorizing all tobacco products at the highest GST rate, including bidis, is one of the boldest and most impactful public health decisions the Indian Government has taken to protect the health of its citizens from the growing menace of tobacco addiction. Taxing bidis at 28 percent will prevent death and disease, not only among millions of bidi users but also among bidi workers who are mostly women and children. 
The prevalence of tobacco use among Indians aged 15 to 24 fell by 33 %, from 18.4 % to 12.4 %. Among youth aged 15 to 17, tobacco use fell by 54 %
The Indian government will now need to stand strong against the tobacco industry appeals and lobbying that will start immediately to water down the decision by attempting to exempt certain tobacco products. Stronger and more effective tobacco control policies like higher taxes are desperately needed not only in India but in other Asian countries like Sri Lanka, if they are to reverse the tobacco problem. 
Without urgent action, tobacco use will kill one billion people worldwide this century. 
While we Sri Lankans congratulate the Indian government on its bold decision to protect health and save lives for generations to come, we urge the Sri Lankan government to expedite implementing important tobacco control policies, including Article 16 of the FCTC, to ban sale of single cigarettes which the Sri Lankan government has been promising for years and take prompt measures to increase the tobacco tax by 90 percent, as the President of Sri Lanka promised on May 31, 2016. 
Sri Lanka is party to the important public health treaty of the World Health Organization, FCTC and we look forward to the government implementing the Articles of the FCTC according to its guidelines.

Amending PTA, not repealing it: Wijeyadasa
	
Introducing amendments to the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), does not mean that the Act will be repealed or replaced by a new Act and there will be nor room left for the countrys security to be jeopardized, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
He told a media conference today that this was not a sole decision of the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice or the Ministry of Law and Order.
This process has to involve all stakeholders including the ministries and the security forces. It is only a policy decision but nothing has been finalised," the minister said. The situation in the country is not the same as at the time we started discussions, the environment was totally different. The countries that requested to revise the PTA, are now thinking of tightening it in their countries. Those counties are amending the Act by adding stricter sub sections. Therefore, we too need to take another look on this Act." (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Beware new ransomware Petya: CERT
	
The Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) today warns computer users to beware of new ransomware Petya received in many forms as it was fast spreading throughout the internet.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, CERT Chief Information Security Engineer Roshan Chandragupta said the virus also infected computers through emails.
No incidents have been reported in the country so far. The virus spreads across Europe and among other countries, he said.
When the virus infects a computer, all information and data in the computer, including video files, would be encrypted (the information and data is converted into a code which cannot be read).
The Petya virus was a similar to the ransomware which attacked recently and it also designed to demand a ransom if the virus was to be removed and the encrypted data recovered.
Therefore Mr. Chandragupta advised all the computer users to be wary of opening suspicious emails that contain highlighted documents such as newsletters, video attachments, PDF documents and bogus lottery winning results etc.
He also advised users to backup all their important data on an external storage device.
Do not backup information or data being online as there is a likelihood of the virus infecting the backup devices as well. It is essential to keep the installed virus guards up-to-date. Reports have revealed several virus guards can defeat the virus. But many incidents of infection by the virus were reported even of computers with up-to-date virus guards, Mr.Chandragupta said.
According to international media reports thousands of infections, the new Petya ransomware has run into its first major problem, as a German email provider has blocked the email account the virus was using to manage ransom demands. Victims should be advised not to pay into the wallet, since its unlikely the attackers can successfully decrypt systems at this point.
The problem is caused in part by Petyas unorthodox method for collecting ransom payments.
Most ransomware programs create a unique wallet for each infection, making it easy to know which victim is responsible for each payment.
But Petya broke with that practice, asking every victim to send US$300 payment to the same single Bitcoin wallet, then send an email to wowsmith123456@posteo.net with a unique identifier to confirm payment and receive the decryption keys. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

CA Sri Lankas APFASL confers CPFA qualification to over 130 senior public servants at inaugural con
	

Over 130 senior public servants were recently conferred with the Chartered Public Finance Accountancy (CPFA) qualification at the inaugural CPFA Convocation organized by the CA Sri Lanka Public Sector Wing, the Association of Public Finance Accountants of Sri Lanka (APFASL), in an effort to strengthen the countrys public financial management.
The qualification was granted to 132 public servants who were accountants, auditors and commissioners of the Inland Revenue Department based on merit, and who had fulfilled the necessary criteria including a minimum of 10 years in service in an executive grade as accountants, auditors and commissioners with a MBA or higher degree in a finance related subject and were above the age of 40 years.
The convocation was held under the patronage of Minister for special assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama, the chief guest, and State Minister of Finance Eran Wickramaratne, the guest of honour.
CPFA is an internationally recognised groundbreaking qualification specially developed by APFASL and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) London, for the benefit of accountants, auditors and assessors in the Sri Lankan public sector to help them enhance their professional skills, to strengthen the financial management within the sector, which in turn will reflect positively on the country and its economic development. President of CA Sri Lanka, Lasantha Wickremasinghe speaking at the convocation said that accounting professionals contribute vastly towards the economic growth of a country, and the public financial management is a key ingredient for economic development in Sri Lanka.
Therefore highly educated professionals with the required skills and expertise in promoting good governance, transparency and accountability is the need of the hour, and this is specially important for a country such as Sri Lanka. Therefore, I am certain that the 132 members who will receive the CPFA qualification today based on merit, will pave the way to enhance the countrys public finance management, and will give leadership towards achieving this goal, he added.
APFASL President V. Kanagasabapathy highlighted that professional organisations have an important role to play in strengthening the professional capacity of the public sector, and having understood this responsibility. CA Sri Lanka together with the APFASL has taken steps to help professionalize the public financial management personnel in Sri Lanka by launching the CPFA qualification, among several other important initiatives, he said. He pointed out that the association decided to confer the qualification on merit on the 132 public servants as the examination process will take time to produce fully qualified chartered public finance accountants. Considering the fact that this process will take few years to have fully qualified chartered public finance accountants, as an initial step we decided to offer the membership to around 132 senior public servants who have been selected purely on merit basis in order to create a nucleus of members to start with and to take our activities to the rest of the members, he said.
Kanagasabapathy also extended his appreciation to the Asian Development Bank, for supporting APFASLs initiatives to strengthen the financial management in the public sector.

DENGUE TURNS DISASTROUS Hospitals suffer from chronic shortage of beds
2017 year has been the year of the dengue mosquitoes. It has only been halfway through the year, but the number of dengue patients have spiked like never before. The rise in dengue has itself caused another travesty as hospitals are inundated with fever patients. The atmosphere in both state and private hospitals as of late is a very tense one, with hospital staff attempting to cope with and provide medical treatment to all patients despite the challenge of limited ward space and other facilities. The Daily Mirror visited the leading hospitals in Colombo and its suburbs as the district grapples the burden of dengue.
We witnessed suffering patients in almost all hospitals while undaunted medical staff were providing much needed care, despite the setbacks that have sprouted into existence with the dengue menace.

Patients suffer from bed shortage
The National Hospital of Sri Lanka, where dengue patients are being accepted day after day, is also faced with the problem of patients outnumbering availability of beds. Upon visiting the wards with dengue patients, we witnessed beds and corridors packed with patients lying on any available space; be it on the floor, benches, foldable beds and the regular hospital beds. Doctors and nurses were bustling through the narrow corridors looking to the needs of patient after patient. 
The Dengue High Dependency Unit (HDU) in Ward 55, has been allocated for dengue patients in need of specialised treatment. The Daily Mirror spoke to many patients who were satisfied with the way the doctors and nurses were treating them, despite the severe shortage of beds.
We further learnt from the Deputy Director General of the hospital that the hospital will continue to manage the influx of patients and are increasing facilities available for the accommodation of dengue patients.
We have set up HDUs in all wards
-Dr. Anil Jasinghe, the Deputy Director General
On average, the hospital houses 375 dengue patients, out of which, 75 are in the latent stage. We have identified and set apart some HDUs in all wards. There are 15 wards and 8 beds in each ward which are set aside for HDU patients. Thats 120 beds in total. Out of these 120 beds, 2 beds in each ward are equipped with a monitor, syringe pump etc; it contributes to 30 beds in total. We are in the process of equipping the ward with 2 more beds in order to increase the total number to 60 beds. 
We have bought 25 foldable beds for the floor patients, so that they are comfortable. We have never stopped admitting patients to the hospital
Speaking of the management and of the staff along with the influx of patients, he said, We have a dedicated nurse for each ward who is trained in dengue care. The doctors too have been trained in dengue protocol management.
We have bought 25 foldable beds for the floor patients, so that they are comfortable. We have never stopped admitting patients to the hospital. The consultants discharge the patients when their platelet count goes up. We admit the patients who have the need to be admitted. We have facilities to evaluate each patient before admission. The full blood count tests take 30 minutes to produce results. If the platelet count is not low, then patients could always come back to test themselves. 
In his message to the public in order to avoid the disease progressing into intense stage, If they are running a fever, by the third day, they should get a medical check up and start on proper treatment. We see when the children or the elderly fall sick they are taken care of from the beginning and precautions are taken. However when it comes to the working people, they neglect their condition take a paracetamol and continue working. What people need to know is, if by the third day the fever does not subside, they should undergo a medical check up.
We were tested regularly
I have been here for 2 days. Some of the patients dont have enough beds here but the doctors and hospital staff are taking good care of us. They are all very considerate. They conduct checks whenever they are required and administer relevant medicine. The nurses visit us regularly and check on us for four to five times a day. They take our blood samples and the doctors do the tests. All in all, I am satisfied with the treatment I am getting here. 


willing to wait
I was admitted yesterday, I have been on this bench from that time. They are looking into me regularly and the doctors are checking on me. Even if I havent been given a bed I wouldnt want them to remove someone on a bed just because I want a bed, everyone needs one, I have to wait for my turn. I am satisfied with the way they are treating me.



I was given a bed
They are treating us properly and looking after us regularly. I have been here for 4 days; I was transferred from another ward to here. We are checked on around 4 to 5 times a day. The doctor visits me regularly. I was given a bed since the time I was sent to this ward.



Commendable service by IDH
When Daily Mirror spoke to a few patients who were fresh from being discharged from the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH), they readily expressed their views concerning the current situation of the hospital. While noting that there was a great influx in the number of patients being admitted to the hospital, they also appreciated the outstanding service of the hospital staff. They said that the staff were maintaining stringent standards with regard to the proper management of the hospital; this is in addition to handling of the situation professionally with good medical expertise. The following are comments from the patients:

Hospital environment is very clean
Currently there is a very big crowd in terms of hospital inmates at the IDH. At least two patients are being accommodated in one bed. However, the patients are being treated with good care and the nurses are very hospitable and kind towards the patients. The hospital environment is also very clean and the treatment is excellent. I believe that the IDH is far better than the other hospitals for treating children.


No shortcomings in medical treatment
Despite the large number of patients that are getting admitted to the hospital, we have not witnessed any kind of shortcomings in the medical treatment that we receive. We have never been asked to get our blood count tested from any private clinics. All blood tests are done within the hospital premises. I was receiving treatment here for seven days, and today, I was discharged. I am very happy with the treatment.



Medical professionals are doing their best
There are at least two or three patients sharing one bed. It has been three days since my eldest sons daughter was admitted to the hospital. She has still not fully recovered from the illness. However, the medical professionals are doing everything within their capacity in terms of treatment. Also, it is quite relieving that blood and urine tests are conducted within the hospital premises itself .


Treatment methodical despite crowds
Despite being overcrowded, the medical treatment administered to patients is very good and methodical. Blood tests and urine tests are also conducted within the hospital premises as and when needed, without any hassle. My wife was discharged today after being admitted for two days at the hospital.



Eradication of dengue must be carried out effectively
Although patients are being accommodated in separate wards depending on their illnesses, we noticed that most beds are shared by two to three patients. The medical service is excellent and patients are being monitored on hourly basis. My husband was admitted to the hospital day before yesterday and he is still receiving treatment for dengue. I strongly believe that the root causes for the spread of dengue should be addressed by relevant authorities in an effective manner. We could have minimized the threat of dengue if drainages, canals and the surrounding environment were effectively cleaned.
Patient attention highly commendable
The Daily Mirror visited the wards of the Kalubowila Colombo South Teaching Hospital scoping out the dengue challenge at the hospital. It was indeed a very hectic environment with throngs of fever patients admitted to the wards while many more remained seated outside awaiting admission. Among the fever patients, there were confirmed dengue cases as well as suspected dengue cases waiting for their medical reports. It was quite clear that the ward facilities were running out with respect to the increasing number of patients.
But despite all difficulties, the hospital staff seems to be managing the chaotic hassle giving priority to the dengue patients though it indeed appears a very tedious task.
Planning to streamline OPD admission
Kalubowila Hospital Director Dr. Asela Gunawardana
We have 340 dengue patients admitted to the hospital at present. A rise in patients are expected if the rains continue. We are planning to streamline OPD admission by encouraging people to stay at home and get bed rest unless the condition is critical. The admission condition is the platelet count is below 130,000 to minimize influx of patients. Amidst other measures, we are hoping to allocate free beds in 2 post-natal wards for patients recovering after a critical condition of dengue. This will make more room for acute dengue patients.

Beds outnumber patients
Rathna Moratugoda, a grandmother who had come to get her granddaughter discharged also spoke about the dedication of the hospital staff. The ward where her granddaughter was receiving treatment had 40 beds which were outnumbered with over a 100 patients where 60-70 of the patients were suffering from dengue. My granddaughter was in haemorrhagic state when she was admitted, but thanks to treatment she is out of danger now and getting discharged today.


There is no time to rest
Liyanage, a nursing sister at one of the female medical wards said, Our ward has 46 beds. Just this morning, the admission of patients rose to 115 to that ward. Among these patients, 48 are suffering from dengue and are under intense monitoring. Other patients have been admitted upon suspicion of dengue. Eight nurses are assigned for day duty, while five handle the night shift. There is no time to rest. However, we stick to strict monitoring and give priority to the dengue patients. 
However, the difficulties faced are not one-sided just to the hospital staff, but despite facility issues, the patients seem to be happy with the treatment that they are receiving.
Overcrowded wards
Patients at the Colombo North Teaching Hospital in Ragama revealed that the hospital has been carrying out all tests, including full blood counts. Except for a few cases, all patients in ward 9, had been admitted immediately while there were also a patients suspected with dengue. The ward housed 42 dengue patients with eight other patients who are at the dengue haemorrhagic stage. More than three patients were on the floor, due to shortage of beds in the ward.
We were also informed of several unconfirmed patients. During our time of visits, beds were placed in corridors which were being prepared for new admissions.
Seek admission if platelet count is below 130,000
Dr. Vajira Dissanayaka
Deputy Director - Colombo North Teaching Hospital, Ragama
There were around 243 dengue patients by Monday with 98 cases with internal bleeding. Dengue patients are admitted to seven medical emergency wards plus three paediatric wards. A ward is usually equipped with 42 beds but since it is an emergency situation we cannot exactly state the number of beds. 
Commenting on the number of the admissions, Dr. Dissanayaka said Dengue cases are increasing when compared to last month. The daily admissions last month ranged between 150 - 200 but now it is 250 - 300. 
Dr. Dissanayaka has also advised those suspected to have been infected with dengue to admit themselves at the hospital as soon as possible. She said patients should stay at least two days in the hospital to confirm whether they have dengue. If the platelet count is below 130,000, we strongly advise to seek medical attention immediately, and if it is above 160,000, it is advisable to rest at home. 
Dengue cases are increasing when compared to last month. The daily admissions last month ranged between 150 - 200 but now it is 250 - 300
forced to share beds
I have been here for a week, but only received a bed after waiting for more than a day. Until then I was seated in a chair. There were some patients on the floor, even on the pavement. The patients have been sharing spaces together due to the lack of beds. Critical and undiagnosed patients are also there.



Doctors have been very attentive and all the tests were done by the hospital staff. The only problem here is the lack of space. I was in the ward for four days and I was sharing a bed with another. There are untrained janitors and wash rooms are not clean all the time.



A dengue haemorrhage patient who had checked his blood platelet count from a private channelling centre, was admitted to the hospital after waiting for 48 hours. He was given the corner most bed which was made by assembling three beds, he has to share it with four others. He had a bed of his own, which was after an unfortunate death of another patient.



benched for treatment
Both were on the corridor of ward No. 9 seated on the bench. He said that the corridors are congested at night, as the admissions are high during the night. Cyril was suffering from an invading germ, while Jude was admitted with a chest pain. Chathura Madhushanka who was not diagnosed with dengue at the time of our visit, was also advised to rest on the bench on the corridor, in order for him to receive treatment if necessary.


I was admitted when the platelet count was around 91, said Roshantha. He was also a patient sharing the corner most combined bed. Nishanka, in the adjoining bed had been in the hospital for four days and his platelet count decreased to 36.


Admission temporarily suspended on four occasions
The Jayawardenapura Hospital made headlines over the past few days as reports emerged that the hospital had temporarily suspended the admission of fever patients. As we entered the hospital, a notice at the entrance read suggesting the same. However speaking to the Daily Mirror, the Deputy Director of the hospital Dr. Santhusha Fernando said that the hospital is well equipped and is familiar in managing the epidemic.
Deputy Director, Sri Jayawardenapura Hospital in her comments:
With the influx of patients, the rate of admission is very high, as there is a very high incidence of dengue in the Colombo district. Most people are very aware of the situation nowadays. The moment they suspect dengue, they get themselves tested from outside by a General Physician or by themselves. They demand for admission as they are scared of the disease. There is a concurrent flu epidemic as well. 
Clarifying the controversy surrounding admissions, Dr. Fernando said the hospital functions in a methodical manner to ensure the best care for patients. At our hospital, even if a patient is discharged we need a bit of time to settle their records because this is a fee levying hospital. We need time to write their diagnosis cards, to give them advice and to get them down from the bed. We also need time to sanitise the beds and prepare for the next patient as we have to adhere to the standards of hygiene. 
When we are inundated with patients, we cant cope with these processes. So from time to time, according to the bed availability we have been forced to shut down the hospital for a few hours, to get our bed management in order. But we have never closed down the hospital as it has happened in some other government hospitals, she said. 
The hospital was temporarily closed for admissions only on four occasions; for a few hours. The closure was not for more than four hours. There has been information circulating that so many patients were turned away. Those were the result of patients being agitated when they were turned away or asked to wait for two or three hours. 
Asked if the beds are sufficient to house patients, the Deputy Director said the hospital is equipped with approximately 1080 beds. The usual standard of a hospital at any given point, we expect the best saturation of beds to be 80 percent of the total number of beds. About 15 to 20 percent of beds in any hospital should be kept vacant in the case of a disaster or accident. We do have beds but we cannot adhere to standards of bed management with the influx of patients. We can manage and we are geared to manage this situation. But due to the public response to fever we are faced with a delay and difficulty in managing the beds. The situation is not as bad as it has been portrayed. We have increased the number of day beds at our Emergency Treatment Unit (ETU) where patients with dengue can wait for their blood count.
We rationally decide if the patient can be sent home and ask them to return the next day
With our clinical judgment we rationally decide if the patient can be sent home and ask them to return the next day if they are from the vicinity. If they are residents of faraway places we still admit such patients. The hospital has dedicated three medical wards headed by three consultants and staff of varied expertise, with 10 to 12 medical staff attending to each ward. Wards dedicated for other illnesses are also cooperating with dengue management and are offering a percentage of their wards to house dengue patients, depending on the requirement. We have provided dengue training to doctors in the outlier wards, refreshing their skills and knowledge on dengue management, Dr. Fernando opined. 
The Jayawardenapura Hospital is geared to face challenges the Deputy Director said citing the staffs experience in managing patients. During the time of the war, we had a high influx of military casualties, so we were used to very intense workloads and coordination between our wards. Our laboratory staff and radiology staff have been providing a dedicated service, as dengue patients have to undergo frequent tests and scans, I can confidently say that our hospital is well geared to manage the situation.
Patient admission ranges from 250 - 300 a day
- Dr. K.V.C. JanakaEmergency Treatment Unit,Jpura Hospital
Dr. K.V.C. Janaka who has been on the front-line of dealing with the heavy influx of dengue patients at the Jayawardenapura hospital admits that the number of dengue patients has put medical services under strain. We have a huge influx of patients this year. On Tuesday evening, there were 135 suspected dengue patients coming in. The total number of for a day ranges from 250 to 300 patients whereas the hospital has about 1000 beds. Therefore we find it difficult to cope with the situation. 
We have been adhering to the national guidelines and have only been admitting patients with a platelet count below 150,000 depending on our clinical judgment. We have to select the patients who are really in need of hospital care and we cant admit all patients for nursing care. 
We are now grappling with practical issues in treating patients
Colombo district obviously has the highest burden but the death rates at our hospital have been below the national level. The dengue virus type 2 is a new strain to our population. Therefore a large number of people have been presenting with symptoms. The previous types of dengue saw a certain degree of resistance. But the changes in the weather pattern may have caused this epidemic. The number of dengue cases are very high this year and we expect it to rise by July. 
We are now grappling with practical issues in treating patients as our staff has to take hourly measurements from about 40 patients in a ward. Our staff can handle the situation but they are under immense stress when the numbers are this high.

Dharmasena Pathiraja, enfant terrible Some personal reflections on the movies of Dharmasena Pathiraj
	
There was always a self-important sense of literariness, of artifice, in certain movies of those directors who were censured by the ideologues, movers and shakers of the Nouvelle Vague, or the French New Wave. These ideologues projected their censure and feelings of hurt to the American counterparts of those directors: to Billy Wilder, William Wyler and everyone else who were so constrained by the big studios that all they could do was forget their own personality. In the eyes of the new critics, nothing could absolve what was considered their shameless acts of fawning to the studios: their movies were at best literary, not cinematic, and second rate. 
Pauline Kael called these critics (many of whom took to directing later on) movie brutalists. The movies they had grown up on were dead, obsolete and rooted in milieus which were no longer relevant to the new world the New Wave was riding on. They rejected the craftsmanship of the old order: the carefully conceived, technically superior but banal work of the old directors. The directors they admired  Nicholas Ray, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock  were ignored by the mainstream producers because they couldnt be rationalised by the criteria those producers brought up when assessing and going for the Wilders and the Wylers. It was left to the brutalists to promote them, and in doing so to emulate them. 
The brutalist who radicalised our cinema emerged from Yapas movie, set in the University
	His characters, like those in Godards movies, entranced an entire generation
	Pathiraja is probably the only director here who has never made a technically inferior movie
	He trumped his critics with his refusal to enter the completely political
The greatest movie brutalist of them all was Jean-Luc Godard. And not without reason: apart from the fact that he is the only surviving member of the Nouvelle Vague, he was also the most consistent. Nearly everyone else who followed him or were part of the revolution he wrought, returned more or less to the same cinema they had repudiated: Truffaut, Rohmer even Chabrol. But Godard was different. His influence spawned imitators the world over, some second-hand, others first rate. That his stints at movie-making followed and ran parallel with the New Wave in Eastern Europe was no coincidence: it was an era of rejection; rejection of values which were superficially different (conservative versus liberal, capitalist versus communist) but actually thrived on conformity, more specifically artistic conformity. 
That culture of rejection came to Sri Lanka towards the end of the sixties, with a movie that brought in nearly everyone who would be part of the transformation of our cinema in the seventies: Sugathapala Senarath Yapas Hanthane Kathawa. Siri Gunasinghe had made Sath Samudura a few years earlier: it brought D.B. Nihalsinghe and Vasantha Obeyesekere together. Nihalsinghe would later make our only technically American movie: Welikathara. Obeyesekere would subvert the mainstream cinema by resorting to and muddling up the tropes it thrived on. But the brutalist who radicalised our cinema was to emerge from Yapas movie, one that was set in an integral locale of the revolution to come: the University. 
Hanthane Kathawa is one of the few Sinhala movies that seem as fresh now as on the day they were released. It breathes naturally in the open, despite the underlying tensions which move into an inexorable climax. Much of its texture, its raw feel of life in the University, came from the fact that many of its cast and crew members were real-life students at Peradeniya. Two in particular had come from the same school and were studying for the same degree. One of them turned out to be an actor. Daya Tennakoon. The other turned out to be that aforementioned radical. Dharmasena Pathiraja. Last week Pathiraja, the director and artiste turned 50. This is a brief outline of the man and what I believe his cinema has stood for. 
Dharmasena Pathirajas characters, like the characters in Godards movies, entranced an entire generation. They entranced us because the world they inhabited was too chaotic, too turbulent, to make them plan for the day after tomorrow. They dont conceive of whats to come, they live for today. Because of this, his plots cant be rationalised or boiled down. They are like sentences that never end, that lead backwards at times and take us to climaxes we never get to in others. Thats probably why one of the books written on him was titled An Incomplete Sentence. 
But Pathiraja is probably the only director here who has never made a technically inferior movie. (With other directors then and now, you get movies which are great, good, not-so-good, mediocre and terrible.) From his first real film Ahas Gawwa  I have unfortunately not seen Sathuro, which he made five years earlier, in 1969  he said everything, and I mean everything, that he would elaborate on, though only obliquely, in his subsequent work. The only movie of his that made some concession to the box office, Eya Dan Loku Lamayek, was, I daresay, not that bad in comparison. But I remember what Regi Siriwardena wrote of it: When one has praised Malini Fonsekas performance in it, one has virtually exhausted its virtues.  In Ahas Gawwa, the characters had some semblance of a family to fall back on. In Eya Dan Loku Lamayek, the conflict is rooted in a love triangle between Malini and two men who dont seem to have any family at all (Vijaya Kumaratunga and Wimal Kumar da Costa). Its in Bambaru Avith that we come across a perfectly uprooted protagonist, with Victor (Baby Mahaththaya), played by Kumaratunga as the son of an ailing mudalali we never even hear about. But Bambaru Avith, like its music, was very operatic and stylised despite the salty dialogues and Donald Karunaratnes cinematography. Pathiraja needed another movie to open up and do away with those operatic, epic overtones. He got to that with Para Dige. 
Para Dige is the movie that best sums up that sense of obliqueness which comes through his characters. There are sequences that seem so random and out of key that the only reason they could be there was Pathiraja himself. Why do Chandare (Vijaya) and his sister (Sunethra Sarachchandra) go to the birthday party of those triplets Why are they the only ones there when they cut their birthday cake Why do they break into a small dance thats at once mesmerising and confusing And why do they never talk I dont think these are meant to be answered, but they are there, painfully obvious, never even asked. Its not just that the director randomly inserts them: its also that he himself doesnt make us WANT to question WHY he inserts them in the first place. Thats where he triumphs: with other directors, such randomness would at most be considered jerky. These sequences are arbitrary, but because of their arbitrariness they are woven into the narrative even though they exist outside it. 
When Godard titled a section of Masculin Feminin with the famous line This film could be called The Children of Marx and Coca-Cola, he was thinking about how the world was dangling between two worlds, shell-shocked and confused. The youth were revolutionaries, but they were also allured by popular culture: they were pop revolutionaries, neither here nor there, never seriously committed to anything. Para Dige epitomised them: desensitised but not incapable of love, impersonalised but not incapable of affection, synthetic but not incapable of honesty. They were in a class of their own, free of familial bonds and constraints. 
Bambaru Avith, despite its operatic overtones, had Brechtian undertones: you never felt for its characters the way you did for those in Para Dige. Those undertones came from Pathirajas trysts with the theatre, in particular his Koraya saha Andaya, which was Beckettian. He returned to Beckett with Soldadu Unnahe, which more than anything that preceded it, forced audiences to radically evaluate the cinema. 
To an outsider, Soldadu Unnahe is shoddy, even untidy. It doesnt quite contain the technical mastery of Pathirajas previous work. There are long, overdrawn sequences and sequences that end so abruptly that they confound reason and judgment. It was destined to alienate audiences because it was formally meant to. 
The late Ajith Samaranayake in a review contended that its climax (where the soldier, played by Joe Abeywickrama, comprehends the true meaning of sovereignty) was incongruent with the Gorkian poignancy of everything that led to it. Valid though his point was, it was a little misplaced. As Regi Siriwardena pointed out in a reply to Samaranayake, Soldadu Unnahe wasnt Gorkian or realistic: it defied realism in a way that could only be described as Beckettian. Pathiraja had, in other words, reinvented our cinema: he had made the first real existential film we could claim. 
The great tragedy of Pathiraja is that, like Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, his movies were never properly evaluated by the press. With Bandaranayake, I think the problem was that the generation of Gamini Haththotuwegama, Ajith Samaranayake and A.J. Gunawardena was soon to pass away. With Pathiraja on the other hand, the problem was the man himself. He trumped his critics with his refusal to enter the completely political. They were upset because he hadnt conformed to their standards of propriety: for them, a movie like Bambaru Avith could work only if Victor was labelled as an evil capitalist and Helen (Malini Fonseka) was labelled as a corrupted peasant virgin. They were upset, in other words, because he refused to turn our cinema into what Bandaranayake and his contemporaries had turned our theatre: politically fragmented, thriving on symbols, metaphors, protests and stark dichotomies. 
But in trumping those critics, Pathiraja has sealed his legacy. And I think its just as well: the intrusion of the theatre into our cinema has given me enough reason to lament, not celebrate. That no critic, apart from someone like Siriwardena, took him seriously remains the best tribute we can make to him. Not because he defied those critics or criticism in general, but because he was able to make inroads to audiences despite the alienation those critics felt from his work. To date, I have not come across another director (in the serious cinema) who has touched the pulse of his or her audience so sharply while overturning those preconceptions of the medium that writers and commentators revere so highly. As always, he remains in a class and category of his own. Rightly. And justifiably.

Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said yesterday that fresh legislation should be enacted to regulate the operation of NGOs in the country.
In an interview with Daily Mirror, he said the NGOs mostly operated in the country posing a threat to national interests and therefore their activities should be regulated. He said he would make some proposals to subject Minister Mano Ganeshan on this matter.
The previous regime had made an effort to prepare legislation with a Parliamentary Select Committee headed by JVP MP Vijitha Herath looking into the matter and making recommendations. (Kelum Bandara)

GMOA warns of sudden work stoppage
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned they wold resort to a sudden work stoppage if the government does not provide them with a reasonable solution to the SAITM issue.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that the GMOAs Central Committee had directed its executive committee to take a decision on the strike and that the next couple of days would be crucial.
Perhaps the strike will be launched today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. It is the final option we have been left with. SAITM should be nationalized and we will not agree to any other solution. However, we will not let any harm be caused to patients during these strikes, he said.
Dr. Aluthge said the government had announced that they would not hold any discussions with the GMOA anymore even though the doctors were still ready to solve the SAITM issue through official discussions without resorting to a strike.
He said the SAITM had continued its procedure without having the approval of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) violating the world standards with regard to medical education. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Helicopter attacks Venezuela court, Maduro denounces coup bid
	
A Venezuelan police helicopter strafed the Supreme Court and a government ministry on Tuesday, escalating the OPEC nations political crisis in what President Nicolas Maduro called an attack by terrorists seeking a coup. 
The aircraft fired 15 shots at the Interior Ministry, where scores of people were at a social event, and dropped four grenades on the court, where judges were meeting, officials said. 
However, there were no reports of injuries. 
Sooner rather than later, we are going to capture the helicopter and those behind this armed terrorist attack against the institutions of the country, Maduro said. 
They could have caused dozens of deaths, he said. 
The 54-year-old socialist leader has faced three months of protests from opposition leaders who decry him as a dictator who has wrecked a once-prosperous economy. There has been growing dissent too from within government and the security forces. 
At least 75 people have died, and hundreds more been injured and arrested, in the anti-government unrest since April. 
Demonstrators are demanding general elections, measures to alleviate a brutal economic crisis, freedom for hundreds of jailed opposition activists, and independence for the opposition-controlled National Assembly legislature. 
Maduro says they are seeking a coup against him with the encouragement of a U.S. government eager to gain control of Venezuelas oil reserves, the largest in the world. 
Venezuelas government said in a communique the helicopter was stolen by investigative police pilot Oscar Perez, who declared himself in rebellion against Maduro.

Kotte Sangha Sabha writes firm letter to President
	
In a strongly worded lengthy letter to the President, the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Sangha Sabha opposed moves by certain political leaders and extremist organizations to criticize monks without a reason in a manner never seen in the history of the country, insult institutions of the Sangha and acquire property belonging to the Sasana.
The letter was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena after a delegation comprising the Mahanayake of the Sangha Sabha Ven. Dr. Ittapene Dhammalankara thera and Anuanayakes Ven. Dr. Bellanwila Wimalaratana thera and Ven. Dr. Kotapitiye Rahula thera held discussions with the President on Wednesday (28).
The Sangha Sabha especially rejected in strong terms, false statements made by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga regarding the Sri Lankan Buddhist identity. We feel these actions are aimed at fulfilling individual aspirations and does not contribute to the welfare of the wider society, the statement said.
It can be seen that some are engaged in a process to brand Buddhists as extremists who are sowing hatred among other religious communities. They are also engaged in condemning the 2500 year old Sri Lankan Buddhist culture. Therefore the Monks and the Buddhists of Sri Lanka are faced with a pathetic situation today regarding the protection of their culture that was safeguarded for thousands of years. We express our displeasure to the government for not probing and stating the truth about the statistics and statements on the wrongs that are perceived to have been done by the Buddhists of the country against other religions.
We do not agree with alternate proposals and unnecessary discussions regarding the position bestowed in the constitution on Buddhism and the unitary state concept where all communities are living together in accordance with a Sri Lankan culture. Therefore the Sangha Sabha has put forward a set of proposals for the government regarding the present problematic situation. The Sangha Sabha proposes to establish a commission of acceptable learned persons who are devoid of extremist views to look into these matters.

The joint opposition (JO) yesterday said there was no considerable development in the country for the last two and a half years since the Yahapalanaya government came to power.
JO member MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena told a news conference that there were no development programmes by the government lined up for the future.
Instead of focusing on sustainable development, the Yahapalanaya government has done many other insignificant things including looting public property. For the first time in history, the Auditor General has raised concerns over the authenticity of accounts maintained by the Treasury. The government is also attempting to grab the properties belonging to temples. At this rate, the government will not last long, he said.
On a different note, MP Abeywardena said the poor farmers were greatly inconvenienced because Sri Lanka imported 70 per cent of rice and 80 per cent of corn, even though 100 per cent of them were available locally. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

REUTERS, 28th JUNE, 2017- The decapitated bodies of five civilians have been found in a Philippine city occupied by Islamist rebels, the military said on Wednesday, warning the number of residents killed by rebel atrocities could rise sharply as troops retake more ground.
The discovery of the five victims among 17 other bodies retrieved would be the first evidence that civilians trapped in besieged Marawi City have been decapitated during the five-week stand by militants loyal to the Islamic State group, as some who escaped the city have previously reported.
Lieutenant Colonel Emmanuel Garcia of the Western Mindanao Command said in a text message to reporters the five decapitated were found with the other 17 civilians killed by militants.
Garcia did not respond immediately to repeated requests for more details.
It was not clear when the bodies were found.

Prasad Kariyawasam re-elected to UN Committee on Migrant Workers
	
Sri Lankas Ambassador to the USA, Prasad Kariyawasam was re-elected as the member of the UN Committee on Migrant Workers for the fourth time at the Election held at the UN, the Foreign Ministry said.
They said Mr. Kariyawasam had been a member of the UN Committee on Migrant Workers since its inception in March 2004.
Issuing a statement, the Ministry said, the meeting was held in New York on June 28, at the 8th Meeting of State Parties to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.
The 51 States Parties to the Convention voted yesterday to select 7 members to the Committee, out of 11 candidates, for the period 2018-2021. The 11 candidates were from Albania, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Mali, Niger, Philippines, Senegal and Sri Lanka, the statement said.
Sri Lankas candidate, Prasad Kariyawasam, was re-elected, securing the third highest number of votes, along with candidates from Albania, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Colombia, Senegal, and Niger.
The UN Committee on Migrant Workers (CMW), consisting of a total of 14 elected members, as its main responsibility, monitors the implementation of the Convention, which is the most comprehensive international instrument that deals with the rights of migrant workers. The Convention which came into force in 2003, is an important component of the core international human rights treaties in the UN Human Rights Treaty System.
Ambassador Kariyawasams re-election to the Committee for successive terms signifies the endorsement by the States Parties of his competence and contribution to the work of the Committee in promoting the human rights of migrant workers, and recognition of Sri Lankas role in this regard as well, on the international stage.
Today, migrant workers account for a substantial component of the worlds approximately 250 million international migrants. Migrant workers around the world make a significant contribution to the growth and development of their countries of destination, and also to the improvement of the economies of their countries of origin through remittances. However, migrant workers are often vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking. The Convention seeks to prevent and eliminate the exploitation of migrant workers throughout the migration process and promote a rights based approach to migration with a view to protecting the rights of migrant workers and members of their families.

Although there are laws to victims of racketeers who are out to make a quick buck any which way they can, the police are often not given the opportunity to take action against these persons as victims of these crimes hardly report them to the police.
Speaking of rackets in which pedestrians deliberately throw themselves in front of vehicles in order to demand money from gullible motorists, Police Spokesman
SP Ruwan Gunasekara said such cases were often resolved by the victims paying up.
Previously Daily Mirror reported a racket in which three-wheeler drivers would demand money from motorists travelling in luxury vehicles after claiming that their side mirror had been broken by them.
The media spokesman said that there had been a marked increase in the number of such rackets taking place in and around Colombo, spurred on by the knowledge that the unsuspecting victims would pay up and not call the police due to the hassle involved.
According to the penal code, suspects could be brought to justice on charges of cheating, misappropriation and extortion if a complaint is lodged at the closest police station," he said.

In the wake of Pakistan's successful Champions Trophy campaign, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has said that it is expecting Sri Lanka to tour the country for one-day internationals and Twenty20 matches at the end of this year.
According to a PCB official, the Angelo Mathews-led team are expected to tour Pakistan for a limited-overs series which would be staged only in Lahore in the months of November or December.
"Our Sri Lankan counterparts have expressed willingness in sending their team to Pakistan as the security situation is improving in the country," the Dawn quoted the PCB official as saying.
He further said that the host country would be providing a similar kind of high-profile security to the Sri Lankan team as provided to foreign players during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) final at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore earlier this year. "The PSL final has proved a great breakthrough in reviving international cricket in Pakistan," the official said.
The PCB official further said that World XI team would also be touring Pakistan in September, which will also saw foreign players from Australia, West Indies, Sri Lanka and South Africa. No Test side has toured Pakistan since the March 2009 militants attack on the Lankan cricket team bus in Lahore, killing six Pakistani policemen and injuring some of the visiting players. However, low-ranked sides namely Afghanistan and Zimbabwe had toured the country for a limited-over series.(DNA)

When the current government came to power, the possibility to stop this project was examined. But we couldnt stop it because 2/3rds of the project had been completed by that time. Furthermore, we had to consider moving the project forward because of the huge loan which had been obtained from the Iranian government for this project," the President said.
He said he had discussions with local and foreign specialists about the actions to be taken now and that a German specialist on mining has started investigations and another group of specialists would arrive in Sri Lanka to carry out further studies.

It said many of the reported incidents had occurred at the end of the ride and warned the females to be extra vigilant during this time and try to limit time alone inside the Tuk.
The embassy advised that Do not be afraid to use force if needed  make a noise, be assertive, and strike back to defend yourself. Doing so will not only draw attention to the scene, but can also startle the attacker. Pay attention to your surroundings, and know your location in case you have to call for assistance
The females were advised to avoid making themselves a target for criminals  flashing expensive jewelry or large amounts of cash can make them a target.

We never had Hora meeting with President: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today refuted the claims made by Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne that President Maithripala Sirisena did not meet the GMOA officially and the meeting with them was informal.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they never had any informal or secret discussion with any party since past and would continue to do so even in future.
Minister Senaratne should have at least understood to whom he had made these allegations. The minister should not have insulted the President in such a manner. We had an open and official discussion with the President, he said.
However, the minister yesterday said that the President had not met the GMOA officially and agreed to meet them unofficially. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
