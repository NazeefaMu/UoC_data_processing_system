Reaffirming its strong commitment to excellence in all key areas of operations, Asian Alliance Insurance has won acclaim at a national level for leadership in multiple subject areas – by bagging a record tally of four awards, the highest won by a single brand, at the inaugural Insurance Industry Awards of Sri Lanka 2016.
Asian Alliance Insurance was nominated for seven awards – five in the Life Insurance segment and two in the General Insurance segment.  Asian Alliance Insurance was the recipient of the awards for ‘Excellence in Agency Distribution’ and ‘Excellence in Growth’ for Life Insurance, ‘Technology Innovation’ for General Insurance as well as ‘Excellence in Growth’ for Motor Insurance. The high profile awards ceremony was conducted by the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) and Fintelekt and the accolades were handed over at a gala event held on 15th July at the Taj Samudra Hotel.
“These accolades that have been independently evaluated by the industry, which recognize Asian Alliance’s excellence and leadership in many key areas of operations at a national level, are a strong endorsement of our strategy and mission,” Asian Alliance Insurance Managing Director – Iftikar Ahamed stated. “Asian Alliance’s continuous success in clinching national and international level accolades reflects the company’s commitment and passion to perform at the highest level.”
