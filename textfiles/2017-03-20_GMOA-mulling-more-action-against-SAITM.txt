The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said today it would hold another round of talks with the parties concerned to pressure the government to resolve the SAITM issue without further delay.

It said it would be compelled to resort to trade union action if the matter continues.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a media briefing that they would launch a token strike and cancel private practice.

“We will talk to university deans, lecturers, students, political parties and anyone else who is supporting us in this battle against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
