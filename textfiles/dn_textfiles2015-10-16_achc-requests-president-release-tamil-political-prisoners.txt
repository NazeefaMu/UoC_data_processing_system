ACHC requests President to release Tamil political prisoners

The All Ceylon Hindu Congress (ACHC) in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested to release Tamil political prisoners languishing in jails.
The Congress appealed to the President to do justice to these prisoners by releasing them during the Navaraththri period.
"All Hindus will appreciate if Your Excellency's government can arrange for the release of all prisoners before Deepavali," the letter stated.
The Congress said that it made a similar appeal to the President in January this year.
"We urge that the Hindu Priests be shown clemency together with other prisoners who are also entitled to justice and fair treatment"
Excerpts from the letter: " A Hindu Priest has been sentenced to jail, despite his plea that he was forced to make a confession under duress. In that connection, we annex hereto a copy of the report given by the J.M.O dated June 10, 2002 which details how he was allegedly assaulted and humiliated while in custody.
"Another Hindu Priest is to face trial and he too claims that he was forced to make a confession under duress".
"We urge that the Hindu Priests should be shown clemency while the other prisoners are also entitled to justice and fair treatment". "During this holy period of Navaraththri we appeal to Your Excellency to do justice by these prisoners," the letter adds.
