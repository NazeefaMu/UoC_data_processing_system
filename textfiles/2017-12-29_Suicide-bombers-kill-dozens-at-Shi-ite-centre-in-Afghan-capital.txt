Suicide bombers  kill dozens  at Shi段te centre in Afghan capital


	





Suicide bombers stormed a Shi段te cultural centre and news agency in the Afghan capital on Thursday, killing more than 40 people and wounding scores, many of them students attending a conference. 


Islamic State said in an online statement that it was responsible for the attack, the latest in a series the movement has claimed on Shi段te targets in Kabul. 


Waheed Majrooh, a Spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, said 41 people, including four women and two children, had been killed and 84 wounded, most suffering from burns. 


The attack occurred during a morning panel discussion on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Sunni-majority Afghanistan at the Tabian Social and Cultural Centre, witnesses said. 


The floors of the centre, at the basement level, were covered in blood as wailing survivors and relatives picked through the debri. Deputy Health Minister Feda Mohammad Paikan said 35 bodies had been brought into the nearby Istiqlal hospital. Television pictures showed many of the injured suffered serious burns. 


The bloodshed followed an attack on a private television station in Kabul last month, which was also claimed by the local affiliate of Islamic State. 


Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement on Twitter denying involvement in the attack. 


Over the past two years, Islamic State in Khorasan, as the local group is known, has claimed a growing number of attacks on Shi段te targets in Afghanistan, where sectarian attacks were previously rare.
