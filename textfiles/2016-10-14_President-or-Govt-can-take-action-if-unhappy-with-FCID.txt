While declining to comment on the views expressed by President Maithripala Sirisena on the FCID at a function held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on Wednesday, its Chief DIG Ravi Waidyalankara said action could be taken in case the President or the Government was not happy with the manner in which the FCID functioned.

“I am aware about the remarks made by President Sirisena but I cannot comment on them being a public servant. However, the President or the government can take action against the FCID if they are not happy about its activities,” he said without elaborating further. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
