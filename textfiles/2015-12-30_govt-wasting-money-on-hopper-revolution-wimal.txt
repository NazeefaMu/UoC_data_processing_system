	National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said today that the government was making arrangements to waste people’s money on celebrations to mark the ‘hopper revolution’ in January.
	Mr. Weerawansa who returned in the country after touring Europe to deliver a number of lectures to the Sri Lankans there on the theme, ‘hybrid court’, said the present government which promoted simplicity was now wasting public funds.
	“This government is preparing to hold festivals for a week to celebrate the hopper revolution of January 8. This is the government which stopped the war victory celebrations,” he told the media outside the Bandaranaike International Airport.
	He said the government was attempting to divert public attention from various grave problems, and that its popularity was rapidly waning.
