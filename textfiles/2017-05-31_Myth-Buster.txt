MYTH: Sitting too close to the TV will damage your vision.  


BUSTED:  “No. Actually there is a misunderstanding with regard to this. The problem is, when children go too near the TV, parents either switch it off or make them sit away from it. Parents should realize that the child sits close to the TV because they can’t see from a distance due to a visual problem. Pushing them back won’t help. If they have normal eyesight and sit near the TV they can get dry eyes, because they keep looking at the light. Otherwise, it’s very difficult for someone to sit too close as its difficult to tolerate the bright light,” explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon from the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
