Afghanistan delays elections in Kandahar after Taliban attack
	

KABUL AFP Oct19, 2018-Afghanistan postponed legislative elections in Kandahar province on Friday, after a Taliban-claimed attack on a US-Afghan security meeting killed a powerful police chief and threatened stability across the south. 
Saturdays parliamentary ballot would be delayed by one week, a spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani said in a statement, following an extraordinary meeting of the National Security Council. 
The Independent Election Commission would announce the new date, he added. 
Preparations for the vote in Kandahar, the Talibans birthplace, were thrown into turmoil on Thursday when a gunman wearing a security forces uniform opened fire on a gathering of US and Afghan officials. General Scott Miller, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, escaped unhurt, but Kandahar police chief General Abdul Raziq was killed along with the head of the provincial intelligence unit and an Afghan journalist.
 Another 13 people were wounded in the assault inside the heavily fortified provincial governors compound, including the governor and two Americans. The gunman was killed.

Ambassador Dayan Jayatilleka visits Russias Academic and Policy community
	
October 16th was marked by the first visit Ambassador Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka and Madame Sanja Jayatilleka paid to Russias academic community, meeting with the Ambassadors long-standing contacts at the Russian Centre for Policy Studies, known to the international community as PIR CENTRE. 
The Ambassador and Madame Jayatilleka were welcomed in a fine 1870s estate, which, since 1944, has been home to the Soviet, then Russian Diplomatic Academy, the core institution of Russian Foreign Service education and research. PIR CENTRE, established exactly 50 years later in 1994, has been widely recognized as one of Russias leading think tanks in international policy studies, with particular focus on non-proliferation and disarmament, global security, nuclear policy, with a strong regional studies component covering Iran, Middle East and Asia-Pacific studies. Numerous publications, periodicals, analyses and reports are published by PIR and made available through Internet, including the longest-established Russian journal on international security, Security Index, in which Dr. Jayatilleka collaborated during his postings as Ambassador in Geneva and Paris. 

Numerous publications, periodicals, analyses and reports are published by PIR and made available through Internet, including the longest-established Russian journal on international security, Security Index, in which Dr. Jayatilleka collaborated during his postings as Ambassador in Geneva and Paris
Though a fully independent non-government institution, PIR CENTRE has provided valuable expertise for some of the Russian Foreign Ministry programs; most of PIR scholars are staff or guest lecturers at MGIMO (Moscow State University of International Relations under the Russian MFA) and lead seminars and other activities at MFAs Diplomatic Academy. 
Notably, the Dual Degree MA program in Non-Proliferation Studies was founded by PIR CENTRE in 2016, as a joint curriculum of MGIMO and the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey (USA), enrolling not only Russian and US students but also those from several other countries, including China, Canada, Spain, Mexico and others. PIR CENTRE noted the large numbers of Sri Lankan students coming to Russia every year and invited those of them with background and further interests in international policy, global security and counter-terrorism studies, to join this 3-semester program, or PIR CENTREs Summer School on international security. 
The Ambassador received an open invitation to participate, as a guest of honour, lecturer or discussion leader, in any of the academic events organised by PIR CENTRE. The invitation was acknowledged gratefully with a note that such academic events would highlight the growing role of Sri Lanka in the Indo-Pacific region in the context of new global policy trends, dynamics and problems. 
Ambassador Dr. Jayatilleka and Madame Jayatilleka were happy to meet again, this time in Moscow, with their long-term academic contact  Dr. Vladimir A. Orlov, PIR CENTRE founder, Security Index editor-in-chief and member of the Advisory Board of the Russian Federation Government. The Ambassador acknowledged his fruitful correspondence with PIR CENTRE CEO, Dr. Albert F. Zulkharneev whom Dr. Jayatilleka was happy to meet in person, and their colleagues Dr. Vadim B. Kozyulin, Director, Asian Security Studies, Dr. Adlan R. Margoyev, Director, Non-Proliferation, Russian Nuclear Policy and Iranian Nuclear Program Studies Director, Dr. Andrey A. Baklitsky, Leading Expert in Middle East Studies, along with Ms. Julia Tseshkovskaya, Advisor to PIR CENTRE Founder.

Devika Perera (nee de Alwis) - Third Year Remembrance
	
Today marks the third death anniversary of my beloved sister, Devika.
Every human being is unique in his or her own way and Devika had a passion to serve God and as a result the less fortunate people, to talk to them, to pray for them and be a part of them. She even opened her doors to them in her Hendala home to teach the Word of God every Tuesday. She had compassion towards other human beings.
A good friend, a beloved teacher, a prayer warrior, an evangelist, Devika was one such gracious, compassionate, kind and admirable human being. Her love and company will be missed forever by all.
Our hearts are full of affection, gratitude, appreciation and honour for her. She was a beloved wife to Yohan, a caring mother to Dinushka and Arvin, a lovable sister and sister-in-law, a beloved aunt, cousin and a good friend to all.
Born on 27th July 1961 to Leslie and Venetia de Alwis, of Kerawalapitiya, Hendala, Devika had two elder sisters, Ingrid who lives in Canada and I. She was educated at C.M.S Ladies College, Colombo and was a Head Girl of the school. Devika, taught art at Ladies College. She used to work late hours helping to make the backdrops, design costumes and props for school plays and stage activities. She was persevering and never gave up whatever she undertook to do in spite of herbusy schedule.
She was also the teacher in charge of the Student Christian Movement and loved taking students on camps and training them for the annual Bible Quiz organized by the Bible Society. She was also a Sunday School teacher at the Hendala Baptist Church for many years.

Everyone felt welcome in her home and there wasnt a single day that she didnt greet one with her affection and charming smile, glittering eyes and lovable personality. She had an admirable ability to relate both to the young, and the not so young, and the affluent, as well as the not so affluent.
If one had a personal problem they would confide in Aunty Dee as she was better known and were assured of valuable Christ-centered advice and a strong hand of support. In addition to her love for art, she loved to sing for the Lord. 
Devika, was very keen on studying the Word of God and she even commenced a course to obtain her divinity degree. She wanted to have a good knowledge of the Bible. 
There was never a moment when she lay idle in good health or otherwise. She was so busy, we could not find time to meet her during the day. Her life was rich and complete. Her life was not measured by material comfort but God-given human qualities, which she shared with others to brighten many lives.
We are indeed honoured and privileged to have been a part of her family.
Devika, we miss you so much, but you will remain in our hearts forever till we meet again.

Dissolving Director Boards - Decision not unusual: Harin
	
The decision to dissolve the Boards of Directors of the Board of Investments (BOI), the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank was planned some time back in keeping with the requirement to change them every two and a half years, UNP Spokesman and Minister, Harin Fernando said yesterday.
He told a media briefing that what was done was the practise followed for some time.
The usual norm is to change the boards of institutions such as BOI every two and half years, the minister said while highlighting the fact that there was no serious rift between the President and the Prime Minister, the minister said and added that the devil is not so black as it's shown to be.
When asked whether the relevant ministers had discussions with the President on this matter, he said the ministers were engaged in regular dialogue with the president to see that capable people were included in the boards.
Mr. Fernando mentioned that the President had the power to dissolve the boards of directors. (Yohan Perera)

Dissolving director boards - Only subject minister can do so: Kiriella
	
In the wake of President Maithripala Sirisena dissolving the director boards of the two State banks, Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said it was the subject minister who had the authority to do so.
He told those gathered at the launching of the load scheme, 'Lak Diriya' in Kandy that he had read media reports about the director boards of Peoples Bank and the Bank of Ceylon being dissolved.
It is only the subject minister who had the authority to do so. However, the President has written to me as the subject minister requesting me to dissolve the director boards using the powers vested in me. I asked the President to submit a list of names to be included in the boards. News stories of director boards being dissolved can sully the international reputation of the banks and will have a major impact on the economy. Such news items are treacherous, the minister said.
He said the 2019 Budget would provide the people a host of relief measures. (Kelum Bandara)

Ending poverty; Not charity, but justice
	

The day after the United Nations World Food Day which we observed on Tuesday, October 16, the world body on Wednesday marked the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty with the significant theme being Coming together with those furthest behind to build an inclusive world of universal respect for human rights and dignity.
In a statement, the UNs Economic and Social Affairs Department said 2018 marked the 70th anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and it was important to recall the fundamental connection between extreme poverty and human rights, and that people living in poverty were disproportionately affected by many human rights violations. 
World poverty fighter and French Catholic priest, Fr. Joseph Wresinski was the first to highlight this direct link between human rights and extreme poverty. In February 1987, he appealed to the Human Rights Commission to examine the question of extreme poverty and human rights and eloquently captured the nexus between human rights and extreme poverty with his profound observation: Wherever men and women are condemned to live in extreme poverty, human rights are violated. To come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our solemn duty.
According to the UN, government policies alone cannot create the social inclusion that is fundamental to reaching those left furthest behind and overcoming poverty in all its dimensions. The commemoration of October 17 each year, when people living in poverty take the floor and share their experiences, demonstrates how we can achieve greater social inclusion by enabling people from all walks of life to come together to respect the human rights and dignity of people living in poverty. 
It underscores the importance of reaching out to people living in poverty and building an alliance around their priorities with citizens from all backgrounds to end extreme poverty. It recognizes the important mutual roles and relationships we have with each other based on our common and equal dignity. The persistence of poverty, including extreme poverty, is a major concern for the UN and at its 72nd session, the General Assembly launched the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (20182027), under the theme Accelerating global actions for a world without poverty. It is important that the Third Decades inter-agency, system-wide plan of action to coordinate the poverty eradication efforts of the UN system includes an effective partnership with people living in poverty.
The International Day for the Eradication of Poverty can strongly complement such initiatives because it aims to ensure that the active participation of people living in extreme poverty and those furthest behind is a driving force in all efforts made to overcome poverty, including in the design and implementation of programmes and policies which affect them. Only by creating and nurturing a genuine partnership with people living in poverty will it be possible to build an inclusive world where all people can enjoy their full human rights and lead lives with dignity, the UN says. Let us remember that ending poverty is not a matter of charity but a question of justice, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says in a message to mark the occasion. 
In Sri Lanka, the shaky Coalition Government as often stresses that its mission is to build a just, peaceful and all inclusive society, much in line with the UN theme for poverty eradication this year. Although there was a delay of about a three and a half years, the government appears to be going all out to implement major eco-friendly and sustainable development projects such as Gamperaliya, Grama Shakthiya, Enterprise Sri Lanka and several hundred schemes to build houses with basic facilities and a small piece of land for homeless people. As the UN says, just giving some charity like Janasaviya or Samurdhi is not the answer for those trapped in poverty. Instead what need to be done is to give them houses and properties of their own, with provision being made to provide well-paid, productive jobs for one or two members of each family. That will restore their human dignity and their human rights to be responsible citizens who play a role in development and whose voices are heard in decision-making.

Govt. turns down gas price hike request
	
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday rejected the requests made by gas companies to add their transport costs to the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) to come up with the new price of domestic gas cylinders district-wise.
Minister Rishad Bathiudeen has turned down these requests while addressing representatives of Litro Gas Lanka (LGL) at the Ministry yesterday.
Your support to the government and Sri Lankans right now is very important and our priority is to safeguard the consumers, the Minister said.
The Litro gas representatives requested Minister Bathiudeen and the CAA to revise the transport cost component within the LPG pricing formula already agreed by the CAA upward.
They said the cost of diesel had increased rapidly since 2007 thereby increasing LPG transport costs, which they claim have reached a level where they cannot operate profitably any more and that the industry could face an imminent shut down if things continue in this way.
Minister Bathiudeen addressing company representatives, said,There have been changes in global market LPG rates as well as local transport costs due to international crude oil price hikes. The crude price hike is hurting our economy in many ways and the LPG industry is no different. At present global crude oil prices are at a four year high and our consumers are facing the impact directly.
We have already allowed District-to-District LPG prices with adjustments for transport, which is the pricing framework now in effect. Revising LPG prices again at this moment is very damaging to our consumers. Our priority should be to safeguard them, Minister Bathiudeen added.
The CAA has the authority to raid any vendor who violates these LPG MRPs. According to Section 60 of CAA Act No 9 of 2009, conviction results in fines and even imprisonment.
The price of a domestic gas cylinder in Colombo is presently Rs.1733. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

OUR INSIGNIFICANCE
	

Suppose aliens existed, and that some had been watching our planet for its entire forty-five million centuries, what would they have seen Over most of that vast time-span, earths appearance altered very gradually. Continents drifted; ice-cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved and became extinct. 
But just in a tiny sliver of earths history -- the last hundred centuries -- the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signalled the start of agriculture, and then urbanization. We are at the very end of that sliver.

We want in our world honesty, compassion, responsibility, love, fairness and justice. And good governance of home, nation and the world. How many of us can put our hand upon the heart and say we have never failed these ideals

So begins a new book by Martin Rees, Britains Astronomer Royal, On the Future: Prospects for Humanity.
There is much in this short, very readable book -- the disturbing, sometimes positive, sometimes negative, future of biotech, artificial intelligence, global warming, medicine, ageing, communications, nuclear energy, weapons development, sustainability, agricultural research, poverty and employment, but its centerpiece is astronomy.
Over the last 50 years, our knowledge of the universe has grown exponentially. Today we know our sun is one of one hundred billion stars in our galaxy, which is itself one of at least one hundred billion other galaxies. These stars orbit around a central hub where lurks a massive black hole. Neither we humans nor any creature living light-years away could ever hope to meet each other. For humans, it would take tens of thousands of years to reach the nearest star. At best, there might eventually be a connection established by radio signals. Astronomers with their quite amazing telescopes have detected echoes of the big bang that triggered our entire universe 13.8 billion years ago. The universe is still expanding. This is how it was born -- and with it, all the basic particles of nature.
The great American astronomer Carl Sagan wrote in 1990 of the photo taken of the earth by the probe Voyager 1 from a distance of six billion kilometres. The earth appeared as a pale blue dot. His observation was almost poetic: Look again at that dot. Thats here. Thats home. Thats us -- on it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you have ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. Every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there -- on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

Is life a fluke If we could find vestigial-life forms elsewhere in the solar system it would be of epochal importance. That would tell us life wasnt a rare fluke but was widespread in the cosmos.

More than that, Rees explains, We are literally the ashes of long-dead stars -- or the nuclear waste from the fuel that made stars shine.
Eminent nineteenth century thinkers argued that life must pervade the cosmos because, otherwise, such vast domains of space would seem such a waste of the Creators efforts (My own observation is that if there were a God, then He must think that creating life on this planet was a grave mistake, given what weve done with it.)
Is life a fluke If we could find vestigial-life forms elsewhere in the solar system it would be of epochal importance. That would tell us life wasnt a rare fluke but was widespread in the cosmos. Even then, that would not be enough to show that intelligent life exists elsewhere. It is most likely that since lifes origin requires such special contingencies that it only happened once in our entire galaxy.
By the time the reader has digested the riches of Martin Reess discussion, he or she would have absorbed the essentials of astronomy. One thought I had when I put the book down was to wonder what my grand, grandchildren would get to know about our universe and what they would do with that knowledge. Will they manage to save our planet from self-destruction because of war, climate change, massive earth-wide rebellion by the less well-off or artificial intelligence getting out of control (It could be, at the rate we are going, that would happen
even sooner.)
Our universe might go on expanding forever, but are our horizons Woody Allen once said, eternity was very long, especially towards the end. But thats only if we contrive to make it so.
This is the only existence we know or are ever likely to know. We try and make the best of it. And so we should, which should mean not enjoining war, war crimes and crimes against humanity, thuggishness, destructiveness, criminality, discrimination and exploitation.
We want in our world honesty, compassion, responsibility, love, fairness and justice. And good governance of home, nation and the world. How many of us can put our hand upon the heart and say we have never failed these ideals
We had better get on with life for all its faults and complexities . Worrying over the fact that we are less than a pin-prick in our galaxy gets us nowhere. We must give of our best, make the best, adore our world and its peoples and then peacefully fade away, our job of living on this quite insignificant planet well done.

Over fifty feared killed in India train accident
	

Amritsar, (Hindustan Times), Oct 19, 2018 - At least 50 people were killed and several injured when a train ran into a crowd watching Dussehra celebrations in Amritsars Dhobi Ghat near Jaura Phatak railway crossing in Punjab.
The incident took place at around 6:45 pm. A crowd of around 300 people was watching Ravan effigy burn, additional district commissioner of police, city-2, Lakhbir Singh said.
When the effigy of Ravana burnt, the whole area resonated with the sound of the crackers. At this time, a DMU train no. 74943 came and ran into people standing on the track, filming videos of the burning effigy.
Subdivisional magistrate Rajesh Sharma said death toll had mounted to 50, according to PTI.
Another police officer of Amritsar police said around 35 people has received serious injuries in the incident.
Eyewitnesses said there were no barricading near the railway tracks and the people were forced to see the Dusshehra ceremony by standing on tracks. The effigy of Ravana was being burnt around 200 feet away from the railway track.
ANI quoted Northern Railway CPRO as saying that due to some incident, people started running towards gate no. 27 between Amritsar and Manawala.
News agency PTI said according to officials, two trains arrived from opposite direction at the same time giving little opportunity to people to escape.

Police probe whether terror accused set up by brother of Aussie Sportsman
	
The brother of a prominent Australian sportsperson may have been involved in setting up a 25-year-old Sri Lankan student over an alleged Sydney terror plot.
Charges against Mohamed Kamer Nilar Nizamdeen were formally dropped by NSW police on Friday after the 25-year-old spent 40 days in a supermax jail accused of concocting an ISIS-inspired terror plot.
The plan, detailed in a notebook found inside Nizamdee's desk at the University of NSW, was to allegedly target iconic Sydney land marks and high-profile Australians including former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and former Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.
The Sri Lankan student was freed on bail last month after the sole piece of evidence against him fell apart. (TenDaily)

Any visit would be the first by a pope to the reclusive state which does not allow priests to be permanently stationed there. There is little information on how many of its citizens are Catholic, or how they practice their faith.

Asked if Kim should send a formal invitation, Moons office quoted the Pope as responding to Moon: your message is already sufficient but it would be good for him to send a formal invitation.
I will definitely answer if I get the invitation, and I can go.
The pope is expected to be in Asia during a trip to Japan next year.

President Sirisenas Cabinet comments strike  a RAW nerve in India
	

By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj
Maithripala Sirisena is a man of many surprises. Sri Lankas sixth executive President has a penchant to make controversial remarks and startling revelations on more than one occasion. Most of these sensational disclosures explode in the public domain with a powerful bang and then fizzle out into pathetic whimpers. The latest in this series were some comments purportedly made by President Sirisena at the Cabinet ministers meeting last week concerning an alleged conspiracy to assassinate him and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The remarks which seemingly insinuated that Indias overseas espionage agency known as RAW (research and analysis wing) was involved in the plot, naturally struck a raw nerve in New Delhi. This could have caused a major dispute between India and Sri Lanka but thankfully a potential crisis seems to have been averted for the moment due to diplomatic damage control done adroitly by our big neighbour across Palk Strait. And in Sri Lanka, once again sections of the media were made the scapegoats!
It all began with a news story in English appearing in the website Economy Next. The website run competently by experienced professionals has built up a solid reputation through its interesting and informative reports. Several national newspapers in Sri Lanka re-produce news stories appearing in Economy Next, sometimes even as lead stories.
Sri Lankas Cabinet of ministers chaired by the President usually meets every week on Tuesdays. The current weeks Cabinet meeting was held on October 16 and was presided over by Maithripala Sirisena himself. Two items of interest in the Cabinet meeting were a heated discussion between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the issue of awarding the East Port Terminal at the Colombo Harbour to India and President Sirisena complaining that the government had not taken any constructive action about the alleged plot to assassinate him and Gotabaya Rajapaksa. It was the assassination affair that caused the big stir later on. Earlier, a media conference had been scheduled at noon on 16th where details of the conspiracy to assassinate President Sirisena were to be revealed. However, this was postponed. It is surmised that the press conference was timed to coincide with the Cabinet meeting revelations. However, the expected to be explosive media meet did not take place as planned on October 16. But verbal fireworks did explode at the Cabinet meeting on the same day.

Two items of interest in the Cabinet meeting were a heated discussion between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the issue of awarding the East Port Terminal at the Colombo Harbour to India and President Sirisena complaining that the government had not taken any constructive action about the alleged plot to assassinate him and Gotabaya Rajapaksa

POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT IN ECONOMY NEXT
In journalist parlance Economy Next had a scoop about what transpired on the Cabinet meeting. The website posted a news story written by its political correspondent at 9.24 p.m. on October 16 under the heading Sri Lanka President drops bombshell, accuses India. Following is the news story in full 
Sri Lankas President Maithripala Sirisena shocked his Cabinet on Tuesday by accusing neighbouring India of plotting to assassinate him on the eve of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to New Delhi, a ministerial source said.
A visibly upset Sirisena accused his senior coalition partner, the United National Party (UNP), of not taking an alleged conspiracy to kill him as well as former secretary to the ministry of defence, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, seriously.
The President said that RAW (Indias external intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing) was behind the plot, a minister, who declined to be named, said.
Sirisena also said he was unhappy with the police Criminal Investigation Department (CID) inquiry into the plot and faulted the Law and Order Minister for what he called the very slow progress of the inquiry.
A ministerial source said the Prime Minister was unusually assertive at Cabinet on Tuesday and appeared to be irritated by Sirisenas barrage against his government. The premier had also retorted in annoyance, much to the surprise of some of the juniors in Cabinet.
The alleged plot was disclosed by a paid employee of the presidential secretariat earlier last month. He had also worked as an informant of the police. Based on his testimony, the police have suspended a Deputy Inspector-General Nalaka de Silva who is said to have been involved in the alleged assassination plot.
Weeks after the so called whistle blower identified as Namal Kumara went public about the plot to kill Sirisena and Rajapaksa, the Presidents office issued a statement denying he was in their pay and called for a separate investigation into his conduct.
However, media reports said the Presidential Secretariat had issued letters to Namal Kumara confirming his employment with an anti-narcotics task force directly under the President.
Official sources close to the investigation said they have not found any evidence to support Namal Kumaras claims of a plot, which also involved an Indian national who was resident in Sri Lanka pending an asylum application with the UN agency for refugees.
The ministerial source said the President did not give details of how India was involved in the plot and several Cabinet ministers were aghast at his claim. I think it was uncalled for (to accuse India) because he did not provide any evidence to support his claim, the source said.
So far, what we have is the figment of someones imagination of an assassination plot, the source said. What can now be done is to look at the genesis of this story and how it came about.
The Presidential Secretariat scheduled a press conference at noon on Tuesday to disclose what it called the details of the assassination plot, but cancelled it at the eleventh hour. The Presidents former Coordinating Officer and the current Senior Advisor Shiral Lakthilaka was to preside at the press conference.
In the meantime, Gotabaya Rajapaksa has lodged a formal complaint with the police over media reports of the twin assassination plot. When he was asked if he suspected any credible plan to kill him, the former official had said he was making the complaint to have the media reports investigated.
The atmosphere in Cabinet had been unpleasant when they were discussing the awarding of the East Terminal of the Colombo Port to India, those at the Cabinet said. Sirisena is opposed to granting India access to develop the terminal just next to the China-run Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT).
The CICT was at the centre of a diplomatic spat with India during the last year of the Rajapaksa administration when the then government allowed Chinese submarines to dock there without New Delhi being in the loop.
Wickremesinghe travels to New Delhi on Wednesday for talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speed up Indian-backed projects in the island, including the East Terminal project.
On the cards is also the development of the currently unused oil tank farm at China Bay in Trincomalee.

The Sri Lankan Government issued an elaborate denial of the report and clarifications came from the highest level. Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera slammed it as a disinformation campaign, urging reporters to be responsible

MEERA SRINIVASAN IN THE HINDU
A few hours after the Economy Next report, the Indian English newspaper The Hindu also posted a news story on its web edition filed by its Colombo Correspondent Meera Srinivasan. The news item was posted at 11.04 p.m. on October 16. It was subsequently updated at 3.44 p.m. on October 17. The news story by Meera Srinivasan in The Hindu headlined Sri Lankan President Sirisena alleges that RAW is plotting his assassination read as follows 
In a charge that might seriously impair New Delhi-Colombo relations, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday accused Indias Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of plotting his assassination.
At the weekly Cabinet meeting, Mr. Sirisena told ministers that the Indian intelligence agency was trying to kill him, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan, The Hindu has learnt from sources present at the discussion.
We were just shocked when he said it, a source said, requesting anonymity.
When contacted for verification, a senior officer at the Presidents media unit said: We will verify this and revert. However, there has been no response till Tuesday night.
President Sirisenas claim comes days before Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes scheduled visit to New Delhi, meet Mr. Modi and discuss bilateral matters, including key, India-assisted projects on the island.
This is not the first time a Sri Lankan leader has accused the Indian agency of interference. Following his poll defeat in 2015, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa held RAW among those responsible for the change in regime.
Mr. Sirisenas allegation, the sources said, came when he raised concerns over the governments indifference to an assassination plot targeting him. Reports of the said plot emerged last month when an individual named Namal Kumara, part of an anti-corruption outfit, claimed he was aware of a plan to assassinate Mr. Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The CID interrogated Mr. Kumara. The police subsequently arrested an Indian national late in September. Local media reported that the Indian, identified as M. Thomas hailing from Kerala, claimed he knew of the plot.
However, the Sri Lankan Government issued an elaborate denial of the report and clarifications came from the highest level. Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera slammed it as a disinformation campaign, urging reporters to be responsible.
At Tuesdays meeting, Mr. Sirisena reportedly said the Indian national must be a RAW agent trying to kill me. The Indian PM may not be aware. That is often the case. Trump may not be aware of CIAs similar moves.
The Hindu, on Tuesday evening, spoke to multiple sources in government  across political parties  who attended the meeting, and they confirmed this.
Tuesdays meeting also saw a heated argument between President Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe, when a Cabinet paper on developing the Colombo Port came up for discussion. Sources said Mr. Sirisena vehemently objected to any Indian involvement in upgrading its east container terminal  a project that New Delhihas been keen to take up.
However, Mr. Wickremesinghe is said to have countered by saying Colombo had promised New Delhi on collaborating on the project, and it was important to rope in India at the terminal, given that about 80% of the cargo handled at the transshipment hub was meant for India. He reportedly sought a weeks time to sort out the issue, since he would be meeting Mr. Modi soon.
Meanwhile, the Presidents media unit on Tuesday called off a scheduled press meeting by Mr. Sirisenas advisers on the reported assassination plot.
When contacted, Presidential Adviser Shiral Lakthilaka told The Hindu: We cancelled it because we are awaiting more information. Asked if it was connected to Mr. Sirisenas reported remarks at the Cabinet, he said: No, it had nothing to do with that.

SPOKEN TO TWO CABINET MINISTERS
The Hindus Colombo correspondent Meera Srinivasan made it a point to emphasise in her report that she had spoken to multiple sources in government  across political parties  who attended the meeting, and they had confirmed it. Subsequently, in an Editors note published in The Hindu it was said the correspondent had spoken to two Cabinet ministers and got indirect confirmation from two others before filing the report after extensive checking and cross-checking.
Apart from Economy Next and The Hindu several Sri Lankan newspapers including the Daily Mirror also reported details in different degrees of the controversial Cabinet meeting. The London-based Lanka e-news website had also carried a news story with some interesting details about the Cabinet meeting. At least one Colombo newspaper re-published the Hindu story as its lead story. Although Economy Next had broken the news first, it was the news story appearing in the Hindu that had greater impact particularly in India. Economy Next was only a recently begun website whereas The Hindu celebrated its 140th anniversary a few weeks ago. The newspaper has acquired a reputation over the years of being the most authoritative voice on Sri Lanka related issues in the Indian media. Therefore a Hindu story on Sri Lanka was effectively credible. Besides the news story had a significant Indian dimension to it.

Taranjit Singh Sandhu however cancelled the trip in order to meet President Sirisena on Wednesday. This he did and secured an appointment at very short notice to meet Sirisena. By this time President Sirisena too was fully aware of serious concerns in New Delhi about the remarks allegedly made by him at the Cabinet meeting. The President was prepared to explain what had happened to the envoy

The Hindu news story sent alarm bells ringing in Indias South Block. The Central Secretariat in India is situated on Raisina Hill in New Delhi. The Central Secretariat comprises two symmetrically constructed identical buildings known as North and South blocks on either side of the Rajpath boulevard leading to Rashtrapati Bhavan or Presidents House. The North block houses the key Finance and Home Affairs Ministry while South block has the Prime Ministers office and Ministries of Defence and External Affairs.
With Indias South block being alerted by the news in the Hindu, events began to move rapidly. It may be recalled that President Sirisena during his trip to the USA in late September had in a speech to an audience of Sri Lankan origin in New York stated that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were planning to launch air strikes from an airport in Tamil Nadu and bomb Colombo during the final phase of the war in May 2009. This implied that India was harbouring and aiding the LTTE on Indian soil to attack Sri Lanka. Sirisenas assertion was outrageously false. Yet, New Delhi ignored it without any diplomatic query seeking clarification. One reason for that was due to the speech being available only in YouTube and a few websites. It was not reported in any major Sri Lankan or Indian media outlet.

RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS WING (RAW)
President Sirisenas purported reference to RAW at the Cabinet meeting however was different. It had been allegedly made at the all important Cabinet meeting. It had been reported in an important Indian newspaper and other media organs. Moreover, it could not be taken lightly as Indias external agency the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) had been directly implicated. Although President Sirisena had reportedly given a clean chit to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying Modi would not have known, the reality was that Maithripalas remarks amounted to an affront to Premier Modi. This is because the RAW is an adjunct of the Cabinet Secretariat coming under the direct purview of the Prime Minister.
The RAW or R&AW set up in 1968 during the prime ministerial tenure of Indira Gandhi is currently headed by Anil Dhasmana. The chief of RAW is designated as a secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat under the direct command of the Indian Prime Minister. The RAW chief reports administratively to the Cabinet Secretary who in turn reports to the PM. So President Sirisenas reference to the Indian espionage agency placed Narendra Modi in a difficult position. On the one hand it implied that the Indian Prime Minister may have had a hand in the alleged assassination plot. On the other hand if the RAW was acting independently of Modi it meant that the premier was not in control of a key agency under his direct command.
What agitated South block officials further was the personal interest displayed by Premier Narendra Modi in this matter. After being informed of this news the Indian PM told key officials in the External Affairs Ministry and Prime Ministers Secretariat that this matter if true was  very serious and instructed them to give top priority to it. The Indian PM urged his officials to find out the full truth and brief him as soon as possible.

VIJAY KESHAV GOKHALE
Indias South block therefore was understandably concerned over President Sirisenas purported remarks about a RAW hand in the alleged assassination conspiracy. In fact it struck a raw nerve (pun intended) in the upper echelons of the Indian establishment. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj who was in Belaurus was informed of what happened. Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale contacted Indian High Commissioner in Colombo Taranjit Singh Sandhu and was briefed. The Foreign Secretary told the High Commissioner that this allegation against the RAW was a slur on Indias national external intelligence agency and that Prime Minister Modi was hurt by this. High Commissioner Sandhu was instructed to meet President Sirisena as early as possible and seek clarification.
Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale also communicated with his Colombo counterpart Prasad Kariyawasam. The Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary a seasoned official who has served in New Delhi realised the gravity of the situation at once. He in turn communicated with Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana who contacted the President and briefed him of the seriousness of the situation. Minister Marapana also informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. As a result of all these efforts certain damage control initiatives were taken. Colombo went into a defensive mode. Statements were issued by the Cabinet Secretary and Presidents Secretariat. The Sri Lankan External Affairs Ministry also issued a statement.
Meanwhile, High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu got cracking. Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was scheduled to visit India this week and the Indian envoy was to go to New Delhi on October 17 as advance party to finalise the itinerary. Taranjit Singh Sandhu however cancelled the trip in order to meet President Sirisena on Wednesday. This he did and secured an appointment at very short notice to meet Sirisena. By this time President Sirisena too was fully aware of serious concerns in New Delhi about the remarks allegedly made by him at the Cabinet meeting. The President was prepared to explain what had happened to the envoy.

TARANJIT SINGH SANDHU
Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu met with President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on October 17. The President was scheduled to meet with several political party delegations on Wednesday. Some of these appointments were put on hold or delayed in order to accommodate the Indian High Commissioner.
After respectfully explaining the ramifications and implications of Maithripala Sirisenas reported Cabinet meeting remarks, the Indian High Commissioner sought specific clarity from the Sri Lankan President on three counts. Firstly what was the basis on which the President suspected an Indian link in the alleged conspiracy to assassinate him Secondly what was the basis on which the President suspected the involvement of the research and analysis wing in the plot to assassinate him Thirdly was there any explicit reference to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Presidents purported remarks

Mr. Sirisena told ministers that the Indian intelligence agency was trying to kill him, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan, The Hindu has learnt from sources present at the discussion

President Sirisena recounted in detail the information received so far about the alleged assassination conspiracy. The President said he was deeply disappointed by the lack of concern or interest shown by the Prime Minister or other UNP ministers in probing the alleged conspiracy. He pointed out that Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had cast negative aspersions on the credibility of the alleged conspiracy. Members of his own government seemed lethargic to take action and investigate an alleged threat to their government heads life and this deplorable attitude was very hurtful. President Sirisena said his safety and security was at stake and he had been compelled to increase his own personal security. The President made it clear to the Indian envoy that his remarks at the Cabinet meeting were basically critical of the PM and UNP component in the government about no action being taken to probe the assassination plot. He did not criticise or blame India in any way for this state of affairs.
Speaking further President Sirisena told the Indian envoy that one person arrested on suspicion of involvement and detained was an Indian national who was a Malayalam-speaking native of Kerala named Thomas. Now they are saying he is mentally unstable. He said that no further actionhad been taken.

President Sirisena stated that he had merely remarked that an Indian national had been implicated and thereafter had speculated that an Indian espionage agency could have been involved. He had never pointed the finger specifically at the R&AW. Sirisena also told Sandhu that he had never accused Premier Modi in any way. In fact he had gone out of his way to say that Narendra Modi would not know what an espionage agency was doing. The President said he had remarked in the same way about Donald Trump not knowing what the CIA was doing. These were all general remarks and were not specifically directed against the RAW or Premier Modi.

PRIME MINISTER NARENDRA MODI
President Sirisena also blamed some ministers in his Cabinet without naming them as the cause for the controversy. He said his remarks had been taken out of context and distorted and published in the media because some ministers had given journalists wrong information. It was part of a conspiracy by sections in his own government to tarnish his image and portray him as an enemy of India. Speaking further Maithripala Sirisena said he had very high regard for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and enjoyed a close relationship with him. In fact he had lengthy discussions with him in person in Nepal recently. Both of them were common people who had risen to the top through hard work and support of the masses. Therefore some elements hostile to him were trying to drive a wedge between him and Shree Modi. The President also emphasised that he was a genuine friend of India and that should be conveyed to Premier Narendra Modi.
Seizing upon the sentiments expressed by President Sirisena, High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu suggested diplomatically that it would be better if President Sirisena himself spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and explained matters. The suavely articulate Indian envoy told Sirisena that his Prime Minister too held the Lankan President in high esteem and that a personal one to one conversation could allay any doubts about the matter. He said the Indian premier was very concerned about this entire issue and would very much appreciate hearing from Sirisena personally. Such a conversation could bring about greater mutual understanding and strengthen ties between the Lankan President and Indian premier at a personal level as well as enhance Indo-Lanka friendship and cooperation.
President Sirisena was more than willing to talk to Prime Minister Modi. High Commissioner Sandhu suggested that it would be better if the telephone call was initiated from Colombo by the President. Again President Sirisena was ready to do so. Having obtained the Presidents consent High Commissioner returned to his office and hurriedly briefed the External Affairs Ministry. Prime Minister Modi was appraised of the situation. He too was willing to talk to Sirisena. Thus a convenient time was arranged in the afternoon of October 17.

AYU BOWAN EXCELLENCY, HOW ARE YOU
At the appointed hour a call was initiated from Colombo on behalf of President Sirisena. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi came on line. Narendra Modi began the telephonic conversation by saying Ayu Bowan Excellency, how are you Then followed a very interesting 20-minute conversation between the two leaders. Details of the Modi-Sirisena dialogue and consequent developments will be related and analysed in a continuation of this article next week.

Remembering P.C. Fernando on his 20th death anniversary
	
Mr. P.C. Fernando passed away 20 years ago, on 23rd October, 1998, at the age of 64 years. He was born to a very respectable family on 2nd April, 1934.
He graduated from Peradeniya University and was a very Senior Class I Officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service. Luckily I had the opportunity of working for him since 1982 when he was the secretary at the Ministry of State Plantations till his transfer to the Ministry of Fisheries in 1990. He retired from service prematurely in 1991 for personal reasons at the age of 57 years.
He was extremely a kind hearted, peace  loving, very good tempered, upright and generous gentleman of par excellence who led a simple, honourable and tranquil life throughout. First class decision making efficient officer who dealt everything meticulously, shrewdly, scrupulously and promptly.
The period of my working under him was remarkably the best one for me out of my 37 years of service; because, though he was my Boss, he never bossed me or dictated terms and orders, and had implicit trust in me. Accordingly, allowed me to perform my duties freely and independently, without any interferences. Besides, he looked after me very well without any discrimination what-so-ever. Similarly, he moved with everybody in a friendly manner and harnessed the full potential from the limited number of staffs available and got the maximum quanta of work done by them in a very harmonious manner.
Apart from the Ministrial functions, he solely handled the family welfare supervisors project for the estates that had been funded by the U.N.F.P.A for several years which he had able to accomplish successfully in a marvellous manner. In addition, he was entrusted with the Tree Crop (Tea) Rehabilitation Project work, funded by the World Bank and that too was well done and completed within the target period and that had been very highly commended by the Treasury and the World Bank at a Seminar held in Washington.
P.C. Fernandos daughter-in-law, Mrs. Murdu Fernando is in the judicial service and recently she was promoted to the post of Supreme Court judge which is an enviable achievement and it is a great honour for the family in general. If Mr. P.C. Fernando had been alive by now, certainly he would have been very highly delighted over her helm of success in her profession. What a pity that Mr. P.C. Fernando is no more to rejoice over herprofessional success.
My Boss, Mr. P.C. Fernando had been very helpful to me officially and personally and I am ever grateful to him. Specially during the communal riots that erupted in July, 1983, when all our belongings, house, etc., were set on fire and we were left mere destitute, with the only clothes we were wearing on that day. At that dangerous and precarious situation, Mr. P.C. Fernando boldly came to the place where we were sheltered, rushing his life to our rescue and brought us to the Refugee Camp for safety of our lives by his car. Also provided us with food, clothing, etc.
According to our sacred Thirukkural, Helping the people at a crucial moment when they are in difficulty is far more greater than the world. As such, I gratefully remember and pay my tribute to my Boss, Mr. P.C. Fernando on his 20th Death Anniversary. May he rest in peace in the Arms of Jesus! Also, I invoke his blessing on all his dear and loved ones.

Saudi planning to blame intelligence officer for Khashoggis death
	

Saudi Arabia is planning to blame one of its top intelligence officers for journalist Jamal Khashoggis death, it has been claimed. 
The kingdoms rulers could point the finger at General Ahmed al-Assiri, who is close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, sources have claimed. 
They will say he was responsible for a botched interrogation of the writer that the countrys leaders knew nothing about, the New York Times reports. 
Khashoggi, 60, went missing having entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago sparking claims he was tortured and murdered in the building. 
The New York Times said it had spoken to three people with knowledge of the Saudi plans relating to General Assiri, who had earlier served as the spokesman for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen before being promoted to his current job in intelligence. 
Two of the sources said Saudi rulers are set to explain that Assiri had been given verbal permission from the Crown Prince to capture Mr Khashoggi for questioning in Saudi Arabia but that he either overstepped the authorisation or misunderstood his orders. 
The newspaper said Assiri had not responded to requests for comment. Earlier US President Donald Trump said he now believes Khashoggi is dead and warned of very severe consequences should Saudi Arabia be proven responsible. 
Asked about the potential US response to Saudi Arabia, which is accused of murdering the Washington Post columnist and critic of the Saudi regime, Trump said: It will have to be very severe. Its bad, bad stuff.

Stray cats take over Presidents House
	
The Presidential Secretariat has reportedly informed the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) to take immediate steps to remove the stray cats which had invaded the Presidents House.
It said the cat population in the premises was fast increasing.
The Presidents House has been unoccupied for the past three years.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, CMC Chief Veterinary Surgeon Dr. I.V.P. Dharmawardena said the CMC had informed him of this situation but that it was impossible to remove the cats from the premises.
The only option left is to sterilize the female cats and there are no specific animal shelters for cats in Colombo, Dr. Dharmawardena said. We will take steps to deploy a team of veterinary surgeons to the location next week to carry out the sterilizations. (Indika Sri Aravinda)

## Title: Tribute to my Flag Lieutenant

Tribute to my Flag Lieutenant
	
Twenty-five years ago on 18th January 1993, at Fort Hammenhiel, Karinagar, two officers and forty-two sailors, all volunteers from the Navy underwent a special training to start a new unit in our Navy known as the Special Boat Squadron (SBS) or the Naval Commando Unit. 
SBS was formed to fight against LTTE Sea Tigers in lagoons and waterways. Our training also focused to carry out attacks behind the enemy lines to destroy LTTE sea tiger installations. UK Royal Marines Special Boat Squadron was our model. 
I was fortunate enough to command this unit and train my men to be the Bravest of the Brave in the Navy. I was a young Lieutenant Commander at that time and my Second-in-Command was an officer more than 12 years junior and younger to me. He was Acting Sub Lieutenant Samantha Waruna Gallage from Dehiwala. As a student of Dehiwala MMV and member of Kinross Swimming club, he was trained as life saver and was a volunteer life guard at Mount Lavinia beach during weekends. He has saved number of lives from drowning during the weekends. He was an excellent swimmer and done his Naval training extremely well. Samantha was also an excellent boat handler and a
top marksman. 
We trained together for eight months in the Karainagar lagoon with the intention of taking over boat operations in the Jaffna lagoon from our small detachment at Nagadevannturai. 
On 11th November 1993, LTTE launched Operation Frog. Our naval detachment in Nagadevanthuri and Pooneryn Army Complex came under heavy attack from the enemy. One by one small detachments around the main Pooneryn Army Complex fell into the enemys hand like a house of cards and more than 700 military personnel were trapped in Pooneryn. 
As there was no possibility to reinforce the besieged Army Complex from the air, military commanders decided to sent reinforcement troops through an amphibious landing. My unit SBS, the brand-new Naval Special Force was tasked to carry out the first wave of landing. 
Landing at an enemy beach is a suicidal task. If you want to see how it looks like, please watch first half an hour of Steven Spielbergs award-winning film Saving Private Ryan. Its bloody and chaotic. There is no cover for you until you get some cover by crossing the beach area. Enemy obstacles and gun positions will be there to slow down your advance and there is a 90 percent probability of getting killed or injured during
this crossing.
Orders were issued; Samantha and I were commanding two Inshore Patrol Craft (commonly known as Water Jets) which carried fifteen Commandos each, followed by fibreglass boats carrying six Commandos each. My orders were very clear to Samantha. I told him, that I will land first because I want to assess the situation.
Navy Gunboats started bombarding the beach early morning with their 37mm guns, and we were given clearance to do the landing with the lull of heavy gunfire. Our two Water Jets raced towards Pooneryn beach. Two machine guns of enemy started firing towards us and suddenly Samantha increased the speed of his Water Jet and landed first and nullified enemy machine gun position with his grenade launchers.
I was very angry with Samantha. My orders were very clear as I told him that I will be landing first. However, I was very happy that he destroyed enemy gun positions in quick sessions with no casualties to us. The landing was successful and we established the beach head for our landing craft to beach and reinforcements poured in. Rest was history. Pooneryn landing was successful. The SBS was hailed as the Bravest of the Bravein the Navy.
After accomplishing our given task successfully, we returned to Karainagar that evening to rest and relax. That night I asked Samantha why he disobeyed my orders and landed first. He said with tears in his eyes, Sir, I was afraid that you would be hit by enemy machine gun fire! I did not want you to get killed. I told him that he would have had the same fate. He said, Sir, I can die. Thats not a concern. My father and mother will cry. But, not YOU! You have a wife and a son (my son was one year old at that time).
You should live Sir! I want to protect you, Sir! (Ironically, I was the only married person in the SBS at that time.)
This was the calibre of officers and men with whom we went to war. We were fortunate Commanders to have officers like Samantha as our subordinates. They were ready to sacrifice their lives to protect us.
One day I saw Samantha going through the Navy List. Navy List is a book which denotes the seniority and qualifications of naval officers. I asked why he is referring the Navy List and he said as per the seniority gap between two of us when I become a Rear Admiral, he will still be a Lieutenant Commander. I promised him if I made to Rear Admiral one day, I will take him as my Flag Lieutenant [Aide-De-Camp (ADC)]. He was very happy and he had mentioned this even to the SBS senior sailors.
Keeping my promise to Samantha, I never took a flag Lieutenant when I became a Rear Admiral in 2009. Even though Samantha is dead, I kept my promise to him and for last nine years the seat and table of Flag Lieutenant next to my office is kept empty as an honour to my buddy Samantha.
In 1995 Samantha got married to Nishika, a young lady officer of the Navy who was a teacher at our Naval Pre-school. 
Samantha died in an SBS and Army Special Forces joint operation at Nallathannithuduvai in Chalai, Jaffna on October 20, 1996. His only son, Rumal was only eight months old when he sacrificed his life for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our Motherland. He was awarded the Weera Wickrama Vibushanaya posthumously for his valour and bravery during this operation. His wife Nishika died of cancer in 2011, leaving young Rumal alone in this World. Today 22 years old Rumal is doing his higher Education in Australia.
They will grow not old, as we that are left grow old;
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the Sun and in the morning
We will remember them

UN asks SL to repatriate commander in Mali
	
The United Nations asked the Sri Lankan government to immediately repatriate the commander of the Sri Lankan U.N. peacekeeping force in Mali following a review of his human rights background.
Following a review of the human rights background of the commander of the Sri Lankan contingent deployed to the UN Peacekeeping Mission in Mali, the Secretariat has requested that the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka to immediately repatriate him to Sri Lanka, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday addressing the media.
This will be done at their cost, as per normal procedures. This decision to repatriate the commander was made by the UN following a review, based on recently received information. The Secretariat remains engaged with the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka, the spokesman added.
Explaining further, the spokesman also said, all peacekeepers go through vetting. There were some extra procedures done with the Sri Lankan contingents that have gone through this. This decision follows information new information that was received by the UN, and so we acted on that information, and we've now asked the Sri Lankan authorities to find a replacement for the commander of their contingent."

UNP wants Anton Deshapriya investigated
	
Making counter allegations against investor Anton Deshapriya, who had recently accused a state minister of soliciting a bribe, the United National Party (UNP) yesterday called for a thorough investigation on the investor.
UNP Spokesman and Minister, Harin Fernando told a media briefing that there was an invisible hand behind this episode.
Some mischievous elements appear to have urged this investor to make allegations against the ministers. This is a move to sling mud at the government and as such we call for investigations both locally and in Italy with the support of Interpol, he said.
State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe who made counter allegation against Mr. Deshapriya said he had received death threats from the investor and that he had received the last death threat over the phone on October 17, the day he had a news conference at the ministry.
He revealed that this businessman, living in Italy, had defaulted several banks and that his name was included in the CRIB. The state minister who appeared to be emotionally shaken up said he was going through a difficult time after the allegations were made by Mr. Deshapriya with family members relatives and friends calling him to inquire about what was happening.
I could not even talk to my mother for some time after the reports published in the media, he said and added that he would propose re-introducing criminal defamation laws to stop people making false allegations.
Deputy Minister of Law and Order, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha said he too was threatened by the same person some time ago. Mr. Bandara showed pictures of the so called office of this investor in Sri Lanka and some of his photographs.
Mr. Senasinghe is likely to file complaints with the FCID and the CID and also call for an investigation by Interpol as well. (Yohan Perera)
