Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa last evening said Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which was headed by him until 2015 when he lost the Presidential Election, was forcibly snatched by his successor President Maithripala Sirisena.

Addressing a public meeting held in Anamaduwa, former president and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said he did not offer the leadership of the party at any occasion.

He said President Sirisena called a separate convention for SLFP members where new Central Committee was formed under his own consent in an attempt to destroy the party.

“He keeps asking me to leave saying I have lost twice. But, he was the one and only SLFP President who lost his own electorate at a Parliamentary Election. I did not lose twice, but once,” he said.

Meanwhile, he said the government to protect the souls of the general public who elected the government by voting. (Hiran Priyankara)
