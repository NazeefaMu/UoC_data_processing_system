JVP lost because it supported the UNP: Somawansa


	

Former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Somawansa Amarasinghe said it was sad to see the JVP being wiped out at the August 17 general election. Mr. Amarasinghe said the main reason for the debacle was that the JVP was toeing the UNP agenda.
He claimed that the JVP, the main socialist party in the country, had not adhered to the original JVP principles because it was being misled and hoodwinked by the UNP.
“The fate of JVP does not surprise me. Only the JVP could speak out on behalf of the people. The four leaders of the JVP should be removed immediately. They are dishonest that is why the people did not vote for the JVP,” Mr. Amarasinghe said.
He said the newly elected government’s move to establish a national government would fail and a coalition government would be formed with the support of some members of the UNP and UPFA. (Piyumi Fonseka)
