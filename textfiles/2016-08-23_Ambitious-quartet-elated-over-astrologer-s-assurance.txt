Ambitious quartet elated over astrologer’s assurance


	



 

Many politicos in the country had made it a point to consult leading astrologers in the country to get a reading of their future given the far reaching significance attached to Jupiter’s recent transit.

 


Most of them had called on an astrologer who had been a consultant to the leadership of the previous regime.


There were four prominent politicians among those who had approached the astrologers to find out the impact that Jupiter’s transit to a new Zodiac sign would make on their political career and this foursome had been highly concerned over the recent planetary event fearing a possibly a far worse period ahead as they are already under the malefic influence of a Shani Erashtaka. 


The foursome are now highly elated over what the astrologer had predicted regarding their future, they say.


All the four political bigwigs currently going through the Shani Erashtaka are said to be Libra (Thula) natives. One of them is now occupying a very high seat in yahapalanaya.


One of the remaining three is holding a high office in the Diyawanna council. The other two are team members at the top table.  Of the two, one is from Kalutara who is credited to have done much spadework to bring yahapalanaya into power.  The other one is a party leader who teamed up with the Greens quite recently. 


By the way, the astrologer had assured these Libra natives that the Erashtaka – the malefic period they were running would end by next January.
