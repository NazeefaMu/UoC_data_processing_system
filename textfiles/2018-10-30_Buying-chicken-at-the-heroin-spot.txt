A State Lodge high-up caught in the company of two persons found packing heroin in packets, is said to have been released following intervention by a powerful politico from the South.




In a statement given at the cop shop, the State Lodge high-up had claimed that he had gone to the place where heroin was being packed into packets to buy chicken, but there had been no meat stall anywhere near this spot, they say.
