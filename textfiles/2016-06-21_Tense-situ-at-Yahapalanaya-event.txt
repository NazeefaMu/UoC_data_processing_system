Tense situ at Yahapalanaya event


	

A tense situation prevailed at an event organised by the Purawesi Balaya and the National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) being held at the Public Library in Colombo, when several attendees had questioned, why the panel was not paying respects to the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, the former head of the NMSJ.

The attendees had criticised the panel for not observing silence to pay respects to the demised prelate and not mentioning him prior to the beginning of the event.

The members of the panel had refuted the claims that they had forgotten the monk but had observed silence afterwards. The theme of the event is ‘Is this the Good Governance promised on January 8?’  (Piyumi Fonseka)
