WPC JHU members to act independently


	

The three Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Western Provincial councillors would act independently in future, JHU National Organiser and Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said today.
Ven. Thembuwana Piyananda Thera, Mr. Warnasinghe and Nirosha Athukorala are the three JHU members in the WPC and they were elected from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance ticket.
The decision had been taken soon after WP Chief Minister Isura Devapriya took over the Health Ministry, which was earlier held by Mr. Warnasinghe, on Wednesday.
The Chief Minister took over the Health Ministry following the defeat of the ministry’s financial expenditure on December 22 by a majority of 22 votes with 23 councillors voting in favour and 45 against.
However, when the financial statement of the Health Ministry was tabled in the council on Thursday, it was unanimously passed along with the financial statements of other ministries of the council.  
Former health minister Warnasinghe said the unanimous approval of the financial statements of all ministries proved the presence of a hidden agenda in the defeat of his former ministry's financial statement. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
