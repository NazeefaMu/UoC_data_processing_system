CR favourites to beat CH

It was always of spectator interest in the past to see the battle between Colombo's two leading rugby clubs CR&FC and CH&FC battling it out for supremacy in their traditional encounter when they meet in the 2015/16 Dialog 'A' division inter-club league rugby first round match at Race Course grounds at 4.00 pm today.
Both teams have not been performing to their full potential and therefore have mixed fortunes in their previous outings this season.
CR, with a well-balanced side supplemented by their fighting spirit will go out as favourites while the lads from CH & FC will take every effort to make the day tough for the Red Shirts by at least cutting down the winning margin.
CR & FC got off to a flying start this season when they came from behind 9-15 to down Army SC 35-15 but went down to the rejuvenated Havelock's side by 34-18 with a pathetic performance where nothing really clicked for them at their home grounds at Longden Place last week.
On the other hand the lads from Maitland Crescent kicked off the season with a 3-80 thrashing from reigning league rugby champs Kandy SC at Nittawela in the first week and suffered another beating 0-62 at the hands of Police at Police Park last week.
The lads from Longden Place will be led by ex Peterite second row forward Ishan Noor while former Zahira College flanker Rifkhan Siddiq will captain the Maitland Crescent boys.
