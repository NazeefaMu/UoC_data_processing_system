Unravelling the mystery shrouding the magical number


	



 

In my last article (that appeared on the Jyotisha page on May 26) I cited personalities, even Government authorities in USA, who had - based on their great discomfort due to being associated with the Number of the Beast -666- replaced it with another number considered favourable. Even former US President Ronald Reagan had reacted with horror towards Number 666 of his new residential address and changed it to another number before going into its occupation.

 


And if you carry a symbol representing the Satanic number with you, day in and day out, would it produce some specific effect on you?



Now the question arises as to what makes the big businesses worldwide take the exact opposite attitude towards the magical number 666?  Why do they willingly and purposefully associate themselves with the number of the beast, by displaying it on their bodies or incorporating it into their business logos? Does it make a difference to a person wearing a T-shirt with the Satanic number, or having a 666 tattooed permanently on his body? What might be the advantage of being associated with the 666?


Could a bottle containing an energy drink displaying the number of the beast have some specific effect on a human who consumes this drink? If the answer is in the negative, then the question: WHY are they using the magic number? Remains unanswered. 


And if you carry a symbol representing the Satanic number with you, day in and day out, would it produce some specific effect on you?



 

Nexus between the apple and Satan

Most of us are familiar with the Biblical story of Adam and Eve, where Eve is “misled” by a serpent into eating the apple from the forbidden tree of knowledge in the middle of the Garden of Eden. As we can read in the Bible in Genesis 3, the serpent told Eve: “God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil”. After Eve saw that “the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom” she took some and ate them. When God found out that Adam and Eve had disobeyed him, he condemned them and banished them from the Garden of Eden.


Why did Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak choose for their company the name “Apple” and the very same symbol of the apple which led Adam and Eve to being banished from the Garden of Eden?

 



 

Apple’s first logo

As you can see above, Apple Computer’s first logo depicted Isaac Newton sitting below an apple tree, with the legend that read “Newton — A mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought — Alone.” The link between the name and logo of the company and Newton’s apple tree is very clear here.

 

 

 

 

 


 

Isaac Newton and the apple 

While Newton was mostly known as a rational and scientific person, some of his private writings that were uncovered recently show a completely different side of his personality. It appears that Newton was obsessed with the occult. In fact, Newton wrote much more about the occult than on his scientific theory, but kept most of that work private, say some numerologists. While being seen as a scientist, he pursued activities that would be labelled as pseudoscience by the scientific community. 


According to some occult scientists Newton’s secret writings remained locked away for two centuries because they were considered very ‘dangerous’. Newton kept them secretly well-guarded in his possession probably because he knew that he would be accused of heresy or blasphemy and end up in prison like Galileo Galilei if he had published them, 
 And more interesting and intriguing is the fact that the first Apple computer was sold for $666.66!

 

 

Just a Coincidence?

 

Are the shapes of these logos and the use of the Satanic number 666 just coincidences? The corporation referred to above, and others who have adopted equally intriguing marks and logos, would almost certainly deny that their logos are either pagan, occultic, or New Age. It may be that the corporate leadership is, in fact, innocently unaware of the esoteric, sometimes hidden meanings of these symbols. Moreover, it must be admitted that a given symbol can have a multiplicity of meanings. Therefore, none can make accusations against these companies and their products, say the numerologists.


Nevertheless, scholars considered proficient in occult sciences maintain that Satan, the temporal “god of this world” (II Corinthians 4:4), could be expected to plant his symbols of evil throughout the globe ‘in its last days’. Satan is looked on as the father of liars, the blasphemous one, the dragon and serpent. Some scholars are convinced that Satan and his agents are very busy these days, conditioning men’s minds and programming their senses with stunningly effective visual magic and sorcery.
