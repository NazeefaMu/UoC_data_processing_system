REUTERS, 26th JULY, 2017-  Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell made a brief court appearance in his native Australia on Wednesday to face what police described as “historical sexual offences”, making him the most senior Roman Catholic official to face such accusations.


Pell, 76, a top adviser to Pope Francis, did not speak as he was escorted to and from Melbourne Magistrates’ Court by police through a large crowd of media, protesters and supporters. He was not required to enter a plea.


Australian police said last month Pell had been summoned to appear on charges of “historical sexual offences” from multiple complainants.
