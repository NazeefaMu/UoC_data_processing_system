The 24 per cent income tax imposed on medical specialists would be reduced to 15 per cent, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.

He said the decision was taken following a meeting held with Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera.

The Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) last week said the recent Tax Act had doubled the tax on doctors by increasing the tax from 12% to 24%.
