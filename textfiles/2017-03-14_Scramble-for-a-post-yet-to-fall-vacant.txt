There are three politicos engaged in a mad scramble to grab the position being held by an opposition political stalwart now terminally ill. 

 


The ambitious trio are said to be trying to outdo one another in winning brownie points from the party leader, with an eye on the position about to fall vacant.   


The three politicos had been close pals of the political stalwart now in hospital, they say.
