Former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said on yesterday that he was summoned by the FCID, PRECIFAC, Bribery and Corruption Commissions last year not to investigate fraud and corruption but to take political revenge.
Mr Rajapaksa visited the PRECIFAC yesterday as well and recorded a statement for several hours.
Mr. Rajapaksa said if they really wanted to find out any fraud and corruption, it would not have taken a year to do so and that what they should have done was to check my assets and liabilities from the day I assumed duties as the defense secretary till I left the post.
“They can check what I have earned since I assumed duties and left the post and find out whether I have deposited funds in foreign banks, bought any land, built any houses or bought shares in companies. I think that is how they should probe frauds or corruption,’ he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa said he had not earned a cent illegally and that he did everything according to the law.
He said he set up Rakna Lanka with the objective of earning several benefits to the government, the company earned foreign exchange and provided lots of jobs to retired security personnel. (Ajith Siriwardana)
