Ban on pandals on Vesak, Poson Poya days to remain: Minister
	
Buddhasasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said yesterday the ban of pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days would not be changed and stressed the need to focus on the spiritual aspect of religion rather than on mundane activities.
He told Daily Mirror that this prohibition on pandals would only apply to April 29, the Vesak Poya Day and May 29 the Poson Poya Day and that pandals could be put up on the other days.
The minister had imposed this restriction last month but the Government Information Department said the government had not taken a policy decision to ban dansals and pandals on Vesak and on Poson Poya Days.
He said the ministry had requested the people to refrain from putting up pandals only on Vesak and Poson Poya Days following a request made to him by the Mahanayake Theras.
This decision was made to safeguard Buddhist principles and encourage Buddhists to engage in spiritual activities during Vesak and Poson, the minister said.
He said all concerned including the Police had been informed to impose this restriction on pandals on the specified days while dansals can be held on these days.
The ministry will soon make a proposal to the Cabinet to prohibit pandals on Vesak and Poson Poya Days applicable to every year. A national policy will be implemented in this regard, he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

## Title: Ending war in Syria possible without outside intervention
## Section: Opinion

Ending war in Syria possible without outside intervention
	

ome 500,000 dead and counting. President Bashar al-Assad is going full blast at reducing the parts of his country still standing, but not under his control, to rubble. Russia hangs on his tail, providing both planes and soldiers but seemingly unable to wag the dog. The US launches, along with Britain and France, a brief rocket attack. (Should we now after two such attacks call President Donald Trump Rocket Man 2) 
The attack is supposedly to draw the line on Assads use of chemical weapons. Perhaps he did do it, or possibly one of his local commanders took the initiative, but it is small beer compared with the horrors inflicted by conventional weapons day in day out. The UN Convention outlawing the use of chemical weapons was aimed at big time use of them when they become dangerous enough to dominate a battle field- as the Germans used them in the First World War and Saddam Hussein (then supported by US arms sales) used them against Iran and against his own Kurdish population when 5,000 were killed. 

So what do the outside players do next Do they know where they are going Trump last month said he was pulling out his 2,000 soldiers, who are inside Syria. Now, his Secretary of Defence says they will stay. Most if not all the EU countries appear to back or at least tolerate the supportive bombing action of British Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron. Neither know much about the complexities of the Middle East but have decided to throw in their lot with Trump who knowseven less. 
The three of them must have been told by their advisers that this attack is chicken feed compared with the murder that goes on every week. It, and the two previous uses of chemical weapons, are a small item in the seven years of civil war. They barely impinge on Assad. To be coherent the three nations should commit themselves to tens if not hundreds of thousands of boots on the ground to topple Assad. But they are very unlikely to do that. So wheres a coherent explanation for what theyve just done 

I recall what Americas top strategist, the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, wrote in Time magazine a year ago: The Syrian conflict is a sectarian war in a volatile region whose potential to spread and directly threaten American interests would only be increased by US intervention..American involvement would simply mobilize the extreme elements of the factions against the US and pose the danger that the conflict would spill over into the neighbourhood and set Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon on fire. (The factions he mentions are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Sunni Salafists, Iranian-aligned militias, Al Qaeda and ISIS.).The recent Israeli bombing of weapons sites inside Syria conveys to some Arabs the sense that there is an external plot against them. That impression would be solidified if the US were now to enter the fight, suggesting a de facto American-Saudi-Israeli alliance, which would play into the hands of the extremists.The various schemes that have been proposed for a kind of tiddlywinks intervention from around the edges of the conflict- no-fly zones, bombing Damascus and so forth- would simply make the situation worse. 

"So what do the outside players do next Do they know where they are going Trump last month said he was pulling out his 2,000 soldiers, who are inside Syria. Now, his Secretary of Defence says they will stay. Most if not all the EU countries appear to back or at least tolerate the supportive bombing action of British Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron"
So what should be done by the Western powers At the moment they dont seem to have any ideas, or not ones they want to share with the public, maybe because they know they will ridiculed. Mr Trump, is it all leading to an attack on Iran The talented Danish artist, Linda Balle, writes on one side of one of her drawings, Now Here, and on the other side, as her dancing figure traverses the page, writes, No Where. Thats how it seems to be with the three Western allies. 
My answer is for the Western powers to remove themselves from the fray, apart from providing humanitarian aid. They should persuade Assad, in return for ending their military involvement, to make sure it is distributed around the country fairly. Aid organisations should be allowed free passage to wherever the choose to work. 
The US, the EU, Russia and Iran should apply themselves to negotiations. The previous UN effort failed partly because Iran, on the insistence of the US, was kept out. 
The outside powers must accept, however distasteful it may seem, that Assad has won the civil war. Like it not, that has to be the starting point. The outsiders, after conceding that, should demand amnesty for those who have opposed the regime. 
The Russians would support this. They have been trying to withdraw for quite some time but events keep pulling them back. As for Iran, it needs an entente with Syria rather than a future war. 
The pursuit of peace is possible, even at this late stage. But it has to be given priority. Bombing goes nowhere.

May Day on three different days
	
May Day in Sri Lanka will be celebrated on three different days this year with trade unions and political parties planning to celebrate it on May 1, May 6 and May 7.
The UNP has already announced that it would hold its May Day rally on May 6 at Sugathadasa Stadium while the joint opposition is to have its rally in Galle on May 7. Some trade unions including the Ceylon Mercantile Workers Union have said they would celebrate it on May 1.
Meanwhile, trade unions are up in arms over yesterday's gazette notification issued by Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardene to cancel the May Day holiday on May 1.
The Government Information Departmentsaid the subject Minister issued the gazette notification as per the powers given to him under the Holiday Act 29 of 1971 and that May 7 will be declared a public and Bank holiday instead.
The statement also requested the private sector to declare a holiday on May 7.
Ceylon Mercantile Workers Union Deputy General Secretary S. Nadesan said his union was planning to file legal action against the move on the basis that shifting the May Day from May 1 to May 7 violates the constitution.
Constitution clearly guarantees the right of assembling and expressing. This right is guaranteed for workers as well, he said.
Besides he said the most venerable Maha Nayaka Theras did not issue any statement asking for the postponement of May Day though the government decided on it.
Inter-Company Employees Union President Wasantha Samarasinghe said the government has no right to cancel the public and bank holiday on May 1.
Having May Day processions and rallies on May 7 is acceptable but we cannot agree with the cancellation of the holiday. The right to stay away from work on May 1 was a right which was won by the workers all over the world for themselves and not a right granted by the Sri Lankan government to the Sri Lankan people, Mr. Samarasinghe said.
He said his union would decide on the action it intends taking action against the change in the May Day holiday. (Yohan Perera)

By
D.B.S. Jeyaraj

Hell hath no fury as an Opposition thwarted in its bid to pass a No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against aPrime Minister!
Sri Lankas self -styled Joint Opposition led unofficially by Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa and officially by Colombo District Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardane is still smarting from the defeat encountered while attempting to pass a No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The ill-advised move failed miserably. Furthermore, instead of toppling the Prime Minister as intended, the NCM has only strengthened United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe politically - at least for the time being.
Moreover, the impact of the NCM has resulted in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) fragmenting into three factions and facing the dismal prospect of a permanent division in the future.
Unable and unwilling at this juncture to blame or confront President Maithripala Sirisena for the NCM failure the Joint Opposition has found a scapegoat in the form of the premier Sri Lankan Tamil political configuration known as the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). The Joint Opposition is training its guns on the TNA Parliamentary Group Leader and Leader of the Opposition Rajavarothayam Sampanthan. The octogenarian Tamil leader was elected to Parliament from theTrincomalee District.
A news story in the Daily News of April 10 stated as follows
- The Joint Opposition has decided to submit a letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya demanding that Tamil National Alliance Leader R. Sampanthan be removed as the Opposition Leader of Parliament.
If the Speaker does not respond positively, the JO is even prepared to submit a No-Confidence Motion against the Opposition Leader, a senior JO member said.
MP Dinesh Gunawardane said the JO would agitate both nationally and internationally for the removal of Sampanthan as he had failed to exercise his duties properly as the
Opposition Leader.
Citing Sampanthans latest decision to vote against the JO sponsored No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, Gunawardane charged that Sampanthan continued to back the Government and especially the Premier blindly in order to save his own position.

"The veteran Trincomalee MP is incorrect when he says I think that nowhere in the world has an Opposition Leader faced a No-Confidence Motion. There is a precedent and that too in Sri Lankain 1981! "

Gunawardane said that Sampanthan had failed to galvanise the Opposition in a constructive manner in order to fight the shortcomings of the Government. He said the Joint Opposition should be granted the post of Opposition Leader without delay as it had the required numbers in Parliament and the will to fight against the Governments flaws.

Defiant Sampanthan In Fighting Mood

The Opposition Leader himself in a fighting mood was ready to face the impending No-Confidence Motion.
At a media meeting in Jaffna, Sampanthan responded defiantly to the news about an NCM being planned against him. A news report in the Daily News stated as follows
-  Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said that he was prepared to face a No-Confidence Motion, should one be moved against him by the Joint Opposition. Addressing a press conference in Jaffna, Sampanthan said that the Joint Opposition might move a No-Confidence Motion against him, accusing him of voting in favour of the No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The news report quoted Sampanthan thus  It is neither ethical nor Parliamentary Tradition to bring a No-Confidence Motion against an Opposition Leader. I think that nowhere in the world has an Opposition Leader faced a No-Confidence Motion, he said.
He said that if a No-Confidence Motion was brought against him, he was ready to face it.
If the Joint Opposition brought a No-Confidence Motion against me for supporting the Prime Minister, I am ready to face it, he said.
He noted that the National Government led by the President and the Prime Minister now should focus on swift Constitutional reforms.
While Rajavarothayam Sampanthan is to be commended for being ready, able and willing to face the envisaged NCM, the Leader of the Opposition seems to have made a slip in his references to the proposed No-Confidence Motion.
According to the Daily News Sampanthan reportedly said
It is neither ethical nor Parliamentary Tradition to bring a No-Confidence Motion against an Opposition Leader. I think that nowhere in the world has an Opposition Leader faced a No-Confidence Motion.
The veteran Trincomalee MP is correct in saying there is no Parliamentary Tradition of a No-Confidence Motion being brought against a Leader of the Opposition but is incorrect when he says I think that nowhere in the world has an Opposition Leader faced a No-Confidence Motion.
There is a precedent and that too in Sri Lanka in 1981!
Since Sampanthan himself was an Opposition MP then it is indeed puzzling as to how the opposition leader forgot what had happened nearly 37 years ago.
Given the efforts underway to present a No-Confidence Motion against Sampanthan in Parliament, it may prove useful to re-visit the not so distant past when a No-Confidence Motion was brought against a leader of the opposition.
The UNP Government led by President Junius Richard Jayewardene went down in Parliamentary history as the only Govt. whose ruling party members presented, debated and passed a No-Confidence Motion against the then Leader of the Opposition in July 1981.
In a remarkable coincidence, the Opposition Leader at that time too was a Sri Lankan Tamil. Well-known Tamil leader Appappillai Amirthalingam, the Secretary-General of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) was the Leader of the Opposition, who underwent the novel experience of having Govt. MPs pass a No-ConfidenceMotion against him.

"Amirthalingam was in an unenviable position. The TULF had whipped up emotions among Tamils in general and the youths in particular for the establishment of a separate State called Tamil Eelam."

As a result, Sri Lanka became the laughing stock of the world then.
The circumstances that led to this bizarre event and the disgraceful manner in which the NCM debate was conducted in Parliament then deserves being related in some detail against the backdrop of a similar no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition move being
currently planned.

General Elections of July 1977

The General Elections of July 1977 was a watershed in the post-Independence political history of the Island nation.
The country was virtually polarised on an ethnic basis with the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) contesting on a platform of separatism and winning 18 of 19 Tamil -majority seats in the Northern and Eastern Provinces
of Sri Lanka.
The First Past the Post winner electoral system was in vogue then. The UNP won the bulk of seats in the eight provinces outside the North including the East.
At the final count after the postponed Pottuvil election being held, the UNP had 140 seats including that of an independent who had crossed over in the then National State Assembly of 168.
The TULF came next with 18 seats.
The SLFP which had polled much more votes than the TULF had only 8. The Ceylon Workers Congress had one seat but its leader and MP Soumiyamoorthy Thondaman was to join the Govt. a year later. One elected independent also sat in the opposition.
It is the tradition and practice in Parliamentary democracies for the leader or nominee of the Chief Opposition party to be nominated as Leaderof the Opposition.
This procedure had been followed dutifully in Ceylon/Sri Lanka too. So, with the SLFP being reduced to 8 and the TULF having 18, the Tamil party had to don the mantle of Opposition Leader.
Amirthalingam first offered it to Thondaman who declined it. Thereafter Amirthalingam himself became Leader of the Opposition.
The TULF president at that time was Nallur MP Murugesu Sivasithamparam who opted to let Amirthalingam be the Opposition Leader.
In those days Sivasithamparam was referred to as the Iyakkathin Thalaiver( Leader of the movement) and Amirthalingam as Inathin Thalaiver (Leader of the people/race).
It must be noted that there was a precedent for the chief opposition party leader not accepting Leader of the Opposition office.
In 1970 the UNP was the chief opposition party with 17 seats but it was not party leader Dudley Senanayake but his chief deputy JR Jayewardene who became Leader of the Opposition.
Dudley remained party leader until his demise in 1973.Thereafter JR the Opposition Leader became partyleader also.
Amirthalingam becoming Leader of the Opposition created many issues.
It was customary to regard the Leader of the Opposition as a potential future Prime Minister. The Opposition party itself functioned like a Govt. in waiting with a shadow cabinet.
In the UK Parliament, regarded as the mother of all Parliaments, the Opposition Leader is called Her Majestys most loyal leader of the opposition.
In Sri Lanka, a tricky situation prevailed as the Leader of the Opposition and his party had been elected with what was termed as a mandate for the separate state of
Tamil Eelam.
The country seemed polarised ethnically with the Govt. hierarchy being Sinhala and the Opposition leadership being Tamil.

"A tricky situation prevailed as the Leader of the pposition and his party had been elected with what was termed as a mandate for the separate state of Tamil Eelam. "

Many Sinhala people resented Amirthalingam as Opposition Leader because in reality the chief opposition party in terms of votes polled was the SLFP and the Opposition Leader should have been Sirima Bandaranaike.
A quirk of fate in the form of lopsided electoral results had brought about a strange turn of events. JR himself preferred Amirthalingam as Opposition Leader over his bete noire Sirima Bandaranaike.
After all did he not deprive her of civic rights in 1980. So the UNP Govt did not block Amirthalingam from becoming Opposition Leader and even tacitly supported it.
Moreover, JR Jayewardene elevated the Leader of the Opposition post to be on par with that of a Cabinet Minister.
JR had found himself treated shabbily as Leader of Opposition during the Sirima Bandaranaike regime. So, he wanted to alter that situation by empowering and dignifying the post. The Opposition Leader was paid a salary equal to a Cabinet Minister.
A large office with supporting staff including secretary, clerks, typists and peons was provided. After the new Parliament started functioning in Kotte, the Opposition Leader office became even more spacious and accommodated a larger staff.
Official vehicles were given and also a chief body guard. Tamil clerical services trade unionist Perinbanayagam became the Opposition Leaders Secretary and Police Inspector Krishnaswamy the chief body guard.
The Leader of the Opposition was also provided with a well-equipped bungalow adjacent to the MP
hostel Sravasti.
Soon the Leader of the Opposition office in Parliament and official residence were virtually transformed in practice into TULF offices.

Amirthalingam In An Unenviable Position

Amirthalingam, however, was in an unenviable position. The TULF had whipped up emotions among Tamils in general and the youths in particular for the establishment of a separate State called Tamil Eelam.
The Tamil people were called upon to make great sacrifices to achieve Tamil Eelam. It was a familiar sight at TULF election meetings for Tamil youths to line up and daub the foreheads of TULF candidates and speakers with blood after slashing their fingers. The youths expected the TULF to adopt a non-compromising stance afterbeing elected.
Many were disappointed by what they perceived to be a sell-out by Amirthalingam for the perks and privileges of a Leader of the Opposition post. It was felt (wrongly) that cunning JR had deftly co-opted Amirthalingam into his folds. Critical slogans began appearing as graffiti on Jaffna walls. Two slogans that I remember now are Kaettathu Thamil Eezham. Kidaithathu Japan Jeep (Demanded Tamil Eelam and got Japanese Jeep) and Ethirk Katchith Thalaimai Alla , Singala Arasukku Ethirppae Emakku Vaendum(We want Opposition to the Sinhala State and not the
Opposition Leadership).
In such a situation, Amirthalingam was caught in the middle.
The TULF took up the position that although they were bound by the mandate for Tamil Eelam the party was willing to consider what Amirthalingam termed as a Viable Alternative.

"He utilised the Leader of the Opposition post to interact with foreign leaders, diplomats, officials and media personnel and put across the Tamil viewpoint. "

Amirthalingam tried valiantly to steer a difficult path between commitment to the electoral mandate and the pragmatic necessity for democratic politics.
He utilised the Leader of the Opposition post to interact with foreign leaders, diplomats, officials and media personnel and put across the Tamil viewpoint. By doing so he incurred the wrath of many hawks in the Govt. like former Industries and Scientific Affairs Minister Cyril Mathew who was dubbed the Industrious Minister of Anti-Tamil Affairs.
A particular point which enraged the Govt. was Amirthalingams conduct while abroad.
There was a conventional expectation that Leaders of the Opposition do not criticise Governments on foreign soil.
While they could and should do so in their own land, it was seen as being Not done to air grievances and evince criticism to audiences abroad.
Amirthalingam however considered himself to be a liberation movement leader and did not abide by such norms. He was very critical particularly when he addressed gatherings of Sri Lankan Tamils in the West or meetings in Tamil Nadu.
Amirthalingam also violated protocol while abroad. As the Leader of the Opposition was on par with a Cabinet Minister, Sri Lankan diplomatic missions were expected to provide transport and other services to the visiting dignitary.

"Moreover, the impact of the NCM has resulted in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) fragmenting into three factions and facing the dismal prospect of a permanent division in the future."


Amirthalingam however dispensed with such protocol measures and opted to liaise independently with Tamil expatriates many of whom were supportive of a separate State.
Under these circumstances, the relationship between the Leader of the Opposition and the ruling Government was quite choppy and even stormy at times. The UNP rule of JR Jayewardene too was eventful and particularly impacted on the
Tamil people then.
The August 1977 anti-Tamil violence, the introduction of the Executive Presidency, the 1978 Constitution, the appointment of an - Tamil District Ministers for Districts in the North-East, the 1979 Emergency rule in Jaffna under the command of Brig. Bull Weeratunga, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA),the appointment of a commission on devolution headed by ex-Chief Justice Victor Tennekoon, the setting up of District Development Councils, Elections to the DDCs, Police going on the rampage in Jaffna and setting fire to the Jaffna library, Eela Nadu newspaper office, TULF party headquarters and the house and vehicle of Jaffna MP V. Yogeswaran were but some of the developments that took place in the four year period from 1977 to 1981.
Parallel and inter-related to this course of events was the rise of armed violence by Tamil militant organizations. Bank and Post office robberies, the assassination of Police personnel, attacks on Police patrols, killing of Tamils deemed as traitors or collaborators of the Govt., targeting of pro-Govt. politicians etc. were also incidents affecting the Tamil polity.
Even though there were simmering inter-ethnic tensions the advent of DDCs and the holding of elections to the councils were expected to bring about a quantum of peace and stability to the situation. Tragically the holding of DDC elections caused further deterioration and widened the ethnic divide.
A disgusting flashpoint of prevailing tensions was the unprecedented No-Confidence Motion against the then Leader of the Opposition Appappillai Amirthalingam.

What had happened then was that the UNP contesting all the District Development Council elections in the country were pitted against the TULF in the North and East.
The TULF won the DDCs of Jaffna, Mullaitheevu, Mannar, Vavuniya, Batticaloa and Trincomalee.
There had been pre-election violence in Jaffna when the UNP chief candidate for Jaffna district Dr A.Thiyagarajah was shot dead by operatives belonging to the PLOTE led by Uma Maheswaran.
A few other UNP workers in Jaffna were also killed in separate incidents.
On May 31st, 1981 the PLOTE shot and killed three policemen on duty at a TULF meeting in Naachimaar Koaviladdy in Jaffna.
A large number of Policemen from outside areas had been deployed in Jaffna for election security. Many of these cops went on the rampage on May 31st and June 1st. This was in retaliation for the attack on the Policemen at Naachimaar Koaviladdy. The Jaffna Public Library, TULF Headquarters, Eela Nadu newspaper, Jaffna MP Yogeswarans house and a number of shops, houses and vehicles were torched by the errant Policemen.
The burning of the Jaffna Public Library with 97,000 books including many first editions and rare manuscripts was a terrible event that shocked the Tamils.
The incident was condemned as an act of cultural genocide by the civilised world. Naturally, the TULF raised a huge outcry over this.
Lacking the political courage to blame or penalise the Policemen responsible for torching the library the Govt. tried to fault Amirthalingam and the TULF for alleged anti-national propaganda.
Amirthalingam did not crumble under pressure. Instead, he went on a global trip to countries such as the USA, UK and India where he related in detail the circumstances regarding the Jaffna Library burning and exposed the fact that the Govt. had not taken any constructive action.
This enraged the UNP govt. more.
After Amirthalingams return, the TULF gave notice of a vote of No -Confidence against the Jayewardene Govt. in Parliament.
This infuriated the UNP Govt. greatly.
When the TULF gave notice in Parliament of a vote of No-Confidence against the Government, the UNP regime retaliated by giving notice of a vote of No-Confidence against the Leader of the Opposition.
This was an unprecedented development in the Parliamentary history of not only the Island but of the Parliamentary democratic world.
Although the custom was to afford priority to an opposition motion, the Govt. overruled opposition objections and gave precedence to the Govt. motion of No-Confidence on the Leader of the Opposition. The proposal mooted by then Panadura MP Dr.Neville Fernando was signed by 36 UNP Parliamentarians. It was widely believed and subsequently confirmed by Dr.Fernando that the No-Confidence Motion project had the approval of President Jayewardene himself.
President Jayewardene was regarded as all-powerful then.
Although there were many decent, learned persons in the UNP Parliamentary group none dared to defy the almighty JR.
Hence the UNP to its eternal shame went along with what was perhaps an all-time low in Parliamentary annals.
The No-Confidence Motion by members of the govt. against the Leader of the Opposition was taken up in Parliament on July 23rd and 24th 1981.
What followed was a high drama of a cheap variety.
At the outset, Amirthalingam wanted to explain his position and rose to his feet. Pandemonium erupted. Amirthalingams voice was drowned in a flood of choice epithets like traitor, liar, and tiger supporter.
Dr Neville Fernando objected to Amirthalingam making a personal statement saying that he could do so only with the indulgence of the House.
Speaker Bakeer Markar upheld Dr Fernandos objection and refused to let Amirthalingam speak. At this point, the TULF walked out in protest.

SLFP Deputy -Leader Maithripala Senanayake

Thereafter SLFP deputy leader and Medawachchiya MP Maitripala Senanayake raised a Point of Order and submitted three reasons for the Speaker to rule the No-Confidence Motion out of order.
Firstly, the vote of no confidence on the Leader of the Opposition did not fall within the powers of Parliament. It had not happened anywhere in the world. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition held his office in accordance to Parliamentary Convention and he enjoyed the confidence of the members of the Opposition. He need not enjoy the confidence of parliament or that of the Government members. Thirdly, the motion, even if passed, would not bring any result. Amirthalingam would continue to be the Leader of the Opposition even after the passage of the motion.
The speaker Bakeer Markar evaded the issue and said Senanayakes Point of Order had been raised too late.
Therefore he could not stop the No-Confidence Motion being debated. The lone Communist party MP from Kalawana, Sarath Muttetuwegama chided the Speaker saying that he was letting the Govt. MPs run Parliament.
The SLFP and CP members also walked out in protest.
Thus Sri Lanka witnessed the bizarre event of the Government conducting a solo performance of debating a No-Confidence Motion against the Leader of the Opposition, while the entire Opposition had walked out in protest.
Most Cabinet or Deputy Ministers from the UNP did not speak but there were some who did including district and project ministers. The backbenchers had a field day. Then followed a disgusting relay of speeches by UNP Parliamentarians uttering dire threats of punishment to Amirthalingam and other TULF traitor MPs.
Horsewhipping, shooting them on Galle Face Green, Tying up on a Post and whipping, Mutilation, dumping in the Lake Beira were some of the modes of punishment advocated.
The most bloodcurdling threat was about reviving an ancient form of punishment allegedly practised by Sinhala kings in the past against traitors.
The victim was to be bound by his two feet to two bent areca nut trees tied with ropes. When the ropes are cut the bent trees spring back upright. The victim would be torn apart.
Speaker Bakeer Markar ordered three passages to be expunged as they horribly violated all norms of civilized conduct let alone Parliamentary decorum.
Among the four Cabinet Ministers who spoke during that debate was Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman the Minister of Rural Industrial Development in the JRJ regime.
Thondaman speaking in his capacity as leader of the Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) was very critical of the No-Confidence Motion.
He also uttered a prophetic warning that undermining Amirthalingam would pave the way for an extremist type of Tamil politics to emerge.
Finally, it was voting time on July 24th. Thondaman abstained. There were 121 votes supporting the NCM.
There was, however, one solitary vote against the motion.
The man who voted against the UNP motion was none other than the honourable member for Senkadagala, Shelton Ranaraja.
By doing so he not only demonstrated that he was an honourable person but also helped salvage a little bit of honour at least for his party.

Shelton Ranarajas Principled Stance

Shelton Ranarajas principled stance on that fateful day was a quiet display of courageous defiance.
At the UNP Parliamentary group meeting held before the debate, only Shelton Ranaraja had opposed the No-Confidence Motion against the Opposition Leader.
Describing it as a travesty of democracy, Ranaraja said it should be abandoned.
Otherwise, he would have no choice other than to vote against it, he said.
President Jayewardene would have none of it. JR said that Shelton could either keep away at the voting time or abstain from voting but must not go against the party by voting against it. Even Thondaman would abstain after speaking out against the motion, Jayewardene informed Ranaraja.
The Senkadagala MP kept quiet during the course of the No-Confidence Motion debate while Thondaman made a hard-hitting speech.
When the voting time arrived, the loquacious Thondaman abstained but the hitherto silent Ranaraja  who was also expected to abstain  did the unexpected.
He voted against the motion openly defying President Jayewardene and the UNP Parliamentarians.
Shelton Ranaraja was prepared to stand up and be counted at the right time. When JR questioned him about it later, Shelton replied that he had voted according to his conscience.
Knowing Sheltons brand of principled politics, JR Jayewardene let it go at that.
This was not the first time that Shelton Ranaraja had dared to go against Junius Richard Jayewardene.
It was in 1980 that the UNP govt. passed legislation depriving former Prime Minister and SLFP leader Ms Sirima Bandaranaike of her Civic Rights.
Shelton (though a Deputy Minister ) was present at the Cabinet Meeting that preceded the move in his capacity as Acting Minister of Justice.
He opposed the taking away of Sirimas Civic Rights at the Cabinet Conclave.
A seemingly bemused JR smiled wryly at Shelton and quipped you seem to be very fond of the lady. Shelton replied I am not fond of any personalities. I care only for my conscience.
Later on, JR told Shelton to keep away at the voting time if his conscience troubled him. Shelton did so.
However, in the case of the No-Confidence Motion, Shelton went against JRs wishes boldly.
This then is the story of a No-Confidence Motion brought against a Leader of the Opposition by a ruling Govt.
It appears that history may repeat itself in a different form with another vote of No-Confidence Motion against a Leader of the Opposition.
Then it was Amirthalingam and now it is Sampanthan, both of whom happen to be Sri Lankan Tamils.
However, the circumstances under which Amirthalingam became Opposition Leader are vastly different to that of Sampanthan.
Both appointments were legal but there are doubts about legitimacy in the case of Sampanthan.
Moreover, the NCM being mooted against Sampanthan is from opposition ranks whereas in Amirthalingams case it was from the Govt.
With the Joint Opposition mounting pressure on Sampanthan, the No-Confidence Motion against the Leader of the Opposition seems inevitable unless saner counsel prevails within opposition ranks.

Govts Most Loyal Leader of The Opposition

While Sampanthan is being targeted by the Joint Opposition there is a growing school of thought among sections of Tamils that the TNA leader should give up his Opposition Leader post voluntarily.
Cabinet Minister Mano Ganesan recently observed whether it was worthwhile for Sampanthan to retain the Opposition Leader position when the Constitutional process has reached a standstill.
There is also a feeling that Sampanthan functioning as the UNP-SLFP Governments Most loyal Leader of the Opposition is affecting the electoral fortunes of the TNA as demonstrated in the recent local authority polls.
These and other related matters will be delved into in greater detail in a forthcoming article.

## Title: Our care for others is the measure of our greatness - EDITORIAL

Our care for others is the measure of our greatness - EDITORIAL
	

eligious leaders have told us that anyone who wishes to be a leader must be ready to be the servant of all and that our care for others is the measure of our greatness. Our political leaders especially need to reflect on this in their hearts and minds as Sri Lanka goes into a crucial period in our history. 
President Maithripala Sirisena, when he was elected to office in the historic presidential election of January 8, 2015 pledged he would be a servant leader. That means to serve the people selflessly, sincerely, sacrificially and with commitment to work towards a peaceful, just and all inclusive society through unity in diversity. 
Often in the world, we see leaders whose main aim is to seek personal gain or glory, prestige, popularity and wealth. But such leaders have ended up in the pigstys of history. 
When parliament resumes sittings next month after the prorogation, the President and other government leaders need to sincerely recommit themselves to the principles of servant leadership. That means we would see a spirit of honesty and integrity among them. We would see a gradual liberation from self-centeredness so that they could sincerely and selflessly serve the people for the common good of all. This may not happen overnight but if the President, the Prime Minister and other leaders set the example the others will follow. 


As part of this servant leadership, we need to see a simple and humble lifestyle or the hallowed concept of Alpechchathawaya. We have not seen much of this during the past seventy years since independence but we need to see it now if Sri Lanka is to move steadily towards a sustainable, eco-friendly and all-inclusive development. 
The leaders and other politicians need to avoid wasteful expenditure, luxuries and extravagance. They need to tell or order their supporters or stooges also not to indulge in such vices at a time when millions of people are struggling on or below the poverty line. 
Besides honesty, sincerity, integrity and simple lifestyles, the leaders need to ensure that politicians or officials do not indulge in bribery or corruption, fraud or other political crimes. Stern action needs to be taken against those who indulge in such vices whereby they plunder the wealth and resources of the people.


This was one of the main failures of the present government. During the campaign for the January 8 election, Mr. Sirisena, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and other rainbow coalition leaders pledged they would act effectively to bring to justice the former regimes VIP politicians and officials who allegedly plundered billions of dollars from public funds and deposited them in secret accounts. But almost three and half years after assuming office, little progress has been made in this direction and instead we saw the Central Bank bond scam, which joint opposition leaders justifiably described as the biggest bank fraud in history. 
Last month, the Justice Minister introduced a Judicature Bill to set up at least three special High Courts with three-judge benches to hear political corruption cases. The Bill made provision for the special high courts to meet daily, morning and evening, so that the cases could be completed within three months instead of several years but with the prorogation of parliament, this bill lapsed and will have to be presented again while the Supreme Court has ruled that certain clauses need a two-third majority. The government may not be able to get a two-third majority now, so the bill will have to be amended. 


We recall again the much quoted speech of the late Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar when he took oaths as Foreign Minister in 1994. He said this country, a paradise island had given him much  free health services, free education and other blessings. Now he would focus his heart and mind on what he could give back to Sri Lanka. Political leaders, other politicians, religious, social or business leaders and indeed all responsible citizens need to experience a transformation in their attitude or approach to life and ask what they could give to the country instead of what they could grab. Any and all who act in that way are servant leaders while their care or concern for others and the country will eventually be the measure of their greatness.

Planetary combinations that produce great men and women
	
Astro 34
By A. S. Fernando
In Predictive Astrology, yogas play an important role. There are auspicious (Subha) as well as evil (Arishta) Yogas. The Yogas are specific planetary combinations in a horoscope of an individual that produce specific good or bad or positive or negative results. These yogas have been propounded by great ancient Indian sages like Parasara, Varahamihira and Jaimini basing them on key principles in Vedic Astrology.
Auspicious and inauspicious yogas
There are thousands of yogas now being followed for predictive purposes. For example, there is a yoga called Daridra Yoga which says that a person afflicted by this yoga would become poor - suffer for want, even if he were born into a royal family. There is another yoga called Vasumati Yoga. A person fortified with this yoga at birth would come into immense wealth even if he were born into a poor family.
Combinations discovered by empirical knowledge
Meanwhile, the eminent astrologers have identified through long years of empirical knowledge and evidence certain specific planetary combinations other than those yogas already propounded by great sages which produce great men and women like rulers, statesmen, great scholars, multi-billionaires, political leaders, army commanders and so on. These specific combinations though they do not come under the yoga nomenclature provide the clue to form a snapshot judgment of the future of a native with a cursory glance at his horoscope.  

A select few of such auspicious planetary combinations are given below.
	A person born when Jupiter and Venus occupy the Pisces Lagna, Sun the 2nd House of Aries and Mars the 11th House of Capricorn, would be a great person equal in stature to a king.
	A person born when Rahu, Mars, Saturn and Venus are posited in the Virgo sign (Rashi) would be a self-made wealthy man.
	Sun and Mercury in the 10th House and Mars and Rahu in the 6th House at birth make the native a great man commanding authority.
	A person born when Jupiter is in the 5th, Moon in the 7th and Venus in the 10th, would achieve a high position in the government.
	If at birth Jupiter is in the Lagna, Saturn in the 12th and all other planets in the 10th House, the native would lead a comfortable life with all needs at his disposal.
	Jupiter in the 3rd, Venus in the 8th, and all other planets in the 10th would produce a great person who can live in the lap of luxury.
	Mars and Venus in Sagittarius, Jupiter in Pisces, and Mercury in Libra at birth would make the native a high ranking army commander of the government.
	A person born when Sun is in Aries, Mercury and Venus in the 12th, Rahu in the 2nd and Mars in the 3rd would be a great person commanding political power.
	If Jupiter is in the 3rd, and Moon is in the 11th at birth native would be a very fortunate person who would bring honour and fame to his family and the clan.
	If all benefic planets are exalted at birth, the native would bring much honor and fame to his family and clan.
	If all planets are clustered in the12th ,1st, 2nd and 7th Houses at birth, the native would become the leader of his community.
	A person born with three or four planets conjunct with Sun or Moon, the native would inherit great wealth and the right to rule his country. This also happens to be a Pravurjya Yoga.
	If born when Jupiter, Mercury, and Saturn are in their own signs, the native would enjoy long life and prosperity.
	If born when Venus, Jupiter and Moon together occupy the same sign, the native would so fortunate as to get a good wife, sons and daughters he can be proud of.
	If born when Jupiter is in Leo sign, and all other planets are in Cancer, Libra, Sagittarius, and Capricorn, the native would be a ruler of a province and a landed proprietor.
	If the birth takes place when Mercury is in the 5th, Moon in the 10th, and Jupiter in the 9th native would be a well-disciplined great scholar.
	If born when Jupiter is in the 5th, Moon is in the 10th; native would be an educated and highly disciplined great man.
	If the birth occurs all planets occupy Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Sagittarius, Capricorn, and Pisces, the native would gain worldwide fame.
	Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Moon are clustered in the 4th with Sun or Saturn; the native would be a powerful and rich landed proprietor.
	If the birth occurs when Moon and Saturn are in the Lagna, Jupiter is either in the 5th or the 9th and Sun and Mars in the 10th the native would be a person of indomitable courage.
	If Sun, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars are exalted in Aries, Cancer, Libra and Capricorn respectively and one of these signs happens to be the Lagna, the native would be a ruler of his country.

PM calls for expansive ties with Iran
	
The private sectors in Sri Lanka and Iran should cooperate closely for the implementation of joint projects following the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions on Tehran, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said.
According to the Financial Tribune, Mr. Wickremesinghe has said positive developments have taken place in Sri Lankas economy.
The private sector has become very active here, and we are seeking to set up meetings with Irans private sector, he told Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani in Colombo on Thursday.
The prime minister said Sri Lanka is keen to enhance trade ties with the Islamic Republic in various areas.
The bygone era of sanctions was a difficult time. We believe the remaining issues should be resolved and the conditions should be facilitated so that businesses from both countries can easily work together, he said.

Seating to be rearranged if 16 SLFPers sit with opposition
	
Parliament Secretary General Dammika Dassanayaka said yesterday the seating in Parliament would have to be rearranged if the 16 former SLFP ministers, state and deputy ministers opt to sit in the opposition on May 8 when the Parliament reconvenes after the prorogation.
He said this in the wake of media reports that they were likely to sit in the Opposition after officially informing Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
We havent been informed about their decision. If they give us ample time by doing so before May 8, we will have to re-arrange the seats to accommodate them in the Opposition, Mr. Dassanayaka said.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to issue an extra ordinary gazette notification indicating the time of the opening of the second session of the 8th Parliament on May 8 soon after he returns from London.
Mr. Dassanayaka said the President would make a policy statement when Parliament is reconvened.
He said the gazetting of the time of the opening in the gazette that prorogued Parliament was not unusual as this had happened in the past as well.
Mr. Dassanayaka said the terms of the 16 Sectoral Oversight Committees like the Finance Committee and the High Posts Committee would not expire with the prorogation but nearly 50 various other committees like COPE and House Committees have to be reappointed. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

The Poem Collection The work of a talented and thoughtful poet
	

The Poem Collection is a delightful little book by Methmini Kariyakarawana. These poems were written several years ago when she was an Year Five student. She says that her elocution teacher encouraged her to publish them in book form. 
What is remarkable is her impish sense of humour, and the way she can put the passing reflections of a child into poetic thought. In the poem titled Exam Time, for example, she writes: What a weird time/is the exam time/We write and draw/We sleep and snore/If you study too much/You wont remember a thing/But if you dont study much/Obviously theres nothing in your head to think.
Writing about her father, she says: He is very silent/He doesnt talk a lot/But with one look/He can say a lot, which sounds really observant.
There are poems about cartoon characters. In Dreamlands are Very Weird, she writes: In each and every story/The girl can sing/And then again she starts singing/About her weird dream/Whats this all about/Im dizzy with questions through and through/I better not think about this a lot/Or Ill have to go to the mental hospital soon.
The poem titled An Aunty says: I have an aunty/Who is very ugly/She is always thinking/How pretty she is.
Heres a talent that should be nurtured.

Twenty tourist police posts by year end: Minister
	
Minister of Law and Order Ranjith Madduma Bandara yesterday said that 20 Tourist Police Posts will be established within this year at identified tourist hotspots across the country to prevent the harassment of tourists.
A Dutchman and two women tourists were reported to have been brutally assaulted at Water Creatures Beach Guest Restaurant & Surf Bar in Mirissa on April 8 when resisting attempts of sexual harassment.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo, the minister said Rs.30 million has been allocated to strengthen the Tourist Police by the Government via Budget 2018. This, he said, was in addition to the Rs.50 million that had been allocated for the same in the 2017 Budget.
Minister Madduma Bandara said the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) will also offer support to make this a reality.
He said that 14 individuals had been arrested by the Police in connection with the assaults that took place in Midigama and Mirissa adding that the law will be strictly enforced and punishment meted out to anyone found guilty over the incident.
Meanwhile, Tourist Minister John Amaratunga said that after the proposed police posts are set up identified areas there would be regular beach patrols to curb harassment of tourists.
He said they would also seek Naval assistance in this regard to curb any illegal activities that occur at sea or on the sea shore.
Minister also informed the press that no embassy or foreign authority had contacted the ministry in relation to the attack in Mirissa so far. However, setting a bad precedent, he said several embassies had directly contacted several relevant bodies and inquired about the matter with guidelines on how to prevent such incidents from taking place in the future.
Minister Amaratunga said that embassies should have consulted the Tourism Ministry as a first priority. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Vimala Aponso: We miss you dear ammi
	
Our dearest Ammi was called to be with The Lord on November 13th last year. She was a tower of strength to our family and our home would never be the same without her. Someone said that Piachaud Gardens (Kandy) would never be the same without her. We all miss her a lot, but we know that she is in a better place now. 
She was a tower of strength to Thaththi. They were married for 65 years which is very rare in the present world. Perhaps, she was the most active senior member of the Y.W.C.A, an institute she served for over 60 years. She was felicitated recently at the National Y.W.C.A. I am sure she would have been very happy when Shyami was elected as the National President of the Y.W.C.A. The Kandy Y.W.C.A will miss her too. She attended all Board Meetings and helped the poor and needy. 
We will continue to do what she started. She was very proud of the three of us (Malli, Nangi and me) and our spouses, her 5 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. Though her name was Vimala she wanted her great grandchildren to call her Virnukthi. 
Her love was not restricted to her immediate family and was given to a wide circle of friends and relations. We were surprised at those who came to pay their last respect at her during the funeral. Some spoke to us about the help she had given to them in their lives. We didnt know most of these people. She was extremely kind and loving to the maids and drivers who served her and she had concern for their families too.
She loved to entertain people. Her friends and loved ones still talk about the meals she prepared for them and the love and fellowship extended to those who visited her. Born in Panadura to Lambert and Leena Dias, she started schooling at St.Johns, Panadura. She was later boarded at Ladies College. Some of her close friends were the late Venetia De Alwis and Siva Obeysekara. Her other siblings were her sister the late Iraganie Fernando (nee Dias) and brothers Hekrema, Welakama and the late Maalya Dias. She was a true Christian and radiated love. She was a lover of dogs. I can still remember how she was so sorry when she lost her pet dog Blackie.
No one can replace her, but we are sure to meet again someday. We miss you a lot Ammi. May the Angels sing to you in your sleep.
(Shyamalee and Ajith Aponso, your elder son and daughter~
in-Iaw)
