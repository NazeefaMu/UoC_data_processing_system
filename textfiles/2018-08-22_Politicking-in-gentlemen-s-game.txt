Politicking in gentlemen’s game!


	



 

Green Party backbenchers are set to make a formal collective request to the party leader, who is also the Number Two in yahapalanaya to appoint Captain Cool to the main chair of the body controlling the popular gentlemen’s game, they say.

 


The rationale for their request is that all the successive occupants of this coveted chair in the recent past had been Blue Party loyalists and it was high time that a deserving Green Party one was given a chance to occupy this position.


The Green backbenchers propose to point out that it behoved the authorities in the interest of the future of the game to keep out of the scene the long-serving chief of the controlling body who got pushed out with the recent administrative change.


Meanwhile, Number Two had suggested to the backbenchers to brief both Number One and the top team member handling the subject on their proposal, they say.
