Shared humour led them to an intimate conversation


	

Two political figures who had been engaged in a war of words over media were seen having a friendly chat at a birthday party the other day.
The duo had initially exchanged only a few words for appearances sake. But their cold attitude towards each other had thawed when they could not help sharing amusement on seeing the candle on the birthday cake stuck upside down.  The closeness brought about by the shared humour saw them later in an intimate conversation until the conclusion of the party, they say.
One of this two-some is a yahapalanaya purohita and the other is a son of a leading politician.
