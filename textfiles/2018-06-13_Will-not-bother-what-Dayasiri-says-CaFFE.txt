Will not bother what Dayasiri says - CaFFE


	

While saying that it was useless to make comments on MP Dayasiri Jayasekara’s statement that the list of 118 was first mentioned by the CaFFE, Keerthi Tennakoon, Executive Director of Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CAFFE) said they would not bother what Dayasiri says.

He told Daily Mirror that people like Dayasiri always attempted to evade the issues and swept them under the carpet.

“We at first raised concerns on bond scam on March 9, 2015 and disclosed the event of bond fraud at the Central Bank. Since then, we have been very vocal on the bond scam. We continued to fearlessly reveal some unexposed events on the bond scam. We are the ones who first said that there are 118 individuals including politicians, civil activists, journalists and religious leaders who have obtained funds from Arjuna Aloysius,” Tennakoon said.

“The amount obtained from Arjuna Aloysius exceeds day by day. Some have admitted whereas some have been accused. Anyhow, we would carry on our study on bond scam and reveal what should be revealed,” Tennakoon added.

He further said he had written to the Speaker and the President’s Secretary urging them to release the un-revealed parts of the Presidential Commission report on the bond scam.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
