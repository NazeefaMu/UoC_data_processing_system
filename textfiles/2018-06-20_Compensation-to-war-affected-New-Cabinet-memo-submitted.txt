Compensation to war-affected: New Cabinet memo submitted


	

A fresh Cabinet memorandum seeking to grant compensation to war affected people including ex-LTTE combatants was reported to have been submitted yesterday.

Sources said, the Cabinet withheld its approval for this compensation formula till the establishment of the reparation office after enacting necessary legislation.

This is the third time this Cabinet paper was submitted. It was first submitted last year. But, the move was shelved amid widespread objections to the inclusion of ex-LTTE combatants.

Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D.M. Swaminathan submitted it again last week but met with similar resistance on that occasion as well.

The memo was taken up for discussion yesterday when Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had reportedly raised objections.

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera is reported to have said that compensation could be paid only through the reparation office after it was set up. (Kelum Bandara)
