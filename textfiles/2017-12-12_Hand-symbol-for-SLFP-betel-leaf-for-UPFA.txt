The 'hand symbol' of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will appear on the ballot paper for the first time since 1991 at the upcoming local government elections, party officials said yesterday.

Minister Mahinda Amaraweera told Daily Mirror the SLFP would field candidates under the hand symbol in some areas and the betel leaf symbol of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in other areas.

He said the last time the the SLFP contested on its own was in 1991.

“I contested the 1991 elections to the Tangalle Urban Council on the SLFP ticket and was elected mayor,” the minister said. (Kelum Bandara)
