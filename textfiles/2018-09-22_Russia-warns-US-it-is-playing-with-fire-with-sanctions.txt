MOSCOW AFP, Sept21, 2018-Moscow said Friday Washington’s latest raft of anti-Russian sanctions that also target China undermined global stability, warning the United States against “playing with fire.” “It would be good for them to remember there is such a concept as global stability which they are thoughtlessly undermining by whipping up tensions in Russian-American ties,” deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said in a statement.   “Playing with fire is silly, it can become dangerous,” he added.     “We recommend that Washington’s operators of the sanctions machine at least superficially acquaint themselves with our history to stop going round in circles.” On Thursday, the United States expanded its sanctions war against Russia to China, for the first time announcing punitive measures against a Chinese military organisation for buying Russian fighter jets and missiles.
