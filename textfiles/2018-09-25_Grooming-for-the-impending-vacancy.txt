Grooming for the impending vacancy!


	



 

Following a strong rumour that has gone viral in political circles that a deputy purohita is now on the brink of forfeiting his Diyawanna seat, the candidate immediately next to the latter on the preference list has already placed an order for a VIP suit with a master tailor, they say.

 


This Diyawanna aspirant is known to be a buddy of a high post holder of a body that supports holding the scales of justice. 
By the way, some leading members of this prestigious body are reportedly holding regular powwows at a high-end hotel in a lagoon view-city north of Colombo these days in a bid to tighten the legal noose around the neck of the deputy in trouble, they say.
