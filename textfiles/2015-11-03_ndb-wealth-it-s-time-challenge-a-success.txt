NDB Wealth has completed the inaugural phase of its innovative ‘It’s Time’ Challenge, an online social transformation initiative where five exemplary individuals were awarded Rs.50,000 NDB Wealth accounts each, which proved to be a catalyst to kick-start their potential.
Ultimately, the NDB Wealth ‘It’s Time’ Challenge saw investments being made in the future plans of fashion entrepreneur Lonali Rodrigo, corporate trainer Sandun Fernando, Negombo-based teacher Sampath Jayakody, logistics professional Menaka Nanayakkara and IT professional Sachitha Perera.
Most important of all, the NDB Wealth ‘It’s Time’ Challenge also ushered in a whole new paradigm for savings in Sri Lanka, helping unveil a range of unique and innovative NDB Wealth products that now give you the potential for ‘More Than Banking’ with NDB Wealth, including the high return, tax free and no penalty Money Plus Fund, which is comparable to a savings account.
