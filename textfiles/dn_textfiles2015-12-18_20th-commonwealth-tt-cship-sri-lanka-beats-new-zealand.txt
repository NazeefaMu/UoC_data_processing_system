Former national champ Nirmala Jayasinghe came up with a brilliant display to help Sri Lanka beat fancied New Zealand 3-2 in their opening match of the team events at the 20th Commonwealth Table Tennis Championship held in Surat, Gujarat.
Rohan Sirisena, captain of the men's team however lost 2-3 to Matthew Ball, the New Zealand number 2 player. Rohan could not come up with his natural playing style and lost the first two sets but recovered sufficiently to take the third and fourth sets but could not sustain the pressure and lost the decisive fifth set.Jayasinghe who was the second player in the team won the first match 3-1 against Yi-Sien Lin, the number 1 of New Zealand to give his team a great morale boost.
Prasad de Silva of Vidyartha College lost the third match to Josh Alexandre 1-3. Sirisena brought Sri Lanka level 2-all by beating Yi-Sien Lin using his 15 years experience to win 3-2.
In the final and deciding match Nirmala came up trumps to beat Mathew Ball 3-2 in a thriller. Nirmala played amazingly well proving that concentration and adaptation are the key factors to win in any competition. He adapted to the playing style of his opponent and hit the strategic services into the weakest places. His ability at identifying the mistakes of the opponent and pressurizing him by focusing on several mistakes at a stretch made the sets score 2-2. In the last and deciding set of the match Nirmala could not focus and saw himself 1-8 down. However, he took advantage of his two services and made it 3-10.
The Lankan women comparatively had an easy game beating Northern Ireland 3-0.
The results: Hansani Kapugeekiyana beat Ashley Givan 3-1, Ishara Madurangi beat Emma Ludlow 3-1, and Erandi Warusawithana beat Erin Thompson 3-1.
