A Maldivian man is in critical condition after being attacked on a main street in Sri Lanka on Wednesday.
Haveeru has found that 45-year-old Nooraddeen of Thaa Atoll Vilufushi island was robbed before the attack, but the High Commission of Maldives in Colombo could not confirm the reports.
A fellow resident of the island told Haveeru that the victim was attacked as he exited after exchanging dollars to local currency.
"He went to exchange dollars somewhere. It seems the incident occurred after he exited the place," resident said.
Zahiya Zareeer, Maldives High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, said it was difficult to confirm whether the victim was attacked.
But she quoted Sri Lankan police as saying that it was an "accident."
Zahiya said the truth behind the incident is yet to be determined as the victim was in intensive care.
The attack comes in the wake of the brutal stabbing murder of a Maldivian man in Sri Lanka.
Razeen, who is a notorious former gangster, was found dead with stab injuries in an abandoned paddy field near the Tumbovila Bridge in Piliyandala on November 5. 
Two suspects -- a Maldivian and his Sri Lankan accomplice -- have been taken into custody.(Haveeru)
