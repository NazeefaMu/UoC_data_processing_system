	The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) would take legal action against the companies, which had increased wheat flour prices without the Authority’s approval, a top CAA official said today.
	Several wheat flour companies yesterday announced that they would increase the prices of their products by two rupees per kilogram from yesterday.
	However, CAA Chairman Hasitha Thilakaratna said there would be no increase in the market price of wheat flour and the control price of wheat flour would remain at Rs.87 a kilo.
	“If any company decides to increase the wheat flour prices without the approval of the CAA, we will take action against them following a special inquiry,” he said.
	He said the Authority would also take legal action against retail shop owners found selling wheat flour products for prices higher than the control prices. (
