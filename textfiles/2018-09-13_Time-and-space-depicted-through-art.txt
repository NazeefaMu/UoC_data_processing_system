Co45 which is a budding art gallery and workspace in the heart of Colombo held an art exhibition, featuring artist Ikuko Deguchi,who is a Japanese Ink & Ceramic Art Specialist, from August 17-26. The paintings at the exhibition depicted the theme of ‘time and space’. Ikuko is a resident of Sri Lanka living in Negombo, she has lived in Sri Lanka for 13 years. She has been exhibiting art in Sri Lanka for the last 10 years. The objective of CO45 is to create a platform for International artists and to create a community of international family-oriented art education platform along with nonprofit projects of supporting the women and children in Sri Lanka.  

Emiko Hanano the owner and founder of Co45, in an interview with the Daily Mirror said,“This particular exhibition was a Japanese artist solo exhibition. This is the second exhibition of the CO showcase. We launched on April 7 and we invited the Japanese Ambassador and other excellencies and guests to participate. the Ambassador himself spoke about the significance of cultural exchange through art.We are not focusing on the sales of the painting. Therefore, our exhibitions are not a commercial gathering, but rather a cultural exchange hub. We want to create a platform for both the local and international creators, to exchange culture and their perspective through art.”  

She also spoke about her vision for CO45, “I want it to be a long-term art hub, something that is sustainable for all artists. I do not want it to be something one off, like a firework. I want this project to take roots, and bloom and grow into the future. I want it to be a sustainable platform that artists can rely on.There are many Japanese art students interested in this project. Hence, we are trying to make a programme for them as well in the near future. We are planning to do some animation and digital workshops as well”  

She spoke about her message to the art community and the importance of art in our lives,“I want people who have the passion for art to know that art is not just about selling art. I want people to know Sri Lanka has the potential to be a predominate platform for art tourism and art exchange. We need professionals and amateur lovers to join to achieve this dream.I believe art truly connects people. Many people used to ask me why are you drawing? Is it to become famous? But I truly wanted to give a message through my art. Visual messages are very strong and does not need language to convey them.”  

Ikuko Deguchi, the solo artist of the exhibition gave an insight to the thought process behind her paintings, “I wanted to try to understand the universe through my paintings. My technique is that I use canvas, paper and silk as painting material and I used various Japanese inks, minerals, pigments, paper and powder gold, colour pencils and pencils as drawing tools. I live in Negombo next to the lagoon, and the water truly inspires my work. I admire the nature and beauty of this country, it is my true muse.”  Speaking on the theme she said, “the theme ‘time and space’ is nothing new but I decided to out my own spin on it. Paintings are 2D, but I use different techniques such as different inks and pigments and the use of light for my paintings to appear 3D.”

She spoke about her message through her art and her journey as an artist,“I began my journey as an artist at the age of 6 years. When I was 17 I went to the Tama university of art, Tokyo, for sculpture. I lived around the world and was inspired by different styles of the world. I combine my experiences throughout my life and I present it in my art. In our technology dense world, I believe art is important.Art is something that comes from your soul. It is there to connect with people. Our world is getting more and more disconnected. I believe something truly touching such as art, will build that connection again. Art is very personal information, that can be shared visually. It is hard to understand art, sometimes there is no explanation. But, I believe it brings some kind of feeling whether the viewer understands the art or not.”  

Her final message was, “I want people to be free through art. Where there are no barriers of cast, creed, language or race. It is important for people to be flexible in their art, where they learn from many countries. It is important to be respect your traditional art roots, but the nature of art itself will be contradicted if one does not free themselves through art.”
