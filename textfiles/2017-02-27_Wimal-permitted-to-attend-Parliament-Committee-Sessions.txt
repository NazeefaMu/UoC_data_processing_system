Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi today directed Welikada Prison Authority to take MP Wimal Weerawansa to attend the Parliament Committee sessions, in which he is a member.

When the revision application, which was filed seeking an order to alter the remand order given by the Fort Magistrate, was taken into consideration, Gamini Marapana PC who appeared for the petitioner told court that his client is currently being permitted to participate in Parliament sessions but he needs to be attended in Parliament Committee Sessions as well.

Permitting the request, High Court Judge put off the further consideration of the application for March 8. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
