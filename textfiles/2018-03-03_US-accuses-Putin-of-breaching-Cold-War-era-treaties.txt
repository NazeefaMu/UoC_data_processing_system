THE HINDU, 02nd MARCH, 2018- The U.S. on Friday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of breaching Cold War-era treaties by developing a new generation of “invincible” weapons and said American military was fully prepared to defend the country.


“President Putin has confirmed what the U.S. government has known for a long time but that Russia has denied prior to this,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.


She said Russia has been developing destabilising weapons systems for over a decade in direct violations of its treaty obligations.
