President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the relevant authorities to release the Tamil and Sinhala translations of the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Central Bank Bond scam within two weeks, UPFA MP Dallas Alahapperuma said today.

He told a news conference held at the parliament complex that the debate on the PCoI report was halted after TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran raised a question about non availability of the Sinhala, the Tamil translations of the report.

He said the previous government had prevented the translations from submitting in the House. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
