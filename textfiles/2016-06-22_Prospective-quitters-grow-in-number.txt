Prospective quitters grow in number


	

The number of Diyawanna members who are to quit electoral politics once their term of office is over, is on the increase.

 


The latest to vow not to contest a general election again is a young comely member – incidentally a first timer to the council - hailing from the Colombo district.  She is said to be very unhappy that the people in her electorate affected by the recent floods gave her the cold shoulder when she visited them – rather late in the day – to look into their immediate needs.


Among others determined not to face an election again are two senior politicians hailing from Uva.  Both of them are holding high office in yahapalanaya. There is yet another one in this boat from the West. He is a ladies’ man despite being old enough to be a great-grandfather. In fact, the man’s undiminishing interest in the fair sex is a common subject in political circles. 


Meanwhile,  a veteran from a prominent political family in the South and a senior politician from Wayamba said to be a religious man have confided in their friends that they are not seeking a return to Diyawanna.
