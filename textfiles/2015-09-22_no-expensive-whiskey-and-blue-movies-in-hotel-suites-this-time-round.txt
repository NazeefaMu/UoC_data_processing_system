The new Big Chief is now set to leave for the UN to address the general assembly.
His predecessor was invariably accompanied by a jumbo entourage when he attended the UN General Assembly sessions during his incumbency. However, the new strongman has decided to take flight to New York with a small group of aides, they say.
Meanwhile, he has already given precise instructions to our envoys at the UN and the country’s embassy in the US about the arrangements to be made for the visiting Sri Lankan delegation. A list of taboo items is among the highlights of the instructions that have gone to our envoys.  Expensive suites in super star hotels, minibars stocked with expensive liquor and blue movies in hotel suites and luxury limousines for the use of delegates are among the taboo items, they say.
