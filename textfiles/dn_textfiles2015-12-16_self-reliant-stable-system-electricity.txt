Self-reliant, stable system for electricity

Our objective is to provide an efficient and uninterrupted supply of electricity to the people, by creating a self-reliant and stable electricity generation system, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitya said. He said this while on tour to inspect the mini 40 kw hydro-electricity scheme in Induruwa, Ruwanwella on December 14.
The minister said the Induruwa hydroelectricity scheme would be a model for those interested in learning about renewable energy generation.
He said that under the previous regime permits for energy generation had been sold for a quick buck by middlemen. He said the new government had introduced a proposal in the 2016 budget to cancel the permits of those who had obtained permits before January 1 2015, but failed to show progress by December 31 this year.
He said this was to clean up and eliminate foul play in the sector, the result of which would be the availability of electricity to all without hassle.
