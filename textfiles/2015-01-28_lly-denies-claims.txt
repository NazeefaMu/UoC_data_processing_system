Central Provincial Councilor Aazath Sally today denied the allegation that he threatned CJ Mohan Pieris.
He said that he had visited Mr. Peiris at his residence for 45 minutes. He said the discussion centred on his resignation from the post of the Chief Justice.
"If there was a threat he should have informed the security officers or the police; but he did not done so," he said.
