He stands pat defying  quit notice


	



 

A certain Ministry has served ‘quit notice’ on the chairman of a profit-making state-owned business undertaking.

 


The purohita in charge of the subject wants to axe this chairman because the latter was appointed to this post by his predecessor, they say.


However, the chairman is not prepared to take the quit notice lying down. He is not a person who can be trifled with either for he is a stalwart of a political party whose symbol is ‘Swan’ and no lesser person than the present Big Boss successfully contested the last big poll under this symbol.


The chairman vows that he will not budge an inch from his present position adding that he is armed with a legal trump card which he proposes to play in a worst-case scenario.
