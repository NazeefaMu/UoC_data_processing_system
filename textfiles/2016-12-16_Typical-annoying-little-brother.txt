Typical annoying little brother!


	



Amazing images captured in Zimbabwe show the moment two lions went head-to-head in an aggressive play fight.

One of the cubs is seen sneaking up behind his sibling, taking a cheeky snap at  her tail. In another photo, the two paw at each other on hind legs with their teeth bared.  

Surprisingly, the lioness 'remained calm' during the fight - suggesting it's not the first time she's put up with her brother's behaviour. This heated moment was captured at Antelope Park in Zimbabwe, Africa.

The young male seemed to be a bit of a troublemaker and a bully, he was always picking on the poor female. Every time she tried to walk off, he would sneak up behind her and try and trip her or ambush her. She was very tolerant of him until finally she said enough and turned on him and they engaged in some pretty rough play fighting. (Daily Mail)
