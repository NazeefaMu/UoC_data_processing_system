Sri Lanka has no intention of pulling out of the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nor did it boycott the Summit, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera told Parliament today.

He said Sri Lanka was of the view that the current environment in the host country was not conducive to hold the summit and that it was duly conveyed to them.

"We informed the chairing  country Nepol in our letter that the SAARC summit cannot be held when one member-state decides not to participate," the minister said.

“Sri Lankan Government believes that regional cooperation is essential to create better living conditions for its people."

Quoting former president J R Jayewardene, he said mutual understanding of the member states was essential when realizing the goals of SAARC and urged all member-states to cooperate in the task of eradicating terrorism. (Yohan Perera)
