Afghan defence minister, army chief resign after Taliban attack
	

KABUL AFP April24, 2017 - The Afghan defence minister and his army chief resigned Monday, days after what is believed to be one of the deadliest-ever Taliban attacks on a military base triggered calls for officials to step down. 

President Ashraf Ghani has accepted the resignation of the defence minister and army chief of staff, a one-line statement from the presidential palace said. 
Angry Afghans had called for the resignations of minister Abdullah Habibi and army chief Qadam Shah Shaheem, among other officials, after the assault outside the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Friday. 
Ten gunmen dressed in soldiers uniforms and armed with suicide vests entered the base in army trucks and opened fire at unarmed troops at close range in the mosque and dining hall. 
Officials put the death toll in that attack at 50, but security sources and survivors told AFP more than 100 were killed in the brazen assault.  Military analysts have slammed the total intelligence failure over such assaults, and called for new strategies to counter them.

BOCs ATM network dispenses Rs.34bn during Avurudu season
	

The owner of the largest automated teller machine (ATM)/cash deposit machine (CDM) network in the country, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), yet again set a benchmark in the banking industry by transacting over Rs.46 billion during this Sinhala and Tamil Avurudu season from April 1 till April 14, 2017.
Having a fully operational ATM network with over 730 machines covering the entire country, BOC has provided customers utmost convenience and easy access to cash for their immediate cash requirements during Avurudu.
Through the banks ATM network alone, BOC has dispensed over Rs.34 billion from April 1 to 14, which is the highest amount dispensed through a banks own ATM network in Sri Lanka.
The bank has installed over 127 CDMs covering every strategic point throughout the country enabling BOC customers to deposit money into their accounts on real time 24 hours a day.
These CDMs have accepted the highest recorded  over Rs.12 billion  in cash during the same period.
The highest number of transactions made on ATM/CDM network was recorded on Friday, April 7, 2017, which was over 350,000 transactions worth Rs.6.29 billion. During the period from April 7 to April 12, the banks ATM network dispensed over Rs.3.45 billion per day on average.
It is overwhelming to see that our efforts to digitally transform the banking landscape in the country are becoming a success day by day. With our ATM/CDM network that counts more than 850 machines covering every hotspot in the country, we have been able to increase the usage of these service points among the public.
Our ATM/CDM network is not only popular among our customers but also among others who bank with other banks to use when in need, stated Acting Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management and Deputy General Manager Retail Banking Range 2 C. Amarasinghe.
The bank has enabled all ATM card users to withdraw or make direct payment through a POS machine up to Rs.100,000 per day 24X7 through an ATM without prior arrangement. The same can be used for transactions over Rs.100,000 per day through a POS machine with prior approval.
Moving ahead with the digital transformation, the bank introduced BOC SmartZone that includes 24x7 operative self-serving lobby, which includes ATMs and CDMs and currently has formed over 130 of state-of-the-art SmartZones. It has been a good service point that served customers with their immediate cash requirements during the festive season.

CB Bond issue -- Mahendran's counsel objects to DEW's evidence
	
When former MP D.E.W. Gunasekara was testifying at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) yesterday, Counsel Chanaka de Silva appearing for the former governor of the Central Bank queried the relevancy of obtaining the views of a former COPE chairman.
He was of the view that Mr. Gunasekara's evidence was of little or no relevance because the PCoI was on a fact-finding mission and that the witness was not an expert on this subject and as such it would be unfair to the other parties involved.
The commissioners said if the evidence was found unfair by the others, the evidence would not be recorded.
Mr. Gunasekara's evidence was led by Additional Solicitor General Dappulada Livera PC. It was revealed that statements were recorded from 42 witnesses with regard to the sale of bonds.
The Commission of Inquiry comprises Supreme Court Judges K. T. Chitrasiri and Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Constitutionalising economic, social and cultural rights
	
One of the key issues is land, as the military is occupying large chunks of land in the region

The current constitution of Sri Lanka does not contain judicially enforceable, economic, social and cultural rights, though they are very much a part of daily life. With the onset of the debate for a new constitution, the discourse for the inclusion of Economic, Social and Cultural (ESC) rights in the constitution has taken center stage. ESC rights include the right to education, housing and health. Though these rights are not constitutionalised people in the country have access to free healthcare and education, which signifies that the state recognizes ESC rights. Hence the question emerges as to why constitutionalising ESC rights is so important and why certain groups oppose the constitutionalizing of these rights. Proponents of constitutionalizing these rights firmly maintain that ESC rights are equally important as their civil and political counterparts. In a panel discussion held recently on this theme the panel, which mainly included the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission, the Secretary General of Amnesty International and the Executive Director of the Law and Society Trust, countered the arguments against constitutionalizing ESC rights, and highlighted the importance of guaranteeing these rights through the constitution and providing judicial remedy when they are breached. 

The PRC received so many submissions asking for socio-economic rights to be constitutionalized.
Dr. Harini Amarasuriya -Former member of the Public Representations Committee (PRC)
Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, a former member of the Public Representation Committee (PRC), a senior lecturer at the Open University and the moderator for the day set the discussion in its context pointing out how despite the submissions to the PRC on ECS rights there was an ongoing debate on their inclusion. Its really interesting that the Public Representation Committee(PRC) received so many submissions asking for socio-economic rights to be constitutionalised, and equally interesting is the huge debate taking place after the report came out on this very issue. In a way, Sri Lanka has had a history of having socio-economic welfare systems in place, without it being necessarily in the constitution. So why in that context is there such a big demand coming up for the constitutionalising of socio-economic rights she said adding that the debate reflected the state of socio-economic well-being in our society. She further remarked that the response by the groups against the inclusion of socio-economic rights in the constitution reflected the huge divide within society on the very issue. 

Sri Lanka can become a model for a new way of looking at incorporating
ESC rights.
Salil Shetty-Secretary General of Amnesty International
Stating that the divide between civil political rights, and economic social rights was very artificial Salil Shetty, the Secretary General of Amnesty international said that from a global perspective the justiciability of ESC rights was fundamental in the effective implementation of the International Covenant Sri Lanka has ratified. In the case of Sri Lanka you dont have a just and equitable country, where no one is left behind, which is a mantra of the Sustainable development goals, he said. 
Commenting further on justiciability he pointed out that through the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and other covenants there has been much reinforcement of juticiability over the years. 
The constitution reform process here is really a great opportunity for ESC rights to be enforecable in a lasting and plural way. Internationally there are more and more constitutions integrating ESC rights into them. Nepal is a shining example of a constitution that is centered on guaranteeing the possibility of citizens seeking judicial redress, he said. 
Emphasizing on the necessity of a universal approach and enforceability he stressed on the importance of judicial remedy. Citing Right to Information he pointed out that there were instances where functioning institutions were essential to define minimum core obligations and state delivery. 
Commenting on delivering mechanisms he said, You can have all these judicial mechanisms in the constitution. But if you have totally ineffective delivery mechanisms and communities themselves dont have any kind of control on the delivery, then they dont have a voice. 

"The constitution reform process here is really a great opportunity for ESC rights to be enforecable in a lasting and plural way"
Remarking on resourcing on a sarcastic note he indicated how when the defence expenditure increased, resources appeared magically. Its also the same with capacity building. If the government doesnt want to do something theyd say that they dont have the technical capacity. Resource and capacity is as you can see very flexible concepts, he added. 
Shetty had just returned from spending few days in the North where he had visited several places such as Kilinochchi and Jaffna. He observed that people were still getting over the trauma of what took place during the last stages of the war. One thing that struck me was that this conversation here cant be disconnected with that discussion because most of the people we met were suffering from a range of issues. One of the key issues is land as the military is occupying large chunks of land in the region, he pointed out. 
He further pointed out that though transitional justice was a hard core civil and political rights question, for most of the people their main demand was less on transitional justice and more about land. Their demands are about health, education and the basic economic, social and cultural rights. This proves the artificiality of this discussion and the meaningless of trying to separate these two kinds of rights. I hope Sri Lanka can become a model for a new way of looking at incorporating ESC rights into the transitional justice question as well,he said. 

Guaranteeing ESC rights in the constitution is no longer an optionPeople want it.
Dinushika Dissanayake -Executive Director of the Law& Society Trust

Dinushika Dissanayake, the Executive Director of the Law and Society Trust stressed that both the PRC report and the Subcommittee report showed how people across Sri Lanka from the North, South, East and West - wanted economic, social and cultural rights guaranteed. Guaranteeing ESC rights in the constitution is no longer an option. This is a false debate we are having. People want it. They very clearly ask for it, she said. 
Elaborating further she referred to the life experience of a boy from Giradurukotte who had spoken at the launch of a briefing paper on CKDU by the Law and Society Trust the previous day. He was a beneficiary of public education and entered the university. His father was a farmer and contracted CKDU. They couldnt pay for his boarding in Colombo and his mother now works for a mono cropped plantation in the area done by a multinational company. His mother is also exposed to different types of chemicals. For me, this raised all types of complex issues about socio economic rights and where we place it. 
She pointed out that ESC rights could be included not only in the Bill of rights but also in other parts of the constitution, including the sharing of sovereignty and decision making over natural and national resources. Sri Lanka has a rich history of provisioning for human rights and especially for economic and social rights since the 1940s, be it education or health. This has led to where we are today, in terms of the indexes and life expectancy, she said. 
Sri Lanka is also a democratic, socialist republic and this is not by accident. The thinking of the leftist government of 1972 and the fact that it was not removed in 1978 says a lot about the political ideology about our people and the country, she added. 


"Constitutions around the world have already moved on, have already guaranteed these rights. So why we need to talk about this is also inexplicable. ESC rights cannot be compromised despite the popular theory that it can be compromised. Human dignity means just like the right not to be tortured we have the right to live"

Speaking about the dangers of providing these rights without guaranteeing them, as is the case currently, Dissanayake pointed out that the systematic nature of these rights could be taken away at anytime. LST and many other organizations were part of drafting a joint civil society shadow report. Some of the discussion around this was about how budget cuts on education and healthcare affects people. This is a lived reality of our people. In the 2017 budget Rs. 100 billion has been cut from education. Rs. 13 million has been cut from health. The Defence budget has gone up, she said. 
When rights are only guaranteed through provisioning there are also disparities in how resources are allocated. For example, the National Education commissions report in 2014 tells us that 16% of primary schools in Sri Lanka didnt have access to water. It also says that in terms of unsanitary facilities only 0.5% of schools did not have sanitation. But when you look deeper it shows that Colombo didnt have 0.5%. while Mullaithivu did not have 37%.  Speaking about shared sovereignty she once again referred to the boy from Girandurukotte. The land in that area has been given to a mono cropping Plantation Company. Some of these plantation companies leave without notice. Sometimes people are not paid salaries. This is frightening in terms of poverty indicators. What happens to women who are exposed to large doses of chemicals without any of the covering facilities that should be used when using these chemicals What happens to them when they fall ill We do have public health care. But how far does it go when you keep cutting the budget on health care 
She added, If you talk about absolute poverty in Sri Lanka it has reduced. In 2012 it was 6.7%. The joint shadow report discusses what is meant by absolute poverty. Is it Rs.135 per person a day Can you live on Rs. 135 In 2016 the World Bank told us that 40% of Sri Lankans live on less than Rs. 225 a day. So when it comes to human dignity, our commitments on zero hunger and zero poverty where do we stand when the day of reckoning comes after years in terms of the Sustainable
Development Goals. 

"When rights are only guaranteed through provisioning there are also disparities in how resources are allocated"
The women in Mullikulam, Mullaithivu and Kilinochchi are sitting on the streets with children sleeping on their laps asking for economic justice. And many of us are only concerned with certain parts of transitional justice, she said. 
An independent judiciary that is capable of finding and directing on civil and political rights is also perfectly capable of finding and directing on economic, social and cultural rights. We have seen how restraint, independent judiciaries in South Africa, India and other places have not overburdened the state, she said. 
Constitutions around the world have already moved on, have already guaranteed these rights. So why do we need to talk about this is also inexplicable. ESC rights cannot be compromised despite the popular theory that it can be compromised. Human dignity means just like the right not to be tortured we have the right to live, she stressed. 

Could we have a dignified life without the right to healthcare and right to education
Deepika Udugama -Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission (HRC)
Deepika Udugama, the Chairperson of the Human Rights Commission (HRC) said that ESC rights should be included in the constitution.This is the third constitution we are living under since independence. It is not a secret that the constitutions of this country have not been a major part of our lives. We dont appeal to the constitution of the country as our saviour, as our protector. It is to a very great extent a very peripheral document. Lawyers do take cases before the Supreme Court on fundamental rights. Human Rights Advocates refer to constitutional provisions of rights which champion rights of all of us. But in terms of the public imagination the constitution is not a central part of our life. I think the constitution building process is about making the constitution part of our public imagination. This is what is very important, she said adding that the actual challenge laid in making the constitution a living part of public life. 
Referring to the three generations of rights she said they were a product of cold war debates and discussions. The first, second and third generation of rights are considered to be universally recognized human rights, although their development could have seen in the various generations emerge. I think what we need to recognize is not just the theoretical debates that took place in the United Nations and the world over, at a local level. I think there is nothing more important than analyzing these guarantees from our own life experiences. 
Would it be possible for someone to argue that the right to food security and the right to clean drinking water are less important than the right to be free from arbitrary arrest Could we have a dignified life without the right to healthcare and right to education she quizzed. 
Stressing that ESC rights was about life experiences she pointed out that the PRC report clearly showed the aspirations of the people in relation to the various dimensions of rights. She argued that people did not want only their civil and political rights protected, but they also wanted other rights such as the access to healthcare, education, a clean environment etc ensured. 
You need to tag this debate to life experiences than the technicalities, because the technicalities can be painfully theoretical and really dont do justice to life itself. After all, human rights are about life. Why do we need human rights To live a good, dignified and free life. Often we are chided for being theoretical, too conceptual and conceptually vague and so on, she said. 
Technicality also has a very practical dimension. Sri Lanka has recognized at an International level that economic and social rights are very important rights by ratifying the International Covenant on civil and political rights. That is also about good faith obligations- an obligation which recognizes that Sri Lanka is legally bound and that we should discharge our legal obligations in good faith, she added. 


"You need to tag this debate to life experiences than the technicalities, because the technicalities can be painfully theoretical and really dont do justice to life itself. After all, human rights are about life. Why do we need human rights To live a good, dignified and free life. Often we are chided for being theoretical, too conceptual and conceptually vague and so on"

She further pointed out that Sri Lanka is required to present the legal status of ESC rights at the United Nations Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Committee in November in Sri Lankas fifth periodic report. 
Highlighting that this was the ideal opportunity to get a balanced bill of rights she said that as sovereignty lay in the people and as human rights were part of sovereignty of the people, all these rights must be protected in a democracy. We also know that both sets of rights-if you categorize them as civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights- entail positive and negative obligations. For example, we are told, how could the judiciary require the state to provide a certain type of education to the public because that is going to entail a great degree of public expenditure, and that is not the role of the judiciary. In dealing with torture are we going to say that the obligation of the state is merely negative, that is to say, that the state should not torture and to stop at that 
She added that the most important dimension in this respect was to practically provide training to the police about modern methods of investigation and provide the technology to engage in investigations without torture. This sounds very simplistic, but its fundamentally a very important dimension of the fight against torture. This costs a lot of money, she said. 


"If you look at so many cases involving equality there are huge resource implications for the state. Does it mean to say that the state does not then provide interpretation for the equality clause on the basis that there are resource implications That really is not the case. So this is about an ideological divide that has nothing to do with the arguments raised about resource implications or the role of the judiciary,"

If you look at so many cases involving equality there are huge resource implications for the state. Does it mean to say that the state does not then provide interpretation for the equality clause on the basis that there are resource implications That really is not the case. So this is about an ideological divide that has nothing to do with the arguments raised about resource implications or the role of the judiciary, she said. 
Speaking on the role of the judiciary and countering the argument of critics of justiciable ESC rights as to whether unelected judges can make decisions she pointed out how the common law tradition built bodies of jurisprudence through the judgments of unelected judges. In the United States constitution there is judicial review of legislation through interpretation. In India the secular nature of the state was pronounced upon by the judiciary. This is the tradition in the common law system. So there is nothing new about it. 
If Sri Lanka goes into the history books at this point as the country that turned its back on all these decades of development in the human rights field, I think its impact is going to be very serious. All the changes that the people of this country worked for will remain unfinished, she remarked.

Curiosity almost killed this cat
	

It was truly a political cat! This cat had been a familiar sight to journos covering the regular media briefings of a certain political party.

The cat would appear from nowhere at the usual venue when the briefing gets underway and would remain there attentively following the proceedings until they call it a day.
Though the cat was a welcome distraction to the news people attending the briefing, the party organizers looked on this uninvited observer as a nuisance.
They had discussed several ways of getting rid of the cat including a few which were rather cruel and finally decided to lock up the cat in an adjoining room until the conclusion of the media briefing.
The cat now forced to remain behind closed doors whenever a media briefing is held, does not screech or scratch as if it has resigned itself to the punishment, they say.

The Foreign Exchange Bill which presented in Parliament by the government is similar to what former Norwegian peace envoy Erik Solheim envisaged, the joint opposition said today.
It said the Bill would enable the Tamil Diaspora which was a repository of LTTE funds to invest in Sri Lanka without any control or monitoring by the Central Bank (CB).
Solheim mentioned this at an interview with The Hindu soon after the election victory of President Maithripala Sirisena. He said the government should reach out to the Tamil Diaspora and get them to invest in Sri Lanka, MP Bandula Gunawardane told the JOs weekly news conference. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

GMOA, 8 TUs to launch major strike in May
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned that they would resort to a major trade union action in early May in coalition with over eight trade unions including the University lecturers against the double standards shown by the Health Minister and Higher Education Minister with regards to the running of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The GMOA warned that along with University lecturers they would withdraw from examiner duties of the Examination for Registration to Practice Medicine (ERPM) (formally known as ACT16) until the government adopted a set of proposals given by Medical Faculty Heads that has handed to them over a month ago, which could ensure the quality of private medical institutions.
Addressing a press briefing GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa said Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and the Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella should stop rescuing the SAITM institute and should work for the benefit of the general public.
These ministers dont have the technical knowledge to decide the minimum standards that need to be maintained by an institute such as the SAITM institute. They have taken over the responsibilities of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) by force, he said.
Dr. De Zoysa said the only institution that should be tasked with finding a solution to this and can be trusted to do so was the SLMC which has persons with the expertise needed for this purpose.
He said the GMOA was at present holding talks with more than eight State sector trade unions and were ready to resort to a countrywide action in early May, thus paralysing the countrys State sector and temporally forcing the government to let the Medical Council take a decision on the SAITM issue.

A proposal to install a water pump to provide safe drinking water for devotees visiting a place of Buddhist worship at a distant place came up at a meeting of Dayakas held at the precincts of this sacred place recently.
Several politicos including a deputy purohita and a high ranking cop too were among those present at this meeting.
When the proposal came up, the deputy purohita said that they would welcome the donation of a water pump for the sacred place.
The khaki high-up present at the meeting immediately rose to his feet and announced to the applause from the gathering that he would donate the much needed water pump.
The khaki high-up did donate a water pump as promised later, but it came to light later that he did not acquire it at his own expense, but with monies collected from Police personnel coming under his immediate supervision and some philanthropists in the area.

hoping to become Frances next first lady at the age of 64
	

Frances next first lady could be a grandmother of seven who is 25 years older than her husband  and taught him at school when he was only a teenager. 
Brigitte Trogneux, now 64, was once the drama coach of centre-Left candidate Emmanuel Macron, 39, who exit polls predicted will be the next president. 
Miss Trogneux last night stood by her husband waving and grinning broadly after he won first place ahead of National Front leader Marine Le Pen in the first round of the countrys presidential elections. 
Speaking after Frances two main parties were kicked out of the election race, Mr Macron, who achieved 23.75 per cent of the vote compared to Le Pens 21.53 per cent, said: We have turned a page in French political history. 
The result of the second round vote on May 7 will have major implications for Britain and its departure from the EU. Miss Le Pen wants to completely renegotiate Frances relationship with Brussels while Mr. Macron wants closer links. Macron and Trogneux are likely to be the next residents at the Elysee Palace with Macron becoming the youngest leader of France in modern history.
 
They first met when Mr. Macron was 15  and he later made a startling promise to his teacher. 
At the age of 17, Emmanuel said to me, Whatever you do, I will marry you!, Miss. Trogneux told Paris Match magazine last year.The relationship started after Mr. Macron acted in Miss Trogneuxs theatre pieces when he was aged just 18 at a private Jesuit school in Amiens, northern France. 
Then Brigitte Auziere, a married mother of three, she was supervising the drama club. Mr. Macron, a literature lover who wanted to be a novelist, was a member. 

He later moved to Paris for his last year of high school. At that time, he recalled, we called each other all the time, we spent hours on the phone, hours and hours on the phone. 
For her part, Miss Trogneux recalled in a television documentary: Little by little, he overcame all my resistances in an unbelievable way, with patience. She also said: He wasnt a teenager. He had a relationship of equals with other adults. 
She eventually moved to the French capital to join him, and divorced her husband. They have been together ever since. 
The couple finally married in 2007  although she did not take his name  and Miss Trogneux is now campaigning by his side. I dont hide her, Mr. Macron told a French TV channel this week. Shes here in my life, she has always been.

## Title: Hungry caterpillar joins fight against plastic pollution

Hungry caterpillar joins fight against plastic pollution
	
A moth caterpillar commonly bred to provide fish bait feasts on a notoriously resistant plastic, scientists reported Monday, raising hopes the creature can help manage the global problem of plastic-bag pollution.
"This discovery could be an important tool for helping to get rid of the polyethylene plastic waste accumulated in landfill sites and oceans," said Cambridge University professor Paolo Bombelli, co-author of a study published in the journal Current Biology.
Polyethylene represents 40 percent of Europe's demand for plastic products, mostly in the form of packaging and shopping bags.
Taking many years to biodegrade, these objects constitute a serious hazard for the environment, especially for sea life, when they are not recycled.
In the European Union, 38 percent of plastic is thrown out in landfills.
The promising discovery centers on the wax worm -- the name for the caterpillar larva of Galleria mellonella, or greater wax moth.
In its pre-caterpillar form, the species is commercially raised as maggots to provide fish bait and aquarium food.
The moth is also a scourge of apiculture, laying its eggs in the precious honeycomb of beehives.
The find happened by accident at the home of the study's lead author, Federica Bertocchini, a biologist at the Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology of Cantabria in Spain.
Bertocchini keeps beehives as a hobby.
"When I went to clean them for reuse in the spring, they were infested with (wax) worms," the researcher told AFP.
"So I put them in a bag. Then, after a while, I saw the bag was full of holes and these caterpillars were crawling all around my place."
Startled by the caterpillar's voracious appetite, Bertocchini and a team from Cambridge University decided to conduct experiments to find out just how much, and how quickly, the pests could consume environmentally harmful plastic.
They placed hundreds of the small, yellowish creatures on top of a supermarket plastic bag. Within 40 minutes, holes began to form.
Twelve hours later, the caterpillars had consumed 92 milligrammes (0.003 of an ounce) of the stuff, far swifter than fungus and bacteria would have taken.
In their next test, the biologists confirmed that the larvae fully digest a plastic meal, breaking down its chemical components.
Covering a plastic bag with mashed-up caterpillars produced a similar results, suggesting that an enzyme or some other compound was at work.
"The caterpillar produces something that breaks the chemical bond, perhaps in its salivary glands or a symbiotic bacteria in its gut," Bertocchini said.
The answer may lay in the worm's habitat and eating habits.
Growing in bee colonies, the moth larvae feed on beeswax, a digestive process that scientists believe may be similar to breaking down polyethylene.
"Wax is a polymer, a sort of 'natural plastic,' and has a chemical structure not dissimilar to polyethylene," Bertocchini suggested.
It remains unclear if a single enzyme or a combination of molecules are responsible for degrading plastic. But biologists hope to identify and reproduce the active agent artificially.
"Using million of caterpillars on top of plastic bags would not be feasible," Bertocchini said. 
Manufactured on a large scale, the plastic-degrading substance would, in theory, take the form of an environmentally harmless liquid that could be used in plastic treatment facilities. (NDTV)

India creeps into Sri Lanka's Energy sector: NFF Muzammil
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) Media Spokesperson Mohammed Muzammil claimed today that they are in doubt whether the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to hand over the China Bay Oil Tank Farm in Trincomalee to India would be signed during the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's visit to India or not, despite PM's assurance that he would not sign.
A secret arrangement is underway to hand over the Trincomalee China Bay Oil Tank Farm to India by the Ranil Wickremesinghes government after signing the MoU. We are not sure whether the MoU will be signed during his visit to India or during the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka in the midst of Wesak celebrations, Muzammil said.
We have revealed some important facts so far regarding the signing of agreements, he said.
In 2003 Ranil Wickremesinghe had handed over number of oil tanks to India. India is in the process of acquiring the remaining oil tanks. Several rounds of discussions have been held to hand over ownership of several plots of land near the Trincomalee harbour to India for a minimum period of 50 years, Muzammil said.
Energy was one of the main elements which gives equal prominence as national security of a country, he said.
India is trying to interfere in Sri Lankas energy sector and trying to control the country's destiny through the Wickremesinghes government, Muzammil said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Leprosy is back
	
The Leprosy Hospital in wattala : A safe refuge for the isolated victims of leprosy
Leprosy was considered a curse in the past and as there was no cure, patients were treated as outcasts and kept in Leper Asylums. Many countries around the world have eradicated leprosy. It was believed to have been eradicated in Sri Lanka as well. Yet, reports show that the disease is on the rise. The importance of making the public aware of the disease led us to the Leprosy hospital in Hendala. Chief Medical Officer of the Hendala Leprosy hospital, Dr. Jayalath Chandrasiri and Director of the Anti-Leprosy Campaign Dr. Priyantha Karunarathna commented on the spread of the disease. 
A lack of attention paid to changes in the skin is the root cause for the infection worsening. Once treated, patients can no longer spread the disease. The government aims to eradicate leprosy from Sri Lanka by 2020, emphasized Chief Medical Officer of Hendala Leprosy Hospital, Dr. Jayalath Chandrasiri. 
Leprosy is a slow-spreading airborne communicable disease, caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. It is a pathogenic bacteria that infects the peripheral nerves. It shares similar features with the tuberculosis bacteria, explained Dr. Priyantha Karunarathna. 



Leprosy Hospital in Hendala,One of theoldest in Asia
There are two leprosy hospitals in Sri Lanka, situated in Hendala and Maanthivu island (close to Batticaloa). The latter has only one inmate. It is said that a Dutch captain who had leprosy travelled to the present hospital premises which was a shrub-land at the time and settled there secretly. He was brought food from the other bank and relatives built a small structure there for him. 
The Dutch VOC hospital opened in 1701 and construction of the buildings was completed in 1708. The inauguration symbol still can be seen there. Since its inception, many leprosy patients were admitted here. The hospital itself is considered an archaeological site and is 309-years- old. The leprosy hospital has the oldest washing machine which was made in England and brought to Sri Lanka in 1938. Most buildings in the hospital premises are in ruins and renovation does not take place since it was declared an archaeological site in 2015. Nobody has the permission to renovate the site except the Archaeological Department.
Present condition
The Hendala Leprosy hospital is home to 29 leprosy patients living in four wards. They cannot transmit the disease, yet their deformities are clearly visible. They have been neglected by their families. Some of them who are skilled in craft-making are helped by the hospital. A 40- member staff is engaged in looking after the patients along with three doctors. In the past, they had 32 acres of land but this has now been reduced to seven and a half acres. The hospital is maintained by the Health Ministry and warmly welcomes helpless patients who have nowhere else to turn. 

Current Trends of the Disease
Stating the statistics of leprosy in the country, he said, Last year the number of patients recorded was 1,863 and the majority of cases were reported from the Western Province, with the total patients recorded being 917. In 2015, there were nearly 2,000 reported cases. Usually we do not get patients below the age of 3 as it takes some time for the disease to develop. Patients are usually above the age of 3 and even above the age of 70. The bulk of patients are between the ages of 25 and 45. Last year the number of children (below the age of 15) recorded was 155. 
We are worried about three parts of the country which are considered highly endemic areas. The Western Province, the Eastern Province (Kalmunai, Ampara and Puttalam) and the Southern Province. The majority of patients are in Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha. In these districts we have observed that it is found mostly among underprivileged families, those in slum areas and the fishing community. The highest number of cases are reported from the Moratuwa area. 
Speaking of public awareness on the disease Dr. Karunarathna said, We want to spread the message to these areas that if they notice anything resembling this disease, they should seek medical help. The message is not being passed properly. In addition to this, there is a stigma attached to this disease so people dont speak about it and some even hide it from their family members and do not go for treatment. 

The Disease Risk factors
The strength of ones immune system is the main determinant in contracting the disease.The weaker the immune system, the higher the chance of getting the disease. The strength of our immune system depends on many things such as genetics, nutrition, general health, the environment, housing, ventillation, congestion and economic status. Thus the lifestyle people lead can determine whether or not they will contract the disease. 
Transmission
The transmission of the disease occurs through respiration, when the bacteria enters the victims nose. The bacterium must enter the persons body for them to contract the disease. Some epidemiological studies have shown that there is a predominance for the disease in males rather than females but anyone can be affected by the bacterium. A leprosy patient can transmit the disease after a few months to those around him through respiration, sneezing and coughing, where the bacterium is released into the environment. Those around the patient can get the disease this way. It does not spread through contact but mainly through airborne transmission. 
A person could inhale the bacteria spread by a patient, however 95% of the time healthy people remain unaffected due to a good immune system and other factors such as genetics and nutrition. Only 5% or 10% of people may get the disease. Factors leading to this includes spending a lot of time with the patient or a weak immune system. 
Action of the Bacteria
The leprosy bacteria is very peculiar. Once it enters the body, it gradually travels to the nervous system and reaches out to the relatively cooler parts of the body, such as the hands, feet and face. Once they have started replicating, patches will start to appear on the skin and are the earliest sign of infiltration.
Then they invade the sensory nerves closer to the skin and the patient complains about the patch and the anaesthetic feeling around the patch. This might spread all over the body. 
Symptoms
Its crucial to know about the early stages in order to get treatment as soon as possible. The most common symptoms are the patches appearing on the face, hands and feet. The colours of the patches are lighter than the other parts of the skin and may vary from copper to gold. If observed carefully, the sensation of the area having the patch will be less compared to other areas. Identification is done by pricking the spot with a needle. 
There may be other variations in the early stages. Sometimes it may appear as a thickened nerve. Patients may feel a lump under the skin on their face, hands or feet, due to the nerve involvement. If such signs persist for more than two to three months, this could be a sign of leprosy. If someone has suspicions about the disease he/she should seek the advice of a dermatologist. Neglecting medical treatment in the early stages will lead to complications. 
If early stages are ignored, the bacteria can infiltrate the nerves. Sensory nerves and motor nerves connected to muscles can be affected and patients will complain about numbness in their feet and hands. Gradual nerve involvement will lead to deformities. The nerves stop working and the limbs become thick and unmovable. 
With the progression of the disease, injuries too will take place. People might get cut or badly burnt because they lose their sense of touch. When the ulcers and injuries do not heal naturally, the bodys reaction is to expel the limbs, fingers or toes, causing these parts to
drop off.
Treatments
It is important for people to know that treatment is available for leprosy and that it is 100% curable. Usually, if someone has contracted leprosy it is diagnosed by a dermatologist. Leprosy treatments are only available in the government sector, throughout the country in any hospital with a dermatologist. We have ensured that there are no difficulties or barriers to access these services. Private sector dermatologists will direct patients to a government clinic. 
Some will have to take this treatment for six months and others for one year. It is a combination of drugs which patients will be directed to use. 
Edward Alwis from Dehiwala
We are told he is the oldest inmate on the premises. He was admitted on April 6, 1943 at age 18. He detected two patches on his face and was later registered at the hospital. There were 800-900 patients and 22 wards at the time I came. There was a drop in patients after 1956. Edward says some of them were even sent to jail, as fights would break out for better meals to be introduced. All my siblings are married but I couldnt get married because of this disease. People dont come and visit because they think they will get the disease but we have all been cured, so it wont spread, he added

Anonymous speaker
The waste management in this place should be properly disposed of, assuring health safety. They just dump the bandages and other waste into a garbage dump and burn it. This is not healthy. Some employees dont have identification cards even though they have worked here for two years. The buildings are very old and have not been preserved. Many are falling to the ground. 


Heen Banda from Kandy
I first detected a numbness in my feet in 2002. I misunderstood it for another disease and got treatment for two years. It was at the government hospital that I realised I had leprosy. Heen Banda says the wounds caused by leprosy should be well cared for, otherwise the disease would worsen. 




Ananda from Moratuwa
Ananda is very skilled in woodwork and was admitted at the age of 18 when he detected scars on his body. He has his own wood workshop, where he takes orders to make wardrobes and other furniture. He also makes special sandals to meet the needs of his fellow patients. 

P.B. Doratiyawa from Kegalle
He spoke about the lack of facilities there and especially the poor meals. Im a vegetarian but they gave me the same thing they gave everyone else. He was admitted to the hospital in his forties. 







An inmate who wanted to remain anonymous
All these buildings are falling apart. Some wards are door-less and dogs come in at night. We have issues with the quality of food we are given here. Even though we are entitled to quality meals, what comes to our plates lacks quality. 

Kamala Gunathilakafrom Bandaragama
I was admitted in 2001. First I was diagnosed with diabetes and my leg was amputated. I was then taken to the skin clinic where the disease was recognized. She had been manufacturing envelopes while warded and had to be satisfied with the Rs.500 allowance. 










Peter Hettiarachchi from Kahawatta
I came here in 1950, when I was 10-years-old. We were sent back home in 1960 after being told we could not spread the leprosy germ after being given the DDS tablet. We demanded an allowance from them because we had been there for years and thats how we got the Rs.500 monthly donation. 





Most inmates are in their 70s and 80s and wish for company above all.
Anyone interested can donate clothes, food and other provisions.
Even a kind word to them will go a long way.

MBSL and Finance among top 10 Lankan financial service providers
	
Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) has emerged as one of the top 10 brands in Sri Lankas financial services industry.
LMD and Brand Finance Lanka, in the latest Brands Annual 2017, which ranks the countrys top 100 corporate brands of listed and unlisted companies, has ranked the MBSL brand among the 10 most valuable consumer finance services brands in Sri Lanka.
This independent external ranking has affirmed MBSLs market position as one of the fastest growing brands in the financial services sector in the country. Having successfully accomplished one of the most complex corporate mergers in the country, MBSL is now well on its way to reinvent its image as a rapidly rising, modern and customer-oriented brand.
This is indeed an encouraging sign of MBSLs brand recognition and mind share among the public. The 2017 ranking puts MBSL at number seven among financial service providers, placing us within the top 10 leading brands in the financial services industry, from the eighth position in 2016.
It is noteworthy that this improvement in brand value has been achieved within just two years of extensive internal restructuring and rapid changes to our business model, following the merger process. This demonstrates the value of the MBSL brand and is indicative of MBSL potential as we continue to expand and strengthen our brand presence, said MBSL Chairman Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa.
The upward movement in MBSLs brand ranking reflects the improvements not only in how the brand is perceived but also the improvements to internal businesses processes and our service delivery. We have continually invested in building customer relationships, augmenting our customer care and enhancing the quality of our employees.
Our employees are the most prominent brand ambassadors of MBSL, demonstrating MBSLs business ethics and quality of products and services to external stakeholders. I am confident we shall continue to see further improvements to our market position and brand equity in future, said MBSL CEO T. Mutugala.
In addition to MBSLs ranking among financial service providers in the country, MBSLs overall brand ranking among the top 100 listed and unlisted companies, in the 2017 Brands Annual has also improved significantly within one year.
In 2017, MBSL came in at the 58th position among the top 100 brands with a brand value of Rs.774 million. This is an upward climb of 18 points from the 2016 ranking at number 76 and a brand value of Rs.475 million.

Schools should limit assigning students for outdoor activities in the severe mid-day heat that is currently prevailing in the country, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told school principals today when addressing a meeting at the Education Ministry.
He said the they should pay attention to the students health and should instruct them to drink more water to remain hydrated and added that students should be asked to wear caps and use umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun.
Government and Government-approved private schools will begin their second term today.
Principals should see that the school water tanks are cleaned regularly so as to provide safe drinking water to students and make the school environment pleasing and safe, the minister said.
On an earlier occasion the Education Ministry instructed school principals to clean their school premises by eradicating dengue mosquito breeding sites.
It had authorised school principals to obtain assistance from parents, past students' unions and school development committee members to keep school premises safe. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Oluvil fisheries harbour to close down
	
Fishing activities at the Oluvil harbour in Ampara is to be halted as the government is unable to bear the cost of maintenance, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and ministry officials had discussed the function of the harbour after it was revealed that it did not make sufficient funds to cover its expenses.
The harbour is a white elephant that we cannot take care of it, the minister said.
The Oluvil harbour, a commercial fishery harbour, was declared open on September 2013. Construction of the harbour commenced in 2008 under the Nagenahira Navodaya programme.
Meanwhile, the ministry official said that proper environmental assessment and feasibility was not conducted when construction began.
While the harbour was constructed to hold more than 250 fishing boats, all boats are anchored outside the harbour as it was dangerous to enter the harbour.
There is a large sand deposit at the mouth of the harbour. There is at least 40 million cubic metres of sand deposited in the area for which the ministry has to bear around Rs. 350 million to remove the sand only to have it collect again in two months or so, ministry spokesman Dharma Wanninayake said.
The Ministry has scheduled a discussion with the Ports Authority, Fisheries Harbour Corporation and Coast Conservation Department about its closure as there was no benefit in leaving the harbour open.
Minister Amaraweera is scheduled to speak to the government regarding the closure of the harbour.
The harbour was also to be transferred to the Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation recently from the Ports and Shipping Ministry. However, the process was cancelled after the decision to shut down fishing activities.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Regular bedtimes make children less likely to be obese as adults
	

Putting children to bed at the same time every night stops them gaining too much weight, research shows. 
Eating regular meals and watching less than an hour of TV an evening also help prevent obesity. The study of almost 11,000 British children found a strong link between a well-defined family structure and emotional behaviour at the age of 11. 
This in turn affected whether or not they were likely to be obese, the research found. 
Sarah Anderson, the American scientist who led the study, said a good bedtime routine was key. She added: This study provides more evidence that routines for preschool-aged children are associated with their healthy development and could reduce the likelihood that these children will be obese. We saw that children who had the most difficulties with emotion regulation at age three also were more likely to be obese at age 11. 
This research allows us to better understand how young childrens routines around sleep, meals, and screen time relate to their regulation of emotion and behaviour. 
Sleep is so important and its important for children in particular. 
The research was carried out jointly by academics at University College London and Ohio State University in the US.It studied 10,955 children in the UK whose routines, weight and emotional regulation were measured when they were three and 11 years old. 
Emotional regulation was defined as whether or not they became easily frustrated or overexcited. Those who had a regular bedtime, ate meals at the same time and watched an hour or less of TV a night had more self-control. 
And those who had better emotional self-control were less likely to be obese, the results show.Dr Anderson, who is based at Ohios College of Public Health, added: Recommending regular bedtime routines is unlikely to cause harm, and may help children in other ways, such as through emotion regulation. 
Giving children supersize portions leads them to eat more whether they are hungry or not, a study has found. Youngsters who were offered salted popcorn, or carrots, ate more when it was served up in extra-large packs. 
The Belgian study found the effect was even more pronounced with sweet food.

Rise and fall of Ananda
	

When I entered Ananda in 1952 it had earned a reputation of producing a list of students (then published in the Daily News) entering the different faculties of the Ceylon University that needed a foot ruler to measure. Ananda was known to send the largest contingent to the University and perennially won the Herman Loos shield for the best platoon. No more distance did Ananda travel in those days of rickshaws and trams. 
Ananda won fame bringing students from Burma and substantially from the schools of the North of old Ceylon. Ironically, the distinguished old boys of that era rarely sent their progeny to the old school: as there were no berths for Anandians in many private sector establishments. The reason was elementary: in the minds of those that mattered,Ananda did not have a pedigree that branded it an elite public school, when it was prestigious to walk a dog at the Colombo Kennel Club, men wore tails and red bands to sip soup at Queens House and officers in the Defense Services found their hazardous assignment was to go on parade 
In a nutshell, Ananda did not fall in line with the values that were treasured by the immediate post-colonial society with its labyrinthine old boy networks from other schools. Eminent old boys of Ananda often loathed disclosing their school identity in fear of being thought inferior. In that topsy-turvy social ladder, to be a planter or tea taster brought more glory than being a banker or accountant. Yet Anandians reached dizzy heights through higher education and often reached the hall of fame in the jewel of the crown appointments in the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service (CCS) and the learned professions. 


I remember a few distinguished old boys (including Presidents of the OBA), did, in my time, sent their kids to the old school but soon transferred them to St. Thomas or Trinity in fear of foul contamination. Fortunately my father was a Trinitian and had his education abroad, loathed the colonial system and was the first civil servant to don the national dress to office and was adamant that his son is a product of a Sinhala Buddhist orientation. My mother sobbed late into that night for the stupidity of enrolling me at a yako school and was taunted by her family of Thomians, since it lowered in their wonky esteem by having a family member from a school where the boys [mispronounced] were mocked for eating the five cent gram and travelling by tram. 
Half a century later, travelling down memory lane, I owe most in life to my peers at Ananda who taught me a value structure that enabled me to advance in life in a transforming, turbulent Sri Lanka; more than what I learnt at home. Sadly among my close friends today, very few are Anandians, but those from other schools that once mocked us. Those old differences have now paled into insignificance. War and Cricket, significantly Sri Lankas twin claims to fame during the period of terrorism, have reduced schools to a level far less important than the nation. For people who matter the old school tie has no relevance. The past belonged to an era when school Big Matches attracted bigger crowds than visiting foreign cricket teams and Ananda and Nalanda held fame as the sister schools that produced most International players at cricket. Things are no more the same. 
What fired our generation at Ananda was a combination of a home/school environment. Decent Sinhala Buddhist homes where culture and values were prime characteristics; parental care and family life was a predominant factor; education was the prime goal sought; people cared for the society they habituated. Add to this the inspiration received from the in-house pedagogues- Ven. Kotagama Vachissara, mascot of Ananda in my time where his word was the sacred gospel; Panikkar (Science), Weeraratne (Mathematics), Thanabalsingham (English Literature), J.R.P. Suriyapperuma (Government)  all legends in their spheres, even though at times over-rated and exaggerated by schoolboy enthusiasm. Principals of that era Meththananda (trend-setter in the Sinhala Buddhist renaissance) Wijayatilake (a superlative exponent in public speaking in English) Karunananda (pioneer in the teaching of science in Sinhala) were national figures, their wisdom expressed in the prize day reports were gems inspiring editorial themes in the national newspapers. They were household names beyond boundaries. 

Ananda won fame bringing students from Burma and substantially from the schools of the North of old Ceylon
Traveling down memory lane, I owe most in life to my peers at Ananda who taught me a value structure that enabled me to advance in life
In recent times with reluctance, and at the insistence of old boys, appeared in shame to represent, principals in matters concerning their own questionable discipline. I tried a dodge by stating there are so many Anandians who are Presidents Counsel and I carried no such honour, which notion was dismissed outright. Todays teachers do not have that same legendary status. I silently weep when introduced to some of todays teachers at school functions while I still bow low to my old school teachers in deep reverence. On retirement, old teachers grow in esteem. Look at any function  around whom do old students rally to revere Teachers that instilled discipline into us. 
We as underdogs were determined to be the top dogs. We knew we had the stuff and stamina to peak though we lacked style and sophistication. It was not my generation that brought Ananda to great heights. The next generation reached the summit in the days of Principal Rajapaksa  he thrived on the laurels of the past and forged ahead. Rajapaksa became the fortunate recipient of a firm foundation built by those named greats: the men who held his office in the past. Thereafter it has been a steady decline and in my analysis the rise and fall of Ananda had much do with the head of the institution. It is the head that carries a school on his shoulders - in times good and bad - with the staff beside him. The wheel indeed had turned with Rajapakse. 


We were a generation that knew not of Apple and Reebok; I Pad or I Pod but survived on linseed oil to season bats and catgut to string racquets. We did not have a ground or pavillion (shared with Nalanda), swimming pool (St Josephs) or gymnasium (wide open spaces next to the work shop). Yet our schoolboy heroes such as Yatagama Amaradasa, Sarath Wimalaratne and the Wettimuni brothers led national schoolboy cricket teams that included at least four of the playing members from Ananda and trounced Indian schools. The Marks brothers with Germanic antecedents, Geoff and Boris, won the pubs at swimming and water polo; the Jayasuriya brothers carried the Stubbs at boxing; the Tarbat Cup for athletics was ours with Vijitha Wijesekera (track/field and hurdles) and Sarath Wijesinghe (throwing events); we won the Jefferson in relays with G.N. de Silva anchoring the last lap; Gamini Weerasinghe and Pundarika Perera saw us emerge as winners in tennis; and the formers brother Neil saw us through at table tennis - both brothers being coached by a keen mother; and the teacher in charge A.D. Karunananda saw us overwhelm other schools to win at badminton annually. As Rajapakse said It was Ananda First, that mattered. 
The Principals room had a glass case that displayed a collection of silver that was priceless. It was designed only to hold cadetting shields and was heavily over-loaded with the other fields over-powering cadeting In debating (Sinhala or English) and Quizzes/Spelling Bees we led the pack and emerged as winners or runners-up; the names of Buddhadasa Bodinayake, Mahipala Udabage and Manik Nagahawatte come to mind. Our teachers, not our parents, were our inspiration and to them was our dedication. My schoolmates and teachers applauded our achievements, fired us with zeal and zest to reach out for the greater glory in the name of the school. 


Where have all those trophies gone with that cupboard now virtually empty and bare Yet, the college now proudly holds assets - in a swimming pool, gymnasium, indoor courts, a stadium with a scoreboard and a terraced pavillion along with well-paid coaches and trainers and an air - conditioned auditorium. Those boys won accolades then, were lads, strong in mind and body. Quality Controllers necessary were in the staff room; now lacking though the present boys have guts, nerve, spirit and more to spare. Its the conditioning, they lack - we had a surfeit of it from our teachers. 
In other respects is Ananda becoming another school without bondage In the old days personal factors were not a competing feature; it was for the school that mattered and we did all-together, to proudly proclaim- A/N/A/N/D/A- Ananda-twice over. Joy and glory were shared as we wore the same maroon and gold tie. My glory was their glory and applauded with all my might- when my peers pushed my school to the forefront. Thankful for the opportunity to contribute to this magazine as there was a time I was deemed insufficient in comparison to others from whom articles were requested. Green eyes were unknown those days. 
My parents were otherwise heavily occupied, knew little about what I did at school and were mildly pleased that their son had secured a place in Peradeniyas law faculty. After my first attempt, before the results were released, they persuaded me to join a foreign owned tea plantation under a Scottish pukka-sahib. Such were the times, Anandians were an unknown commodity in the plantations. Those white members at the old Uva Club in 1963 snorted at the bar hearing the word Ananda mocking it to be a night school Fortunately University results came in 9 months. Most members of the plantations are some of my dearest friends- no one wears school ties any more. 


Up in Peradeniya (where a different mode of artificiality prevailed) found every rag-leader was an Anandian. Such were the controls acquired at the campus by the numerical strength of Anandians in 1964. They knew of me and saved me of raghazards by chasing me away with an overdose of filth. They told me later how it was organized to save marked men in Peradeniya. No wonder I owe so much to Anandians of my time. Such was the brotherhood. 
Our ambition was to win keeping with the college motto, of not delaying it for too long. So we strived harder and win we did. In sports, there was sadly a touch of gamesmanship where our winning mattered: in studies it was the hard slog to be the front-runner. We imported the best of talent from our sister colleges and molded that talent to achieve greatness using the drive produced by our teachers. 
The true test of an Anandian in a nutshell reads - whether he is your senior/junior, a predecessor/successor, if he is from the old school follow his career relentlessly and take pride in his achievements as a reflected glory of your old school. We all share in the pride of being Anandians. 
My advice to the coming generations of Anandians is to Hold your head high. Dont bend or bow. Harness your skills as there is no substitute for hard work to achieve greatness. The pride of Ananda will gather glory as long as at its head is a respected learned man dedicated to the college as those in the past to whom, let me pay homageYou did it for us, kind teachers. We benefited. You did not, except in the pleasure in seeing what we have achieved!

Rs. 30 mn allocated for prevention of Malaria
	
The government has allocated Rs. 30 million this year - a three-fold increase compared to last year - for the prevention of Malaria in the country ,Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Despite Sri Lanka being a Malaria-free country now, the Minister recalled the catastrophe it caused when the epidemic broke out in 1934 losing the lives of 80,000 people.
He said recently a Malaria patient was reported at the Kalubowila Teaching hospital where a migrant who was infected with the disease was identified as a positive Malaria case.
Minister Senaratne said the Health Ministry had identified several possible diseases that could be transmitted through migrants coming down from vulnerable countries.
However, the Minister said health officials and doctors were capable of identifying the disease and treating them successfully. He asked Lankans to be vigilant when travelling to Malaria endemic countries and seek medical assistance when necessary. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Towards a parallel Sinhala cinema
	
H. D. Premaratne

Because cinema is the youngest art form, those who take to it tend to align themselves with other, older art forms
Lester was a documentarian who recorded life as it was
Obeyesekere and Premaratne were quirks in our cinema
In my tribute to Vasantha Obeysekere two weeks ago, I noted that Sri Lanka was never really open to the kind of parallel cinema that invaded India. There are reasons for this, prime among them being the fact that our cinema was (at its inception) theatricalised to such an extent that, unlike our immediate neighbour, for it to break away from the semi-operatic form it had succumbed to, it had to tear itself away from the visual image and embrace the written word. That is why Lester James Peries opted for adaptations of both popular and serious novels and short stories. 
Lester, however, was a documentarian who recorded life as it was. When compared to the films of Satyajit Rais heirs (Shyam Benegal, Mira Nair, and Adoor Gopalakrishnan), those of Lester can be traced back to the Italians and the French. It is my contention, therefore, that despite his attempts at reporting Sri Lankan (village) life, he was constrained by his (lack of) roots from conjoining the visual and the verbal in them. The problem with those who could conjoin those two, on the other hand, was their inability to transcend the commercialist tendencies of their films. 
H.D. with Vijaya
Ravindra Randeniya, at the launch of Dileepa Pereras book on Tissa Liyanasuriya last month, implied that Tissa stands between Lester and his ideological foe, Dharmasena Pathiraja. This is both correct and incorrect: correct because Liyanasuriya, in the films over which he exerted complete creative control (Saravita, Punchi Baba, and Narilatha), went for stories that were more socially conscious; incorrect, because despite their lofty exhortations (Getawarayo is about the corruption of the village by the city, while Saravita is about an uncorrupted idealist from that same city), they could not transcend those populist, moral overtones that Pathiraja would reject. 
Much of the groundwork laid by these pioneers  Liyanasuriya, Mike Wilson, and Shesha Palihakkara  would be adapted and added to in the seventies, not by Pathiraja but by two other directors. The second of these, Vasantha Obeysekere, did the implausible: make use of the tropes in our commercial films to subvert the patriarchy and moral conservatism embedded in it. Barring Diyamanthi, all of Obeyesekeres films depict a shattering of hope, be it Kusums highbred notions of marriage life in Palagetiyo, Rathmalis idealisation of her tormentor in Dadayama, or Nandas dreams of a stable, secure life with her errant husband in Kadapathaka Chaya. 
If Obeysekere tilted towards the anti-romantic, however, the other director tilted towards the opposite extreme. That is why I consider H. D. Premaratne as the more ground-breaking artiste of the two: not because he hit it big at the box-office with even his most serious stories, but because he brought serious themes to popular audiences through those stories. If Obeysekere shocked, then Premaratne preached. 

Because cinema is the youngest art form, those who take to it tend to align themselves with other, older art forms. Measured against this truism, Lester was a modernist director, having grown up on Wallace Stevens, Proust, and Hemingway, while Pathiraja was the postmodernist, eschewing the idealism of his ideological foe through Barthes and Lyotard. I think it a fair criticism of both these pioneers that they were as dependent on literature as those they were contending against: the Jayamanne brothers, Sirisena Wimalaweera, and K. A. W. Perera. 
The cinema of H. D. Premaratne was never rooted in the written word this way. Premaratne was the first director here who (wittingly or unwittingly) worked out his stories, not through his scriptwriters, but through his composers. I believe this observation (personal though it may be) is borne out by a rough perusal of his work: the contrast between the energetic freshness of Sikuruliya and Apeksha and the more serious undertones of Parithyagaya and Deveni Gamana, for instance, comes out when considering that the music for the first two was composed by Clarence Wijewardena, for the latter two by Premasiri Khemadasa. 
A scene from the film Parithyagaya

In Premaratnes work, consequently, the image, the spoken word, and music are almost effortlessly conjoined. Like Douglas Sirks melodramas, Premaratnes more popular films (Apeksha, Saptha Kanya, and Adara Hasuna) bring about what can only be described as pure visual poetry because of this: the final sequence of Adara Hasuna, for instance, where Vasanthi Chathuranis character is reconciled with her lover (Ravindra Randeniya), echoes the kind of happy but poignant ending that Sirk opted for in Magnificent Obsession and All That Heaven Allows. There are sequences from even his cynical films  Palama Yata, Visidela, and Seilama  which depart from that cynicism and entreat us to forget. 
And for me, that was what constituted the mans strength and weakness. While Obeysekere became more cynical with each successive film (to the point of overkill, as Maruthaya showed), Premaratne remained the disciplined, romantic idealist, though not at the cost of depicting otherwise taboo themes. For better or worse, however, that idealism became his undoing when he went for the overtly political. That explains the limitations in Visidela and his last film, Kinihiriya Mal. 

In Visidela he tried to reflect a politically fragmented era in a thwarted love story. Jackson Anthonys character (a soldier), is at odds with his more politically active village. His idealisation of the political Establishment crumbles when he learns that his sister has been raped by his fathers friend (the sequence of the rape cuts to her fathers discovery of her boyfriends corpse: a victim of the ongoing insurrection). In the end he is as blindly unable to connect the personal and the social as we are, so we blindly follow what he does next: kill the old man and in turn get killed by the same officers who employed and later promoted him. The tragedy here, poignant though it is, to my mind is inadequate to make up for the disjuncture between the love story and its political backdrop. 
In Kinihiriya Mal he was crippled by another inhibition. Malinda Seneviratne in his review pointed out that the story was limited by the dichotomies reinforced between the virtuous village (symbolised by the elder sister, played by Vasanthi Chathurani) and the corrupting city (symbolised by the younger sister, a prostitute played by Sangeetha Weeraratne). The urban-rural dichotomy depicted in the film is contrived and unconvincing for such clear demarcations are no longer tenable, not even in the imagination of the romantic ruralised, he wrote. 
Put simply, Premaratnes attempt to depict a pertinent issue (underpaid garment workers being ensnared to prostitution) was marred by the good/evil divide that commercial films subsisted on. Given his inability to do away with those dichotomies, he was unable to free himself of the box-office tendencies of the same parallel cinema he brought about. Obeysekere faced roughly the same problem: in his last film, Aganthukaya, he tried so hard to do away with the commercialist strains of his story that he ended up reinforcing the same good/evil divide that Premaratne tried to evade, but could not. 
Should we regret, though At one level, perhaps. But then Obeysekere and Premaratne were quirks in our cinema: there was nothing to explain why they entered our film industry. Lester James Peries and Dharmasena Pathiraja were reacting against the conventional wisdom in that industry, with Lester as the modernist and Pathiraja as the postmodernist. Obeysekere and Premaratne steered clear of both. In the end, I believe they could not realise the full worth of what they were doing because (and this I will get to in a later article) they were in a country where the divide between the popular and the arty, even in the cinema, was too firm to penetrate, much less defy.

U.N. finds torture widespread in Afghanistan
	

KABUL REUTERS April 24- Torture and mistreatment of detainees by Afghan security forces is as widespread as ever, according to a U.N. report released on Monday, despite promises by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and new laws enacted by the government. 
At least 39 percent of the conflict-related detainees interviewed by U.N. investigators gave credible and reliable accounts of being tortured or experiencing other mistreatment at the hands of Afghan police, intelligence, or military personnel while in custody.  That compares with 35 percent of interviewees who reported such ill treatment in the last U.N. report, released in 2015.  The U.N. report comes as senior Afghan officials prepare to appear before the U.N. Committee Against Torture in Geneva this week to face a review of Afghanistans record of implementing anti-torture laws. 
The International Criminal Court in The Hague is conducting a separate review of torture in Afghanistan.

Vallibel Finance moves Gall branch to dual access location
	

Financial innovator Vallibel Finance called for a double celebration as it not only relocated to its own premises in Galle but a showpiece location in the heart of the popular town.
Smack in the middle of downtown Galle, the location is the centre point of the southern commercial hub, commanding prestige and prominence. The new premises while having two road frontages has a phenomenal view of the harbour too.
Vallibels new customer-centre lends a vibrant new look to the city centre and its enhanced infrastructure facilities will allow the financial trailblazer to bring its full spectrum of financial products and services to the people of Galle.
Vallibel Finance Managing Director Jayantha Rangamuwa said that the high-riding finance company is now the centre of attraction and it is a rare privilege to own a landmark location in such a historic city, which is also known to be the informal capital of the intellectuals and entrepreneurs.
Speaking in the aftermath of declaring open the spanking new customer centre, Rangamuwa also stated that Galle stands out as a true Sri Lankan treasure and Vallibel Finance understands its incredible potential.
If tourism was Galles strong suit, business and trading come a close second. Galles multi-dimensional economy is boosted by the entrepreneurship of its people who also thrive in agriculture, fisheries, craft and industry, he said assuring the large gathering that his company will energize Galles engine of growth, readily assisting its people with financial products right for the times and the area.
Galle is a spectacular city that inspires the entire district further adrift of the bustling city centre. Its a tourist attraction that plays host to visitors from around the world. As a company attuned to understanding the true aspirations of a diverse people we are recommitting ourselves to people of Galle, he said.

A letter containing this appeal had been presented to the political authority when the latter attended a New Year oil anointing ceremony.

The politico making a case for promoting his man had described him as an exceptionally efficient officer in the public service, but those familiar with his track record say that he is a just mediocre type and is facing allegations of sexual harassment made by several female employees. Besides, there are several white collar ones senior to him in service who are better qualified for the high office in question, they say.
Meanwhile, reports say that this politicos man had collected a commission in foreign exchange taking advantage of his involvement in organizing a Russian tour for a group of politicos at a provincial level.

Youth should take more governing and parliamentary responsibilities: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today he strongly believed that intelligent youth should take more governing and parliamentary responsibilities.
He told this when President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Saber Chowdhury met him at the Presidential Secretariat today.
Mr. Chowdhury pointed out that although 50% of the world population is below the age of 30, only 1.9% of the Parliamentarians in the world are below 30 years of age.
The President, welcoming the IPU President, said that he would extend fullest support to IPU programmes to promote youth and women participation in government and parliament.
He pointed out that steps have already been initiated to introduce a womens quota for local government body elections.
Mr. Chowdhury said the President Sirisena has given an inspiration to all those who work to strengthen parliamentary democracies in the world.
The step taken by President Sirisena to dilute executive powers of the Sri Lankan Executive Presidency and vest them with the parliamentary is an important step towards strengthening democracy.
He also expressed his high appreciation over the anti-tobacco campaign of President Sirisena.
Pointing out that in some countries parliaments have been marginalized by Executive Presidents and in some other countries government terms have been extended through referendums, the IPU President said, Sri Lanka is a beacon of hope for other parliamentary democracies.
