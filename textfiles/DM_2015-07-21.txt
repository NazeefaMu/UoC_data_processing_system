Video: Akila challenges MR for a public debate
	
	UNFGG Kurunegala District candidate Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today challenged UPFA rival in the District former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for a public debate.
	Minister of Education Kariyawasam told a news briefing that he was willing to face the former President for a debate on any TV channel.
	He said he was willing to debate on the promises given by the former President during his term in office.
	He questioned as to why the former President could not deliver these promises which he was making now during his tenure as President.
	The former President had promised to increase the salaries of public servants up to Rs 25,000 and I would like to ask him as to why he could not do this while holding office, he said stating that he would ask such questions at the debate.
	Kariyawasam said the decision of Rajapaksa to contest from the Kurunegala District had created an internal competition among the UPFA candidates as well.
	Therefore he said Rajapaksa, Johnston Fernando and Chief Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera were competing with each other for the preferential votes.
	He said a large number of UNP members from the Kurunegala District left the party along with Chief Minister Jayasekera, when he joined the UPFA but today many UPFA members were joining the UNFGG. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)

Video: Govt. has given less priority for national security: Gota
	
Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa said today the new government has given less priority for national security which was crucial for the development process in the country.
When we stabilised the security in the country, we were charged to be war fanatics. We can clearly see how the national security deteriorated during this short period, he said.
Mr. Rajapaksa expressed these views at a function held at Ape Gama in Battaramulla to launch the election campaign of UPFA candidate Udaya Gammanpila.
Mr. Rajapaksa said some people charged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as a dictator but if it was so he would still be the president and I would be the defense secretary. Mr. Rajapaksa said some individuals who were with them had committed wrongdoings and that led to the downfall of their government.
Mahinda Rajapaksa has identified those who committed wrongdoings. We are ready to rectify our mistakes based on the past experience, he said.
Western Provincial Councillor Udaya Gammanpila said it was not Mahinda Rajapaksa who left on January 09 would be coming on August 19 but a fresh leader after rectifying his mistakes.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Lankans among those seeking Swiss asylum
	
Applications from Sri Lanka, Eritrea, Syria and Somalia seeking asylum in Switzerland had increased during the first six months of this year, Swiss media reported.
It said almost 12,000 applications had been lodged and Eritreans were accounting for more than half of the applications followed by Somalia, Sri Lanka and Syria.
The latest statistics from the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) show 11,873 applications between January and the end of June  up 16 per cent on the same period last year.
More people had requested asylum in the second quarter than the first, with June registering a bumper 3,805 applications.
The SEM said the increase in the second quarter was mainly due to the higher number of Eritreans arriving from southern Italy.
But it pointed out that the increase was modest in European terms. The Swiss share of asylum requests lodged in Europe had more than halved since 2012.
The State Secretariat for Migration expects asylum requests to reach around 29,000 by the end of this year. Last year the total was just under 24,000.
Pius Betschart, Deputy Director of the Federal Office for Migration told the Schweiz am Sonntag newspaper online that in the first five months of this year asylum requests were under last years levels.
Then they rose suddenly, and now we have 1,000 requests a week, he said.

Video: Probe source of funding to Muslim extremists: BBS
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) today urged the government to investigate the alleged funds that were coming to Muslim extremists and expose them to the country.
It should investigate how the funds are coming to them, from which countries and for what and publish the details to the country, BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said.
Most of the problems are created because of not revealing to the public the facts relating to the Welikada, Dehiwela, Aluthgama and the latest in the Keththrama ground incidents, the Thera said.
The Government should take action to stop such funds coming to extremists without fondling them in the aim of getting votes in the upcoming Parliamentary Elections, he said. 
While addressing the media by the BBS CEO Dr. Dilanthe Withanage said that the BBS had warned of the danger of Sri Lankans being recruited by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) six months ago.
Withanage said that when the BBS initially warned of this possibility, it was ridiculed as a racist comment.
However, this warning had now become a reality, with reports of a Sri Lankan ISIS fighter being killed in Syria, he said.
The IGP has instructed Central Province Police to conduct investigations into the slain ISIS militant, who is reported to be a Sri Lankan.
Media reports claimed that the militant was known in the organization as Abu Shuraih Sailani. He was reportedly a former Sri Lankan Karate instructor.
Several Sri Lankan Muslim communities have requested the BBS to help free them from this extremism and they said that they would support silently, he said.
We can clearly say the Sri Lankans, who worked for ISIS, have involvement in the Aluthgama incident. Sri Lankan authorities are afraid of investigating in to the ISIS related incident in the country, Mr. Withanage said. (Chaturanga Pradeep, Indika Sri Aravinda)
