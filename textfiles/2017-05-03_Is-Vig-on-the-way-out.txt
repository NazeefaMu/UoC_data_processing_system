Is Vig on the way out?


	



 

A ding dong over the Northern Chief Ministerial post has already begun though the poll appears to be miles away. 

 


The leaders of the political party with a popular base in the North-East had set the ball rolling when they decided at a recent closed door meeting to oust the incumbent Vig who turned renegade after winning the coveted office with their blessings.


The party leaders had also reached agreement to field as their candidate a ‘radical’ already holding a seat in Diyawanna council. 


The party big guns have taken into consideration that they would have no problem about marketing ‘the new face’ among the people in the North as the latter has close ties with several media institutions in the country.  


Vig, who turned a rebel in the party and a controversial figure in the national political scene soon after assuming political office, is getting set to meet his main challenger from a position of strength, they say.
