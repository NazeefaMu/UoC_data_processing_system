The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has requested President Maithripala Sirisena to inform the Attorney General or the High Court, the government's stance on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

GMOA Secretary Naveen De Zoysa told a news briefing that the government had changed its stance on the SAITM from time to time.

“The government’s stance keep changing. Nothing has been finalised yet and we cannot depend on the government's statements,” he said.

Dr. De Zoysa said Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had informed the Appeal Court that SAITM students received a quality education, but the government issued a statement on April 7 admitting that these students should receive better clinical training.

He warned the government that its final decision on the SAITM issue should be revealed by May 29.

“The subject minister should brief the court about the government’s final decision on SAITM by May 29 and only then we can accept it as the government’s stance on this matter,” he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
