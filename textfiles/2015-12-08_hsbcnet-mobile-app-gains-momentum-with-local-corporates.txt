MAS Legato, the Shared Service Centre of the MAS group, has become the newest user of HSBC’s newly launched global mobile application for HSBCnet.
The mobile app provides a convenient and secure platform for customers to perform a number of HSBCnet functions on their iPhone or Android smartphones while they are away from their desk, as follows:
-View account balances and statements
-Create payment instructions for existing beneficiaries
-Authorize payment instructions
-Receive notification of payments ready for authorisation
The new digital solution has enabled MAS Legato to authorise payments swiftly creating a sleek and convenient environment for day-to-day cash management requirements. 
Speaking on this further, MAS Legato CEO Shiromi Rajendra said, “This is a first step for the MAS group. MAS Legato currently processes over 14,000 payments a month for group companies. The use of the mobile app will simplify the authorisation of these payments. Initiatives such as these helps MAS Legato move closer to our objective of enhancing the user experience and simplification of process steps through automation.”
The enhanced platform on the mobile offers faster and easier user experience. It provides direct access to customers’ entitled accounts and services from their smartphone home screen, allowing easier control at their fingertips with a mobile-friendly interface, anytime and anywhere.
HSBC Sri Lanka Head of Corporate Banking Chamira Wijetilleke said, “HSBC Sri Lanka was among 12 markets in Asia Pacific to launch the HSBCnet mobile application platform in June this year, and we have since seen a positive take up with our customers who are already users of HSBCnet. In a digital era where mobile banking has changed the way we conduct business, we are confident that HSBCnet mobile will help companies to grow and remain profitable. We are pleased to have MAS Legato as the latest user of the mobile app and hope their experience will propel more new users in the future.”
