Chief Executive Officer of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Dilantha Withanage today urged the Government that it had come to know about the warning of the danger of the Islamic State terror group spreading its tentacles to South Asia, from a recent report by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.

While addressing a media briefing today, he said the report had been handed over to the Defense Ministry last week.

The report warned about the spreading of the Islamic State terror groups in the country.

“We are questioning the President’s office and the Prime Minister’s office about the knowing of this report,” Mr. Withanage said.

“Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera might not have read this report,” he said.

“In his report the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had warned the danger of the IS terror group spreading its tentacles to South Asia including Sri Lanka through organisations. The report demonstrates the speed and scale at which the threat has evolved in just 18 months,” he said.

“We should talk about this threat in terms of politics rather than looking at it in a racial manner as we are raising the issue.

“Due to lax visa regulations, Sri Lanka is fast becoming a hotspot for terrorist activities for them to spread fear among our people,” he said.

“If the government had a backbone, it should stop the spreading of the Islamic State terror group in the country instead of hunting BBS,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
