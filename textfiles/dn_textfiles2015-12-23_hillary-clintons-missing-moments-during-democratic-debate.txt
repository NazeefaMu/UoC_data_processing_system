Hillary Clinton's missing moments during Democratic debate

US: Hillary Clinton went missing during the Democratic debate and her absence did not go unnoticed.
After the first commercial break - almost an hour into the third Democratic debate on Saturday night, the debate returned to the screen with two candidates at the podium, Senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley.
The former Secretary of State was missing.
Rather than waiting, moderator David Muir moved forward, asking Mr Sanders a question. Mrs Clinton came walking in, and said "sorry" into the microphone.
The reason why she was late hasn't been disclosed, but her calm apology was received with laughter and cheers by the audience.
It was likely just a matter of timing. She had exactly one minute and 45 seconds to walk out of the gymnasium at St Anselm College to the ladies' restroom and one minute and 45 seconds to return to her place on stage.
With the men's room significantly closer to the debate stage, Mrs Clinton's male opponents, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, made it back more quickly.
Aides said they had been concerned during the walk through before the debate that the ladies room was such a schlep. The campaign's vice chairwoman, Huma Abedin, had timed the distance to and from the podium and expressed concerns to organisers, but the gymnasium setting meant there were no closer options. She relayed to Mrs Clinton that she would have to be speedy, said several aides involved in debate planning.
In the end, the moment became one of the most talked about of what seemed an otherwise low-impact debate. The momentarily empty podium prompted jokes that Mrs Clinton, so focused on defeating the Republicans, had, perhaps, decided to watch the primary debate from a Manchester bar, with a row of glistening ladies' rooms nearby.
In the first Democratic debate in October, Mrs Clinton was also late to return to the stage after a break, and said, "You know, it does take me a little longer", a comment referencing that it can take women longer to use the bathroom.
Some on Twitter blamed the ABC television network for coming back from the commercial break too early. Others said that the campaigns should have negotiated with the network to not return until all candidates were back on stage.
