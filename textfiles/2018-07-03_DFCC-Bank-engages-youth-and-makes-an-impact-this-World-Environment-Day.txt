DFCC Bank recently commemorated World Environment Day by conducting a tree planting campaign at Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya in Ranala. While DFCC’s Sustainability Unit planted 50 fruit trees with the students of the school, the bank’s Community Projects team organized the donation of agricultural and gardening equipment, to enable the students to continue nurturing the newly planted trees.

The event, whichwas attended by Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya’s entire staff, all 300 students, as well as most of the students’ parents, kicked off with a brief address by the Vice Principal of the school, where he highlighted the significance of World Environment Day and the importance of planting trees. He also thanked DFCC Bank for involving Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya in an initiative of this nature, which will contribute towards enhancing the school’s natural surroundings, whilst giving the students an opportunity to engage in agricultural and eco-friendly activities.

The agricultural equipment and tools were then handed over to the school by Senaka Jayasinghe and Ruvini Hettiarachchi, members of DFCC Bank’s Sustainability Unit. This was followed by the planting of trees around the school playground, by students, teachers, parents as well as DFCC Bank officials and representatives. After all ofthe trees had been planted, each class in the school was given the responsibility of looking after five trees, so as to ensure a high survival rate for the plants, which in turn would help make the initiative a success. The event concluded with the DFCC team handing out snacks and beverages to all the students and participants that were present at the school grounds.



Commenting on DFCC Bank’s World Environment Day celebrations, Mr. Lakshman Silva, CEO of DFCC Bank said; “This World Environment Day, we are very pleased to have had the chance to give back to the planet and do our part as responsible corporate citizens, by hosting a tree planting campaign at Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya. We recognize the value of teaching our youth, the importance of conserving our environment and natural resources, and we hope that this initiative will inspire and encourage the students of the school to become more involved in environmentally friendly practices and activities. Another highlight of this year’s World Environment Day was our visit to Korathota Somananda Vidyalaya in Athurugiriya, where we planted 100 seedlings on World Environment Day 2017 as well. It was an absolute delight to see that nearly all the young seedlings we had planted a year ago had flourished into healthy trees. We look forward to working on similar tree planting initiatives in the future, and engaging with youth across the island.”
