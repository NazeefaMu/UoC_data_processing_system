A case where ignorance was bliss


	



 

This fair one is holding a very high office in a commission much talked about these days. 

 


The lady met a group of colleagues from the black-coated community during a recent visit to Aluthkade. A popular figure among pro-yahapalanaya groupings, the lady had occasion to chat to a few pro- JO colleagues as well. While swapping banter with them, the lady told them: “I understand that you people have coined a nick name for me now.”


“We really don’t know it. What is it? Please tell us!” a black-coated one pleaded.


Then the lady uttered a three-letter word and asked them: “Is it not the nick name you have coined?”
However, the colleague ventured no reply though he appeared to be on the brim of laughter.


The lady spoke up again. “Tell your friends who gave me the second baptism that I really like the new name they have given!”


Having said that, the lady walked away.


Once she was safely out of earshot, the black-coated one burst into laughter. After giving vent to his mirth, he addressed the colleagues looking askance at him.  “She doesn’t know the real nick name we have given her. She has mixed up the letters of the name!”


“Why beat about the bush? Tell us the nick name you have given her!”


A colleague insisted. 


“Apoy! How can I utter a filthy word here?”, he said and beat a hasty retreat.
