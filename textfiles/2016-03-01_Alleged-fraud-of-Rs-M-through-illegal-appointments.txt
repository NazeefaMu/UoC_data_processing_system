Financial fraud amounting to Rs.16 million had been committed by making illegal appointments to the government sector, including to the state school sector, said the secretary of the Ceylon Teachers' Services Union, Mahinda Jayasinghe today.

After lodging a complaint with the Anti-Corruption Secretariat against Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam regarding illegal appointments to the government sector, he said the minister had made such appointments to National schools in Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya and Karandeniya.

“The proper procedure had not been adhered to in making these appointments. The vacancies had not been advertised in the gazette. The ministry had not even conducted proper interviews,” Jayasinghe said.

He said the minister had violated the establishment code by giving back-dated appointment letters.

“The letters of appointment were dated December 30, 2015 to show that the applicants had assumed duties before January 2016. All the appointments had been made in violation of the fundamental rights of the G.C.E. O/L and A/L qualified persons and in favour of those with political connections,” he said.

He said the appointments had been made to various departments and institutions relating to the education sector.

He also said the government had introduced a Contributory Pension Scheme in budget 2016 for those appointed before January 2016. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Indika Sri Aravinda)
