Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told Parliament yesterday that during the past two months, 38 ‘Ava’ group members had been arrested and four motorbikes, four swords and an axe taken into custody.

Responding to a statement by EPDP leader Douglas Devananda that the 'Ava' group had inconvenienced the people in Jaffna, the minister said some 100 police officers had been deployed in the North to control the situation.

Mr. Devananda said this armed group had engaged in assaulting and looting people and that he was wondering whether some unknown elements were backing this group.

"I wonder whether the criminals are operating with political influence because whoever is arrested is released soon after," he said.

The minister said the police had not received any complaints about political influence backing the 'Ava' group. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
