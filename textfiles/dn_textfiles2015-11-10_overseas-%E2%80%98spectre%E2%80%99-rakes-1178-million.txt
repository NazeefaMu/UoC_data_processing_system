Overseas, ‘Spectre’ rakes in $117.8 million

James Bond and Charlie Brown’s gang re-energized the North American box office after a dismal few weekends.
Spectre launched to $73 million from 3,972 theaters, the second-biggest opening for any film in the iconic spy franchise, and one of the top showings of the year to date. Still, some had expected the tentpole to approach $80 million domestically. Overseas, Spectre also dominated, grossing $117.8 million from 76 markets for a global weekend take of $190.8 million and early worldwide total of $300 million. It placed No. 1 everywhere.
The Peanuts Movie, looking to launch a new family film franchise, opened to $45 million from 3,897 locations, a solid start considering newer generations aren’t necessarily familiar with the late Charles M. Schulz’s famous comic strip. Overall revenue for the weekend is expected to clock in at $162 million, a record for the first full weekend of November. That’s good news for Hollywood following a string of high-profile misses.
Peanuts only launched in a few foreign markets this weekend, including China, where it opened to a poor $2.8 million amid fierce competition. Fellow Fox title Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials and Universal’s Everest also debuted in China, earning $19.8 million and $11.3 million, respectively. (There were also two Chinese films that debuted.)
Spectre — James Bond’s 24th trip to theaters — couldn’t match the $88.4 million domestic debut of Skyfall in November 2012, a series best, but beat the openings of Casino Royale ($40.8 million) and Quantum of Solace ($67.5 million). All four films star Daniel Craig as 007.
Sony, MGM and Eon Productions, partners on the tentpole, say Spectre faced more competition domestically than Skyfall, which had the weekend to itself in terms of new releases. “It’s a fantastic start,” said Sony worldwide distribution president Rory Bruer. “On every continent — including Latin America, Asia and Europe — it is breaking Skyfall records.”
Spectre outperformed Skyfall’s opening in Mexico ($4.5 million), Brazil ($2.9 million), Russia ($5.8 million), Hong Kong ($2.4 million) and Malaysia ($2.3 million). It opened to a massive $20.1 million in Germany — on par with Skyfall — nabbing the biggest Saturday of all time. Spectre has yet to open in China, Japan, Australia and France.
And, after making history in the U.K. with the biggest opening of all time, Spectre fell just 29 percent in its second weekend of play there to jump the $100 million mark and put it ahead of Skyfall. Hollywood Reporter
