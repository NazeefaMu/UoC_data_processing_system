The accomplished playwright M. Safeer has begun his brand new international theatre experience called “Swings of love”. The sole female character of this production is performed by Julia Filippo, an Italian artist equipped with international stage experiences. Julia Filippo has already arrived in Sri Lanka and will continue to train full time on the production until the initial performance is staged for an limited crowd.   


The premiere show of the “Swings of love” is planned to be held at the Pune IAPR international theatre festival in November. It will also be staged for three special public viewings at the Korean International Dio<U+200B> performing arts festival in Seoul, followed by some invitation shows around the world.   
The script of this poetic play is written by the proficient writer Manjula Wediwardena. His original script is translated into English by Dilini Eriyawala.   


The theme of ‘Swing of Love’ is about femininity and love. The story recreates the sensations born in a woman on natural wonders of love, coition and violence. Apart from the explicit beginning and ending, the production is four act.   


The production has a single female performer to reinvent femininity and love using her gestures, rhythm and voice as the medium of communication. Five swings of different colours are used according to the theme and some pre-prepared videos and coloured backgrounds appear concurrently with the acts. From the beginning to the end, the performer plays her role only on the swings.   


The production management and lighting designing are by Sujeewa Pathinisekera and Music is directed by Vindaka Weerasinghe. Stage management is by Jeewanthi Perera and the stage supervision is carried by Tharushi Kavindi. Weerasingha Jayasundara takes part in the production with audio-visuals. The national and international logistics and propagation will be done by Nirasha Priyawadani while the international coordination is done by Jayalath S. Gomes.   


Inter Act Art has produced numerous creations during the last twenty years, appreciated by local and international audiences. In 2013 and 2015, the artistic director M. Safeer, has been invited to the FLAME University of Pune in India and the Directorate of Culture and Arts of Goa in order to realize workshops with students and artists and create two theater productions. These shows participated in numerous international theater festivals and they received a warm welcome and success.   


The shows produced by Inter Act Art are created following the modern and contemporary theater techniques. In 2016 during an international festival organized by the IAA, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, M. Safeer got to know Julia Filippo and her work. Following this meeting, Inter Act Art has decided to co-produce an international theater production combining the abilities of the actress Julia Filippo and the directing style of M. Safeer.
