The National Development Bank PLC was felicitated with awards for Best Use of Mobile Technology (Banking Industry) and Best Use of Mobile Technology in financial services for its newly introduced NDB mobile banking app at the recently held South Asian Business Excellence Awards ceremony organized by the South Asian Partnership Summit (SAPS) and the World HRD Congress. 
NDB’s mobile banking app is the bank’s flagship IT lead initiative. Banking is now extremely convenient and easy, allowing customers to access their accounts/cards to carry out various secured transactions in real time without any hassle from any mobile device running iOS, Android or Windows. Without any limitations this comprehensive solution can be used by anyone, on any mobile network to perform any transaction. 
Now with more opportune solutions, customers have guaranteed safety for their debit and credit cards with the unique feature of switching them on or off whenever they require it from wherever they reside, while also being able to  activate credit/debit cards instantly without calling the Bank’s Call Center. 
The app consists of a plethora of features which allows  customers to make payments to any postpaid or prepaid mobile number registered in Sri Lanka, carry out fund transfers between own NDB accounts, transfer to third party NDB accounts, and also transfer to other bank accounts. The customer will now instantly be able to view all the latest deals and offers with the merchant location and details as well. 
The NDB mobile banking app introduces the ‘shake’ element to make the customer’s mobile banking experience fun and easy to use.  With the shake feature the customer has to ‘shake’ the phone to view the deal of the day without having to log in, and after logging in the customer can ‘shake’ the phone to view account balances. 
NDB has further introduced an innovative ‘Pay to Mobile’ function where the customer can transfer funds to another NDB Mobile Banking customer by simply inputting the mobile number, without having the need to enter an account number. The customer could easily add and manage beneficiaries for making fund transfers to third party NDB accounts, fund transfers to other bank accounts, bill payments, mobile recharge and Pay to Mobile. 
A photo capture feature is provided for beneficiary registration where the customer can either capture a new photo or select from the existing photos in his/her mobile gallery which enables the customer to easily identify beneficiaries at a glance when making a payment.
Another unique feature of this app is the ability to make payments to other bank credit cards (own / third party) by registering other bank credit card details through the app itself. Utility bill payments can also be done through credit cards using the app. For frequent payments, the customer could simply save the beneficiary details for greater convenience, set own transaction limits, report lost cards without the hassle of calling the call center and carry out many more banking activities.
