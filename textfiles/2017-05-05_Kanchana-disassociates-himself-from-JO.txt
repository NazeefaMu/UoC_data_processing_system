UPFA Matara District MP Kanchana Wijesekera said today he had decided to temporarily disassociate himself from the joint opposition.

In a Facebook post he said he had no intention of joining the government or the ‘Maithri faction’ of the SLFP or for that matter any other faction which supports the government.

“This decision was taken to obtain a better perspective of the prevailing situation. I will continue to serve the people of Matara and the mandate given to me,’ he said.

In a response to one of the comments, he said his decision is in no way against the joint opposition or former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, but against those who misuse the JO platform in the pursuit of earning more money and against those who support such moves.

“I will never sell my soul for a ministerial post or other perks but will continue to fulfil my duties as a Member of the Opposition,” he said.
