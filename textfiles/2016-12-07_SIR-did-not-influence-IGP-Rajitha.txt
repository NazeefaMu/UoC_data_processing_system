Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne today said who ever spoke to IGP Pujitha Jayasunadara during the press conference in Ratnapura on November 30 was not to influence him to arrest or not to arrest any individual but only to know about the position of the said case.

Responding to a barrage of questions from journalists at the weekly Cabinet news briefing in Parliament, Minister Senaratne said no one could suggest that the so-called ‘Sir’ was in a move to influence Mr. Jayasundara to do something or not to do it.

“If you closely go through what transpired during the conversation, it was very clear that Mr. Jayasundara was explaining to the ‘Sir’ about an ongoing inquiry against a ’Nilame’. He did not say whether he was to arrest or not. The ‘Sir’ also did not apparently asked Mr. Jayasundara to take action to arrest the ‘Nilame’ or not. I think, the media blew this incident out of proportion and it became a big topic in the media and in political circle,” Minister Senaratne stressed.

However, when asked by a journalist whether it could be Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Minister Senaratne said 'it could be'. (Sandun A.Jayasekera)
