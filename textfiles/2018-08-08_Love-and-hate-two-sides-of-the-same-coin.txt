Love and hate – two sides of the same coin!


	



 

Asking for high positions from political authorities is generally considered a pretty dicey affair. Because if your request goes unheeded, it could mark the end of your ties with the big guy!

 


There is a prominent cleric who is said to have realized this home truth through this bitter experience.
This dignitary who played a lead role to bring yahapalanaya into power had asked for a portfolio related to agriculture – that too at the top level – from a high political authority.  In fact, he had made the request several times. However, the high authority who, by them had got used to such requests galore, had simply ignored it. 


Livid that his request had gone unheeded, our cleric severed all ties with yahapalanaya and began attacking its leaders at every turn. 


And he has gone to the extent of grooming a member of his own revered community to pit against the high political authority at the upcoming big poll, they say.
