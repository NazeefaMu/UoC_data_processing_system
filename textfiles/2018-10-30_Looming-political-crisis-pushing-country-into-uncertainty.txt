Looming political crisis pushing country into uncertainty


	

The uncertainty currently prevailing in the political climate in the country is not only killing but also dangerous. Both the United National Party (UNP) led by Ranil Wickremesinghe and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) led by President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa are laying claim to the government, after Rajapaksa was sworn in by the President on Friday in a dramatic and surprising move.   


This situation has led to the supporters of the two parties to attempt to hold on to or capture power in various government institutions, as we have already witnessed in the State-owned media institutions and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Added to this is the possible showdown over the premises of the Temple Trees, the official residence of the Prime Minister of the country.   


Needless to say the only way out is to weigh the power both groups claim to wield in the Parliament and accept the outcome. But it is 17 days far away, as the Parliament session has been prorogued until November 16, within which anything is possible. It is inferable that the President has prorogued the Parliament in order for Mr. Rajapaksa to buy time to muster power sufficient to show that he commands the confidence of the Parliament, as required by the Constitution. But, it is a legal decision.   


Whether it is legal or not, ethically correct or not, the intervening period is so crucial in terms of peace among the masses. Also the situation would be further chaotic in the event Parliament decides against the President. Hence, the main stakeholders of the current conundrum must prove that they are responsible, matured and respected leaders. They must bridle the possible black sheep within their ranks.   


Another serious matter is that the minorities in the Parliament are becoming the decisive factor in sorting out the power struggle in the House. Already all eyes are on the individual members and the leaders of the minority political parties in the Parliament, despite many southern politicians always having a habit of demonizing them. The UNP seems to be depending totally on the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the UPFA is trying to woo individual members, if not for the leader of other Tamil and Muslim political parties.   


The minority parties becoming important at this juncture is serious not because of any possibility of minority representatives of the House getting advantage of the situation for their personal gains or to win over their political demands, rather it is serious because they are gaining importance and going to decide the fate of the two groups at a time when emotions are running high in the majority community.   


With the initial changes at the helm that created the current imbroglio, already some sort of fear seems to have started to creep into the minority community circles, especially the Muslims. It is obvious, given the developments and their own political decisions during the recent past which was their sovereign right though. On the other hand, the leaders of the Tamil and Muslim communities that live in the southern parts of the country seems to be in a catch 22 situation, given the circumstances that led to the current poser which was elucidated by the President in his address to the nation on Sunday and the mindset of their constituency, that would decide their fate at the future elections.  


They might have definitely been confused by the fact that anything might happen at the confidence vote in the Parliament when it meets. Therefore, the situation demands more farsightedness on the part of those leaders of the minority political parties.
