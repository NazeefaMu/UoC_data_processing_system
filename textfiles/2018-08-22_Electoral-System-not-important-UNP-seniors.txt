The electoral system under which the PC Elections should be held was not important for the UNP as the party wanted the Provincial Council Elections held as soon as possible under any system, several party seniors said today.

UNP Spokesman Harin Fernando told a media briefing that the system under which the elections were held was not important as the party wanted the elections held as soon as possible under any system.

“If we keep on crying on the electoral system, it will result in a political setback,” the Minister said.

Minister Fernando added the report of the Committee appointed to look into the Delimitation of Provincial Constituencies was discussed by the Cabinet on Tuesday and both-President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe-had called for another report on the amendments that had to be made with regard to Delimitation.

He said decisions would be made after they get the report.

State Minister Eran Wickramaratne, who also participated in the media briefing, said the debate on the delimitation was included in the Order Paper.

He said it was up to the MPs to decide on how would vote- in favour of the Delimitation Committee Report or not - after seeing it. (Yohan Perera)
