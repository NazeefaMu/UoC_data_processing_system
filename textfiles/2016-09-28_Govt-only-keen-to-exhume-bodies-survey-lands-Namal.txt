Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa said today the biggest problem for the government was the extent of my grandmother’s land and not the hardships faced by the drought affected people in Hambantota and Polonnaruwa or the possibility of the IMF loan being turned down because of the failure to implement the VAT increase.

He told journalists after being present at the surveying of the land owned by Yoshitha Rajapaksa in Dehiwala yesterday adding that they would always respect Court orders.

“We will never evade court. At least one of our family members is summoned to Court every day under this good governance government. We have not done any wrong and we are not afraid to come to courts. We have faith in the court today just as in the past and hope justice will be meted out,” he said.

He said the government had done nothing since it took office other than exhuming bodies and surveying lands.

When asked about the delay in holding the Local Government election, Mr. Rajapaksa said the government had no confidence to face an election as it had done nothing for the people.

“We urge the government to hold the election if it was not afraid of elections. Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was blamed for holding elections. This government has not been able to resolve the burning issues of the people including those of farmers,” he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
