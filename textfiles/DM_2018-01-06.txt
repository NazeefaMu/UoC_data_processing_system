Bomb cyclone hits US East Coast energy, power supply
	

REUTERS, 05th JANUARY, 2018 - A severe winter storm froze pipes and disrupted services at refineries on the U.S. Atlantic coast on Thursday, sending fuel prices higher as heavy snowfall and high winds caused electricity outages for almost 80,000 homes and businesses.
The only nuclear plant in Massachusetts was shut just after 2 p.m. because of the failure of a line that connects the reactor to the power grid. Entergy Corp (ETR.N), which operates the Pilgrim Station, said it had not identified the cause of the line problem. ISO New England, which operates the regions power grid, attributed the shutdown to blizzard conditions. The company did not say when the station would restart.

Bond Commission report: Speaker to convene party leaders meeting
	
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has convened a party leaders meeting on Tuesday to discuss the request made by several political parties to hold an emergency parliamentary meeting to table and debate the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report, a Source said yesterday.
He said the request for an early date was made by the SLFP, the MEP, the JVP and the joint opposition before Parliament's scheduled sittings on January 23.
However, the decision to summon Parliament earlier than scheduled has to be taken by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Speaker is has referred the requests to the Prime Minister, the source said.
Meanwhile, Minister Susil Premajayantha said when the PCoI report is tabled in Parliament it becomes a public document and can be subjected to a debate.
The Speaker has said that some members of the UNP had also consented to an early date to discuss and debate the report in Parliament. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Embodiment of missionary education
	
As much as fee levying private missionary schools have not been able to bring up children with religious values, the late Rev. Kala Suri Marcelline Jayakody remains one, who went in search of values in his faith.
When his alma mater, a Missionary College in Colombo, put him out for not being able to pay the arrears fees he opted for seminary training to pursue his school education as a student. Although education is now compulsory for 13 years, there was a high drop-out rate, during the missionary school days due to the inability among parents to pay the fees missionary schools levied.
Such schools were not patronised by the State like now, hence those who were unable to pay facilities fees had to drop out.
Yong Marcelline Jayakody was not an exception and had the wisdom to seek entry to the Seminary to complete his primary education.
Most of the dropouts from the private schools now seek admission to Government schools as the only option to complete the 13-year education programme.
Not only Rev. Fr. Jayakody, but a lot of unfortunate children had to leave in the private missionary schools due to poor financing conditions.
However, with his upbringing in a homely Buddhist atmosphere, the Temple was a part o his life.
Many who promote reconciliation have emphasised the need to take the essence of all religions and base a Rule of Law in terms of the prescriptions of these faiths.
The late Rev. Jayakody justified this thinking and mobilised authorities to achieve these ends.
He used music and lyrics of indigenous ecclesiastical verse in this mission. However many before Rev. Jayakody had attempted this. It needs language and literature skills and the philosophical knowledge, which could be achieved only with an open mind.
Christianity was first introduced to the country during the latter part of the Anuradhapura Period, for which there is evidence- that of a Nelum Kurusaya (Petal Cross), which is believed to have been found carved in the Abhayagiri Monastery.
Even the Christ was colloquially named as Abishek Buddha, which means as the Anointed One in the Christian faith.
The composition of the Mangala Geethaya by late Rev. Fr. Jacome Gonsalves, CO and the famous composition of the Song Deviyo Uppanney Sathuni, could only originate from a rural agricultural community.
The Christian songs of the pre-Portuguese era had been rewritten or updated with better melodies in keeping with the indigenous verses.
Many revolutionary artistes like Fr. Jayakody and Francis Molligoda emerged in the post-independence era. They fall in line with Ananda Samarakoon, Sunil Santha and Rukmani Devi.
The struggle for a national music continued with the Radio Ceylon and even in Churches. There was also a musical revival of the Buddhists, with Latha Walpola and Mohideen Baig in the same period.
As the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is always conversant in the development of indigenous music in Sri Lanka, has once expressed that there had been wise men, who have not been in the school system.
Education is not only indoctrination according to a curriculum. This is the tradition of music the Jayakodys and Molligodas have bestowed to the heritage of the Catholic Church.
It is up to the stakeholders to patronise this tradition for the betterment of our culture.

THE HINDU, 05th JANUARY, 2018 - Perus ex-president Alberto Fujimori was wheeled out of a Lima hospital late Thursday a free man following a controversial pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
A frail-looking Fujimori, 79, held up a hand to wave to supporters as aides rolled him out the main entrance of Limas Centenario Clinic in a wheelchair, before he was whisked away accompanied by his lawmaker son Kenji in a convoy of vehicles.
A woman repeatedly shouted We love you, we love you! as she tried to reach Mr. Fujimoris vehicle through a line of security officials.

GMOA alleges 'Sunset' and 'Sunrise' an eyewash
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday alleged that the decision taken by the government to create two separate entities called Sunset and Sunrise under the SLIIT by abolishing SAITM was a mere deception and they would not accept it.
The Government on Thursday said it signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the SAITM and the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) on December 30 to create two separate not-for-profit entities called Sunset and Sunrise under the SLIIT.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told the Daily Mirror the said governments decision was not even clear and added that the government was in an attempt to continue private medical education in the country with this decision.
The government does not have any specific programme to solve the SAITM issue. The current situation reveals the governments inability to solve this issue. The main reasons behind the battle to abolish SAITM are its low standards and inadequate clinical practices, he added.
He said the government was trying to handover the responsibility of the SAITM to SLIIT with the hope that the said requirements would be fulfilled through it and added that they do not have any authority to do so since the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) had still not approved these two new entities.

No campaigning at places of worship: EC
	
Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday that if any candidate contesting the LG polls, uses a place of religious worship for his election propaganda work, not only the candidate but the one in charge of the place of worship was liable for prosecution and a 7-year term of imprisonment under election laws.
"Displaying posters, cutouts and banners of candidates other than at his or her election office and at a venue of a rally is not a right but a courtesy extended to candidates and that all propaganda material have to be removed by 12.00 midnight on February 7," he said.
Mr. Deshapriya told the media that special arrangements had been made to check the qualifications of candidates contesting the local government polls and that three unqualified candidates had been identified so far.
One candidate has his name in two electoral lists, another has served the same LG body to which he is contesting for and other candidate is below 18 years of age. As such they will not be eligible to contest the elections and the reasons for disqualification have been conveyed to them, he said. "The EC is conducting inquires to identify whether any of the candidates been convicted of some crime and had served jail terms. A person once convicted can contest an LG poll only seven years after the conviction.However, those who have been fined or given suspended sentences will not be disqualified."
Mr. Deshapriya said a meeting of party representatives would be held on January 8, 9 and 10 and pointed out that disqualified candidates among the 8,356 contesting the LG polls could be identified at this meeting. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

North and South Korea agree to hold talks next week
	

North and South Korea have agreed to hold high-level talks next week, the Defence Ministry in Seoul said Friday, with North Koreas potential participation in next months Olympics top of the agenda.
Pyongyang had accepted an invitation from Seoul to hold talks in the shared border village of Panmunjom, located in the Demilitarized Zone, on Tuesday, the ministry said.
The talks will be the first meeting between the two governments in more than two years and come after both sides extended olive branches.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had offered to send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea in his New Years address, and said he sincerely hoped they would be a success.
In response, Seoul suggested Tuesdays meeting, saying it wished to resolve the crisis over North Koreas nuclear programme with dialogue and diplomacy.
Hopes of a potential thaw between the neighbours continued on Wednesday, when the two countries restored a telephone hotline in Panmunjom that had not been used since 2016.
And on Thursday, the US and South Korea said they had agreed to delay planned joint military exercises until after the Olympics.
Tensions escalated on the Korean peninsula over the course of 2017 as North Korea forged ahead with developing its missiles and nuclear weapons.
North and South Korea have been in a technical state of war since 1953, when a ceasefire came into force. Talks have started multiple times since then to establish a formal peace treaty, but have always collapsed due to acrimony on each side.
North Korea is enraged by the Souths reliance on the United States, especially its decision to let US troops be stationed there, as well as and its policy of conducting regular military drills with those troops.
It has also reacted badly to South Korean programmes to blast propaganda messages across the border by loudspeaker.

Social life and survival strategies of the  Sri Lankan Leopards
	

Sri Lankan leopards are at the apex of the food chain in this island. They not only feed on large herbivores like sambhurs and buffaloes but do on dozens of others both large and small, including reptiles and amphibians.
They not only feed on little creatures such as mice and frogs to subsist when food is scarce but consistently will kill and eat small prey opportunistically.
Highly adaptable and versatile in diet and habitat preference, leopards live along marginal areas where other large cats have been long become extinct. The Leopards adaptive radiation throughout Asia and Africa is one of the great success stories of mammalian evolution.
With long association with humans from a time that the leopard was not quite a leopard and humans were not quite human, today it seems that the leopards have learnt more about us than we have learnt about them.
Primarily, the leopards have realized that humans are best avoided as they pose an ever-present danger.
However, leopards are able to live in close proximity to human settlements even urban areas, and live on livestock, pets and suitable refuse. We have always underestimated leopards and do not give this intelligent, adaptable cat the credit it deserves for living as our neighbours.
Human-leopard conflict however is a growing problem in some areas especially the hills.
It is possible to avoid this conflict altogether ensuring long-term survival of leopards, if a few behaviour changes are undertaken by humans.
The leopards natural instinct is to avoid humans. Its unparallelled camouflage and its secretive nature and its learning capacity will all help to minimise the conflict, which is mostly caused by humans.
Fear mongering and unnecessary persecution and disinformation will not help. It will only prevent easy coexistence which can be lucrative and beneficial to both.
Leopards are an important part of the food chain and ecological balance.
Their extinction will have unforeseen, adverse consequences, impacting directly on a myriad of other species.

The Wildlife and Nature Protection Societys (WNPS) monthly lecture will be delivered by Rukshan Jayewardene on January 18 at 6 p.m. at the Cinema Hall of the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall (BMICH), Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 7. The lecture is open to all and entrance is free.

About the speaker
Rukshan Jayawardenes early education was at the Royal College Colombo.
In his final year in school Rukshan Jayawardene learnt about animal diversity and biological evolution in Zoology. More than any other school lessons, this revolutionary theory, first propounded by Charles Darwin and taught by an inspirational teacher at the Royal College, fascinated him and fired his imagination.
His first job was at the National Zoological Gardens Department or simply the Dehiwala Zoo. By observation and experience he learned much about animals at the zoo, especially leopards and other big cats: Leopards were to become a lifelong obsession.
He was fortunate to have the guiding hand of his first boss Lyn de Alwis.
He has an degree in Anthropology from the University of Maryland and a post graduate degree (MPhil.) in South Asian Archaeology from the University of Cambridge, UK.
He counts 14 years of field experience as an Archaeologist. He retains an abiding interest in Palaeontological Research, especially in recovering past environments from the fossil record. He has a special interest in understanding evolutionary relationships amongst proto-humans, other primates and adaptive radiation of all species.
He is a founding trustee of the Leopard Trust (Est. 2002) founder-member and Chairman of the Wilderness and Protected Areas Foundation (Est.2005), Director at The Environmental Foundation Limited (Est. 1981) and the President of the WNPS (Est. 1894)

## Title: SUBODHIS FR. MERVYN FERNANDO
## Section: News Features

SUBODHIS FR. MERVYN FERNANDO
	

Subodhi is Fr. Mervyn and Fr. Mervyn is Subodhi. The two are inseparably knit together in our memory. Subodhi was the brainchild of Fr. Mervyn, and he lived there ever since it was put up. The other day, he joined in the singing of Christmas carols at their Christmas get-together. The next morning, he was gone, passing away peacefully in his sleep.
I came to know Fr. Mervyn many years ago, at the home of Uncle Eric, whom Fr. Mervyn and his brother Godwin used to visit often. Our friendship grew ever since.
I have had the privilege of introducing Fr. Mervyn to many people - University dons and students, priests and religious dignitaries - on several occasions. And I began, almost every time, by saying that Fr. Mervyn was a visionary. Though Fr. Mervyn was a member of the Astronomical Society of Sri Lanka, he had his feet firmly planted on terra firma. He was a visionary in the sense that he envisioned what was going to happen, what was going to be needed, in the future, especially in Sri Lanka.

He was quite content in being simply a priest, a Man of God - aware of the true source of all he had and had become, and that he was
doing no more than generously sharing what he had been so lavishly given with others.

He was someone who had the gift of looking way ahead of the present and beyond the known horizons. I used to refer to him as the successor to Fr. Peter Pillai. He began the Family Services Institute and Subodhi with this privileged insight.
As a young priest, Fr, Mervyn was chosen by Thomas Cardinal Cooray, the Archbishop of Colombo, as his personal secretary. Later Cardinal Cooray sent him abroad for higher studies. And on his return, it was Cardinal Cooray who supported Fr. Mervyns dream of beginning the Family Services Institute. It was necessary that the Institute conducted workshops and courses on psycho-sexual-spirituality, focusing on issues not much spoken of in those by-gone days. Eyebrows may have been raised at that time that these issues were to be handled by so young a priest. But such was the confidence Cardinal Cooray had in Fr. Mervyn that he was entrusted with the task.
Many years later, when I was making my retreat at Bandarawela, having returned to Sri Lanka after my priestly studies, I met Fr. Mervyn there. He had come to review a book he had written, prior to publication. In the course of a chat, he invited me to join him in conducting a course on Barefoot Counselling, at the Family Services Institute. Seeing me nervous due to a lack of paper qualifications he reassured me, he will fill in the blanks. We conducted that course for about three or four years, first at HFC Bambalapitiya, and then at Aquinas.
One year, we invited Fr. J.C. Fuster, whose course in Counselling I had followed in Bombay, to conduct a similar one for the Family Services Institute. It was at this course, at which I was Fr. Fusters assistant, that I think Mr Godwin Mendis and Sr. Thomas Aquinas, among others, cut their teeth in counselling.
Some years later, Fr. Mervyn gave us Jesuits a talk on the necessity of providing our youth with an integral formation. Reminding us that often our youth get a lop-sided training, with a far too excessive emphasis on their intellectual formation, Fr. Mervyn emphasized that providing our youth with a holistic, integral, formation was an imperative. This was about the time I was appointed as the Catholic chaplain of the University of Peradeniya. Every year, the orientation we gave to the first year University students was based on Fr. Mervyns explanation of the need for an integral formation. I followed that up, almost every year, when we went to Subodhi for the national workshop for University students, by getting Fr. Mervyn himself to explain this concept to the students. It was to provide the youth of our country with the courses, workshops, and the environment necessary for their integral formation that Subodhi was begun.

Subodhi is situated in the midst of a sprawling and pleasing environment. Its architect was Geoffrey Bawa who was a personal friend of Fr. Mervyn. It can accommodate several hundreds of youth and provide them with ample space to conduct their games, exercises, and campfires. Our University students are quite familiar not only with the place but with Fr. Mervyn as well, as he used to oblige them with an inspiring talk, over the ten or twelve successive years we went there.
Fr. Mervyn has told me that the life and vision of Fr. Teilhard dChardin inspired his own life and vision very much. And that no doubt is why he organised the Teilhard Colloquium annually to delve deeper into and help others too to come to know and be inspired by, the life and vision of Teilhard.
A versatile man he had a wide range of interests that embraced the planet Earth in its many facets. And that perhaps is why he was called upon to address many conferences and stole time to put his thoughts and vision into writing.

Subodhi is situated in the midst of a sprawling and pleasing environment. Its architect was Geoffrey Bawa who was a personal friend of Fr. Mervyn. It can accommodate several hundreds of youth and provide them with ample space to conduct their games, exercises, and campfires.

However, the greatness of Fr. Mervyn lay in his simplicity, which glowed from deep within his heart. It is this that I most admired in him. His manner and lifestyle were simple. He was well aware of the many gifts and talents he was blessed with, and the affection and esteem in which he was held, but he would never flaunt them before others. He was quite content in being simply a priest, a Man of God - aware of the true source of all he had and had become, and that he was doing no more than generously sharing what he had been so lavishly given with others.
May the earth lay lightly over him.

Sword or axe; just use it: Wimal to President
	
MP Wimal Weerawansa yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to use whatever the weapon he had - be it a sword or an axe - to punish the culprits of the Central Bank (CB) bond scam.
At JO briefing, he said the President should remove Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and other ministers who he said were responsible for the scam and that it was not the job of the President to summarize the contents of the PCoI report to the media.
A PCoI spokesman could have revealed excerpts of the report. That is not a job fit for the President of a country. The Presidents duty is to take action against the wrongdoers. Thats what he should have done after receiving the bond report, the MP said.
He asked the President whether he could continue to work with the Prime Minister and Ministers Malik Samarawickrama, Kabir Hasim and MP Ravi Karunanayake.
The Prime Minister and other ministers should resign immediately. If not, the President should remove him and the ministers responsible for this scam, the MP said.
He said the President should also take responsibility of the scam as it was he who dissolved Parliament to prevent the previous COPE report being presented in Parliament and authorized Mahendrans appointment.
The President can repent for the sin of dissolving Parliament by convening it immediately and tabling the Bond report in the House, the MP said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 05th JANUARY, 2018 - The UN Security Council is planning an emergency meeting about Iran on Friday, after the US asked the world body to show support for Irans anti-government protesters.
With council members divided in their views of the demonstrations that have roiled the Islamic Republic, its not yet clear how the discussion will take shape or what might come out of it.
Alma Konurbayeva, a spokeswoman for current council president Kazakhstan, confirmed that Friday afternoons meeting is about Iran. The US called on Tuesday for such a session, but council members could insist on a vote before taking up the topic, and it would take nine of the 15 votes to go forward.

UNP and Ravi ask for copy of PCoI report
	
The United National Party (UNP) has asked for a copy of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry report on the CB bond issue, MP Ravi Karunanayake said yesterday.
He told Daily Mirror he also sought a copy for himself in addition to the copy requested by the party and said he would respond after a detailed study of the report.
The PCoI report covers the CB bond sales between 2015 and 2016.
It states that primary dealer, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) made a minimum profit of Rs.688 million at bond auction on February 27, 2015.
The Commission is of the view that further investigations may reveal that this amount could be even more on the basis that PTL had made an undue profit of Rs.11 billion in the secondary market. In these transactions, the EPF and other government institutions have lost more than Rs.8.5 billion, the President said in his speech on the PCoI report. (Kelum Bandara)
