Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today that he was not informed of the court decision regarding Geetha Kumarasinghe's MP post.

He told parliament in response to a question raised by UNP MP Nalin Bandara Jayamaha that he would act according to the court decision when it was informed to him.

Joint Opposition MP Geetha Kumarasinghe attended parliamentary sessions today despite the court decision which ruled that she was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament as she holds dual citizenship. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
