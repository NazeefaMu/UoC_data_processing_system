Sri Lanka's fiscal deficit is likely to be in the 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent range in 2015, the IMF said on Friday, higher than the official target of 4.4 per cent because of falling government revenues.
IMF mission head Todd Schneider also projected economic growth at 5.0 per cent to 5.5 per cent for 2015 lower than the government estimate of 7 per cent.
