He is to emerge  from oblivion!


	



There are indications that a former purohita reduced to a backbencher is to get a portfolio again, they say.


By the way, two purohitas have vehemently opposed the move afoot to bring back the former colleague back into the top team.


The move to restore the former purohita now down and out to his former status has been initiated following signals that he is to be exonerated from all charges he is facing now, they say. Chances are that the former one is to receive the necessary blessings to preside over foreign affairs at the top team level.
