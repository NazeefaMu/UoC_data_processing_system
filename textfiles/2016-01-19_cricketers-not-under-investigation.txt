	Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Captain Angelo Mathews said today the team members including himself were keen to safeguard the reputation of SLC and that was why they volunteered to disclose what they knew about the match fixing allegations.
	He said this to the media while leaving the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) after recording a statement for nearly five hours in connection with a inquiry into the allegations. Mr. Mathews was accompanied by Counsel Nishan Premathiratne.
	He said the cricketers were saddened to read media reports that they were involved in match-fixing.
	“It is the cricketers who informed SLC about attempts by some people to fix matches. However several media institutions in their news reports gave the impression that the cricketers were the ones responsible. The players are not being investigated but the approach made to cricketers that is being investigated," Mr. Mathews said.
	He said he appreciated the stance adopted by Sports Minister, Sri Lanka Cricket and the FICD which were keen on upholding the reputation of Sri Lanka Cricket.
	Counsel Nishan Premathiratne who accompanied Mr. Mathews said the FCID had only asked his client to appear on Tuesday and not on Monday.
	Earlier, the FCID recorded statements from cricketers Rangana Herath, Kusal Janith Perera and SLC team manager Jerry Woutersz in connection with this allegation. (Darshana sanjeewa)
