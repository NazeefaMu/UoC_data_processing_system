The Government decided to import sheep for the sheep farming in Sri Lanka, Cabinet Co-Spokesman Gayantha Karunathilaka said today.

Speaking to the media at the Government Information Centre, he said, sheep farming had been done at farms of National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) and private farms in the Northern and North-Western Provinces.

“But no improved categories had been developed since 1980,” he said.

Accordingly, the proposal was made by Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison, Minister Karunathilaka said.

He said Minister Harrison proposed to import 25 stud sheep and 100 females at Rs. 10 mn, allocated for 2017 following proper procurement procedure. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
