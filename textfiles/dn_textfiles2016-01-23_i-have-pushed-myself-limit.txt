'I have pushed myself to the limit'

There is no denying that tennis legend Lleyton Hewitt pushed his body to new heights in the month before his professional career ending loss at the Australian Open.
Following his gripping straight set loss to Spaniard David Ferrer, the former world number one said he 'pushed himself to the limit' and couldn't be prouder that he left it all out on the court.
'I came out, I gave everything I had like always and left nothing in the locker room,' Hewitt said.
'That's something I can be proud of. My whole career I've given 100 per cent. I love competing.'
Long-time fans may have forgotten the brazen and sometimes off-putting attitude Hewitt displayed in his younger years.
Hewitt’s children - Mia, Ava and Cruz - joined their father on the court at Rod Laver Arena, in Melbourne, immediately after his storied 20-year, 878-match professional tennis career came to a close
But punters were given a stark reminder of his fiery temper when they were treated to one last outburst from the infamous 34-year-old.
'Get rid of him mate because he is the only moron who has called anything during the match,' he said of the 'f***ing cheat' linesman who had called a series of foot faults against him.
The father-of-three, who shed tears over an original song created by his children earlier that night, then turned his vitriol towards French official Pascal Maria.
'You're a friggin' idiot,' he said.
'That's why everyone in the locker room thinks you're so full of yourself.
Throughout the match, commentator Jim Courier said the spirit the veteran showed on the court was 'vintage Hewitt'.
'[He's] unhappy with the umpire, unhappy about the foot fault and one line's person at one end and let off a bit of steam there,' the commentator observed.
'Whatever happens he is not going gently into the good night, is he, whenever that might be.'
Hewitt's children - Mia, Ava and Cruz - joined their father on the court at Rod Laver Arena, in Melbourne, immediately after his storied 20-year, 878-match professional tennis career came to a close.
Spanish party pooper David Ferrer ended an era in Australian sport with a 6-2 6-4 6-4 victory over the wounded warrior in a gripping encounter that ended in controversial fashion on Thursday night.
Rod Laver Arena was packed with fans hoping to see the former world number one and dual grand slam champion wind back the clock at least one more time.
But he'll compete no more.
Instead, the tennis great will turn his attention to his new role as Australia's 19th Davis Cup captain and he admitted retirement wouldn't sink in for a few days yet.
'It's a weird emotion. Rod Laver Arena, it's like a second home for me,' he said.
'I'm just so lucky to keep having this opportunity 20 years in a row.
'I just felt like this was the perfect place to finish.
'I was getting goose bumps out here tonight.'
A part-time player for much of the past year since announcing after his second-round Open loss in 2015 that this would be his farewell to the sport, Hewitt still dared to dream following his first-round triumph over James Duckworth.
'I want six more,' the Hall of Famer said before Hunters and Collectors' Holy Grail was belted out on the sound system during his warm-up on Thursday night.
In reality, there was never going to be a fairytale finish for the veteran dream believer. In an unprecedented 20 straight Open appearances, Hewitt's best result will forever remain his epic run to the 2005 final that ended in a four-set defeat at the hands of Marat Safin.
He failed to venture beyond the fourth round any other year since becoming the youngest Open qualifier in history at just 15 in 1997. Hewitt will nevertheless be remembered and ranked among the modern-day greats of Australian tennis, up there with fellow former world No.1s John Newcombe and Rafter and behind only the legend after which the arena where Hewitt made his last stand was named.
'He's just been one of the greatest competitors I have ever seen in my life,' said world No.1 and five-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic.
'Tennis will definitely miss a great competitor, a great fighter.'
And after losing five straight games to drop the first set, and then needing treatment for a leg injury, Hewitt displayed all his trademark grit to conjure seven break-back chances in an epic game while trailing 4-3 in the second set.
