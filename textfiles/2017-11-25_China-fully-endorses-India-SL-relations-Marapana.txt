Minister Marapana told Daily Mirror that China fully endorsed the various joint ventures Sri Lanka has launched with India, in particular those with strategic importance such as the Mattala Airport Development Project and the Trincomalee Oil Tank Project.

Speaking to Daily Mirror on the outcome of his recent official visit to the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) Minister Marapana said it was sad and indecent that certain political elements were trying to misinterpret Sri Lanka’s warm and friendly links with China and India.

“Their modus-operandi is to create a rift between Sri Lanka and two friendly countries by making unfounded and misleading allegations. I explained in detail to the Chinese side the extremely warm and close cultural, religious and trade contacts Sri Lanka has with both countries and the importance of improving this friendship for the mutual benefits of all, sentiments that China fully endorsed," Minister Marapana stressed.
