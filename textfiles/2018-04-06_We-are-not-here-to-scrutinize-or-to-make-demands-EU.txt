We are not here to scrutinize or to make demands: EU


	

The delegation of the European Parliament Committee on International Trade (INTA), which is in Sri Lanka on a brief visit, said they demand nothing from Sri Lanka and that they are not here to scrutinize anyone.

INTA Standing Rapporteur for South Asia Sajjad Karim said there was misconception in Sri Lanka especially among some political elements that there were demands from the European Union (EU).

“We want to dispel the myth of external demands. We demand nothing. Certain political elements say that demands are being made from the Europe and possibly from elsewhere. That is simply not the case,” he told a news briefing held at the EU Embassy in Colombo yesterday. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
