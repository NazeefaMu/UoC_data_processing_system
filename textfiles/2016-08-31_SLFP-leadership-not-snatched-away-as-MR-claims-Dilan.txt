SLFP Spokesman Minister Dilan Perera today rejected the statements made by Kurunegala District MP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that President Maithripala Sirisena had snatched the party away from Mr. Rajapaksa.

During a public gathering in Anamaduwa, last week, Mahinda Rajapaksa claimed that the party leadership was snatched by his successor President Sirisena.

While addressing a press briefing at the SLFP headquarters today Minister Perera said the transfer of the SLFP leadership took place amicably. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
