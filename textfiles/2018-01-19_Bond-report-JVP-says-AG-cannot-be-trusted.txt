While claiming that the Attorney General cannot be trusted on implementing the recommendations of the Bond Commission, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said today legal action should be taken against those involved in the Central Bank bond scam through a special court established by Parliament.

JVP MP Sunil Hadunnetti told a news conference that it has been more than a year since thereport of the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) on the Bond scam had been sent to the Attorney General and added that he had taken no action so far.

“It is pointless to expect any action from the AG against those held responsible by the Bond Commission. The COPE report on the Bond scam was sent to him on October 17, 2016. He has not given his recommendations or action to be taken even after 15 months. So how can we expect any action from him,” he asked and added that legal action should be initiated through a special court established through Parliament. (Ajith Siriwardana)
