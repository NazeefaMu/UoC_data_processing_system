REUTERS, 09th APRIL, 2018- North Korea has told the United States that it is ready to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula at the planned meeting between the two countries’ leaders, media reports said on Sunday citing US officials.


It is believed to be the first time for Pyongyang to convey the message to Washington directly about its intention to denuclearise, reports Xinhua.


It is seen as a positive step toward the meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korea’s top leader Kim Jong Un scheduled to take place by the end of May.


“The US has confirmed that Kim Jong Un is willing to discuss the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,” a Trump administration official told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday.
