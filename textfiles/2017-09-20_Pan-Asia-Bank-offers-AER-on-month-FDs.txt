Pan Asia Bank offers 13.1% AER on 4-month FDs


	

Pan Asia Bank has come out with a short-term fixed deposit promotion, which offers a higher rate of interest on four-month fixed deposits, where the customers get the opportunity of receiving a 13.1 percent annual effective rate (AER) on their fixed deposits (nominal rate 12.57 percent p.a.).
There is no limitation to the amount one can invest and every investment is guaranteed the high return. In a fixed deposit, the return is guaranteed in comparison to most of the other forms of investments, regardless of interest rate fluctuations. Also, it is an easy to understand, tried and tested secure investment method, which will give peace of mind to any investor. 


Apart from offering higher interest rates for deposits, a deposit at Pan Asia Bank is a highly secure investment since Pan Asia Bank is a licensed commercial bank regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.


The bank was also recognised as the ‘Fastest Growing Commercial Bank in Sri Lanka 2016’ for the fourth consecutive year by the Global Banking and Finance Review and it is currently operating with 83 branches and 82 ATM points.
