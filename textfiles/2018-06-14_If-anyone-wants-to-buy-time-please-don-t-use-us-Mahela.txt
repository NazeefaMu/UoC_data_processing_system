Former Sri Lankan Cricket Captain Mahela Jayawardane has rejected the request made by Sri Lanka Cricket selectors to be a consultant to the Sri Lanka Cricket and said that “no previous recommendations were implemented and I don’t have any trust in the system.”

“With all due respect to the selectors & the sports minister i have spent 1 year in the cricket committee & 6 months in a special advisory committee & no recommendations were implemented. I don’t have any trust in the system. If anyone wants to buy time please don’t use us!, former Sri Lankan national team captain tweeted.
