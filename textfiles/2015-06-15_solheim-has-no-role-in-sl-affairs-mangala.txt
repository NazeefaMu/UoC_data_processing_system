	Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera said today that former Norwegian peace envoy Erik Solheim had absolutely no role to play in Sri Lankan affairs, but that his views on engagement with the diaspora, in the context of his long experience, were of value.
	In response to a Daily Mirror story headlined ‘Erik Solheim back in SL affairs’ in its Monday issue, he said, “Mr. Erik Solheim was present very briefly on the first day of the discussions in London, and this was only to share his past experiences in engaging the Sri Lankan diaspora. This was in his personal capacity and not as a representative of the Norwegian government.
	"Mr. Solheim has absolutely no role at all in Sri Lankan affairs or in any matter pertaining to Sri Lanka and will not have any role in future either, in any form or capacity. But his views on engagement with the diaspora, in the context of his long experience, were of value.”
