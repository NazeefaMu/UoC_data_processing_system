Herath joins five-wicket Test elite


	



Rangana Herath took his first five-wicket haul against Zimbabwe, joining Dale Steyn and Muttiah Muralitharan as bowlers to have taken a five-for against every Test-playing nation. He became just the third bowler to pick up five-wicket hauls against all nine Test opponents to earn Sri Lanka a big first-innings lead before Zimbabwe bounced back on the third day of the third Test at Harare Sports Club on Tuesday.

Herath recorded figures of 5 for 89 -- his first five-wicket haul against Zimbabwe -- to bowl the home side out for 272 and give Sri Lanka a 232-run lead in the first innings.
