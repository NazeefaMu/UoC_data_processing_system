Angelina Jolie Pitt: 'I'm on fire inside'

Angelina Jolie Pitt is poised and self-aware, yet she pulls a face when I ask whether her kids think she's cool. There are, famously, six of them (aged between seven and 14). "They think I'm weird," she says eventually. But then she shrugs: well, alright, they might. "Maddox [who is 14] talks to me sometimes about writing as if he doesn't think I'm terrible at it... And Vivienne is just happy I'm a tiger in a panda movie. But, ah, she's just the little one - she's all sweet."
She ponders again. "I mean, there are moments when I can be cool, but they like to mess with me. They like to make fun of me. I'm just..." She breaks off. "Little Mommy."
On the sofa in front of me is the consummate professional, sat perfectly upright, in all-black (well, alright, leather trousers and a slip vest), a woman who had serenely but firmly shaken my hand. And yes, here were are, conducting a meticulously planned chat, no time for faffing about. But if we had all day (and we really don't; she keeps a tight schedule) I would wager that Angelina Jolie Pitt would talk nonstop about her kids.
Some have described this actor, 20 years in the business, as a cunning manipulator of her own image. This newspaper once wrote: "The Hollywood star never plays ball with the press, so her detractors claim, unless she is completely in charge of the rules... She seems eternally torn between wanting to blow smoke in the face of her own public and a stronger urge to reveal herself. The tattooed Tennessee Williams quote on her body that reads: 'A prayer for the wild at heart kept in cages' is the ultimate attempt at control."
I look at the tattoos - the Williams quote on her left arm, soon to be masked by a cardigan she will shrug around herself in the autumn chill. And later on I will witness a moment when her eyes threaten genuine, unwished-for tears. Yes, she's an actor... but when this moment comes she looks a little horrified at herself. Keeping those tears in - now that requires some control.
Because the woman I meet, I can see, has just come out the other side of a turbulent stretch of time: two terrible years of having to make agonising decisions about her health, and undergoing life-affecting surgery. In 2013, after being told that she had a 89% chance of developing breast cancer (due to her carrying a mutation in the BRCA1 gene) she underwent a double mastectomy. Then in March this year, after experiencing a cancer scare - and having already been told she had a 50% chance of developing ovarian cancer (the disease that claimed her mother's life at 56) - she went ahead with surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes.
This is a woman who, at the age of 39, orchestrated a situation that meant she could no longer biologically have children, because she felt she had no option other than to save herself. Who has forced, as explained in an article she wrote for the New York Times, early menopause. Today, when I ask, she says the physical symptoms have shown themselves "a little. But also your emotions adjust a bit. I feel matured in a way that I'm happy about. I'm at this other stage in my life - and it's not a bad thing at all."
There is a feeling that Angelina has moved into a new chapter. That these days, family - living real life - is at the heart of everything she does, thinks and believes. But she will correct this: "Maybe it's because the women in my side of the family tend to get sick and pass away relatively young [her grandmother and aunt on her maternal side also died of cancer], but I've never been somebody who put work before life."
