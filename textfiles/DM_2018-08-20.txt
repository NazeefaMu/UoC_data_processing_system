Fourth phase of E01 by 1st quarter of 2019
	
The fourth phase of the Southern Expressway (E01) project, which spans from Andarawewa to Hambantota via Mattala, would be vested in the public in the first quarter of 2019, an official of the construction company announced.
A.B.K. Abeydeera, the Project Director, said the construction of the 23-kilometre-long 4-lane expressway, which began construction on January 19, 2016, is on schedule to be completed in 36 months ending on January 19, 2019.
More than 75 per cent of the construction work of the project has now been completed. This expressway connects the Hambantota Harbour and the Mattala Airport. We are hopeful that the fourth phase can be completed in the first quarter of 2019, he said.
The construction of the fourth phase is being carried out by China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC), a subsidiary of the China Communications Construction (CCC). The Exim Bank of China has funded the project which cost Rs.52 billion. Around 800 employees including about 200 Chinese workers had been involved in the construction work but the number had since dropped as the project was nearing completion.
The uniqueness of the fourth phase is that it includes a massive elevated interchange at Andarawewa, a feature which is seen only at Kadawatha.
Mr. Abeydeera said the elevated sections, which are built on pillars, act as elephant corridors.
In total, 12 bridges and 71 culverts have been constructed in the fourth phase of the E01 extension.
The first phase of the E01 extension spans from Matara to Beliatta (30kms), the second phase from Beliatta to Wetiya (26kms) and the third phase from Wetiya to Andarawewa (15kms).
Mr. Abeydeera said the first three phases are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2019.
All these phases need to be completed to connect the expressway from Colombo to Hambantota. The use of the expressway will reduce the transport duration from Colombo to Hambantota to three hours, he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Gnanasara Thera spoke up for the country: Kotte Maha Sangha Sabha
	
In a letter to President Maitripala Sirisena with regard to the imprisonment of Bodu Bala Sena general secretary Ven. Galagodaathte Gnanasara Thera, the Mahayanayake of the Kotte chapter of the Siyam Nikaya, the Most Ven. Ittapane Dhammalankara Thera has highlighted several points including the one that if monks who speak on behalf of the people and the country were imprisoned, it would pose a challenge to the entire Bhikkhu community.
The letter states: "It is our responsibility to express some sentiment with regard to Ven. Galagodaathte Gnanasara Thera since he belongs to the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha. Since the court proceedings regarding him are not over we would not delve into it. Therefore our Sangha Sabha has decided to bring the following points to the attention of the President.
The offence that is said to have been committed by the Ven. Galagodaatte Gnanasara thera at the Homagama Courts was not committed to achieving a personal benefit. The incident took place because of the deep concern that arose within the venerable thera towards the members of the military intelligence who contributed immensely to rid the Sri Lankan society from the cruel war.
From ancient times the Sri Lankan Bhikkhu was a character that always stood and fearlessly spoke for the country and for the benefit of the wider society.
If the Buddhist monks who speak on behalf of the country and the people are imprisoned it would pose a challenge to the entire Bhikkhu community.
We would like to further state that the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabha stands for the country as well as for all communities and religions and highly values justice and fairness."

Hirdaramani Announces completion of the First Stage of a Long-Term Solar Panel Project
	
Celebrating 10 years since the opening of its flagship green facility Mihila, Asias first CarbonNeutral Apparel factory, The Hirdaramani group this month is again paving the way with the installation of the largest Rooftop Solar installation in the Apparel Sector in Sri Lanka.
The installations are part of the Suryadhanavi  meaning generated from the sun  project by Windforce (Pvt) Ltd. Through its investment in Windforce, this on-going venture in renewable energy is part of the Hirdaramani Sustainability Strategy that focuses on the core pillars of Planet, People, Product and Community, and has seen the manufacturer undergo massive changes to build greener more sustainable facilities across the island. The current installation at Hirdaramani features 21,000 solar panels generating 7.7 MW, leveraging cutting-edge mono PERC modules. Used for the first time in Sri Lanka by Windforce, PERC modules optimize the efficiency of solar panels by significantly improving light capture; a technology that is rapidly making standard solar cells obsolete.
At Hirdaramani we have consistently pioneered sustainability projects in the apparel industry and in the country. The Suryadhanavi project is an exciting new step in this journey and we are committed to building on the success of these first implementations, said Nikhil Hirdaramani, Director, Hirdaramani Group. With growing pressure on the environment, we understand the importance for leaders of industry to set the right example and invest in greener more sustainable manufacturing and processes thus creating an impetus for change, he added.
It is envisaged that through Suryadhanavi, 13.4GWh will be added annually to the national energy mix, accounting for more than 30% of electricity consumption by the Group. This would support an annual reduction of 10,200 Tons of CO2e emissions into the atmosphere, the equivalent of removing more than 2200 Passenger Vehicles from the road each year.
The Suryadhanavi project holds strong potential for further expansion and for making a significant contribution to the nations energy security. The world is fast moving towards adopting renewable energy and we are proud to be at the forefront of driving this change. The support of companies such as the Hirdaramani Group makes these changes all the more viable, said Manjula Perera, Managing Director of Windforce (Pvt) Ltd.
Hirdaramani is an organization that believes in driving positive change while encouraging and empowering employees and businesses to think in a new way. We are thrilled to be part of this mega project driven by Windforce that will see solar installations spreading across the island making a real impact on the energy security of the country while drastically cutting carbon footprints across industries, added Nikhil Hirdaramani.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could file a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition in the Supreme Court to obtain its opinion whether he could contest or not at the Presidential Election, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader, MP Udaya Gammanpila said addressing a news briefing today.
There is speculation in political circles that according to the opinion of some legal experts, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not debarred from contesting the Presidential Election for a third time.
Anybody who wishes to bring former President back to office, can also file an FR petition in the SC emphasizing that his or her suffrage would be violated if somebody else other than Mahinda Rajapaksa contested, he said.
It is hard for me to express my ideal thoughts on the opinion expressed by some legal experts like Nihal Jayawickrama, because I have not referred to their source on which they say that former President is eligible to contest, the MP said.
However, he said Mr Rajapaksa could file an FR petition in the SC so that the Supreme Court could order the Elections Commission to allow the ex- President to contest. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

PC Elections under old system 
	
The Elections Commission is in the process of exploring the legal possibility of conducting the Elections for the Provincial Councils under the old (PR) system as the newly enacted legislation is not yet operational, it is learnt.
The Government enacted a piece of legislation last year to introduce a formula of the First Past the Post (FPP) System and Proportional Representation (PR) to conduct the elections to the Provincial Councils.
The Delimitation Committee was appointed to submit a report on the creation of new boundaries of constituencies. The report is yet to be approved in Parliament. As such, the new law is not yet operational in the country.
Against this backdrop, some political parties, such as the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) raised the point that the elections to the Provincial Councils could be conducted under the old system of Proportional Representation as the new law was not in effect yet.
They pointed out to the Elections Commission that the provisions for the Interpretation Ordinance provided for it
The Daily Mirror learns that the legal division of the Elections Commission was studying the legal provisions along with all the court rulings related to the conduct of elections to see whether the elections could be conducted.
Meanwhile, the Elections Commission made a fresh request to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and other political leaders in writing last week requesting them to create the legal background for conducting the elections for the PCs.
According to sources, the Commission would wait until action was taken by Parliament to clear legal barriers to proceeding with the elections as promised by the Speaker on the previous occasion.
Besides, the report of the Delimitation Committee will be taken up for debate and put to vote on Thursday (23). It has to be passed with a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
Asked about the Governments position on the report, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella said it would be taken only on Thursday, August 23.
The elections to three Provincial Councils are already overdue. In addition, three more councils will stand dissolved by October, this year.(Kelum Bandara)

Pentagons annual report to Congress on China made references to Htota port
	
Countries participating in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) could develop economic dependence on Chinese capital, which China could leverage to achieve its interests. For example, in July 2017, Sri Lanka and a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) signed a 99-year lease for Hambantota Port, following similar deals in Piraeus, Greece, and Darwin, Australia, the annual report to Congress, Military and Security Developments Involving the Peoples Republic of China 2016, stated.
The report also said:
Chinas leaders increasingly seek to leverage Chinas growing economic, diplomatic, and military clout to establish regional preeminence and expand the countrys international influence. One Belt, One Road, now renamed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is intended to develop strong economic ties with other countries, shape their interests to align with Chinas, and deter confrontation or criticism of Chinas approach to sensitive issues. Countries participating in BRI could develop economic dependence on Chinese capital, which China could leverage to achieve its interests. For example, in July 2017, Sri Lanka and a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) signed a 99-year lease for Hambantota Port, following similar deals in Piraeus, Greece, and Darwin, Australia.
China seeks to secure its objectives without jeopardizing the regional stability that remains critical to the economic development that has helped the CCP maintain its monopoly on power. However, China is also willing to employ coercive measures  both military and non-military  to advance its interests and mitigate opposition from other countries. For example, in 2017, China used economic and diplomatic pressure, unsuccessfully, in an attempt to urge South Korea to reconsider the deployment of the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system. In its regional territorial and maritime disputes, China continued construction of outposts in the Spratly Islands, but also continued outreach to South China Sea claimants to further its goal of effectively controlling disputed areas. China also maintained a consistent coast guard presence in the Senkakus. In June 2017, India halted Chinas efforts to extend a road in territory disputed with Bhutan near the India border, resulting in a protracted standoff lasting more than 70 days. In August, India and China agreed to withdraw their military forces from the vicinity of the standoff; however, both countries maintain a heightened military presence in the surrounding region.
China also continued to send submarines to the Indian Ocean, ostensibly in support of its counterpiracy patrols. Chinese attack submarines conducted port calls in Seppangar, Malaysia and Karachi, Pakistan, but they were denied a port call in Colombo by Sri Lanka.
These submarine patrols demonstrate the PLANs emerging capability both to interdict key sea lines of communication (SLOC) and to increase Chinas power projection into the Indian Ocean.

Some Officers in the Ministry of Prisons had received death threats after the Minister took steps to rid the prisons of corruption and drugs, Prison Reforms Minister Ms Thalatha Atukorale said,
Speaking to the media after a function held in Ratnapura, the Minister said she would take any decision that was needed to transform the prisons into correctional centres despite such threats.
She recalled that a rushed decision had to be taken recently in respect of drug-related offences as drug business controlled by some people from within prisons had been doing a great harm to society.
She said that for the first time in the history a Prisons Police Unit with necessary legal powers had been installed in order to intervene in the affairs of the prisons after the Prisons Intelligence Unit was disbanded.
The Prison Intelligence Unit was founded in 2010 and there was nobody to take responsibility for the actions of that unit for the past eight years, she said.
Some decisions, taken according to the wishes of the officials have been changed at the interference of politicians. That shouldn't be the case, she said.
There should be strict discipline among the Prisons Officers as they are not dealing with people living in an ordinary environment as in the outside world, she said.
However, the Minister added that officers should be committed to protecting the prisoners as well as their rights.

Return to the Rural
	

rom Gramashakthi to Gamperaliya, major rural investment over the next few years is now Government priority. What does the idea of rural development  abandoned globally in the decades of liberalization, including under an open economy since 1977 in Sri Lanka  mean today Will rural development merely serve as a fig leaf for expansion of political patronage, or is there rural capacity to shift such investment towards progressive social and economic change
Electoral outcome
There are a few interesting historical trends with electoral politics in Sri Lanka. First, given the long democratic tradition of universal suffrage, the first country in Asia reaching back to 1931, there has never been a successful military coup and the citizenry have overthrown authoritarian governments at crucial elections; the 1994 and 2015 elections are two such instances. Second, electoral swings against incumbent governments have been a consistent pattern. Third, the rural constituencies when their interests are neglected have dramatically shifted their electoral allegiances leading to change of governments. It is this relationship between the rural constituencies and electoral politics that is shaping the current rural development drive.
One major reason for the overthrow of the Rajapaksa regime in 2015 was its abandoning of the rural constituencies during its second term. While rural infrastructure works such as electrification and rural road development were given priority during its first term from 2005 to 2010, after the war they became focused on urban-centred development such as the beautification of Colombo backed by tremendous international financing. The current Government continues to neglect the rural economy despite the long drought ravaging many districts; the consequence was the major defeat in the local government elections this year.
State versus social mobilization
Rural development as with any other form of development requires capital, and if it is a development drive by the state, it requires state funds. Furthermore, even when such funds are made available, there is a need for rural capacity to absorb such funds. This capacity for absorption also requires local state structures to disperse funds and carry out rural infrastructure work. The line ministries and district secretariats have the administrative and implementation capacity to build such local infrastructure and provide livelihood schemes mainly in the form of handouts. Indeed, with the neglect of the rural vision including the related rural development institutions over the decades, it is political urgency resulting in dispersal of funds and projects by the administrative bureaucracy that is characteristic of contemporary initiatives of rural development.

"One major reason for MR regime overthrow in 2015 was its abandoning the rural constituencies during its second term"
On the other hand, sustainable and meaningful rural development has to go beyond infrastructure and handouts, challenge top-down development by officials and increase avenues of production with the participation of people. This requires strong social institutions that can mobilize rural society. However, most of the social institutions such as co-operatives, rural development societies, womens rural development societies, farmers organizations etc., all require considerable strengthening. Furthermore, even those state and non-state institutions that are to build the capacity of rural social institutions, including for agricultural research, training and extension, require revitalization. With social mobilization crucial for any serious rural development effort, it remains a central challenge for the Governments current programme centred on state institutions.
Building rural economies
There are major public misconceptions about rural development that are also the consequences of decades of intellectual neglect of the rural question. First, the flawed idea that rural economic problems are simple matters and can be dealt with state priority and funding. Here, urban elitist arrogance reduces rural development to allocation of some funds, ideas about starting companies in villages, or throwing some computers at rural educational and other institutions. Second, that the rural world has not changed and that it is archaic and is about subsistence. In reality, there are considerable changes and many new dynamics in the rural social life; their incomes and livelihoods come from multiple sources, including linkages with small towns and migrant work abroad. Furthermore, there are new possibilities for production and increased value from rural agricultural production for both the national markets and even exports.
Third, the aspirations of rural youth and society more broadly have also been changing as they seek economic stability while integrating with new forms of consumption, which are also related to advances in media and communication technologies.
In other words, the rural societies are as modern, dynamic and complex as urban societies, and it is our urban ignorance that relegates the rural to the backward and simple. For the urban working class, employment and income are important for their daily lives, which when affected lead to rising protests and strikes. Similarly, for rural folk, landed agricultural production and other sources of waged income are critical for sustaining their communities, which when disrupted invite a political response.
In this context, when governments forget the rural population, they come back with a vengeance at elections. But remembering rural constituencies is one thing, and working with them to build a progressive economic future is of another order. Rural development is not just about building small infrastructure and handouts, it is much more about rural production with the participation of producers who form communities, whether they be farmers, fishermen, craftsmen etc. and to build a stable economic base.

"For rural folk, landed agricultural production and other sources of waged income are critical for sustaining their communities"
Returning to the current rural economic drive by the Government, its success depends on whether rural social institutions are strengthened and a rural economic vision is consolidated. At the root of the problem are decades of neo-liberal development policies sharpening the rural-urban divide, including by pushing for rural to urban migration and abandoning the rural economy and society more broadly. Therefore, even as funds are pumped into rural works, progressive rural social change requires an ideological battle waged against statistic bureaucratic tendencies and elitist urban discourse.

Rs.25, 000 fine for violating level crossing signals
	
Laws had already been drafted to fine Rs. 25,000 from drivers who violated railway level crossing signal, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Attending an event in Hikkaduwa on Sunday, he said steps would also be taken to install CCTV cameras at main railway crossings.

Minister said at least 75 accidents had occurred at railway crossings each year and that new laws were needed to protect lives and properties.
He said a programme had been commenced to install 200 signal lights at a cost of USD 6.4 million.
Under the programme, a total of 175 bells would be installed on single railway lines, while another 25 would be installed on double railway lines.
In addition to these 200 signal light system, Cabinet approval has been obtained to install another 200 signals with the funds received from the Hungarian Government.
There are at least 1,337 railway crossings across the country but only 526 crossings had protected with either lights or bells.
But there are still about 626 unprotected railway crossings across the country. We hope to reduce this number as well by installing security systems, Minster De Silva said.
He declared open 10 signal lights at 10 railway crossings during the event. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Vidia - The second Indian origin Nobel Laureate
	

ir Vidhyadar Surajprasad Naipaul, or Vidia as he was known to his friends, has died without leaving a new literary successor or equal of Indian origin who could scale the heights he reached. Only the second writer of Indian origin to win the Nobel Prize, he leaves a complex legacy of finely written books, literary feuds and enmities, and a uniquely individual way of viewing the third world which many found hard to stomach. 
Though he was born in Trinidad and Tobago and lived much of his adult life in England, Naipaul may be called an Indian writer. But he would have detested that definition. Essentially rootless, he was scathingly critical of both the West Indies and India, and haughtily contemptuous of Britain, calling it a country of bum politicians, scruffy writers and crooked aristocrats.

"Though he was born in Trinidad and Tobago but lived much of his adult life in UK, Naipaul may be called an Indian writer. He was scathingly critical of both the West Indies and India, and haughtily contemptuousof Britain"
I discovered Naipaul among the fiction shelves of the British Council library during my school days. The first thing I read was a collection of short fiction, which included some excruciatingly funny pieces. His masterpiece was the autobiographical novel A House for Mr. Biswas, which too, is very funny. 
Thereafter, his fiction as well as non-fiction grew bleaker and bleaker. Mimic Men, In a Free State and Guerillas were dark, brooding novels. I have read enough of bleak novels in my life. But, whether its Dostoevsky, Thomas Hardy or Joseph Conrad, the romantic view of life which is central to their plot and character building makes their books a pleasure to read. Naipaul is the least romantic of all major writers Ive ever read. Writing about love was as difficult to him as writing about monastic life would have been to Henry Miller.
That may amount to a considerable literary achievement  to leave out what many writers would consider as essential, and create a lasting literature around the ugly truths and inconsistencies of life. But it put me off Naipauls fiction considerably. His non-fiction was more interesting. It created the biggest controversies of his literary life, too, earning him the unenviable reputation of being a racist and a bigot. 
Naipaul was born in 1932. His grandparents were labourers. His father Seepersad was a journalist with a great love of European literature, and proved to be his inspiration to be a writer. During his lonely years at Oxford University in Britain (he got there thanks to a scholarship), the letters between father and son were a source of strength to Naipaul. These were published later as Letters Between Father and Son (1999). 
A House For Mr. Biswas, was published in 1961 when he was only 29, establishing his literary reputation. The success allowed him to spend the next few years travelling in India, Africa and the Caribbean. The ensuing writing was hardly flattering to these countries. An Area of Darkness, his book about India (1964), has him recoiling in horror at the narrow, broken lanes with green slime in the gutters, the choked back to back houses, the jumble of filth and food and animals and people, the baby in the dust, swollen-bellied, black with flies, but wearing its good-luck amulet. 
That hardly won him many friends in India. His writing about Africa was no different. He took up a writer-in-residence fellowship at a university in Uganda, and wrote The Mimic Men while there (1967), the story of a politician of Indian origin in the Caribbean who only succeeds in mimicking the behaviour of his former European masters.

His writing about Africa was scathing. Travelling widely, he saw only destruction and despair. In A Free State (1971) won the Booker Prize with its portrayal of a violent, post-colonial milieu attracting young, idealistic whites in search of sexual freedom. Guerillas (1975) was an even more disturbing novel about a politically naive white girl who was fatally attracted to a self-styled messiah leading a ragtag liberation movement in a Caribbean state. A Bend in the River (1979) based on the Republic of Zaire under Mobutu Sese Seke, is a frightening study of how absolute power corrupts absolutely. Such works seem to confirm Naipauls view that Africa would revert to the bush. 
Such bleak views of life in the third world drew vehement criticism from notable literary figures such as Nobel laureates Chinua Achebe and Derek Walcott; the latter said that Naipaul wrote beautiful prose scarred by scrofula and a repulsion towards Negroes. 
After Africa, the West Indies and India,Naipaul turned his attention to the Muslim states and Islamic fundamentalism. In The Believers (1981), he attacked Muslim clerics and the new generation of religious youth mercilessly. In reviewing it for the New York Times, one writer wrote that it bore an antipathy to the religion so blatant that a book taking a comparable view of Christianity or Judaism would have been hard put to find a publisher in America.
When Salman Rushdie went into hiding after The Satanic Verses, Naipaul described the fatwa as an extreme form of literary criticism. Writing about Islam, he wrote that there probably has been no imperialism like that of Islam and the Arabs.
The academic Edward Said declared he found it hard to believe any rational person would attack entire cultures on such a scale. Many critics saw him as a misogynist and a hater. Novelist and travel writer Paul Theroux, his one time friend and admirer, became a bitter enemy when he discovered in a second hand bookshop one of the books gifted by him to Naipaul.
Not all Muslim writers saw him in a negative light. Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk wrote that Naipaul represented the third world not with sugary magic realism but with their demons, their misdeeds and horrors  which made them less victims than human. 
He married twice. His first wife was Patricia Hale, a fellow student at Oxford. She was very supportive and read all his manuscripts, but he was unfaithful to her. 

"As Naipauls fame grew, his younger brother Shiva Naipaul (born 1945) was relegated to obscurity. The late Shiva Naipaul too, was an acclaimed fiction and travel writer. He died in 1985 without realizing his full potential"
As Naipauls fame grew, his younger brother Shiva Naipaul (born 1945) was relegated to obscurity. The late Shiva Naipaul too, was an acclaimed fiction and travel writer. He died in 1985 without realizing his full potential. His two novels The Fireflies (1970) and Chip Chip Gatherers (1973) explore his native Indian community in Trinidad.Geoffrey Wheatcroft, commenting about them in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, said that Fireflies was written in limpid prose, with a crystal ear for dialogue and comedy. Through the human story of struggle it strikes at the heart of the functioning of the Hindu community in Trinidad.
After publishing these two novels, Shiva Naipaul too, spent time travelling in Africa. The resulting work, North of South,is harshly critical of African life just as his brothers writing was. In 1980, came out Black and White, an exhaustive study of the mass suicide in Guyana by members of American preacher Jim Jones cult, which led to accusations of anti-Americanism by critics. His last novel was A Hot Country, a dark and despairing work set in a fictitious SouthAmerican country.

A SMART Court System: Modernises judicial capacity
	
What Sri Lanka can learn from the Australian legal system
Delivering the keynote address at the Lawbiz Symposium, Supreme Court Justice Prasanna Jayawardena - Presidents Counsel shared an impressive method to improve Sri Lankan economy. He contemplated establishing an effective and reliable legal system which could attract investors and traders to our economy. However, he was of the view that such an effort would require careful study of a comparable jurisdiction, which has achieved a reduction in court time. In search of such new ways and strategies, which could be adopted to the Sri Lankan Judiciary from a comparable legal system, Daily Mirror conducted an interview with a Barrister of Australia, Alan Moyle (LLB, BEc, GDLP, LLM, DipIPL), who has forty years of professional experience and was also a guest speaker at the Colombo Lawbiz Symposium organised by the Colombo Law Society.Following are the excerpts.

QWhat is your basic understanding about the legal knowledge that the Australian general public have
They have a confidence in the legal system. But, sometimes people criticize judges too.
QIf I may disturb you, in order to criticize a judge those people need to have a sufficient knowledge on their legal system and law. So, does your education system in schools provide sufficient legal knowledge to students
There is education and awareness to a considerable level about how our constitution and legal system are structured. Australia is a federation and each state has its own constitution and a parliament, and at the top of them, there is a federal parliament and a federal constitution, therefore, children learn about those basic things in schools.

Every year, lawyers in Australia will have to get a practicing certificate. There is also a compulsory professional indemnity insurance, which means that if lawyers get sued by a client then everybody has professional indemnity insurance
There are law reform bodies to look into issues in prevailing laws in Australia
QFrom where do children start learning them
Their learning of legal studies initially start primary school and gradually in high school and those who prefer legal studies for higher education, they get a lot of time to study about the court structure and how it works.
QThat means in general, they have a fair knowledge on their legal system, right
Yes. I suppose they have an idea about how it works.

Delaying of cases did happen in the past in Australia, where we had cases dragged for years. But now the Australian legal system does not really let that happen
The documents are filed in Australian courtselectronically. There is a case management system so that the case can be heard quickly. Even in some cases, if the witness cannot be present in court judge might be prepared to hear them online through video call.
QThere is a saying that no other place like Sri Lanka for a lawyer to practise. May be people say that because of the freedom that lawyers in Sri Lanka actually have or perhaps for the reason that there is no independent body to scrutinize the practice of the lawyers Can you say anything on that
I think I am not in a position to comment on that since I dont have a very good knowledge about the Sri Lankan legal system.
QTell us about that situation in Australia...
In Australia there is a legislation that lawyers have to comply with, in order to regulate the legal profession. Every year, lawyers will have to get a practising certificate. This certificate has to be renewed every 12 months and we pay a fee for that. There is also the compulsory professional indemnity insurance, which means that if lawyers get sued by a client then everybody has professional indemnity insurance. Level of that insurance varies but there should be at least a minimum level of insurance.

"The clients can complain to an independent body (like an ombudsman) and it will look into it and see whether the lawyers charge is disproportionately high. Then that could be a subject for a court action against the particular lawyer by the client or the regulatory body will take actions against that lawyer "
QAre there any restrictions in your country on how lawyers should charge for their services
There is no restriction on what lawyers can charge except for market forces such as more experienced people tend to charge more and less experienced people charge less. Some areas in law, there is a lot of competition among lawyers, while some areas dont have such competition.
QIs there a payment scale for the lawyers
There was such thing before, but now there are no set fees or scale of fees anymore, because it was said that it was anti-competitive for lawyers to compete with each other and therefore the previous fixed scales of fees was abolished. Now people are charged on hourly base and or a set fee for a particular case of work. Lawyers can also charge based on time if they want to (monthly or for a particular milestone in the case).
Those are the two ways that lawyers mainly charge and sometimes there might be a success fee for winning the case while there could be some cases that lawyers carefully enter into the no fee no win cases as well.
Even though, there is no restriction on how lawyers should charge on clients, certainly clients can complain to an independent body (like an ombudsman) and it will look into it and see whether the charge is disproportionately high. Then that could be a subject for a court action against the particular lawyer by the client or the regulatory body will take actions against that lawyer.

"If you fail to fulfil procedural requirements on time, then judge can made a cost order against the lawyer personally to prevent delaying of cases"

QWith the technological advancement in the modern world, can you educate us on how the Australian legal system has evolved over time
We have a British based legal system, where we have constitutional monarchy, that queen of England is the queen of Australia even though not actively doing anything. Each state in Australia has a court system while there is a federal court system because the federal constitution divides on the responsibilities of states and the commonwealth of Australia. So, over the time the court system has evolved with technological advancements. 
The documents are now filed in courts electronically. There is a case management system so that the case can be heard quickly. Even in some cases, if the witness cannot be present in court judge might be prepared to hear them online through video call. And also for some procedural hearings, rather than solicitors coming to the court, judge might say lets have a telecommunication conference to smooth up the process. The Australian legal system uses these technological advancements to speed up the process. Even, barristers are allowed to use their i-pads, laptops and phones in the court.
QHow about the freedom of press for the legal sector in Australia
Actually, the press is allowed for most matters that are taking place in open court, but recording is completely prohibited. And also sometimes there are suppression orders on media preventing coverage of certain cases. Even though usually media oppose that these suppression orders are there because sometimes, for instance, in a rape case, when news reports carry that news during the trial it might have a negative effect on the minds of the public since they will assume that he is guilty even thought there is a saying one is innocent until proven guilty, so that can do a lot of damage to that persons reputation. If that person is found guilty at the end of the case then normally the suppression order will be lifted so that media can report about it.

"There is also compulsory mediation to try and settle cases before they get to trial. Even though, cases may not necessarily settle in mediation, it will help to quicken the court process by reducing listed court cases"
QWhen it comes to the aspect of delay of cases in Sri Lankan legal system, many people accuse lawyers as responsible since they come up with various reasons to drag the case. Is that the same scenario in Australia
This delaying of cases did happen in the past in Australia, where we had cases dragged for years. But now the Australian legal system does not really let that happen. There are procedural requirements to speed up the resolution of cases. One of the things that the legal system does is that if you do not comply with the procedural orders that are made by the judge then the court will cost against the lawyer not against the client.
If the judge in a procedural stage says that you have to file these documents within a certain time period and you fail to file them on time, then judge can make a cost order against the lawyer personally. That compels lawyers to go through that procedural stage quickly without further unnecessary delay. 
There is also compulsory mediation to try and settle cases before they get to trial. Even though, cases may not necessarily settle in mediation, it will help to quicken the court process by reducing listed court cases. 
In the court trial, firstly the two parties usually get together and decide on their witnesses in the case and how long it will take to conclude proceedings with them. Then, they go before the judge and reveal the approximate time period that they will take for trial. Then judge will usually ask them how many days that the trial may take place and accordingly judge may fix extra days within a certain time period in order to maintain the continuity of the trial.
QHow does the Australian legal system play its role in the context of policy making
Sometimes judges make comments on the cases if the law needs to be reformed. There could be cases where the judge may think the outcome of the law is unsatisfactory even though it is the prevailing law.

"Australia is a federation and each state has its own constitution and a parliament, and at the top of them, there is a federal parliament and a federal constitution"
QSo, are you saying that those opinions of judges are being heard by the politicians
Not always, but sometimes politicians respond to them. On the other hand, there are law reform bodies in each state, which look into bringing new laws as well as the need of reformation to the prevailing law. There are actually some laws that came out from these law reform bodies and public agitation like environmentalists. Sometimes these law reform bodies will look into existing laws that have expired.
QCan you contemplate how the young generation of Australia see the field of legal studies
It is interesting. Actually I always get asked by young people that whether they should study law or not. I respond to them, saying dont do law just because parents tell them or the students think that they can make a lot of money or to pursue a job with status in the society. I ask them to do law if you are passionate about law.

"There is a case management system so that the case can be heard quickly. Even in some cases, if the witness cannot be present in court judge might be prepared to hear them online through video call"
QIs there an authority or any kind of an institution that conducts productive researches on the Australian legal system in a statistical nature
The law reform bodies do that. If there is an institution of judicial administration, which looks into a lot of statistical details about cases such as how quickly cases are resolved, how long the trials have gone, etc.
Q Very recently Daily Mirror reported about two famous suspects, who were in remand custody, over the controversial financial scam. After being brought to the courts in morning by the Prison officers to produce for the magisterial inquiry, the suspects were not given water or food until 3.00 p.m. The Prison moved as reasons saying the delivery of lunch packets was late. Any comments on that
As Justice Prasanna Jayawardena mentioned, in his speech at the Lawbiz Symposium, about the reforms that were brought in to the Pakistan legal system recently, I can tell you a story in Pakistan. When the new Chief Justice was appointed a few years ago in Pakistan, he got a letter from a prisoner who was in remand. Letter said Dear Chief Justice, I have been in jail since several years and I am just wondering when my case might come to the court. The new Chief Justice thereafter immediately ordered this guy to be produced in the court. Then the judge asked what the case was against him and subsequently found out that this person was in remand longer than the maximum punishment for what he was charged for, despite whether he was guilty or not. Then the Chief Justice immediately ordered to release him. That shows how some legal systems were in a napoleon state, which really should not have happened.

Buddha statue at CMC removed: Ven Omalpe Sobitha, Mayor refutes claim
	
The Chief Sanga Nayaka of the Southern Province Venerable Omalpe Sobitha Thera yesterday alleged that the Buddha statue that was in the office of Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake has been removed.
The Venerable thera said this during a function held to mark the centenary of the Daham Pasala at the Vajirarama Temple held at the BMICH last evening.
The Buddha Statue which was in the office of the Colombo Mayor has been removed. There have been a number of non Buddhists who have been elected Mayor in the past. However none of them removed this statute at any time. So one wonders as to why the incumbent mayor removed this statue and who gave the order to do so, the Thera said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was one of the chief guests at the event, said he had called Ms. Senanayake to verify this claim as soon as the Thera mentioned the removal of the statue during the function. She informed me that it has not been removed and was inside the Townhall premises. She sent me a facebook picture of the statue as proof, the Prime Minister said.(Yohan Perera)

## Title: Evils of Translocating Wild Elephants
## Section: News Features

Evils of Translocating Wild Elephants
	

Sri Lanka is said to have a wild elephant population of about 6,500 although exact numbers are not really available, in spite of some form of census that was carried out some years back. This approximately accounts for about 10% of the world Asian elephant populations, the rest being primarily in India, Thailand, Nepal and Borneo. Sri Lanka may have over 18 National parks, but the reality is that some 65% of these wild elephants are found outside these protected areas.
Due to the high degree of intelligence of wild elephants, coupled with the expanding human population and unplanned development, finding solutions to the human-elephant conflict is a very complex task. Piece meal solutions will not do. Many Sri Lankan elephant researchers have developed good practical solutions to mitigate the issue. What is needed is a holistic, well planned out, all-encompassing strategy, taking into consideration all the available findings by private researchers, to be implemented on a nation-wide scale, in a consistent and cohesive manner, without ad-hoc political interventions.
So what is wild elephant Translocation
So in reality it is the movement of a wild elephant from one area to another. This is normally undertaken by the Wildlife authorities to move wild elephants, after being tranquilized, who may be causing crop damage and harm to humans in one particular area, to another which is possibly safer. However in reality this is not the case and almost often it ends up with changing the pillow to get rid of a headache.
"The root cause is not the elephant, but unplanned development and land encroachment. So there is no case whatsoever in concluding that a marauding elephant is primarily at fault"

What are the repercussions
It is an attempt to get rid of the problem created by a wild elephant which may be crop raiding and causing danger to humans. But as indicated earlier, it really does not solve the problem, and does even aggravate it at times.
Elephants have been found to have their own home ranges. Male elephants are solitary by nature, and constitute almost the entirety of the so called problem elephants. They have a larger range than females and herds. These home ranges are very familiar to them, and are mapped out in their brains. So if they are forcibly re located, they always try to find their way back to their original home grounds.
There are spectacular recorded evidence by Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, Sri Lankas foremost wild elephant researcher and expert, of elephants who have been translocated, even some hundreds of km away from their home range, eventually finding their way back to their original home areas. (Ref Centre for Conservation and Research). The sad part is that in the translocated elephants journey in finding its way back to familiar territory, it often has to pass through unfamiliar villages and built up areas. There are altercations with humans, some with disastrous consequences of bullet wounds and other injuries, further angering the elephant. Several die during this attempt to relocate back to their home range. Hence it is more than evident from hard scientific research and facts, that translocation does not solve the root cause, and may in fact aggravate the issue, or at the most, translocate the problem to another area.

"Due to their strong home ranging behavior, elephants will not adapt and move away. They continue to stake their claim to their lands and thus begins the conflict with man"
Then why do translocations Are they ethical
Haphazard and unplanned development has reduced and fragmented the land available for good elephant habitat. Hence basically we have encroached into lands that the wild elephants used for centuries. Due to their strong home ranging behaviour, elephants will not adapt and move away. They continue to stake their claim to their lands and thus begin the conflict with man.
To a great extent wild elephants will give humans a wide berth. But there are some males (always solitary) who get used to crop raiding and finding easy and tastier sources of food in plantations. Herds do not resort to such raids because most often they have juveniles in the herd. So it is not surprising to find that few of the adult males get used to this behaviour, and no doubt become a nuisance and in some cases a danger as well. And it is a fact that something has to be done to protect the humans.
However, the root cause is not the elephant, but unplanned development and land encroachment. So on an ethical basis there is no case whatsoever in concluding that a marauding elephant is primarily at fault.
The ethical issue is further aggravated when the DWC (supposedly at the instructions of the Minister) recently wanted to translocate two of the remaining elephants in the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, because they were a threat to some people. Sinharaja is a world heritage site, and these few elephants have a right to live there. It is their home. It is the people, venturing into the forest or residing in the border areas illegally, who are at fault. This is why this issue caused such a chorus of protests, with even the UNESCO writing to the government saying that this was not at all acceptable.
Hence translocating an elephant does not work, both on scientifically proven grounds, or on ethical basis. However in extreme cases, when all other efforts prove unsuccessful, after careful assessment, a rare translocation may be required.
If not translocation, then what
There are some initiatives that could be implemented in the short term. Some researchers have currently conducted case studies on enclosing entire villages in the night by an electric fence, which is proving to be quite effective. (Elephants raid mostly in the night time, and during day the village will have one or more access points to move out, which need to be closed, and the electric circuit reestablished in the night). Hence in problem areas such electrified enclosures could be installed. Of course the ideal situation would be to remove the village settlements away if they have been put up illegally. This of course has major political implications and will therefore not happen.
