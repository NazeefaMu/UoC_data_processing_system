The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday criticised the Government for holding a meeting to justify the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and telecasting it via the electronic media.

GMOA Secretary Dr. Naveen de Zoysa told a news conference that they had never witnessed such kind of discussion and added that the Government was attempting to give more validity to SAITM through such activities.

“It is evident from these kinds of actions that the Government is trying to go ahead with SAITM as per its own will. Such a media discussion has not even held for the issue of Meethotamulla garbage dump,” he said.

He said Ministers had also avoided several questions made by journalists and added that this discussion was held to resolve the issue and to continue the business.

He said such an explanation on SAITM should be given by the heads of the institutes and not by Ministers.

He also claimed that it was a shame to do such a discussion by Ministers on behalf of SAITM in order to justify its existence.

“Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero have participated in this discussion, despite their duty to be to protect State education as well as health services,” he said.

He also condemned the Health Minister’s statement that there were better students in SAITM than in the Medical Faculty of the Colombo University.

He also challenged the Ministers for an open discussion with members of the GMOA on the issue. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
