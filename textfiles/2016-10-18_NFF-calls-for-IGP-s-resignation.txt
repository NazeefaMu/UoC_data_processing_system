The National Freedom Front (NFF) today asked the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to resign from his post because he was the one who was responsible for politicizing the independent institutions including the CID, FCID and the Bribery Commission.

NFF media spokesman Mohammed Muzammil told a media briefing that the President’s statement made on Wednesday had proved that these institutions were working to a political agenda.

“There is no use of the National Police Commission if the FCID is functioning to satisfy various political forces. These so called independent institutions are not functioning in an independent manner. Therefore, the IGP should resign from his post as he had failed to fulfill his responsibility,” said Mr. Muzammil. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
