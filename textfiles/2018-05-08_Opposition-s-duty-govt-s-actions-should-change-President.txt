The duty of the opposition and the course of action of the allies of the national government should take a different form in today’s political arena, President Maithripala Sirisena said.

Commencing the second session of the 8th Parliament, President Sirisena said, “If the political allies in the government should act similar to Vajji rulers as Buddha preached, we should also follow the course of action of the Vajji,” he said.
