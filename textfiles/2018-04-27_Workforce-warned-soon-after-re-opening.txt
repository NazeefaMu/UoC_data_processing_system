A business establishment connected to a leading politico, kept closed for three months, re-opened recently and resumed operations.

 


The day the establishment was re-opened, a high-up on the management issued a severe warning to the workforce saying, “We know that there are some workers here bent on bringing this establishment into disrepute by giving various types of information to the media. If we catch any of them sneaking anything about this place to the media, they will get the immediate sack. They will be taught a good lesson before being chased out!”
