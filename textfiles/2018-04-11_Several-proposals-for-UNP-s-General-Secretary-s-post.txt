Several names have been proposed for the United National Party (UNP)’s post of General Secretary, sources close to party leadership said yesterday.

The post became vacant after General Secretary Kabir Hashim tendered his resignation.

Several names including Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Navin Dissanayake and Imtiyaz Bakeer Markar have been proposed for the post according to sources. However, no final decision has been arrived yet, according to sources.

It was also reported that positions in the party will not be changed before the National New year. However, they will be changed before the end of this month as the term of the present office bearers ends on April 29, 2018.

Meanwhile, newly appointed 12 member politburo members will meet for the first time today to discuss on the reorganization of the party. (Yohan Perera)
