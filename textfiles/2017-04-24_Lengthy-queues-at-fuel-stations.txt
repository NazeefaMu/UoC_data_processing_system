Lengthy queues at fuel stations


	



Long queues can be seen outside fuel stations as motorists wait to top up their tanks at stations. A petrol and diesel shortage was reported from several areas in Colombo after workers of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) launched an indefinite strike as a protest against the lease of oil tanks in Trincomalee to India.
