A feasibility study on establishing a 10 km railway land line from Maradana to Battaramulla via Dematagoda would be started today (26), Sri Lanka Railways said today.
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Railway Department Superintendent Vijaya Samarasinghe said the plan of the proposed 10 km railway line would be finalised this week.
“The Ministry of Transport had proposed the new railway line from Maradana to Battaramulla to ease traffic congestion. After a steering committee comprising officials from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and Transport Ministry met, final decisions and recommendations on the estimated cost of the railway line and other important issues will be finalised,” he said.
Buildings and houses, which would be found on the railway line would be removed, he said.
“Among the buildings which will be found in the railway line, will have to be removed only if we could negotiate with the owners on compensation. Otherwise, the railway line will have to be built over the buildings. Further, we are able to use electric trains too. But, it is up to the Transport Ministry to make a final decision with regard to this,” Mr. Samarasinghe said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
