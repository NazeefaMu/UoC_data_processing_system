Defiant PM is mauled from all sides of Parliament


	



The Prime Minister ran the gauntlet of MP anger in the House of Commons this afternoon, as she was mauled from politicians in all parties   

 

Theresa May was mauled by MPs from all sides, as she pleaded with them to back her Brexit deal and not to send Britain ‘back to square one’ in the crunch negotiations.   


The Prime Minister was given a furious grilling by MPs for over two and a half hours in the Commons as she made her latest desperate bid to win over critics after sealing the package at an EU summit over the weekend.   


Despite looking on track for a catastrophic defeat in a crunch vote in Parliament next month, Mrs May told MPs they had a ‘duty’ to listen to constituents and do ‘what is in the national interest’.   


But she faced a barrage of attacks from all sides of the House, including from Tory big-hitters Boris Johnson, David Davis and Iain Duncan Smith.   
Tory MPs told their leader her deal is ‘as dead as a dodo’ and does not stand a chance of getting passed when it is voted on by the Commons on December 11 after a marathon five-day debate.   


The DUP - whose ten MPs prop the Tories up in No10 - again condemned the backstop, while Jeremy Corbyn said the package pleased ‘nobody’.   
Even previous loyalists such as ex-Cabinet minister Sir Michael Fallon joined in the criticism.   


Extraordinarily, it took over an hour of brutal attacks from across the chamber before the first MP - Nicky Morgan - spoke in defence of Mrs May. 

 
At one point during the battering, Mrs May ruefully remarked to Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry that she barely seemed to have achieved one task that people claimed was ‘impossible’ before they were demanding she completed another one.
