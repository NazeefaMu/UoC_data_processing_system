Senior DIG in-charge of the FCID, Ravi Waidyalankara today rejected reports that former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga had been arrested in Dubai.

Media reports quoting Senior DIG Waidyalankara earlier said that authorities in Dubai had arrested Weeratunga on Monday morning based on the investigations and submissions made by the FCID.

However, when Daily Mirror contacted Senior DIG Waidyalankara, he dismissed the report of Udayanga being arrested and concluded that he had not made such a statement to the media.
