A certain electrical engineer had castigated the Police in abusive language in the presence of the provincial Police top brass at the Puttalam District Development Coordinating Committee meeting held recently. 

 


However, the engineer later had to withdraw his remarks and apologize to the Police, they say.
The engineer had reportedly berated the Police over an incident connected with the erection of an electricity pylon.  However, he had apologized for his remarks in the face of vehement resentment expressed by the political and white collar authorities present at the meeting. 


Meanwhile, reports say that the Police bigwigs who were present had reported the engineer to the CEB authorities for disciplinary action.
