Kandy SC running away with league title

The inter-club league rugby tournament is half way through with all clubs playing seven games each. Defending champions Kandy SC are placed number one followed by Havelock SC and Navy SC. If Kandy SC continues to play in this fashion they should have no problem retaining the league title for another year.
Kandy SC has been branded as the best rugby team without any doubt having beaten all the clubs they have met convincingly. Currently Kandy has all the fire power to topple any side.
In their last outing on Sunday, the VIP enclosure was packed with high-spirited rugby lovers like ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa, Minister Malik Samarawickrema, MP's Lohan Ratwatte, Dilum Amunugama, few officers from the Navy and the committee members of the host club. The stadium was filled to capacity and the club made the highest gate collection of the season.
Full back Nigel Ratwatte had a memorable game and fashioned out the 29-10 win for Kandy. Ratwatte who missed the earlier game against Havelock SC scored 24 points out of the 29, a try a goal and five penalty kicks at goal was his contribution.
Nigel speaking to the Daily News after the final whistle said he really enjoyed the game and was proud that he was able to contribute towards the win in the presence of the home crowd.
"It was a team game and all my scoring was done due to the backing given by my team mates. The last few days at practice I concentrated more on my kicking and that helped me in a big way. My club will do better in the second round, for which all players are in top form," said Ratwatte. "I am thankful to the club for giving the much needed back up."
It seemed as though Kandy SC's fullback Ratwattte had reserved his best performance for the game against the Navy SC.
Kandy SC's new head coach Sean Wijesinghe created a very good image in his first year as coach. Taking on the champion club and maintaining their winning streak is no easy task. The former captain of the club and the country Wijesinghe after the match hailed his captain Fazil Marija as the greatest fly half ever. He has helped the club make history as the only team to win seven consecutive games this season.
"We took the field with the hype, confidence, superiority and power, which has been the hallmark of the team this season. It was a special victory than the rest because last year Navy beat us at Nittawela by one point. It was an opportunity that we really wanted to take and it was a huge relief and brought a sense of satisfaction at having got the job done well," said Wijesinghe.
The coach also thanked his former coach Johan Taylor who is in Kandy on a short visit. Taylor gave the team all the encouragement and a helping hand in the last two games, and helped to polish up the team's performance. He leaves for Ireland in a few days time.
Taylor said, "This victory means a lot - I'm pretty grateful to be where I am. I'm so proud of the team. To win back-to-back matches is a dream come true. It's a pretty strong group of guys. We try to do things no other team has done before. It's a special feeling to be part of such a great team."
Marija the skipper said, "We've been the hardest working team in club rugby. Nobody has trained harder than us. The work ethic has been magnificent. We do not have the huge stars, but we've out-worked other teams and that's something to be proud of. I thank my players and all the people who helped us in every way."
Rugby Chairman of the club, Lasantha Wijasuriya a former captain says one of their goals was to be the team of the tournament. "We set out to create a team that Kandy rugby fan can really be proud of. They should be proud of this group of young men, who have worked so hard to achieve what they have done. This moment and the day belonged to the team, and it is yours to share"
