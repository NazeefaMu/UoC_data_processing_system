‘Up-Cycled Fashion’

“The age old practice by Buddhist monks of stitching their robes from the saffron colored cloth used to wrap corpses in India is one of the oldest known instances of up-cycling clothing. However at present up-cycling is still an emerging trend in Sri Lanka,” says Dhanushika Welagedara a final year student attached to the Department of Textile and Clothing Technology of the University of Moratuwa. She presented a paper on her study of the acceptance of Up cycled fashion in Sri Lanka at the 4th International Conference on Management and Finance (ICME 2015) held at the University of Ruhuna recently.
“The word ‘up cycling’ has originated its meaning from deviations of recycling which in general is reducing the waste and reusing everything we shed. Up-cycling has also be defined as optimizing the materials, ingredients and process pathways in such a way that waste is converted to raw materials for nature or some other industry. It is the process of reusing discarded items to create a product of higher value than the original,” she explained.
“In the fashion arena, up-cycling could be defined as the process where waste or useless products are converted to new fashion products of better quality or a higher environmental value through craftsmanship and design. It is one way to take care of over consumption in an environmentally responsible way and still satisfy the profitable fashion industry and the needs of the fashion conscious consumers. Up-cycling provides a vista of opportunities to designers who are willing to do business with less guilt,” she added.
