Indian Ministry of Agriculture has moved a Rs. 380 crore proposal to provide subsidy for replacing old trawlers of Tamil Nadu fishermen with modern tuna longliners to end bottom trawling fishing in Lankan waters, Business Standard reported.
Ever since India and Sri Lanka signed the maritime agreement in 1974, Tamil Nadu fishermen have run into problems as they have been crossing maritime border for fishing in the Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar regions using bottom trawling.
The main complaint of Sri Lanka has been against India's bottom trawling method of fishing that severely damaging marine resources and the sea bed, leading to arrest of Tamil Nadu fishermen.
"To mitigate the relentless conflict with Sri Lanka and encourage sustainable fishing, the Agriculture Ministry has moved a cabinet note seeking subsidy support for replacing existing old fishing trawlers in Tamil Nadu with the modern tuna longliners," sources said.
There are 3,000-odd old trawlers in the state. A modern tuna longliner boat above 50 metre length is estimated to cost around Rs 60 lakh. The Tamil Nadu government has requested the centre to bear the 50 per cent of the cost of the boat and sought Rs 950 crore funds for the same.
However, in the cabinet note, sources said the ministry has proposed that the Tamil Nadu fishermen should pay half the price of the boat on their own and the subsidy portion should be borne by both the centre and the state in the 40:60 ratio.
Accordingly, the ministry is seeking release of Rs 380 crore funds for incentivising purchase of modern tuna longliners boats, which will help Tamil Nadu fishermen explore full potential of high seas, sources added.
Bottom trawling is banned in many countries including Sri Lanka. Due to old trawlers, Tamil Nadu fishermen are unable to explore high seas for fishing and therefore go to Lankan waters to get maximum number of catch.
