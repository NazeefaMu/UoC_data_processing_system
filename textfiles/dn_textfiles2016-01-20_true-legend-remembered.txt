A True Legend remembered

Felicitating or commemorating a deserving individual is fine by any means. Somadasa Elvitigala is such individual who had made his contribution for the betterment of the local music industry. His works with evergreen qualities are appreciated by people of yesteryear and present day. Elvitigala will also be remembered by future generations who will have their feet firmly placed on the soils of mother Lanka.
Somadasa Elvitigala commemoration program held at the BMICH on January 14 was organized by Somadasa Elvitigala Foundation headed by Sumedha S Elvitigala in association with the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. Guidance of present SLBC Chairman Nanda Muruththettuwegama paved way for the event to become a huge success.
House was packed with people from all social strata and the President Maithripala Sirisena’s participation added more depth to the occasion.
Sinidu Sudu Mudu Thalawe show got a kick start with the symphony style music of the song came in the film Sath Samudura. People who were in their youth in the golden era of Sinhala cinema would have recalled how stunningly a youthful Cyril Wickramage portrayed the main character in Sath Samudura. A matured Cyril Wickramage who too deserves a felicitation was seated in the audience witnessing his youthful looks on screen.
Creativity Par Excellence
Somadas Elvitigala’s mentors had been Don Vincent Peiris, Soorya Shankar Molligoda, Ananda Samarakone, H W Rupasinghe and J Sadiris Master. Creativity lying within young Elvitigala’s soul would have ignited due to the shock of the untimely demise of his loving parents. Finding difficult to fathom with the unbearable void created by this tragic incident in his early life young Elvitigala went to India with the little money his parents had saved for him. In Mumbai under the guidance of Usthad Ali Akbar Khan young Elvitigala learned to play the Sarodh and became an expert Sarodh player.
Witnessing the famed Indian music director Naushad directing songstress Lata Mageshkar to sing a film-song had inspired Elvitigala to indulge in film music direction. With this surging stimulation Somadasa Elvitigala came back to his motherland to let lose the creativity that was oozing from his soul.
Association with veterans Chitrasena, Lionel Edirisinghe and Prof Sarachchandra kept Somadasa Elvitigala on a high pedestal when engaging in creative work. Radio Ceylon embraced Somadasa Elvitigala in 1958 and provided strength to him in his quest to open new vistas in music direction.
There are diverse experts’ views on importance of music in the cinematic construction of ideologies. Some say cinema is a film director’s brainchild and cinema music is just one component in the whole creation that adds value to a particular cinema.
Yet music compositions made by Somadasa Elvitigala for the Sinhala films Sath Samudura, Binaramalee, Bakmaha Deegae and Welikathara have become monuments in the film music direction history in Sri Lanka. The songs Sinidu Sudu Mudu Thalawae, Dakkoth Pathmawathie and Pipunu Kusuma Parawuwa in Sath Samudura cinema will forever linger in the minds of Sri Lankans.
If one could revisit memories in relation to Welikathara cinema and recall the drum beats heard from the background in its climaxing scene when Gorin Mudalali is chased by the police battalion, he would see one aspect of late Elvitigala’s musical prowess.
In contrast were the songs and music scores in Bakmaha Deegae or Binaramalee.
Stage dramas were no exception for Somadasa Elvitigala in letting lose his musical ability. The heartwarming song Muhudu Pathula Yata Indala in the stage drama Moodu Puththu, Anna Balan Sanda in Kundalakeshi and Meka Thamai Kanthoruwa, Udeta Enawa…Hawasata Yanawa in Janelaya are registered in the minds of stage drama lovers.
Somadasa Elvitigala received the best music director Sarasavi award for the film Sath Samudura in 1967.
He was bestowed with the Deepashika award in 1974 for his yeomen contribution to the local music field. In 1985 Royal College, Colombo felicitated Elvitigala. He was recognized with Kala Bhushana award in 1988. Somadasa Elvitigala left SLBC to join SLRC the same year.
Somadasa Elvitigala commemoration show at the BMICH brought to fore all these memories and took the audience down memory lane for a couple of magical hours.
