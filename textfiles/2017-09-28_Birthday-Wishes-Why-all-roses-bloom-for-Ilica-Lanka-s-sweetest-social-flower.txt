Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne, a colourful personality in Sri Lanka’s social and media circles, celebrates her birthday today, September 28. A prolific writer and author whose articles, almost always, have been vivid portrayals of statesmen, literary giants and colourful personalities,   

Viewed from any angle, she has emerged a winner in life - and portrayed qualities we all desire and dream of in another human being – love, concern and an unshaken friendship especially in the darkest hours
-By Ranee Mohamed  

They call her Ilica, the name her father bestowed upon her at birth. And also Malkanthi, to add a flower touch to that bundle of a bud that saw light decades ago on a September night. Today, when the mood swings her, she wraps herself with a name of her own choosing – Kamalka – an amalgamation of all her names – knowing, no doubt, that whatever name a rose is called, she smells as sweet.  

It was the 1980s and young journalists of the SUN and WEEKEND newspapers were creating their best in the face of heavy competition – with each writer, being more pronounced than the other.   

Ilika Malkanthi Karunaratne, that time belonged to the category of senior writers- an ‘established’ journalist, writing her vivid portrayals, profiles and news features.   

Viewed at from any angle, she is a winner.  Born in the midst of esteem, class and the clink of silver spoons Ilica, rose with poise, naturally, unaffected by the prominence, eminence and power around her.  

Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne, writer, author, and social icon is a doctor’s daughter- a daughter instilled with compassion, love and care for all living beings around her.  

Her father Professor C.C. de Silva was Sri Lanka’s first Professor of Paediatrics. A medical professor of that era who went to University College, London and put Sri Lanka on the international map and enjoyed national and international fame. With enough reason to be proud,his daughter Ilika has always remained down to earth. Her dealings with fellow humans have always been endearing. 


Known to never leave a friend in time of distress, Ilika has always won the race in this stage called life.  


Ilica is the daughter of Irene de Silva. Ilika, who married UNP MP Chandra Karunaratne, has three children Kishan,  Anjali and Nirupa.  

Her concern and philanthropy spring from great beginnings. She descends from great philanthropists as Sir Charles Henry de Soysa, Sir Henry De Mel, Bishops Lakdasa De Mel and Harold De Soysa.   

Known to never leave a friend in time of distress, Ilika has always won the race in this stage called life. For she has always been the one to reach out in times of distress, never to leave your side till she sees you stand tall again.  

She speaks with love about her dear friends – a warm and solid network of beautiful bondings that have enriched her life with happiness, laughter and experiences that only those special friendships can bestow upon us.   

Ilica Karunaratne speaks of personalities who have had an intense impact on her life, names that remain etched in her heart and life. They are J.R. Jayewardene, Dudley Senanayake, Nalini Wickremesinghe, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Lalith Athulathmudali.   

Having written about a plethora of subjects, Ilica Karunaratne knows the happenings in the country and in the city of Colombo – inside and out.  

Her charming demeanour and warm smile however can be the soft exterior for the vast knowledge of hard facts that she has gathered in her extensive traverse of the journalistic arena.  

Ilica Malkanthi Karunaratne is a personality of substance. Her well-styled clothes have always been in good taste, soft colours, warm hues and mysterious dark designs have always been chosen to suit the appropriate time of day and occasion. Driven by the deep dress sense, the etiquette and the understanding and acceptance,Ilika has left behind a trail of colourful and mystique memories. 
 
I have felt the full force of her friendship as she stood by me during a time when I ceased to write. She has urged coaxed, encouraged and ardently recommended me - and spurred me to rise like the Phoenix. She was always there to raise both her hands to applaud successes. She has been an inspiring breeze that blew, I know from her most sincere heart.   

Lucky are they who enjoy her friendship, luckier are they who realise its depth,if ever misfortune dare strikes -and to find, in her deep and unfathomable well of kindness, compassion and altruistic generosity, the ground spring of hope. Keeping true to the name her father baptized her in Anglian waters. Ilica: the goddess of the earth. And Malkanthi, the fragrant flower of a thousand petals.
