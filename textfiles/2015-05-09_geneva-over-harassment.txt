UPFA parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardane today said they would lodge a complaint with the Inter-parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva within next two weeks against the harassment faced by certain UPFA MPs due to the growing influence of the ‘state police’ concept.
MP Gunawardane said it was important to inform the international community about Ranil Wickremesinghe’s ‘police government’.
He said they decided to complain to the IPU to ensure the security of the peoples’ representatives.
“We will go to Geneva and complain to the IPU soon after we obtain an opportunity to meet them. The government officials and the bootlickers of this so called police government should know that we as peoples’ representatives of the parliament have international protection,” he said.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
