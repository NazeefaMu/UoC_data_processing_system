HNB Assurance (HNBA) clinched two awards under the categories of corporate social responsibility (CSR) Contribution and Micro Insurance Contribution at the inaugural Insurance Industry Awards of Sri Lanka jointly organised by Fintelekt and the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL), which was held recently at Taj Samudra, Colombo.
These awards recognize and honour the achievements of insurance companies that have met measurable and tangible business objectives. Each submission was reviewed, analysed and processed internally by Fintekelt with a final review by an eminent jury to ensure the highest level of transparency and an independent evaluation process.
The company was awarded the Micro Insurance Contribution Award in recognition of its contribution towards providing protection to low-income segments of society as well as in delivering affordable insurance solutions. 
Likewise, in recognition of the efforts taken towards sharing clean drinking water amongst rural folk through its CSR initiative on water stewardship, the company was awarded the CSR Contribution Award.HNBA and HNB General Insurance Limited (HNBGI) CEO Deepthi Lokuarachchi stated, “As a company involved in providing protection, these accolades clearly are a testament of the ethos of not only providing protection exclusively to the affluent but also to the underprivileged and marginalised amongst us in our society.”
Speaking further, Lokuarachchi added, “Whilst our micro insurance solutions address income security, the water stewardship programme is our contribution to society to provide physiological protection to folk who are otherwise exposed to inadequate water resources or in some instances the consumption of contaminated drinking water.”
