Former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said today that he did not receive an invitation for the ceremony to mark the commencement of President Maithripala Sirisena's second year in office that was held today at the BMICH nor to take up the leadership of any new political party.

He also took a swipe at the government on the incident that took place on Saturday in Hambantota during the inauguration of the Hambantota industrial zone saying that attacks on the protesting villagers point to the collapse of democracy, good governance and the rule of law in the country.

Mr. Rajapaksa made these remarks after visiting the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera and the Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera.

He was received at the Sri Dalada Maligawa by Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela Banadara. (Nadeeka Daya Bandara)
