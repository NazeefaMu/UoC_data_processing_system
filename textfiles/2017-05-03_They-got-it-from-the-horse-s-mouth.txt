A rumour that a young lady from a high family in the country was planning to run for North Central Chief Minister made a sensation in political circles recently. 

 


Number One in yahapalanaya scotched this rumour while addressing a gathering of party supporters in Rajarata the other day. Despite none having made any direct inquiry, Number One assured the gathering that no family member of his would come forward to run for chief minister of the province. Number One added: “I can also assure you for that matter that no member from my family would enter politics as long as I hold office in this government!”
