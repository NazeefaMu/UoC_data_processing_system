A programme to recruit retired military personnel in national development endeavours would be launched under the aegis of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat on October 11, State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene said today.

The programme had been initiated by the Ministry, National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry and the Home Affairs Ministry to increase the effectiveness and the productivity of the development projects.

“Retired armed forces personnel who are still capable of working will be absorbed into 15 ministries, construction fields, hospitals and other seven institutions under the first phase of the project. This is a concept of the President and the Cabinet approval was given in this regard in March this year,” the Minister told a news conference.

The Minister said the livelihood of the retired armed personnel would be improved by way of recruiting them again at suitable position in the development tasks.

A total number of 4,269 applications had been received by the ministry from retired tri-forces personnel so far to fill posts in various institutions. More information on the programme could be obtained from the website, www. Smod.lk, the ministry said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
