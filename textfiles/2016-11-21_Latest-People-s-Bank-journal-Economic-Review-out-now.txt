Latest People’s Bank journal ‘Economic Review’ out now


	

Re-launched to an overwhelming response earlier this year, the People’s Bank publication brought out by its Research Department, Economic Review, has issued a high value edition. 


A community initiative by People’s Bank, the Economic Review imparts knowledge and promotes interest in the economy and shares information on economic development through multiple opinions, research-based articles and debates. The theme of the current issue is ‘Voting’. 
Brought out by the bank’s highly-regarded Research Department, the publication is published on a quarterly basis. Available in English and Sinhala, its contents, however, do not necessarily reflect bank policies or the official viewpoint. The advisory panel for the publication includes the senior management of People’s Bank.


The focus of the latest edition of the Economic Review is the people’s right to vote, with prominent personalities presenting their point of view on the issue of voting. The lead article ‘Vote if your right’ and ‘Vote is your power’ is written by Chairman of the Elections Commission Mahinda Deshapriya and Attorney-at-Law Nimal Punchihewa. 


In the same issue, Dr. Shirantha Heenkenda discusses the economic cost of ‘voting’, while Dr. Sujatha Gamage debates ‘A review of the proposed mixed member proportional representation method of election’. The current issue also contains an electoral register of all citizens eligible to vote, which is a valuable resource. The main feature article is based on an empirical study on transition of cultivation from rubber to other crops. The People’s Bank Journal is available via subscription or direct purchase for a nominal fee from the bank’s head 
office.
