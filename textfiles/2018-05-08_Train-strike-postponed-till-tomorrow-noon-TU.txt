The islandwide train strike, which was scheduled to take effect tonight, was postponed till tomorrow noon, Railway Professional Trade Union Alliance Convener Janaka Fernando said today.

The Trade Union had taken this decision following an assurance given by  the Minister Sarath Amunugama to discuss their grievances after the cabinet discussion tomorrow.

“During the discussions held with the Deputy Transport Minster Ashoka Abeysinghe this morning, he had requested two more weeks to find solutions for their salary issues,” Mr. Fernando said.

If tomorrows discussion fails to find solutions for their issues, the strike would definitely be launched at 12 noon tomorrow, he said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
