Daily Mail/9 February 2017-  The U.S. Senate voted to confirm Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions as the next attorney general of the United States on Wednesday after fierce opposition from Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren as many question if he can serve as the nation’s top law enforcement officer independent from President Donald Trump.  


The Alabama lawmaker was confirmed by a narrow 52-47 vote after several of his former colleagues staged a second all-night debate to share their opposition of his nomination over his civil rights record to become the 84th attorney general of the United States.
