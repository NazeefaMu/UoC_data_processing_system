Video clip may have been an old one - NCPA

The National Child Protection Authority official yesterday, said that the controversial video clip that went viral on social media, may have been an old one as it had received information that the incident had taken place 18 months ago.
He said that they had received information of such an incident from the Kalutara Police Division. The NCPA officials and Police officials of the relevant police stations were informed to look for more information on this incident.
"If the girl who is being beaten by two males in the video clip is underaged, the NCPA will conduct a probe and legal action would be taken against the assailants," he said.
The video showed two apparently drunken males beating a girl severely, while another person recorded the incident.
