Didn’t instruct IGP to cancel IP Nishantha's transfer: NPC


	

The National Police Commission (NPC) said yesterday it had not directed the IGP to cancel the transfer of the CID’s Organised Crimes Investigation Unit OIC, IP Nishantha Silva.

Several reports claimed that the NPC had directed the IGP to cancel the transfer of IP Nishantha Silva.

NPC Secretary Saman Dissanayaka said the NPC had not recommended IP Nishantha’s transfer as the CID did not belong to the commission’s functional division.

The Secretary said both the transfer and its withdrawal had been made by the IGP.  (Darshana Sanjeewa)
