Bringing the festival outdoor to the Paradise Beach, MLH promises a completely different experience this year.

Topped up with a series of fun filled games the evenings will definitely offer great excitement. Aer Lingus, the Irish band who will perform at the festival comes from one of the oldest music societies in Ireland, the Aer Lingus Musical Society. Comprising of 6 members and the group of tap dancers, they will add to the fun and frolic of the beach festival.

Together with our partners we have been the ideal hosts for probably the best beach festivals in the past and our guests eagerly look forward to the next one. St. Patrick's Day celebrations are going to be bigger and better this year. We have moved outdoors not only to accommodate the growing number of party goers but also to provide an amazing atmosphere where tropical will meet Irish festivities", Mount Lavinia Hotel Group General Manager Bazeer Cassim.
