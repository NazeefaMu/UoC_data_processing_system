Laser treatment for skin conditions: Is it for you


	



 

Laser treatment is more effective than conventional treatments such as creams when treating blemishes, acne scars, wrinkles and certain other skin-related issues. Laser treatment is as of yet a novel technology in Sri Lanka which people are hesitant to undergo due to the mystery surrounding it. 

 

LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation

 



A laser beam is concentrated on irregular or blemished skin so that its irregularity is removed gradually. Most often, several sessions of such treatment are essential for optimum results. Debunking myths related to laser treatment, Dr. Nayani Madarasingha, Consultant Dermatologist explained when laser treatment proves to be beneficial, its preconditions, side-effects, benefits and precautions.   

QWhat is laser treatment?
LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Lasers have been used for decades in other countries including India. It is used in different fields of medicine to treat skin, eye-related and urinal problems as well as varicose veins. However, this kind of treatment is fairly new when it comes to dermatological issues.   

 

Laser treatment can cure blemishes, acne scars, wrinkles and other  skin-related problems


There are different types of laser treatments available and the correct type should be given depending on the condition. Sometimes people come and say they’ve undergone laser treatment but that it has not been effective. There are so many things to consider- whether it was the correct type of laser, how it was given, the dosage and the standard of the machine- for it to be effective. 

It has to be done by a qualified doctor who has a good understanding of skin and related problems as well as laser.   

QWhen do you perform laser treatment? 
Laser treatment related to skin issues are manifold. We can help women with excessive hair through permanent hair reduction laser treatment. Through laser treatment, the hair becomes thinner and almost invisible. It can be used to reduce hair anywhere and even men can go through laser treatment. It is widely done and gives very good results.   

 

Different types of laser treatments are given depending on the condition

 


The visibility of scars such as those present due to chicken pox, surgery, pimples and stretch marks could be reduced, as their depth is reduced through the laser. 

You can see a striking change in just one session if the scars are superficial. However many sessions will be required for better results. Laser treatment is also administered for skin rejuvenation and to get rid of wrinkles. Birthmarks can be removed. Black patches caused due to certain pigmentary problems can be erased. Not all black marks can be erased in this manner. Tattoos and thread veins (tiny veins which run close to the surface of the skin) can also 
be removed.   

QWhat requirements need to be met before undergoing laser treatment?
We don’t do laser treatment if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding. There is no specific age limit. It can be done to children. Other medical conditions are not problems to be concerned about either. Laser treatment requires several sessions. Usually, there is a gap of at least a month or two between sessions. So you need to plan ahead and be patient with the treatment.  

 

Laser treatment requires several sessions

 

 
Q What are the side effects?
Redness, swelling, skin darkening and very rarely scars. If it is done properly and if the person follows the instructions given, the negative consequences can be minimized. Sometimes we can do a test patch to see how the skin reacts before going ahead with the full procedure.   

QAny precautions to take after undergoing laser treatment? 
Depending on the laser used, the type of pre and post laser treatment will differ. It is compulsory to avoid sunlight after undergoing treatment. Otherwise, the skin might end up darkening. This is the main concern related to laser treatment. Contracting skin cancers and other diseases is false. They are myths.

  QWhat are the benefits of laser treatment compared to traditional treatment?
If you take creams and tablets, there is a certain extent to which they could be effective. If there is an acne scar, for instance, the laser can get into the deep layer of the skin and reduce its visibility. 
This amount of improvement cannot be achieved by applying cream. There are certain skin issues ( Tattoo removal, thread veins) where drugs and creams have no place in the treatment.
