The staff of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) including the engineers are to stage a protest in front of the Colombo Town Hall tomorrow against the removal of Commissioner V. K. Anura by the Western Province Governor.

Mr. Anura was removed on Friday, March 2 following the recommendation of the Presidential Commission appointed to look into the Meethotamulla tragedy.

A spokesman for the CMC staff told the Daily Mirror that they would stage a protest tomorrow against the removal of the commissioner.

"It is unfair that the present commissioner is treated this way as the Meethotamulla issue flared up before Mr. Anura took over as the commissioner" the spokesman said. He said the staff will reveal real details of the issue tomorrow.

The spokesman said several former CMC members are the one who were behind the Meethotamulla tragedy. (Yohan Perera)
