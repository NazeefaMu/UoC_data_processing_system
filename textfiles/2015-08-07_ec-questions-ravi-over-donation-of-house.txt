Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya had sent a letter to Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and questioned the nature of the donation of a house during an election, on a complaint filed by National Freedom Front (NFF) member Kapila Gamage.
Mr. Gamage had complained that the minister's donation of a house to the family of the woman, who was shot dead at Kotahena last Friday, was an election bribe.
While denying the charges, the minister said President Maithripala Sirisena had approved the donation of the house.
“The deceased woman's main desire was to live in a proper house. Considering the humanitarian side of her wish, President Sirisena approved the donation of the house. We have also consulted the Prime Minister in this regard. This is not a bribe,” he told a news conference.
The minister said the deceased woman had also been a strong United National Party (UNP) supporter for the past 20 years and added that he had informed Mr. Deshapriya about the donation over the phone.  (Yoshitha Perera)
