Thajudeen Murder: Defence, aggrieved party question delays


	

Delivering his own submission, from the defence dock, former SDIG Anura Senanayake today requested the prosecution to arrest, without any further delay, the true culprits who committed the murder of Wasim Thajudeen because the unjustifiable delay of the inquiry had violated his Fundamental Rights.

He was of the view that in addition to fabricating false evidence, the prosecution had purposely included the ‘conspiracy’ charges against him in order to keep him in remand custody.

On the other hand, questioning the current progress of the inquiry, Counsel Misbah Sathar, who appeared for the aggrieved party, said that his clients could not be pleased with the current progress of the investigation, because even with sufficient material evidence in court; former Chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara was not arrested yet and brought before justice by the CID.
