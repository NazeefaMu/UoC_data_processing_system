Wary of Trump unpredictability, China ramps up naval abilities


	



 

BEIJING REUTERS Feb 26- The PLA Navy is likely to secure significant new funding in China’s upcoming defence budget as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its own projection of power around the globe.   


China’s navy has been taking an increasingly prominent role in recent months, with a rising star admiral taking command, its first aircraft carrier sailing around self-ruled Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places.   


 Now, with President Donald Trump promising a U.S. shipbuilding spree and unnerving Beijing with his unpredictable approach on hot button issues including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy.   


 “It’s opportunity in crisis,” said a Beijing-based Asian diplomat, of China’s recent naval moves. “China fears Trump will turn on them eventually as he’s so unpredictable and it’s getting ready.”
