Good pay for no work


	

It has come to light that a daughter of a politico recruited as the Liaison officer (Foreign relations) of a statutory body handling civil aviation has drawn emoluments amounting to Rs.6,095,560 for a period of over one year despite not working a single day since the date of appointment.

 


It has also been revealed that she had been appointed to this special post without observing the stipulated recruitment procedure and besides, she knew next to nothing about the subject she was expected to handle. 


This privileged person had been seconded to the Civil Aviation Ministry four days after her appointment.  She also had been exempted from registering her arrival and departure using the clocking-in machine and she had marked her attendance in a diary provided by an additional Ministry secretary.
