The House will be unable to function any further if the Parliament Select Committee (PSC) is not appointed tomorrow, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said.

Addressing a news briefing, he said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had been delaying the appointment of PSC members since November 14 and that he always preferred a majority of the PSC to be UNP MPs.

“The tradition is to appoint a majority of government MPs to the PSC. Hence, the Speaker cannot violate this practice. This should have been done on November 14 when the Parliament first met. However, the Speaker sabotaged the entire procedure in Parliament,” he said.

He said seven MPs -- Dinesh Gunawardena, S.B. Dissanayake, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and Thilanga Sumathipala -- were nominated to the PSC by the government on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa said some valuable properties in Temple Trees had reportedly gone missing.(Sheain Fernandopulle)
