If there is light it's a very long tunnel for Windies - Jeff Dujon

The name of Jeff Dujon may not rank as high as that of Viv Richards, Clive Lloyd, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Joel Garner you name it, that shaped the powerful West Indies team which dominated world cricket in the 80's but he proved to be a vital cog in their wheel of success especially to their formidable quartet of fast bowlers who played from time to time.
Keeping to such men of exceptional speed was no easy task but over time Dujon mastered the art to become the most successful wicket-keeper produced by West Indies in Tests and One-Day Internationals accounting for 270 and 204 dismissals in both formats.
In an exclusive interview with the "Daily News" Dujon who is presently in Sri Lanka as a television commentator for the ongoing series involving West Indies talks of a wide range of topics from their dominance to their downfall and of their future, if there is any and, makes comparisons between the present Sri Lanka and West Indies teams.
Q: How did you fit into a side like Clive Lloyd's all-conquering world beaters?
JD: I got into the team first as a batsman David Murray was keeping wickets then. I was more of a batsman/wicketkeeper. In local cricket I had two good seasons as a batsman before I got into the West Indies team and went on tour as a second wicket-keeper.
Q:How did you displace David Murray in the team?
JD: A little bit of luck was involved, I actually made the team as a batsman. I played the first two Tests as a batsman. In the second Test Murray broke his finger and I was given an opportunity to keep wickets in the third Test. I got a half century and well the rest is history.
Q:What was it like to keep wickets to a battery of fast bowlers like Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Colin Croft, Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, etc?
JD: It was that I wasn't a genuine wicket-keeper but my grounding from school was basically to spin so I kept to a lot of spin bowling in school. Coming into the West Indies team having to cope with all of this fast bowling was a difficult experience to start with. Over time I got used to it and overtime I got better at it. I wouldn't say at the beginning of my Test career that I was a good wicket-keeper to fast bowling but eventually with that experience I learned and got better.
Q:How did you find keeping to balls coming at you at 90-100 mph?
JD: Naturally it is something that you have to get used to and realize that you have to play through the pain and whatever. But the most difficult thing to adapt to was the fact that they were all different - in terms of what they did with the ball and what they could do. That part of it was for me the most difficult. We had bowlers who could swing the ball at great pace, others who would hit the seam and get a bit of extra bounce because of their height people like Joel Garner (6ft, 8 1/2 in) you had to sort of work out not just how far back you stood but also try to understand their method of doing things. It took a little time to get used to but I must tell you it was very interesting and in the end a very rewarding experience.
Q:Which of them did you find difficult to keep wickets to?
JD: The most awkward to me and unfortunately it was only for one Test I had to keep wickets to was Colin Croft who tended when he didn't get it right, to go way down the leg side, but at the same time he could hit the seam and get the ball to leave the right hander. It was difficult and had he been around longer it would have taken a lot more time to adapt to him but with the others they were far more conventional in the way they delivered the ball.
Q:What made West Indies form a battery of fast bowlers, was it due to the defeat they suffered at the hands of Lillee and Thomson in Australia in 1974-75?
JD: It had quite a bit to do with that defeat and it was very fortunate that at that time we could put together a quartet of fast bowlers of quality that was important - not just the pace itself because we were 'done-in' by Australia by quality just as much as pace. That experience was the guideline for what we needed to do and we were very successful in the end.
Q:Whose idea was it?
JD: It stemmed a lot from Clive Lloyd who was the captain at the time and he saw the effect that this type of bowling could have.
If you have good quality fast bowlers it doesn't really matter what surface you are playing on.
We had four fast bowlers who were so much so different that usually on the day for one of them the conditions would suit him.
Q:Did such a bowling attack shut out the spinners?
JD: It did to a certain extent but it's not that we didn't have a few quality spinners in the West Indies at the time.
The emphasis in the team was more one of balancing the batting and the bowling so they ended up with part-time spinners who could stop a gap and give the quicker bowlers a rest because they were the ones who were taking the wickets.
Q: Why is it that West Indies don't produce that kind of fast bowlers today?
JD: At that time it was a very competitive situation in the West Indies in terms of trying to get into the team.
We had players who were good enough both batsmen and bowlers. The team was so successful it was very difficult for anyone to get in. In recent times for some reason our fast bowlers have diminished in stature, they are not as tall and they are not as big.
I don't think it's that we don't have individuals of that size more than that there is less interest. The fact that the doors of county cricket were closed to us could be a contributing factor to that and the pitches in the West Indies have slowed down, they don't really encourage fast bowling. Many reasons can be given by different individuals and probably they all would be right.
The fact is that the stature of our fast bowlers has changed and there may be a few things that may have influenced that. Some say the taller fellows have wanted to play basketball or whatever.
Fast bowling is very hard work and we are coming to an era now more of instant gratifications where youngsters are not prepared to work as hard as people in the past.
The reason why I say the fast bowlers were as great as they were is the fact that they worked very hard at what they did. I am not sure that same commitment exists no, to a large extent we are suffering from that not only from the bowling point of view but also where the batting is concerned.
I am not sure if our batsmen put enough effort into it to improving their techniques and improving each season.
Q: What made West Indies want to become the top nation in the eighties?
JD: In my time cricket was a far more popular game than it is now I believe. I can only speak of someone who played for the West Indies. In the era I played in it was a very fierce national pride. We took pride in what we did, we wanted to dominate the world, we played together and it had less to do with financial rewards because we weren't very well paid. What we were paid is you could call it pocket money more than anything else. That was the motivating factor. It was the fact that you took a lot of pride in representing the West Indies and you wanted to go there and do your best. You realized that you represented millions of people who were listening. In those days there wasn't that much television coverage, they were listening at odd hours of the morning and that is what drove us the most - personal pride and pride in the fact that we were representing the West Indies. Sentiments of that have been echoed by Sir Garfield Sobers during his visit here and sentiments which I totally agree with.
Q: At which point did the pride start to diminish?
JD: When the heart of the team was removed. When a number of experienced players the core of the team was changed all at once. They thought that we could just keep producing these players that it would happen like magic. Just around that time we started to see not immediately but that decline. It's been a progressive situation since downhill. I am not sure if the administration has really understood exactly why is it that we were as dominant as we were and one stupid decision just started the ball rolling.
Q:Is there light at the end of the tunnel for West Indies cricket?
JD: If there is a light it's a very long tunnel and I am not sure if we are on the right track. There's got to be some changes made in terms of the actual cricket itself from the grassroots, in terms of organizing all grassroots better, teaching it better, better coaching, and better fundamental coaching so that players don't come to this level as deficient as we seen now. We also need an administration that has a different type of thinking that is willing to build the game in a realistic way and invest in a future.
Q: Being a member of a great team how much does it hurt you to make comments on the present West Indies team?
JD: I can tell you that it does hurt because you keep harking back to days when things were so much different. What encourages me is the fact that I do see talent. There is talent but that alone is not enough you have to develop it and you have to learn to manage it properly and to be constantly looking to improve. I am not seeing enough of that but I am seeing talent there and I am actually encouraged by the fact that we do have something to work with.
Q:Your impressions about Sri Lanka cricket compared to West Indies?
JD: Sri Lanka at the same time are going through a transitional period I don't think that is going to be as painful as where the West Indies are concerned. From what I can see there is a lot more interest and a lot more organisation the way cricket is run here. They are producing some fine young players - spinners in particular have come in and started to make an impression, some nice young batsmen as well. It's going to be a slightly easier transition for Sri Lanka. I was very impressed with the captain Angelo Mathews he is a very good leader. He is so consistent at international level that he will help to bring along some of the new players of the team.
Q: Has T20 cricket got a lot do with West Indies downfall?
JD: It does. Also in the sense the shorter form of the game is providing more financial remuneration to the players. A little bit of focus has shifted from dedication to the game and more to the financial aspects of the game itself. This could have been better managed by the administration but as it is now you can't blame players for wanting to go and earn money and look after their families. A cricketer's career is short but at the same time you have to remember where you are coming from, who gave you your opportunity, you have to show some kind of loyalty where that is concerned.
