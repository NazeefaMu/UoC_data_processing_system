Rumpus in Parliament; SF shows photo of Avant Garde chief with minister


	

Minister of Regional Development Sarath Fonseka caused a rumpus in Parliament yesterday by showing a photograph of a government minister and Avant Garde Chief Nissanka Senadhipathi whom he accused of corruption, and also by alleging that a former top state official was behind the killing of Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.

This was actually a follow up action by Minister Fonseka who had accused several Joint Opposition members of serious acts of corruption.

Drama reigned when angry members of the opposition charged that the minister was violating standing orders by making allegations against individual members.

Joint Opposition member Vasudeva Nanayakkara, raising a point of order, said the minister could not make allegations against individual members according to standing orders. “The minister has to bring in a motion if he is to make an allegation against any individual member,” he said.

MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Keheliya Rambukwella also came up with similar arguments.

Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala, who was at the chair, ruled that what the minister said about the MPs would be expunged from the Hansard. Mr. Fonseka said expunging it was unfair as he never claimed that any of the MPs whom he accused had been convicted.

Heated arguments followed this and both minister Fonseka and Joint Opposition members were heard using unparliamentary language. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)
