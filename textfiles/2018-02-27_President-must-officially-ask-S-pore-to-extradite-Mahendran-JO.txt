President Maithripala Sirisena should officially request the Singapore Government to extradite former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to Sri Lanka, who is allegedly connected to the bond scam, JO National Organizer MP Dullas Alahapperuma said today.

Addressing a media conference, he said having been issued a notice over Mr Mahendran to appear before the CID before March 8, the CID had reportedly mentioned that Mr Mahendran was not present in the given address in Singapore.

“We saw recently how the Government took prompt action against the Defence Attache of the Sri Lankan High Commission in UK Brigadier Priyanka Fernando, who was suspended over making a throat slitting gesture and showing the Sri Lankan Flag. Why such action cannot be taken against the mastermind of the bond fraud,” MP Alahapperuma asked.  (Sheain Fernandopulle)
