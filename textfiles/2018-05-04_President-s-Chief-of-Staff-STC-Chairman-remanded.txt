The two suspects, President’s Chief of Staff I. H. K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayaka were arrested by the Bribery Commission last evening in the act of accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million from an Indian businessman.

The suspects had allegedly solicited a bribe of Rs.540 million from the businessman promising that they would provide him with the approval needed to obtain machinery and building space for business purposes.
