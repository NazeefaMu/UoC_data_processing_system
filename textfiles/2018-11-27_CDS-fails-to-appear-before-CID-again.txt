Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Ravindra Wijegunaratne again failed to report to the CID this morning, officials said.

The CDS was asked to report to the CID to record a statement over allegedly harbouring Lieutenant Commander Prasad Hettiarachchi alias Navy Sampath.

He was first summoned to the CID in September but failed to appear as he left for Mexico.

This was the second time he was summoned to the CID. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
