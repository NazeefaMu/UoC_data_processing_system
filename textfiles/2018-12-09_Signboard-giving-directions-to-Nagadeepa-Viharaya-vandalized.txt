Kayts police said that the signboard for the Nagadeepa Temple in Jaffna had been blurred by using red paint on Saturday (8). This name-board has been a boon to pilgrims and tourists who visit the Nagadeepa Temple in Jaffna.

According to police, the red paint had been applied on the name board which is situated in the Velanai Junction in Kayts in such a way as to keep the name Nagadeepa visible in Sinhala, Tamil and English while blurring the picture of the temple. However, police said they still have no leads about the culprits but added that investigations into the matter were continuing.

During the last provincial council elections, Tamil politicians including the Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V.Wigneswaran had insisted that this area was erroneously called Nagadeepa whereas it should actually be called Nainathivu. They had also protested against the erection of a Buddha statue in close proximity to the Nagadeepa Viharaya.(Romesh Madusanka)
