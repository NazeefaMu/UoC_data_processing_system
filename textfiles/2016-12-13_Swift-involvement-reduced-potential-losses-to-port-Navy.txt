The Navy today assisted to load 1,086 cars and jeeps onboard a South Korean Vehicles Carrier, ‘Glovis Phoenix’ which arrived at the Hambantota port for the loading of vehicles, the Navy said.

It said the ship was scheduled to leave the Hambantota Port for its next port of call in Durban, South Africa, having the vehicles loaded expeditiously by tomorrow.

The Naval personnel made an extensive effort to rectify the damages caused on the generators, power supply system and cleared all the obstacles caused to equipment and machinery by these saboteurs.

The swift involvement of the Sri Lanka Navy helped reduce the potential losses that would have been suffered by the Sri Lankan Government due to non-operations of the harbour as a result of the sabotage carried out by port employees, the Navy said in a statement.

The protest campaign staged by the port employees of Hambantota Harbour on 7th December 2016 continues to its seventh day as of today hampering the routine work of the Hambantota Port.

The Navy said it got the tense situation which erupted on 10th December under control restoring back the security of the harbour and establishing normalcy.
