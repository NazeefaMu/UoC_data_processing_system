He was given the cold shoulder!


	



 

A very high political authority was the chief guest at a very important public function held in Borella area recently. 

 


A former top bureaucrat who attended the function had reportedly made several attempts to have a word with the high political authority without success.  


The top bureaucrat had also walked up to the high political authority when the guests were entertained to tea at the conclusion of the ceremony, but the latter had ignored the official. 


The bureaucrat had later unburdened himself to the ‘second-in-command’ present on the occasion and the others had overheard the latter promise him to speak to the one looking after foreign affairs.
