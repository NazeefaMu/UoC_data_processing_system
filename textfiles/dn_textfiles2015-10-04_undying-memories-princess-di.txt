Undying memories of Princess Di

Fourteen previously unseen photos of Charles and Diana’s wedding reception have auctioned for $12,500.
The official photographer Lord Patrick Lichfield took the never-before-seen snaps, which failed to make it into the final album. Instead, Lord Lichfield’s assistant kept hold of the photos - until now, as he explains in a letter of authenticity that accompanied the single lot to the September 27 auction.
“I was the photographic assistant to Lord Patrick Lichfield...the only photographer allowed to take informal photographs of the royal family and their guests when they returned to Buckingham Palace...for the wedding reception.
“Lord Lichfield had me make up an album of black and white and colour photographs, which he presented to Prince Charles and Princess Diana to commemorate the day of their wedding. These are photos that did not go into that album [and were given to Litchfield’s assistant in recognition of the work done on the wedding photographs]. To my knowledge, none have ever been published. Very few people have ever laid eyes on them.”
The photographs reveal few smiles behind the scenes on that July day in 1981 - although perhaps that is just the royal way. Yet that didn’t deter bidders. Memorabilia connected with Princess Diana always attracts interest, and the unusual nature of these photos ensured a strong price.
The dress Diana wore when she danced with John Travolta at the White House made £240,000 ($363,200) in 2013.
