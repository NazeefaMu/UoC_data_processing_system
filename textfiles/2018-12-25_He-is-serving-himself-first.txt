There is a Green party local politico who has utilized his annual budgetary allocation to concrete only the approach roads to his business places and the residences of his family members, they say.

 


This politico, known to be a close buddy of a political high-up at national level has always utilized his decentralized fund allocations to develop the roads he is personally interested in. When questioned about the unjust way he is using the public funds, the politico would retort: “No one is barred from using these roads!”
