Upali Kodikara creates rumpus at Presidential Commission

Former Western Provincial Minister Upali Kodikara created a rumpus at the Presidential Commission of inquiry at the BMICH by trying to forcibly enter the hall where the sittings were taking place, despite the announcement of the commission's officials.
The Commission officials had made an announcement that the commission premises is not spacious to accomodate all those present and entrance to the hall was limited to lawyers and the media.
Commission officials said they have to give priority to the lawyers and media personnel, invited by the Commission and regretted any inconvenience faced by others who were not allowed in to the premises.
