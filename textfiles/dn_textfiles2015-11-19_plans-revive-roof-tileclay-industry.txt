Plans to revive roof tile,clay industry

Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council plans to take immediate measures to resurrect the local red clay ceramic products (building bricks and roof tile) industry.
Speaking at the 12th Annual General Meeting of Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council President Mahendra Jayasekera said the council has already taken measures to re-open all the closed down factories across the island.
There were over 500 brick and roof tile manufacturing factories in the country using red clay for manufacturing in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately, due to lack of incentives given by the relevant authorities to develop the industry, around 300 factories closed down their operations over the last 20 years.
Jayasekera also expressed his satisfaction over the government’s move to ban the use of asbestos roofing sheets in the country by 2018. He said the ban will help revive the red clay roof tile manufacturing industry to a greater level.
Jayasekera said the council has been lobbying government policymakers with regard to the issues faced by the ceramic industry.The Centre for Technical Excellence in Ceramics (CENTEC) jointly with the Sri Lanka Ceramics and Glass Council is working closely with the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) to introduce the SLS mark to the red clay ceramic products such as building bricks and roof tiles.
CENTEC has currently singed up with over 20 red clay roof tile and building bricks manufacturing companies to implement Sri Lanka standards with regard to system certifications in their factory. With the implementation of SL standards, the council is intending to improve the productivity, yields while bringing down the cost of production and making the local companies more competitive in the market place. 
The council is also closely working with Industry and Commerce Ministry and the Agrarian Services Department to solve issues with regard to the mining of raw materials.
He said the government support must be given to resolve outstanding issues with regard to the mining of raw materials to take the industry forward as an environmentally friendly and sustainable industry.
