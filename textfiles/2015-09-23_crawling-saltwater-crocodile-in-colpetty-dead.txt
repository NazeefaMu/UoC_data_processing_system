The saltwater crocodile which was crawling in the sea off Colpetty, about 15ft away from the shore, had been found dead today, Wildlife Conservation Department spokesperson Hasini Sarathchandra said.
She said the crocodile was in the area for more than a week.
“The reason for its death was yet to be known, but the attempts by the area’s residents to rescue it may have caused its death,” Ms. Hasini said.
 
The Sri Lankan saltwater crocodile is the largest carnivorous reptile in the world and is generally at the top of the predators in their ecosystem, she said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
