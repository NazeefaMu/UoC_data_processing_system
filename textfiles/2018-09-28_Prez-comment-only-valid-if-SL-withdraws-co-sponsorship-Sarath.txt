Prez comment only valid if SL withdraws co-sponsorship: Sarath


	

Referring to the remark made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the UN General Assembly that Sri Lanka should be allowed to handle its own internal affairs, former MP Sarath Weerasekara said the President’s comment would only be valid if the government withdraws the co-sponsorship of 30/1.

Rear Admiral Weerasekara, who is in Geneva to counter the pro-LTTE propaganda, said Sri Lanka is legally bound to implement the recommendations in the resolutions unless it is withdrawn as per the President’s remarks.

He said, “The technical assistance provided by the UN had already culminated in a resolution charging Sri Lanka of war crimes. This resolution 30/1 was adopted by this council without a debate or a vote because it was co-sponsored by a delegate and he did that without the approval of the President or the cabinet. Hence it has no legal base. The USA has withdrawn from this council accusing it as politically biased and hypocritical. Since the US was the main sponsor of 30/1 the co-sponsorship too should be nullified automatically. 

Germany was occupied by UK and USA for years after world war 11. More Germans were killed as prisoners of war after the war than during the war.

Germany still pays reparations to Israel. We saved 300,000 during the war and rehabilitated 12,000 after the war. It’s a pity that Germany and UK of all the countries are now pushing us to implement 30/1.

The US has threatened sanctions against ICC if it persecutes American soldiers. PM Theresa May said she will change the Human Rights laws to protect her soldiers. Our President too thanked our soldiers who defeated terrorism. It implies he rejects the war crimes. Then why 30/1? Many things can be negotiated Mr. President, but sovereignty, never!”
