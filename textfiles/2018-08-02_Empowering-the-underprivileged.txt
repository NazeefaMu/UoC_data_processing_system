Empowering  the underprivileged


	



Treading the path of their founder, Eugene De Mazenod, Oblates now support a scholarship foundation to help the less fortunate to complete their education 

 

Eugene De Mazenod, the young Frenchman of noble birth, who later became the Bishop of Marseilles and Founder of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, paved a path of love for the Oblates to follow and accomplish their missionary work.   

The French Revolution and its aftermath had left the Church in France in a state of sad disarray and devastation. France was a shattered society. It was at this hour of terrible tragedy that Eugene De Mazenod with great courage and confidence founded the Missionaries of Provence in 1816. His ardent desire was to revitalize the Church and bring hope to people living in despair. It was ten years later in 1826 that Pope Leo XII approved the Institute with its constitution and rules conferring on it the name – Congregation of the Missionary of Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI).   

Eugene, though never a missionary himself, was a true missionary in mind and heart, full of zeal and ardour, who could inspire and invigorate others to engage in missionary work. Thus from the beginning, the outlook of the Congregation was missionary and this legacy is carried on by the Oblates, with the same zeal and enthusiasm shown by their founder. Eugene accepted to send his Oblates at the request of Mgr. Bettacchini, who was residing in Jaffna as Pro-vicar and Coadjutor of the Vicar Apostolic of Colombo. The first batch of Oblates with Fr. Etienne Semeria as their Superior, arrived in Ceylon, as Sri Lanka was then known, from France. Eugene De Mazenod loved to refer to this tear drop island in the Indian Ocean, as the most beautiful island in the world and to him and the Oblate missionaries, the most promising mission. The missionaries were involved not only in parochial ministry, but also in administrative and educational activities in the island.   


 

Long history 

A closer look at the history of the Oblates in Sri Lanka reveals how God has been part of the long history and how the mission of Jesus has been at work among the people through the Oblates. The history of the Oblates in Sri Lanka is the story of a group of persons, who have dedicated their lives to the mission of Jesus Christ, by emulating the example and zeal of their founder, St. Eugene. The Oblate missionaries went a long way in sustaining and continuing the great work of Saint Joseph Vaz, the apostle of Ceylon. It is undoubtedly the Oblate congregation that has contributed much to the building up of the Sri Lankan Church.   

Eugene De Mazenod from the day of his ordination had a special concern and love for children and youth. He realized that youth would be the future of the church and the society. This same love and concern of St. Eugene for children and youth has inspired a group of Oblates, Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda, the founder and the Foundation Committee members Rev. Fathers Clement Waidyasekara, Justin Silva, Angelo Wijewickrama, and Ajith Wellington to start the ‘De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation’ with the noble aim of continuing St. Eugene’s love and care for children and youth. The Foundation was inaugurated on 21st May 2016 when the Oblates in Sri Lanka celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Foundation of the Congregation, on the feast day of their beloved founder St. Eugene De Mazenod. This is one way of sharing the joy of the Oblates for the numerous blessings they continue to receive from God. The De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation will be a new sign of missionary activity in Sri Lanka, re-reading and re-energizing the Founder’s initial inspiration “evangelizare pauperibus visit me, paupers evangelizantur.”   


 

De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation

The vision of the “De Mazenod Scholarship Foundation” is to empower the underprivileged children and youth through education.” In view of realising this vision the Foundation decided to partially fund the students who are eligible, but have no financial means to complete their university education; to inculcate in children and youth the values that enable them to transcend religious, social, ethnic and cultural barriers; to enhance the life situation of children and youth to enjoy their self-worth and to be open and available to serve the Sri Lankan society at large; to help children and youth gain necessary skills in leadership and thus being equipped with skills to remain sensitive to people in general and to the poor and the needy in particular.   



It was with great joy and anticipation that the Annual Get-together and presentation of Scholarships to new students was held on 7th July 2018 at the Centre for Society and Religion, Fatima Church, Maradana. Rev. Fr. Angelo Wijewickrama welcomed the invitees, students and parents. Very Rev. Fr. Irwin Moraes, Provincial Supervisor of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, Sri Lanka was the Chief Guest. In his address to the gathering, he thanked Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda and his team for the initiative taken to establish the Foundation. He encouraged the recipients to make use of this opportunity given to them and find fulfillment in their lives, and to remember those in need and assist them when they are able to do so. 

In his address Rev. Fr. Justin Silva expressed his joy and thanked the Oblates for this opportunity of awarding scholarships to undergraduates as it is a permanent commitment to the education and future of our youth. The students should make it their priority to devote themselves to their studies and finish on time. He gave examples of persons worthy of emulation so they would be motivated to pursue their studies well. Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda was not able to be present and he was represented by his Sister, Rev. Sr. Martin de Porres. Thirteen new students were awarded with scholarships bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 38 undergraduates. The vote of thanks was proposed by Rev. Fr. Ajith Wellington.   

All preparatory and related work was handled by Rev. Frs. Ajith Wellington and Justin Silva who together with Rev. Fr. Dennis Iddamalgoda and other Oblates should be lauded for their committed service towards this worthy cause, as they strive to shoulder the enormous responsibility of continuing the mission of Jesus.
