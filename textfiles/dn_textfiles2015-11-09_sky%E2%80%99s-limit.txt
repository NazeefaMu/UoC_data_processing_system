The SKY’S the LIMIT...

Being the only child in the family, her parents allowed her to follow her heart when making important decisions in life. Kishani Alanki Perera went to Colombo International School and studied Law at the University of London. Her mum has always encouraged her and is the biggest strength in her life along with her dad who has always supported her decisions.
She was not acting for about 3 to 4 years because she dedicated that time for her Law Degree but started her acting career again after completing the studies. These days she is appearing in a tele drama called Monara Kadadasi.
She also hosted a popular adventure TV programme called A Team B Team.
With all this and more she is now getting ready to represent Sri Lanka in the Mister and Miss Pancontinental beauty pageant which will be held in Manila Philippines from November 19 to the 30.
T’nC caught up with this beauty with brains for a chit chat.
Q: So Kishani...do tell us how you got to be selected for this upcoming pageant?
A: The national Director Prasanna Pathmanathan was in search of a suitable candidate to represent Sri Lanka for this inaugural pageant.
He had auditioned several potential candidates and finally decided that I was the most suitable for the title and I was surprised when he called me and invited me to represent Sri Lanka for this prestigious pageant as Miss Sri Lanka for Miss Pancontinental.
Q: Have you ever participated in other international pageants?
A: Even though I had been invited to take part in several pageants before, I never took part in any, therefore this happens to be my first ever participation in an international pageant.
I truly feel blessed to have been selected to represent Sri Lanka.
Q: Describe yourself in 3 words.
A: Sensitive, Straightforward and Caring
Q: What is your daily routine?
A: I am not a morning person...but if I have a shoot then I will be awake at 5 am and start my day early. These days I am busy meeting designers who are designing outfits for my pageants and training for the pageant in every aspect.
Q: Three things you can’t do without?
A: My phone, Food and Love.
Q: Top 3 actors/ movies.
A: Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone and Angelina Jolie. Movies - A Walk To Remember, Love Aaj Kaal and Seven Pounds
Q: Motto in life?
A: The Sky is the Limit if you believe in yourself!
Q: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
A: I see myself being a Human Rights Lawyer and working with underprivileged kids. This is why I pursued a degree in law because I felt that it can be used to do something that I have always been passionate about. I work closely with the Foundation of Goodness as one of their ambassadors and I have been fundraising every month for the last two years to raise donations for underprivileged kids in rural areas to obtain a good education. It truly saddened me to learn that there are so many kids in rural areas who walk up to 17km to go to school barefoot. So we assist them by raising donations to buy school bikes and school shoes and encourage them to go to school. I wish to raise more awareness and to help on a larger scale so that more kids can benefit. And well in the next 5 years I think I might see myself being married!
Q: What are your fitness rules?
A: I am honestly one of the laziest people and never really cared much about exercise but I try to stay healthy by taking a walk at least twice a week so that I could stay healthy. But these days I am working out because for the pageant and it has truly motivated me to be a fitter person!
