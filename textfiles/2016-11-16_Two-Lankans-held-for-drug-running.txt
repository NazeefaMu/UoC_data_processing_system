The woman was allegedly concealing something underneath her clothes. On being frisked by the security agencies, she confessed she had an aide, after which a man who was taking another flight to Chennai was also arrested.

On Monday as well, Kolkata Police and NCB arrested two persons — Md Madhu (30) from Uttarpanchannagram, Anandapur, with 520 grams charas.
