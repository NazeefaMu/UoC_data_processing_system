Peace talks that ended in a drunken orgy


	

There is a rumour doing rounds that a discussion held with the aim of re-uniting the splintered Blue party had ended in a drunken orgy with hardly any positive result achieved.



The participants had taken advantage of the occasion to carouse and have a song and dance and by the time the ‘peace talks’ ended, the participants had emptied a good number of Vat 69 bottles, they say. The gulf between the two factions had further widened when the politico who took the initiative to organize the ‘peace talks’ had attacked the pro-yahapalanaya Blue group in public the following day itself saying that they did not want to have anything to do with the latter in future.
