They wonder why she has gone missing!


	

Normally politicos -be they Diyawanna or not -have a hankering to do the honours at opening ceremonies for these are ideal occasions for them to cut a figure. However, a lovely fair Diyawanna member, who was in active politics until recently seems to shun public functions on her home turf these days, they say.


She had either developed many segments of roads in her area, but she had failed to attend any of the functions held to mark their opening and in fact, some roads developed with funds from her budgetary allocation had been opened to traffic informally without any fanfare, they say.


People in the area appreciate the saving of public funds by doing away with formal opening functions, but wonder why the lady has stopped visiting her voters let alone attending public functions in the area, they say.
