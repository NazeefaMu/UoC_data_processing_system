Accessible Cricket where ‘Everybody’ is included

Cricket, like football and rugger, is very much a spectator sport. ICC periodically gives Sri Lanka Cricket a big sum of money for upgrading facilities for spectators at international match venues.
BUT regrettably …. all past leaders of Sri Lanka Cricket, including the ministers for sports, have not found it imperative to invest in establishing toilets, refreshment areas and seating facilities – even in the VIP Boxes – safely to accommodate the country’s largest minority – spectators with restricted mobility, wheelchair users in particular.
Two elders and several wheelchair users have communicated with me to express their grief on being denied their right to come and witness the last test-match innings of our legendary Kumar Sangakkara – for want of accessible and safe facilities.
This situation was worse when cricket’s most prestigious mega-event, the World Cup, came here last. We had nine matches, including a semi-final, and a big sum of money was given well ahead of time by the ICC for upgrading facilities at match venues.
When doing so, highest equal priority should be given to inclusion with safety and dignity of the country’s 20% of the population with restricted mobility.
Here we are talking of near five Million of people includes the growing number of seniors, (over 65 years are fast approaching 18% of our population!), victims of the war, those including the youth living with numerous debilitating medical conditions and the convalescing.
We also have an unaccounted number of permanent users of mobility-aides such as wheelchair, crutches, frames, etc.
Many of these people are young and cricket loving. They are the very people who have the desire and time to come and see a match but they are denied that right.
In fact Participation restrictions with activity limitations are now recognised internationally as a human rights violation issue.
Failure to provide safe and equal access to a facility or equal treatment in a service – that is what we, still, see at sports stadia - constitutes discrimination.
Supreme Court ruling of 27 April 2011
The Supreme Court recognises that: People have different levels of ability to move freely, and that many are restricted in their movement to varying degree.
This Court further recognises that: No person should be discriminated against on the ground of their mobility restriction in a manner which precludes or impedes them from enjoying equally their Inherent Right to Access, safety and accommodation in day-to-day life at public buildings, public places and facilities provided there.
This ruling is mandatory by law for approving building plans and also issuing certificate of conformity. It covers newly constructed, renovated and upgraded facilities at cricket and all sports stadia.
Those holding top positions in cricket and all sports along with the Minister for Sports here must give serious thought to these ever increasing vital segments of our population and comply with the laws of the country.
They must setup the framework to activate immediately this dormant accessibility legislation and ensure this law is effectively implemented in sports that will also then strengthen the rule of law in Sri Lanka.
Real Corporate Social Responsibility
Business giants spend big money to bring live television coverage of these sporting events. Administrators cry that television has deterred the crowds from coming to witness even a test match, an ODI or T20 and thereby drastically reduces the profits each hosting club needs for their survival and the betterment of its players.
But in rugger, football and cricket, we have a commodity with unlimited potential for entertainment and togetherness in an excellent social environment.
A proper investment strategy CAN still reverse this sad trend and thereby optimise the profits.
Accessible Cricket for all concept has been proved a big success in England in particular as a lucrative business opportunity.
But in Sri Lanka it’s still an untapped low cost feasible investment bringing rich dividends.
Even the hospitality boxes and pavilions belonging to reputed business giants who spend big money to promote live telecasts and talk highly about their corporate social responsibility, continue to deny wheelchair users and many seniors, the facilities enjoyed by others in same society.
Even then, there are not even properly designed toilet and restaurant facilities - the most essential two needs during several hours’ stay – that are accessible to those with restricted ability at most reputed sports venues.
Businessmen should embrace human diversity
Many business organisations are readier to offer sympathy and a helping hand than empathy for ENABLING and EMPOWERING. But if these business organisations could as part building their image as a people’s caring company, INVEST 10% of that big ADDITIONAL money they happily spend ‘for few seconds of their TV commercials’ on match days to promote Accessible Cricket for All, those rupees would make sports stadia enabling for the widest possible range of potential spectators, and thereby touching hearts and benefiting thousands of cricket, rugger and football loving spectators.
It would also do tremendous good to the game, the clubs and also the country! That would be REAL Corporate Social Responsibility!!
Accessibility experts – our missing link
‘ABILITY is DIVERSE’. Designing for inclusion of all people is an essential investment and a highly responsible task involving time, effort and money. Hence, authorities undertaking construction should seek expert guidance as to how best to do this right, first time!
Accessibility experts perform a highly specialised job, which is still, under-estimated and unrecognized in Sri Lanka.
They require a good in-depth understanding of intricacies backed by adequate practical experience and thorough working knowledge that goes far beyond than what our university courses on architecture and civil engineering teach.
It is NOT one where standards and specifications can just be read and applied in vital tasks.
Accessible Tourism - An essential investment for Cricket
It is encouraging to know that Sri Lanka Tourism has an ambitious plan to promote tourism here through ‘King Cricket’. Those spectators with restricted mobility forming the largest minority must have the right to accessible accommodation at all hotels and motels in and round sports stadia.
Independent surveys confirm that it is the senior sports loving public from the West, Australia and UAE who have the time, big purchasing power, spending capacity, and the inclination to travel out of season and not be perturbed by unwarranted fears. But they find difficulty here in identifying essential facilities –including toilets – even at our star-hotels and guest houses that cater for their ‘reduced ability’ needs.
This needs to change – and change soon – in the interests of all people and of the economy. It should soon be an ‘implemented policy’ of Sri Lanka that no sports stadia or hotels should be allowed to waste our limited assets with ‘man building more physical barriers to man’. Justice delayed is justice denied and, in this case, loss of profits and the country’s good name too!
