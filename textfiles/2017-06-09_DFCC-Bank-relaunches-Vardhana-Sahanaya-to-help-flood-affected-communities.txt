DFCC Bank has relaunched Vardhana Sahanaya to help the people affected by the recent natural disaster to rebuild their lives in the aftermath. 
The Sahanaya loan scheme was launched to provide relief for those affected by floods and fire in 2016 and has been extended by the bank once again to help the families tide over the present crisis in the country. 
The loans offered include personal, housing, education and business loans. Going beyond providing short-term relief, the bank is focusing its efforts on facilitating a long-term rebuilding initiative by providing individuals and enterprises affected by the floods with low-cost personal and business loans.
Individual salaried earners who have been affected by the floods will be eligible for personal loans to rebuild their damaged properties. They can also obtain loans for the purchase of school books and other educational material that were lost in the floods. DFCC will also provide loans to affected businesses for the replacement of damaged assets and working capital. All these loans will be granted at very concessionary interest rates with easy payment terms.
In addition, the public can make use of the government credit lines such as SwaShakthi, Jaya Isura, Ran Aswenna, Govi Navoda, Rivi Bala Savi and small and medium sized enterprises line of credit at concessionary rates, which will be facilitated by the bank.
