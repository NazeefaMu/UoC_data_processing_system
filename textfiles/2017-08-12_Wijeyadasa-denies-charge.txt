Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday denied allegations that he had breached the collective responsibility of the Cabinet by criticizing a decision taken by it.  

The minister was recently criticized by several ministers over a statement he made with regard to regaining of the Hambantota Port.   
The minister said it was not a criticism but a comment made to retrieve a national asset.   
“The Cabinet decision was to lease out the Hambantota Port and I didn’t challenge or criticize it. 
I simply mentioned a way to secure a national asset legally when the time comes,” he said. The minister said, as someone who always stood by the country, he was able to intervene and help the government to regain the Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Insurance Company and the Apollo Hospital in Colombo which is now renamed as Lanka Hospital on previous occasions.   
He also said it seemed that there was no collective responsibility in the Cabinet anymore.   
“It was only last week the Cabinet approved the 20th Amendment to the Constitution but this week SLFP Ministers upon meeting the President said that they would go against the decision. Is this maintaining the collective responsibility? There are a variety of opinions expressed in a unity government.” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
