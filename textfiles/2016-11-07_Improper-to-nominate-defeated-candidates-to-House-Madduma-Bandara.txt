Improper to nominate defeated candidates to House: Madduma Bandara


	

Public Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said Sri Lanka is plagued with a bizarre political situation where even defeated candidates could enter Parliament and that he was opposed to such as these taking place.

He expressed these views at a function held to launch road construction work in Moneragala.

Minister Bandara was apparently taking a swipe at Irrigation Minister Gamini Vijith Wijeyamuni Zoysa who was defeated at the election but nominated as an MP on the national list.

“This is not good for the country. Mr. Zoysa entered Parliament under the bizarre political situation that prevails here. Making matters worse he was even appointed Irrigation Minister and is now planning to develop the Katugalla Weva. It is a good move. It is a task left undone for the past 20 years. Although the tank is being constructed under our government, Mr. Zoysa has given it a political colouring. This is a UNP government. MPs like Mr. Zoysa were able to become ministers because UNPers elected President Maithripala Sirisena to office,” Mr. Bandara said.

He said this government could not be toppled before it completes its full term. (KB)
