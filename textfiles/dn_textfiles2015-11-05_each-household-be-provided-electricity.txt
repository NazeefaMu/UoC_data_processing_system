'Each household to be provided with electricity'

A rapid programme would be carried out to provide every household with electricity without taking into consideration house ownership, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said it was identified that around 200,000 families are lagging behind in getting electricity connections due to financial difficulties. Therefore, a joint programme would be carried out by the Power and Energy Ministry and the Social Empowerment and Welfare Ministry to assist those householders who were financially in difficulty in obtaining electricity connections.
"It was reported that due to financial difficulties the 200,000 house owners have not got their electricity connections even though the national grid is available nearby," he said.
Considering this situation, a soft loan of Rs. 40,000 would be granted to those families so that they could obtain their electricity connections. The loan installment could be settled with the monthly electricity bill, he said.
The minister said those people who were unable prove their house ownership could be able to get their electricity connections unlike other days.
"It is significant that temporary houses such as cadjan or Iluk thatched houses are also provided with electricity connections now using especial safety and precautionary measures," Minister Siyambalapitiya said.
