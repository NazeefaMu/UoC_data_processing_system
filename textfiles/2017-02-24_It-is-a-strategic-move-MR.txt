MP Wimal Weerawansa’s request that five members of the National Freedom Front (NFF) would function separately in Parliament was a strategy, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.

Addressing the media at the launch of the National Assets Protection Centre, Mr. Rajapaksa said members of the NFF would remain as members of the joint opposition even though they would no longer be a part of the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).

“At a point we all will get together. We are working according to a certain plan. We cannot reveal those tactics in public,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
