National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa, who was remanded yesterday on charges of misusing 40 state vehicles, has requested permission from Prison Authorities to get all three meals from his home.

Prison sources said declining food provided by the Prisons Department and bringing them from outside was a privilege for any prisoner.

“As such, the approval was given to bring food from outside for MP Weerawansa,” they said.
