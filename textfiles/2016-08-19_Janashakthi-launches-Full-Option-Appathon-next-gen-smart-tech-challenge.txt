Janashakthi Insurance PLC, a leading innovator in the insurance industry, launched its latest campaign to capture the innovative minds of today’s youth – the ‘Janashakthi Full Option Appathon’, the next-gen smart tech challenge. 


The team-based challenge will have the nation’s youth competing for the Rs.1 million prize by proposing and developing apps that add value to the lives of the public. The inaugural theme for the challenge is ‘Solutions to issues caused by traffic’.


Powered by the world-renowned Google Developer Group (GDG), the Janashakthi Full Option Appathon challenge is aimed at encouraging Sri Lankan youth to challenge their creativity and practical thinking skills, as well as use their skills in app development towards providing innovative solutions for issues faced by the public.


Based on submitted proposals, the challenge will see teams go through several stages prior to being shortlisted for the final selection. In order to empower the teams to excel in their projects, Janashakthi will further conduct workshops led by experts from the IT field, who will provide the necessary guidance and mentorship required by the participants during the entire process. “At Janashakthi, we believe that innovation is the way forward and holds great potential to pave the way to an extraordinary future. It is therefore with great excitement that we launch the Janashakthi Full Option Appathon challenge for the young masterminds of Sri Lanka. We believe that this platform will help empower the youth of our nation to discover the unlimited potential of merging their innovative and technological skills to offer solutions for the benefit of the public. 
The Janashakthi Full Option Appathon challenge is a continuation of our journey of innovation where we strive to help craft a new generation of innovators by fuelling young minds to seek solutions where others simply see problems,” said Janashakthi Insurance PLC Chief Executive Officer 


Jude Fernando.
“We look forward to the many brilliant proposals that will help reveal the infinite possibilities that await us when technology and innovation are combined to open new doors,” he concluded. 
The Janashakthi Full Option Appathon challenge was launched at Majestic City, Colombo with the novel use of a flash mob for the entertainment of bystanders. The proceedings then continued on to include an informal panel discussion featuring representatives from both Janashakthi 
and GDG.


Innovation has been the cornerstone of Janashakthi since the very inception. The insurance provider has introduced many innovative and effective product solutions that have helped enhance the quality of its customers’ lives in a progressive journey of over two decades in Sri Lanka. 


Janashakthi Full Option was significantly the first to offer instalment-based motor premium payments, ‘Safety Net’, a high-technology vehicle tracking security system, ‘Vehicle Emergency Roadside Assistance’ service, ‘Full Option Locator’ mobile app and ‘Easy Claim’, a service that enables customers to claim payments through ATMs.
