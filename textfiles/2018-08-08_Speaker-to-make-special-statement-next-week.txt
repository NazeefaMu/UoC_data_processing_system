Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had informed the leaders of political parties represented in Parliament that he will make a special statement on the Opposition Leader’s post when Parliament meets next week.

He had also said issues such as the allocation of speaking time to the joint opposition and also matters on appointing its members to various committees would also be looked into.

Speaker Jayasuriya had given the same assurance to the joint opposition when they raised the issue of the Leader of Opposition earlier during the sessions. He informed the members that he will have to obtain legal advice on the matter.

“It is my duty to obtain the opinion of all the party leader’s before appointing MPs to any post in the House,” the Speaker said. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
