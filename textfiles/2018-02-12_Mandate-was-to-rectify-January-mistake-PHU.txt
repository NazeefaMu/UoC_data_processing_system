Mandate was to rectify January 8 mistake: PHU


	

The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) today said the people have voted for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the Local Government election to rectify the mistakes they have made on January 8 Presidential election.

Addressing a news briefing, PHU Leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said the people’s mandate, which was given to the SLPP, was not a mandate given to deliver the promises made on January 8 when President Maithripala Sirisena assumed duties.

He said if the people wanted to get the January 8 promises fulfilled, they should have voted for the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP).

"Ministers and even NGOs who analyse this election results say people have gathered around the lotus bud because the government has failed to deliver its promises given on January 8. This is an illogical statement. If people are disappointed and wanted to get those promises fulfilled, they should have voted for the JVP which stands for that mandate. Our mandate is not the January 8 mandate," he said.

He said people have rejected the United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) along with the JVP by gathering around the lotus bud.

The MP said the people rejected the attempts made to divide the country, sign the ETCA and sell national assets to foreign countries. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
