Police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said today that the police had used minimal force to disperse the students who had protested aggressively on the main road.
Commenting on today's incident at the Town Hall in Colombo 7, where a clash broke out during a protest march organised by the Inter Higher National Diploma in Accountancy Conservation Students' Unity, he said the police had used the least possible force -- using batons to disperse the protesting students.
“Police can use minimum force to disperse an illegal gathering or any demonstration which disturbs the peace. First they use batons, and if they still can't control the situation they can use tear gas or water cannon,” he said.
Hundreds of students took part in the protest, which lasted for hours, urging the authorities to reintroduce the degree equivalent to the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy.
The anti riot squad, which was called in, used water cannon and tear gas on the students as they attempted to forcibly enter the University Grants Commission building.
ASP Gunasekara said if anyone was injured, he or she could resort to legal action.
Thirty nine university students were arrested, and seven persons, including a policeman, were injured during the clash. Police said two monks and five female students were among those arrested. They were to be produced in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court tomorrow.(Darshana Sanjeewa and Chathuranga Pradeep)
