	It is a normal thing for the VIPs to spend their vacation in Nuwara Eliya. Recently a former Ministerial one hailing from a prominent family in Kalutara area booked a suite in a leading hotel in Nuwara Eliya in his name.

The hotel employees who were looking forward to the arrival of the VIP of the former regime, were surprised when a young beautiful cinema actress checked into the hotel suite instead of the VIP.
A beautiful cinema actress moving into a hotel suite booked by a former Ministerial one provided an interesting topic for the gossip-loving hotel employees.
One employee had told another in a whisper that even a special train has been named after this actress. Meanwhile, an elderly employee who had long served at this grand hotel had warned the gossipy juniors to mind their business. “The Mahattaya who booked the suite too will soon check in. You, employees mind your business and let hotel guests mind their business,” he told them.
