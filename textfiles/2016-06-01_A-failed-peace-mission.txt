A failed peace mission


	



 

The Northern chief purohita and his party chief from Trinco who happens to be the occupant of the main chair in the official opposition   continue to be at loggerheads, they say.

 


The twosome had been on a course of conflict for some time. Their strained relations had taken a turn for the worse following reported moves by the opposition bigwig to install a prominent lawyer – a new comer to Diyawanna, in a key office in the opposition. 


As this feud between the two most prominent figures in the main political party based in the North had come out into the open posing a threat to the unity of the party, a diplomat from a powerful neighboring country had come forward to play peace maker. 


The diplomat had first held talks with the opposition bigwig with a view to working out a formula for peace and had later called on the chief purohita to present the formula to him.


However, the chief purohita had reacted with anger to the proposed peace formula. “This lawyer whom our party leader wants to elevate to high office in the opposition was once my understudy. How can I play second fiddle to him?” he had demanded angrily.


So the diplomat on the goodwill mission had to return empty-handed.
