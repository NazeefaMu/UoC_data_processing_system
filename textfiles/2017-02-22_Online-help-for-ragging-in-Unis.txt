The UGC said in a statement said that any member of the University Community could lodge a complaint regarding incidents of ragging, harassment, intimidation and bullying by accessing the link from the UGC web site ugc.ac.Ik/rag securely and confidentially.

When the complaint was lodged, the relevant authorities such as the Vice-Chancellor and Student Counselors would be alerted by the UGC.

“The UGC has given instructions to the authorities in Universities to investigate and support the victims/complainant from the moment a complaint is lodged. The Universities will provide support in the form of counseling, ensuring safety and protection, and support with continuing education or work,” the statement added.
