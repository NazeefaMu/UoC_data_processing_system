When Arjuna Mahendran was the Governor of the Central Bank, he had transferred 500 members of the bank's staff, including some senior officers and heads of departments, in year 2015 alone, an official said.

Assistant Governor and Secretary of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, H.A. Karunaratne told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds, on Thursday, that it was the first time in the bank’s history that so many transfers had been made within one year.

He said about 200 transfers usually took place during a year. He said that in 2015 alone, some 34 officers in 30 departments had been transferred by Mr. Mahendran.

He said that the transfers were unnecessary and the bank's staff were displeased about the transfers. “Due to these transfers some departmental heads met Mr. Mahendran to discuss the matter,” he said. (Manopriya Gunasekera and Ranjan Katugampola)
