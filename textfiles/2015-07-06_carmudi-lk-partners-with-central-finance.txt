Sri Lanka’s online car classifieds website Carmudi.lk joins Central Finance Company PLC,  enabling their customers to enjoy a discount of up to Rs. 25,000 when leasing a vehicle advertised on Carmudi.lk. 
A buyer who intends to purchase a car found on Carmudi through financing can immediately sign up for a discount voucher, which is valid for six months, through the website. The discount voucher can be utilised on any new lease obtained through Central Finance Co PLC and it can be utilised to pay the initial charges of the facility.

The company offers a range of services designed to fit the rising needs of customers including asset leasing, savings and deposits, contract hire, fleet management, insurance broking, micro finance and SME lending.
