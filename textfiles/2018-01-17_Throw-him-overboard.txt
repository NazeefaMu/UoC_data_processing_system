“Throw him overboard”


	



 

A group of about 10 Green backbenchers who rendezvoused in a hotel in a city suburb discussed ways and means of minimizing the political damage that the party had to suffer from the fallout from the bond affair. 

 


A bigwig holding a deputy post in the party who had to step down from high office figured prominently in their discussion and it was their consensus that it was high time for the party to throw overboard the big man now a big liability to the party. They finally decided to take up the urgent issue with the party leadership.


The names of several party high-ups hailing from Colombo, Kandy and Moneragala districts too were mentioned at this discussion as ideal choices for the deputy posts in the party, 
they say.
