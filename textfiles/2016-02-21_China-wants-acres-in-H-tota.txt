China had requested for a 1000 acre block of land in Hambantota to set up an investment zone, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.

He said more Chinese investments were coming in to Sri Lanka.

“A Chinese company is interested in starting a ship building project in Hambantota as well,” he said.

While citing that the Andhra Pradesh State Government had given a 10,000 acre block of land to China, he said Sri Lanka would lose investors if it misses opportunities.(Yohan Perera)
