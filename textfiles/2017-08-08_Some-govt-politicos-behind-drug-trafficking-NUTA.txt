Some govt. politicos behind drug trafficking: NUTA


	

The National University Teachers Association (NUTA) said there was public perception that some government politicians were behind drug trafficking and requested President Maithripala Sirisena to implement the law against wrongdoers irrespective of their status.

NUTA General Secretary Channa Jayasumana, in his letter to the President, said he had been informed that students were addicted to drugs such as heroin, ganja and hashish.

He said it appeared that those, peddling such drugs, escaped the long arm of the law and that though drugs were discovered in large quantities in sugar containers bound for Lanka Sathosa no action had been taken to punish those responsible.

Dr. Jayasumana said people were under the impression that drug trafficking took place with the blessings of Cabinet Ministers.

“This will negatively impact on the principles of good governance,” he said in his letter. (KB)
