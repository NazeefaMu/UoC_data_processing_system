Last chance to grab tickets for Ricky Bahar and the Legacy NYE party

The iconic Galle Face Hotel has lined up grand New Year celebrations with top entertainers to ring in 2016. As the preferred venue for the crème de la crème of revelers to bring in the New Year, the hotel has pulled out all stops to deliver an entertainment fiesta that will surpass anything done so far.
The two high profile bands performing at the GFH are Ricky Bahar and Legacy and Mintaka, easily the two most popular bands in the country, who will grace the portals of the heritage structure of the Galle Face Hotel.
Ricky Bahar and Legacy, the big ticket show at the Grand Ballroom of the Galle Face Hotel, offers the last few tickets for discerning party goers. Ricky Bahar and his band Legacy are committed to playing a mix of modern and golden oldie hit songs that will appeal to a wide cross-section of party goers. The brilliant musician and entertainer has earned landmark accolades throughout his extraordinary music career.
NYE revellers can avail of several offers for the Ricky Bahar show, with HSBC cardholders being offered the chance to purchase 8 tickets for the price of 6. The bar at the Grand Ballroom will be open throughout the night with unlimited access to spirits with no additional charge.
Moreover, children between 6 to 12 years of age will get a 50% discount on the ticket.
Mintaka will perform at the Chequerboard and the Verandha, with tickets for the show already sold out. Led by dynamic musician Chris Dhason, Mintaka promises non-stop entertaining music to keep revelers rocking into the wee hours of the morning. Playing Feel Good music, Mintaka will serve up classic hits from various musical legends.
The majestic Galle Face Hotel has built up a reputation for providing the most spectacular New Year Balls over the decades.
This New Year’s at the Galle Face Hotel will be even more memorable because the hotel has finally completed its massive restoration project.
