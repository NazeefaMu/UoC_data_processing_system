Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said yesterday steps would be taken to provide Wifi facilities at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) within three months.

Responding to JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake, who said Wi-Fi facility at the BIA was very poor, the minister told parliament that he was not aware of such a situation and that he had instructed the officials to provide the facility within three months.

The MP said even the world's poorest airport was equipped with Wi-Fi facilities whereas in Sri Lanka, passengers had to wait in long queues to get the boarding pass scanned to obtain the password.

The minister said the Wi-Fi facility was available at two points at the arrival and departure lounges and admitted it was not sufficient. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
