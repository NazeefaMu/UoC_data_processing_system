JVP wants LG polls under existing electoral system

The Janatha VimukthiPeramuna (JVP) yesterday called on the government to hold the Local Government (LG) polls without delay under the existing electoral system.
JVP General Secretary Tilvyn Silva told the media that the LG polls were being delayed due to issues within the two main political parties.
He said the government had no right to postpone polls due to internal political issues and said that many issues has been created due to the lack of political representation at the grassroots level.
Silva said that the special commissioners appointed to oversee the LG bodies of which terms have lapsed did not have much contact with the grassroots level and as a result people inthe villages did not have any political representation to present their issues.
He said that the formulation of a new electoral system and the delimitation process should be done in a very transparent and justifiable manner so as not to cause any injustice to any party. He said that this cannot be done in a hurry. Silva said that the JVP will continue to pressurize the government to hold the LG polls before next April under the existing system. He also stated that the JVP's view on electoral system was not based on its political preferences.
Commenting on constitutional reforms, the JVP General Secretary said the JVP would engage in the process by presenting his party's proposals to the Constitutional Assembly.
"There are commissioners overlooking some Local Government bodies. They are not close to people at the grassroots level. As a result, they fail to address problems in their areas. This situation is exacerbating the present crisis," he said.
