Mount Lavinia Hotel partners with CMF once again

Mount Lavinia Hotel is the chosen venue once again for the 27th Country Roads concert organised by the Country Music Foundation. Riding on the success of the show last year, the organisers are keen on staging one of the best country music concerts of the year.
"We are pleased to join CMF as venue sponsors for one of South Asia's longest running musical events for children. Throughout the years, the funds from Country Roads has brightened the lives of many a child and we are obviously proud to be part of it. Our Team is dedicated in going into detail to re-create the ambiance befitting the concert," Mount Lavinia Hotel Resident Manager Harinda Weerasinghe stated.
MLH, the ideal venue with its old-world charm will be transformed into the rustic country ranch atmosphere complete with stabled horses, old Western tavern-like bars, and cowboy outfits.
In addition, the hotel will also be home to two of the main performers, the German group the Mavericks and British country singer Astrid Brook, throughout their stay in Sri Lanka.

The signature event would be the exclusive charity dinner hosted by Country Music Foundation and Mount Lavinia Hotel on the preceding night where guests will be entertained by some of the performers over dinner as they share their passion for country music and their contribution to the betterment of children through their association with CMF.
"The Mount Lavinia hotel with its old world charm and spacious ballroom is our home for the third time. What makes the hotel on the hill an excellent venue is its team striving to make every country show better than the previous one and, once again this year, working in sync with the Country Roads team to make the show memorable", Country Music Foundation President and Co-founder Feizal Samath stated.
Organised by the Country Music Foundation, the Country Roads concert series has, to date, raised several million rupees for Sri Lanka's needy children. From mother and child friendly initiatives related to clean water, dengue prevention (mosquito nets) and plantation workers, to funding libraries, schools and child-friendly courts, this concert series has passed on all its proceeds to many child-related causes over its 27 years. Tickets are available at Mount Lavinia Hotel.
