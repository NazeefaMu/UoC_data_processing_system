The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) has launched an investigation into the fire erupted at the Pepiliyana, Boralesgamuwa ‘Fashion Bug’ store on Saturday night.

Colombo Crime Division Director, SP Nishantha de Soysa yesterday told the Daily Mirror that a special team has been appointed for the investigation based on the complaint lodged by the textile store owners with the Boralesgamuwa Police.

He said that they would start recording statements from relevant parties and the CCTV footage would be used to investigate the cause of the fire.

He said they are awaiting reports from the Government Analyst and Electrical Engineers who observed the store after the fire.

The fire had apparently destroyed the entire textile warehouse, but the cause of fire and the extent of damage were not yet known. The fire was doused by the fire brigade.

Meanwhile, Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan and Former Provincial Councillor Azath Salley visited the site after the fire broke out. (Piyumi Fonseka)
