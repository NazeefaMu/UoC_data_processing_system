A compensation payment plan is currently underway to pay depositors of the Golden Key Credit Card Company. 
This plan was initiated following a request made by representatives of the Golden Key Depositors’ Association and Golden Key All Depositors’ Association, to President Maithreepala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Ravi Karunanayake, Minister of Finance, to interfere in this matter and extend the support of the government in working out a solution.
Measures were taken to resolve the issue by recovering and paying money back to the depositors, and consequently the repayment process has been conducted since 2009. 
Accordingly, the depositors were paid under four phases. A total of Rs. 791 million was paid to 8,052 depositors under phase one, while Rs. 685 million was  paid to 7,036 depositors under phase two. Phase three saw the payment of RS. 574 million to 5,777 depositors, while under phase four, which was concluded last January, Rs.11 million were distributed among 457 depositors who had made investments of less than Rs. 1 million.
 
However, following the fourth phase, the payment plan was halted due to Supreme Court orders pertaining to the Golden Key Credit Card Company case, and the Company faced legal restrictions in liquefying its assets, in order to attain the necessary finances to pay the depositors.
“Due to legal restrictions, after January, Golden Key did not have funds to pay the depositors, and the depositors too were facing numerous economic hardships. Taking this into account, representatives of the two associations met the President, Prime Minister and Minister Ravi Karunanayake and requested them to interfere in the matter and provide a solution. Then under the instructions of the President and the Prime Minister, Minister Ravi Karunanayake got involved. His efforts regarding the solving this issue should be greatly appreciated as he was very keen on resolving this issue immediately,” said Dushanthi Hapugoda, President of the Golden Key All Depositors’ Association and Director, Golden Key Credit Card Company.
Accordingly, under Minister Ravi Karunanayake’s instructions, the Treasury and the Central Bank will be providing funds worth of Rs. 8.5 billion to the Company to settle the payments to depositors. Hence, the payment plan was resumed from July 24th where the rest of the depositors will be paid back in groups. As such a portion of 41 percent from their total deposit will be paid under this plan. 
The first group of depositors, which included people who had made investments less than two million are to be paid within one month starting from the date of resumption and the Treasury has provided 544 million rupees to settle these payments. Depositors who deposited funds from two to 10 million rupees will be paid in two months and the depositors whose deposits exceeded 10 million rupees will be paid in a year.
Wasantha Gunathilake, President of the Golden Key Depositors’ Association and Director of Golden Key Credit Card Company opined that this solution, which is a significant achievement in terms of getting justice for depositors, was a result of not giving up the fight for justice.
