On Aug 7 the Police’s Counter Terrorism Special Branch launched an operation in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur which led to the arrest of a male Sri Lankan citizen. The 37-year-old is suspected to be a senior member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) terrorist group who entered Malaysia in December 2012 with a Social Visit Pass.
Early investigations found that the suspect had made Malaysia his hiding place and was extorting Sri Lankans in Malaysia to raise funds to revive the LTTE struggle in Sri Lanka. From interrogations, he had confessed to having been involved in a credit card fraud syndicate in Malaysia which was masterminded by other foreign nationals.
The suspect was arrested under Section 15 (1) (C) of the Immigration Act 1959/63 for exceeding his stay in Malaysia more than the period allowed by the Social Visit Pass. “He was deported to his home country on August 14 for further actions by the ruling power of Sri Lanka,” said Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar in a statement today.
