Some of the international NGOs, which suspended their operations in Sri Lanka are reported to have decided to start operations again under the new government.

Among them is the Friedrich Naumann Foundation (FNF), an organisation committed to the promotion of liberal politics including the empowerment of politicians, will be relaunched soon.

German Ambassador Dr. Jürgen Morhard, in an interview with Daily Mirror, said his country had submitted several proposals for cooperation.

The FNF said there were also others exploring the possibility of relaunching their activities in Sri Lanka.

“The political foundations have a multitude of expertise to assist in capacity building and political culture reformation,” the Ambassador said. (Kelum Bandara)
