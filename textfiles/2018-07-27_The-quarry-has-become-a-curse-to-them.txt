A metal quarry located in an area of an ancient kingdom fame is posing a serious hazard to the residents in the locality, they say.

 


Stones hurled out by rock blasts while being a serious threat to life often damage the walls and the tiled roofs of houses around the quarry. 


Whenever the tiles of a roof are damaged by flying stones from the quarry, the owner of the quarry, a kinsman of a powerful politico would offer to buy the affected householder roofing sheets, they say.


Residents also complain that blasting is being done with no regard for the legal limits on noise and vibration produced.


People in the area had complained to the powerful politico about the quarry that has become a curse to them during his visits to the area. He had promised on all such occasions to consider their problem, but there is no indication that he has taken their representations seriously, they say.
