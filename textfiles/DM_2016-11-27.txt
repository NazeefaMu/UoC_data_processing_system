Castro struggled for freedom: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today that though the United National Party (UNP) followed a line of policies that was different from the one that followed by Fidel Castro, his policies were hailed world over.
The former President of Cuba passed away on Friday at the age of 90.
Issuing a condolence message the Prime Minister stated the former Cuban leader was in the forefront among personalities prominent during the 20th century.
Mr. Wickremesinghe observed that Sri Lanka had a lot to learn from his revolutionary planning and reforms in the fields of housing, education and health.
The Prime Minister reminisced the close personal relationship that existed between the leader of the Cuban revolution and the former Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene and recalled that Mr.Jayewardene sent a collection of best Sri Lankan teas to the Cuban leader every month, which in turn sent a box of precious Havana cigars to Mr. Jayewardene.
I recollect with gratitude the contribution Castro made during the Angolan liberation struggle and the South African freedom struggle, while praising his support to Sri Lanka at the international level, maintaining diplomatic relationship with Sri Lanka since 1959, the Prime Minister stated.

India's neighbours struggle after shock currency move
	
India's surprise move to get scrap 500 and 1,000 rupee notes to target hidden stashes of "black money" has affected the country's immediate neighbours, which all have long-standing trade, tourism and family links.
Sri Lankans living in India says they are facing serious difficulties as a result of the sudden decision by the Indian government.
A PhD student who declined to give her name said the announcement came while she was visiting Sri Lanka on holiday.
"When I came to Sri Lanka, I brought some Indian rupees with me. As I have an Indian visa for valid for 4 years, I was not shocked as I thought I would be able to go to State Bank of India in Colombo with my 500 rupee notes," she said.
"But they were quite rude and told me only dollar notes could be exchanged outside India. They also refused to offer me any advice."
Sri Lankan diplomats have also told BBC Sinhala that the cash crisis has left hundreds of Buddhist pilgrims stranded in India. Without access to cash, they are finding it difficult to continue their journeys or return home, the diplomat said.
Poor families normally take part in these pilgrimages, sometimes even pawning their jewellery or other valuables to make the trip.
More than one million Bangladeshis visit India every year for medical, tourism and business purposes.
Many Bangladeshis, especially businessmen, visit as often as two or three times a month. Being businessmen, they tend to carry wads of high-value Indian notes on their trips.
Since the new rules have come into effect, Bangladeshis have been trying to exchange their unusable currency, but money-changers have refused to take them.
There is a lot of informal trade in goods between Bangladeshi and Indian businesspeople, and they exchange money at the border without bothering with documentation.
Farmers in eastern Nepal say the volume of their agricultural exports to India have decreased by almost 90% since the Indian currency move.
The unsold products are being dumped in warehouses and even along main roads.
About 98% of cardamom and more than 70% of tea and ginger produced in Nepal are bought by Indian businessmen from across the border.
In Pakistan, currency dealers are estimated to hold more than 150 million rupees ($2.2m) worth of Indian currency. After the government's move on the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, this stash is being traded for about a quarter of its value, they say.
The general secretary of the Pakistan Exchange Companies Association says Pakistani citizens hold Indian currency - sometimes in large amounts - because they travel there for family reasons.
"Not enough time was given to people outside India to exchange money," Zafar Paracha said. "It was very sudden."
Pakistan has also denied that counterfeit Indian currency is being produced in Karachi and Peshawar. Targeting counterfeit cash is thought to be another reason for India's unexpected move.(BBC)

Penal Code Amendments to keep kids out of punishment
	
No action would be considered an offence punishable under the Penal Code if it was committed by a child younger than 12-years old according a new amendment in the Penal Code tabled in Parliament last week.
However, the court still can decide to proceed with action under the Penal Code basing on the childs maturity, according to the amendment.
The Bill identifies how legal proceedings would be initiated and maintained in compliance with international standards as regards children.
The Bill provides that as regards a child, above 12 years and under 14 years, it is accepted that it is appropriate to confer discretion on a Magistrate to determine as to whether such child has the required degree of cognitive maturity to form the requisite intent or to entertain requisite knowledge, which serves as the mens rea (The intention or knowledge of wrongdoing that constitutes part of a crime, as opposed to the action or conduct of the accused) of the impugned offence committed by the relevant child.
The Amendment is to be sent to the Cabinet for approval. (Yohan Perera)

Ranil: Trumps entry not end to US domination
	
Outlining Sri Lankas foreign policy in the wake of new global situation, the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday said the election of Donald Trump as the USs new President would not be the end of the USAs aim of dominating the world.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made this point at the graduation ceremony of Bandaranaike Centre for International studies on Thursday.
The elected of new President in USA is to have a re-look at the foreign policy. It might challenge the belief of orthodox members of US foreign policy, how to deal with Russia, North American neighbors and how do you deal with free trade.
It was a revolt against the establishment. Trump would not have got there if not for his new vision. Even if he does not implement everything he promised, there would be a reassessment of US rule, he said.
Certainly I dont think it will be the end of the USs aim of dominating the world, he stated and added what we see was the end of post-cold war order.
"Simply because for 70 years the policies followed by the West to give independence to the Asian nations, promoting their own models in these countries, General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT) and World Trade Organization (WTO), the alliances USA had with Japan and East Asian and South East Asian nations, strategic understanding with China resulted in a boom in the Asian economies and they were able to withstand the 2008 global financial crisis, he said.
I would say this is a significant moment to the whole world. There is a question as to what will happen to the Western world, which controlled the world for so many years. The United States of America led the Western powers to challenge the Soviet Union, with the long term objective of ensuring global peace and ensuring there is no rivalry to the Western Powers," he stated.
They had the Cold war, first and at the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Easton block, the post cold war period. A question is being asked after results of the Referendum in UK and the election of Donald Trump whether this is the end of the Western domination in the global order, the Prime Minister said.
"Certainly some fear the coming of the isolation of USA and inward UK. Currently the UK is looking to play a new role in the world to adopt themselves to the world having left the single market.
I dont think anyone had studied the consequences of leaving the single market. Therefore it is a new game for the UK and the rest of Europe, he added.
He said there was also emergence of China to demarcate a role for itself, and becoming a rival for USA as the Soviet Union did.
With the strategic understanding with US it will re-design its role in Asia. The question that is to be asked is what will happen to Trans-Pacific Partnerships (TPP). With the deleted response from Obama administration of how to have Asian allies together and give them market access on those determined by USA it will be favorable to US businessmen. This was the core of Trumps campaign whether right or wrong, which featured loss of jobs in Mexico and Asia, he also said.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said that Sri Lanka would work towards bringing Asia together, while working with the West, China, India and Japan. (Yohan Perera)
