Prez perturbed over CDS arrest move


	

President Maithripala Sirisena who hurriedly summoned a special Cabinet meeting today criticized the move to arrest high profile military officers even without initiating court action against them.

The President summoned this meeting in the event of moves by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to record a statement from Chief of Defence Staff Ravindra Wijegunaratne over the incident in which 11 students were abducted during the war time. He was asked to give a statement to the CID last Monday. However, he had gone to Mexico the same day. Also the CID had informed court earlier that they would arrest the CDS. .

The President is reported to have said that it is unbecoming of those concerned to harass the officers of the military top brass in this manner even before initiating court action. Also, the President took swipe at Minister Sarath Fonseka for criticizing Army Commander Mahesh Senanayake and speaking about defence matters. (Kelum Bandara)
