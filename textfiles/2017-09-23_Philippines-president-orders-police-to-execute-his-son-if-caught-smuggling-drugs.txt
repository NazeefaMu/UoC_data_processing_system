Philippines, (Daily Mail), 21 September 2017   -Rodrigo Duterte has ordered police to carry out the standard procedures of his controversial war on drugs campaign even if his son is found guilty of criminal activities.  


The Philippines president sparked international criticism for his strong anti-drugs stance, that has seen more than 9,000 civilians killed for links to drug dealing and use.  


His eldest son, Paolo, has been accused as being a member of a Chinese organised crime syndicate and allegedly overseeing a drug-smuggling and drug lord protection scheme.  


‘My orders are to kill you if you are caught, and I will protect the police who kill you,’ Mr Duterte said he told his 42-year-old son.Paolo faced the Philippines Senate earlier this month accused of being involved with the triad gang, allegations he described as ‘baseless’ and founded upon ‘rumours’.  


He allegedly helped facilitate more than a tonne of ice being shipped into the country which has been ravaged by abuse and addiction. During the hearing, he was asked by opposition Senator Antonio Trillane to remove his shirt and display a large tattoo on his back that allegedly proved he was a member of a Chinese faction.  


Paolo acknowledged he has a tattoo on his back but refused to remove his shirt and show the hearing.   


Duterte says he wants police to carry out normal procedures should his son be found guilty.
