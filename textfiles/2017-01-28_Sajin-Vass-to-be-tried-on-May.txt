Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Attigalle also extended Mr. Gunawardena's travel till that date.

Investigations had revealed that he had entered into a three-year contract with the Singaporean Company -- PPL Inter Private Limited in September 2015 -- for the supply of ground handling equipment to the airline.

Mr. Gunawardena who was the then CEO, was not only liable for violating tender procedures when seeking the services of the foreign company, but had also disregarded the bids from three other companies which were prepared to supply such equipment.
