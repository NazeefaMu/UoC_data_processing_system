Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday told Parliament that it was American business magnate George Soros who had conducted the recently concluded economic forum in Colombo.

He said Mr. Soros had invited him to participate in the Forum.

“The Government did not invite Mr. Soros for the economic forum in Colombo and neither did was it funded by the Government, it was Mr. Soros who came to Sri Lanka and conducted the forum and invited me to participate in it,” the Prime Minister said responding to a question asked by opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila.

He said it was Mr. Wickremasinghe who had informed the House that such a forum was held.

Mr. Wickremesinghe then said he had never mentioned that the forum was organized by the Government. "We did not spend anything for the forum," he said.

The Prime Minister said the previous government could not get economic experts and investors to come to Sri Lanka because the previous regime had demanded commissions. (YP)
