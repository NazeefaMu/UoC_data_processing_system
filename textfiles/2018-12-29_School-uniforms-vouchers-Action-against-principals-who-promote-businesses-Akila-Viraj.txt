The Education Ministry said yesterday disciplinary action would be taken against principals who were trying to promote certain businesses when giving out free vouchers to purchase school uniforms.

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said the ministry had received complaints that certain principals were engaged in this unethical practice when distributing free vouchers to students for uniforms for the new year.

The minister instructed all the principals to adhere to the 41/2018 circular without attempting to influence from where parents should go to when purchasing school uniforms for their children.

He said the voucher system was introduced to prevent malpractices reported in the past when distributing free school uniforms.

The ministry secretary in a letter sent to principals and other officials said that the children should be allowed to purchase uniforms from the place/ outlet of their choice.

The letter added that no education official should mediate directly or indirectly in the act of purchasing school uniforms. (Ajith Siriwardana)
