At least two crude bombs were found at Bodh Gaya pilgrimage centre in Bihar on Friday evening, just hours after Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama had retired for the day, NDTV reported.

The bombs were detected during a search of the centre 100 km from state capital Patna following an explosion near one of the grounds at the complex.

Considered one of the most sacred Buddhist shrine and the seat of Buddha's enlightenment, the Mahabodhi temple complex had been the target of serial bomb blasts in July 2013 that had injured many. In all, 10 bombs hidden in different parts of the complex had gone off in one hour; three at the temple sites and six within the one kilometre radius. Three more bombs had been defused.
