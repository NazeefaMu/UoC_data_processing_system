Land fraud, land loss and land rights – Part I

The following is the first part of the article which highlights the issues in the current land registration system in Sri Lanka, the lacunae in the law enabling fraud and how much progress has been made in rectifying the problem. The second article will aim to address information that is crucial for land owners and buyers, the reforms that need to take place and land dispossession in Sri Lanka. While addressing the issue of land fraud in Sri Lanka it is important to understand that there are several different legal systems in play, such as Thesawalamai law, Muslim law and Kandyan law, thus any reform that takes place needs to attempt to harmonize all legal systems.
1. How the system could aid fraud
In an interview with experts on the matter it was pointed out that, shockingly the rules governing registration for land and the notarial practice are discretionary rules, allowing deeds to be registered even if the rules are not adhered to; meaning all it takes is a negligent notary who fails to check someone’s identification thoroughly to cause a land owner or buyer to lose millions. Another problem is the way the documents have been stored in the Land Registry, poor maintenance, theft, years of decay and nature taking its toll has left the documents deteriorating, as a result it allows room for entries to be changed in the folio and to introduce forged deeds.The current land registration regime in Sri Lanka is not subject to the rule of law, loopholes and shortcomings in the law in combination with negligence by some authorities have created a system where defrauding someone over a piece of real estate has become possible. Systems that were put in place to supposedly uphold the rule of law have subsequently become ‘Public Enemy No.1’ and with very few land buyers doing their due diligence, it has led to several people becoming an accessory to a crime committed against their own self.
The legal system concerning the registration of deeds in Sri Lanka has been such that it invited fraud, the Notaries Ordinance provides that registration is not even mandatory. Registration does not amount to ownership in Sri Lanka; registration of a deed is proof of the transaction but if legally defective does not make the sale effective, which results in a lack of certainty. The officials in question have no duty to check if the seller does not have the right to sell, nor do they have the competence to do so. Hence this allows for the infiltration of the registry by ‘fake deeds’. A report by the CID stated that the Land Registry does not maintain a list of deceased notaries nor do they take charge of seals, which allows for ‘fake deeds’ to be registered using the name of a notary who is deceased.
The system has obvious flaws, the pace at which it is being addressed is not sufficient to combat the present issues. Reforms need to be brought in not just at a legal but also a policy level. Moreover the necessary laws and policies need to be implemented alongside the appropriate tools that allow for their efficient functioning. For the time being it is necessary for the general public to understand how the system works and that their position is rather precarious.
2. How land fraud is committed
With the land titling system so vulnerable, it is not surprising that land fraud is so widespread in Sri Lanka. Listed are several popular ways land fraud is committed in Sri Lanka:
1. Impersonation is fairly easy; it is simply a matter of creating a forged deed using a copy of the original deed and creating a fake identity card. Then buyers are found either through paper advertisements or brokers and once the lawyer of the buyer is satisfied with how genuine the deed is, subsequent to a search in the land registry where it has been correctly entered in the folio, the impostor sells the Land using the forged NIC.
2. It is also possible to sell the same piece of land twice or more times; Once a sale is made it takes some time in the Land Registry to alter the relevant folio, thus the seller can take advantage of this delay and sell the land to a second buyer, who will be satisfied that the seller still remains the owner after a search in the Land Registry. A longer delay enables the seller to deceive more buyers.
3. A slightly harder method than impersonation is to actually transfer the ownership of the land and then sell. This is done by collecting a copy of the deed either via a broker or someone attempting to sell, then creating a forged deed in the fraudster’s name using the name of a deceased lawyer and getting the forged deed registered in the Land registry, and then selling the land appearing as the original owner.
4. Another way is to execute a deed of declaration, without actually having 10 years of continuous possession, and registering the deed in a new folio as a ‘deed of declaration’. This in turn will cause the original owner to not be accepted as the original owner which enables the land to be sold to a buyer by a fraudster. This happens often where deeds are executed for government lands or temple properties on trust.
5. An unexpected method is by filing a partition action to obtain a court order through forgery. This can be done by first executing a deed of declaration by falsifying facts and pretending to be in possession for 10 years of an unused piece of land, and then introducing another person, to whom a portion of the land is transferred in the presence of a lawyer, this person thus becomes the co-owner. The partition action is filed, a decree is obtained from the court to divide the land, and this judgement is registered in the Land Registry, which enables sale to a third party. All this while the original absolute owner is unaware of these transactions, but when he goes to court, he will get ownership leaving the buyer without land or money.
With several gaps in the system land fraud almost seems inevitable, leaving you wondering; how safe are your own assets in reality.
3. Is the future of land registration bleak?
In an attempt to rectify the problematic land registration system in Sri Lanka, a title registration system is being implemented right now, commonly known as the Bim Saviya and supported by the World Bank; it has been implemented in 18 of 43 Land Registries at present. This Act provides land title free of land fraud and eliminates the procedure of searching predecessors to title 30 years in the past. The Bim Saviya also provides an ‘indefeasible title’ to land, this is a judicial term coined to mean that the entries in the title registry are conclusive and cannot be questioned by a court of law. This means that the buyer if registered as the owner in the registry and has possession will be able to exclude all those with rights even if the seller did not have the right to sell.
Unfortunately the rigidity of this law means that several innocent land owners are in a position to lose their land, if fraud takes place. The loophole in this act is that, the original owner can only retain their title if the buyer has knowledge of the fraud taking place and was party to it. However this loophole serves no purpose as it is near impossible to prove that the buyer had the intention of fraud.
In addition to being a title registration system, the Bim Saviya is also implementing an E-Land registry, while this is actually extremely necessary in Sri Lanka, what is problematic about this is that it is being implemented without the appropriate client identification tools, there is no identification process, or biometric system in place to identify the person being entered into the land registry as the owner, which can have disastrous consequences.
The real problem is not the law itself, but the lack of appropriate tools to support it. Another shortcoming within the system is that the offences committed by notaries are either not made punishable or even where the offences are punishable there is no prosecution. Having interviewed lawyers and professors who are researching the subject, it was pointed out that it is important to understand that in a country like Sri Lanka where different legal systems operate, a ‘one size fits all’ policy will just not do, and we have placed ourselves in a position where the World Bank had to intervene. Land in Sri Lanka is not treated the same way as anywhere else, life here is more communal meaning people respect the right of way or a ‘lien’ on land, thus a system of title registration which excludes all other rights may not be feasible in Sri Lanka.
Even though the government is attempting to bring in changes, progress is extremely slow, legal reform in land law is not seen as a ‘hot button’ issue, there needs to be a drastic change in attitudes toward this, land fraud needs to be seen for the debilitating issue it is.
