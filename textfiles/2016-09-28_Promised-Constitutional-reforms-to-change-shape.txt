Promised Constitutional reforms to change shape?


	



 

The subject of the proposed new Constitution came up for discussion at a high level conference held quite recently.

 

The Big Boss who is keen on fulfilling the pledge given to the people presented his views at the outset.  


Most participants who spoke after their Boss, expressed the view that if they were to implement the Constitutional reforms designed to devolve powers further, as promised at the national elections, they would have to go in for a Referendum. And they would have no other alternative given the court ruling already delivered.


However, the Constitutional experts, eminent lawyers and veteran politicians who were among the participants were one in the opinion that holding a Referendum was a risky exercise for if they suffered defeat at it, it was a cinch that all their Constitutional reform plans would go haywire. 


After giving an attentive hearing to all the views, the Big Boss ruled that all proposed Constitutional amendments that required a mandate at a Referendum be dropped from their agenda.


Given this ruling by the Big Boss, the contours of all Constitutional reforms held out by the yahapalanaya leaders at the last national elections with much sound and fury will undergo a complete change, they say.
