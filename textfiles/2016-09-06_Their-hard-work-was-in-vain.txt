Their hard work was in vain


	

A leading politician at national level was billed to perform the honours of depositing the reliquary of sacred relics on the elephant to be conducted in an annual perahera pageant held recently at a temple in the Western Province. 

 


All politicos of the party big and small in the area were falling over themselves in organizing the event in a bid to win brownie points from the leader who was to be the chief guest at the ceremony. 


However, their high hopes of warming their way into the graces of the leader shattered when he failed to turn up for the event.
