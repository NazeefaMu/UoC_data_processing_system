A purohita highly provoked on hearing from a colleague that people are blaming him for allowing his wife to use a Ministry vehicle, is reported to have cursed those making the allegation saying, “There’s no need for my wife to use an official car. I’ve bought her a good vehicle for Rs. 4.5 million!”

 


Despite the purohita’s protests, his wife continues to use a Ministry vehicle leaving the sleek Rs.4.5 million worth limousine well looked-after back at home, they say.
