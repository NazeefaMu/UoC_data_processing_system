Prorogation: To avert a predicament?


	



 

There is widespread speculation about a move afoot to prorogue the present session of the Diyawanna council.

 


The move had originated from the Green party leadership keen on sidestepping some controversial issues and challenges staring them in the face, they say.


A prorogation would normally cause the Select Committees like the COPE and the COPA to lapse and all matters being handled by these committees would go into the cold storage. 


Meanwhile, sources close to the highest echelons say there is a strong possibility of the council being prorogued sooner or later to make way for the yahapalanaya Number One to make a policy declaration in view of the already made arrangement for the council to meet as constitutional assembly beginning January. 


By the way, a story doing rounds in political circles says that the Number One turned down a request made by the Green leadership to go in for an immediate prorogation.
