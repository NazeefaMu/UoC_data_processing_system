Two brothers, aged 43 and 46, who allegedly robbed a man of Rs. 1800 after throwing chillie powder in his face were taken into custody by the Nawalapitiya Police.

The victim of this attack, a 67-year-old man, who had gone to a funeral house in the Thispane area in Nawalapitiya and was returning home, had been waylaid by the two brother who were drunk at the time. They had taken their prey to the home of the illegitimate wife of one of them and stolen his money after throwing chillie powder in his face.

The upshot of this was that while the two were busy ridding the elderly man of his money the husband of the woman who was being 'kept' by one of the brothers had also been at home and the clandestine love affair of his wife came out into the open as a result of the brothers' decision to bring their victim to this house.
