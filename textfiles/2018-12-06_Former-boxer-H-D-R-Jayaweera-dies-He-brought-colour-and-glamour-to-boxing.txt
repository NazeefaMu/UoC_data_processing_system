I am extremely sad to note the death of H. D. R. Jayaweera, a  former Carey College boxer and National Champion. His funeral was held on December 5. The late Jayaweera was the most stylish boxer that Carey College  ever produced during the late 60s and early 70s. 

He brought colour and glamour to the boxing arena during that period and won many best Boxer Trophies. He was famous for wearing world famous EVER LAST boxing shorts. We all remember and admired not only his shorts. He was a classic boxer who had all the punctures and produced beautiful combinations. You will not see that type of boxer at present. In 1969 the up-country vs low-country schools boxing meets were held in Kandy. I was in the up-country team. To make the team, my coach late Derrick Raymond wanted me to shift one weight up to 110 pounds and fight Jayaweera. To be honest I was reluctant as Jayaweera was senior to me and he definitely had a reputation and I thought it would be difficult for me to handle the challenge, but my coach thought otherwise.

To make things further difficult without my knowledge Raymond has altered the programme and our bout was shifted to be the last bout of the evening. By the time we entered the ring both the Colombo Schools and Kandy Schools had won 7 bouts each. It was a very close contest. Since I was a southpaw, I got the impression, that Jayaweera would find it difficult to adjust himself. I was ahead in the 3rd round and with my victory Kandy Schools won the championships.

He was our life-long friend. Whenever our team travelled to Colombo we stayed at the St. Joseph’s College hostel. Jayaweera’s house was just opposite the road. We used to visit his home. He had a lovely collection of boxing magazines and photographs of International boxers. His elder brother H.D Kumarasiri was also a boxer. Jayaweera was a close friend of all the Sylvestrians during that period. We always admired this stylish boxing during that era. Apart from that he was a sincere friend who was willing to entertain friends. We will always think of him and we will always remember him, as a dear friend and a brilliant boxer and he will be in our thoughts forever. Good Bye dear friend.
