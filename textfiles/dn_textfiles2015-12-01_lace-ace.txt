Lace is ace

Once reserved only for lingerie trim, the delicate lace is staging a luxe comeback, rising back up the fashion food chain and showing up on everything from sleek day dresses to frilly weekend tops. Having prevailed through the ages, from refined Victorian looks to racier versions, historically, the fabric was a sign of wealth and elegance and the must-have fashion among renaissance patricians. Today, the delicate material has become a more everyday indulgence and it's now a regular part of women's wardrobes.
"The fabric has had many makeovers since its genesis. It was used to decorate everything from dresses to door knobs and from lingerie, bridal wear to cocktail outfits. However, right now the lace is ruling the runway in its throwback to the 70s and the 90s fashion," shares fashion guru Nachiket Barve. Creative director of Vertical Divani, Sanya Dhir agrees and adds, "The best part of this revival is that both designers and the high street appear to have realised that it doesn't have to be - a) Victorian-like and b) supremely OTT and girlie. The French may have invented the notion but designers have embraced their individual freedom of expression for fall by doing whatever they want with the fabric to bring out exquisite results: featherweight see-through shifts, elaborately crafted sheaths, fluid T-shirts and more. For resort, it's turning up in sophisticated, racy styles from semi-sheer or peekaboo tops to abbreviated skirts and dresses."
Playful colours counter the naughtiness of the lace, creating a sexy attitude that's anything but stodgy. "Forget bridal white and think of sugary pastels and eye-popping neons. For maximum impact, team a bright colour with a neutral and finish the look with a clashing manicure and fluoro accessories," reveals fashion designer Nandita Thirani and adds, "While laces always look great in black and white, this season it's trending in all kinds of hues and patterns. Big bold patterns or intricately detailed ones paired with bright shades of red, yellows, blues and pinks are perfect to make a style statement. Think Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, not the Queen Mother. You also have to be careful here - lace can get cheap-looking quickly. Choose high-quality material and pair vibrant hues with shoes from the same colour family or metallic. Wear your hair loose to keep the overall look easy-going and fun."
You can also texturally mash-up the fabric and bring on your combination-game. Nachiket suggests, "Lace looks best in an elegant grown up format.. guipure lace with heavy duchesse satin or with a silk crepe looks elegant. The 90s can be revived with combining it with leather, denim or even gingham and tartan by paying homage to all that's grunge." About another variation, designer Swatee Singh adds, "If you want something that's a little more contemporary, then, try metallic lace, a type of lace that's made from metal or metallic threads such as gold, silver, or copper. The designs can be worked on a textile ground or the lace can completely be made from metallic threads." Well, now we know that it suits all women but can men ever embrace the feminine fabric? "Yes," exclaims designer Paresh Lamba. "Designers have been constantly innovating and experimenting with the fabric, its texture and colour. Lace-inspired sherwanis and coats are a big trend this wedding season that I'll suggest men to try it out."
