All governments, past and present, defend the corrupt, said Opposition Leader R Sampanthan yesterday.
Speaking during an adjournment debate in the House, Mr. Sampanthan said corruption was endemic in the country.
Parties hit each other on corruption during elections. This government is also being attacked on corruption. One party is defeated and another party comes to power. However corruption continues. They blame each other, but do nothing to end corruption. People are getting sick of this situation, he said
Corruption might end democracy in this country. Nepotism and dictatorship have always followed rampant corruption in many countries. People who are guilty are not punished. Is there anyone who was punished by a court for corruption There is no one. You are just fooling the people, he said. (Yohan Perera)

Bolt loses gold medal as teammate failed dope test
	
Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's golden Olympic record was diminished Wednesday after Jamaican compatriot Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance, CNN reported.
Carter's positive test means Bolt must return one of his nine Olympic gold medals.
The 30-year-old Bolt cemented his status as an all-time great by completing an unprecedented 'triple triple' in Rio 2016, becoming the only man to win all three sprint events at three Olympic Games.
But the gold the Jamaican won in the 4x100m relay in Beijing 2008 will no longer count after governing body the International Olympic Committee (IOC) disqualified the Caribbean island's sprint team Wednesday.
Re-analysis of Carter's samples from Beijing resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine.
All four members of the team - Bolt, Asafa Powell, Michael Frater and Carter, a bronze medalist at the 2013 World Championships - lose their titles.
Last summer, Bolt said returning one of his golds would be "heartbreaking" but added that he "would not have a problem" doing so.
Bolt's agent Ricky Simms had not been immediately available for comment.

CB Scam should be dealt with as a criminal case: MS
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today that he had found that the investigation of the Central Bank bond scam was being carried out under civil law after the matter was referred to the Auditor General's department by the Prime Minister's office. He said it must be taken up as a criminal case.
Rejecting the allegations against the Auditor General, the President said it was he who had appointed the Auditor General who was regarded by the entire country as an honest official. "It was I who removed Arjuna Mahendran and replaced him with Dr. Kumaraswamy who is acclaimed by the whole world," he added.
Addressing a function for the opening of the replica of the Avukana Buddha statue at Abhayaramaya in Narahenpita he vowed that fraudsters would be punished irrespective of whether they were supporters of the government or the opposition.
President Sirisena stated that after those responsible for the recent Central Bank bond scam were punished he would take action to punish those involved in frauds at the Central Bank during the seven or eight years prior to the current scam.
Turning to the Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Mahanayake Thera, who had earlier made a remark that the commissions were pointless, the President said that he had decided to appoint a commission on the bond issue after obtaining the advice of top legal luminaries in the country, purely to expedite the investigations.
"There were allegations that I had appointed a commission in order to sweep the matter under the carpet. Having come out of a regime that was corrupt to the core, I do not want to establish a similar rule. A thief is a thief, no matter who he is. I will do what is correct," he said.
He said that he discarded the cabinet paper to legalise homosexuality as he did the proposal to legalise prostitution. "I will reject any proposal that would be detrimental to the country," he said.
He averred that he would not give in to anybody excepting the people of the country. He reiterated his earlier stand that foreign judges would not participate in the investigations into human rights violations. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

THE HINDU, 24th JANUARY, 2017-The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it would withdraw its 2016 notification allowing bull taming sport Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu in view of the fresh legislation, passed by the state assembly, on the issue. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi told a bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra that the Centre has decided to withdraw the January 6, 2016 notification issued by the Ministry ofEnvironment and Forest allowing the sport.
The court, which had reserved its verdict on a batch of petitions challenging the notification, said the concerned bench would take a decision on when the application of the Centre would come up for its consideration.
The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment), Act, 2017 piloted by Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, was on Monday adopted unanimously by a voice vote in the Assembly after a brief debate. The Bill would now be sent for approval to the President.

A Colombo-based envoy of a powerful Western country met the professor leading the Pohottuwa party at a high-society party held in the city recently.

Their conversation gradually turned to the political developments in the country and the envoy suggested it was high time that former strongman quit politics for a quiet life in retirement.
The professor who did not take kindly to this unexpected suggestion replied: It is the people in the country who do not want him to go into retirement. How can he turn his back on the popular demand
The envoy was not impressed with the excuse trotted out by the professor. The son of your former boss will have a promising political future only if he retires  fades completely from the political scene. Therefore, he should quit at least in the interest of his own son!
Annoyed by the envoys persistence, the professor put an end to the argument saying: As I told you, it is the masses who want our boss to continue to play an active role in politics. I invite you to watch the crowd enthusiasm at two or three public functions he attends. Let us  resume discussion on this matter thereafter!

The deputy had added after a chuckle: Sir, my boss and I are getting along well because no work means no issue to quarrel over either. After all he is not unhappy about the situation, because he has got ample time on hand to attend to his affairs in the Moneragala area!

One way ticket to frustration, chaos and turmoil
	
Secularism has become the buzz word for all those who wish to drive out Buddhism from public life in Sri Lanka, both overtly and covertly. 
When we refer to secularism we must be in a position to distinguish it from pseudo-secularism. 
What is practised in a large majority of countries in the name of secularism is a pseudo variety of secularism. 
We now see particularly in the Western countries in the light of the influx of a large number of refugees from Middle Eastern countries, deep seated nationalism and patriotic fervour rising to the surface and challenging the secular image these European countries had carefully cultivated and projected to the outside world in the decades following the end of the second world war. 
In other words, beneath the veneer of secularism in Europe lurks an innate nationalism that had laid the foundation of the nation state and united the people on the basis of a shared past that bonded one another through affinities to a common religion, ethnicity and language. 
Sri Lankas 2500 year old civilization was founded on this basis-similar to the great Chinese and Japanese civilizations, and several European Christian nations. 
Yet, modern day pseudo-secular countries particularly in the West want Sri Lanka to discard its primordial national (Sinhala) and religious (Buddhism) identity, and embrace an artificial secular identity that has neither roots to the soil of the country nor been shaped either by history, common values, heritage or destiny. 
Pseudo-Secularism
Secularism calls for equal treatment of religions without discrimination. 
In which countries is that practiced 
Take for example the status of Buddhism (And other Eastern Dharmic Religions) in Western countries. 
In Europe only two countries have officially given recognition to Buddhism- namely Russia and Austria.

The rest of Europe with a Christian heritage denies official recognition to Buddhism. 
Buddhism is being tolerated but not recognised officially as a religion despite almost all majority Buddhist countries in Asia giving full official recognition to the major Abrahamic religions, i.e. Christianity and Islam. 
It is this lack of reciprocity on the part of European Christian nations to give any form of recognition to Buddhism that has caused consternation at recent international Buddhist Conferences. Speakers have condemned the adoption of double standards by European countries in respect of different global religions. 
Despite claiming to be Secular most European countries allow Political Parties to bear religious names such as the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Germany. The leader of the CDU, Angela Merkel, is the current Chancellor of Germany.Christian Democratic Party (France), Christian Social Union in Bavaria, Christian Democratic Party (Norway), Christian Democratic Peoples Party (Switzerland), Christian Democrats (Denmark) are names of some of the political parties that openly espouse the cause of the majority religion in Europe.
There are no public holidays for Buddhism or any other non-Christian religion in the public holiday calendar of European nations with Christian heritage. 
This is in stark contrast to the conduct of traditional Buddhist countries e.g. Sri Lanka, which has granted public holidays on days of religious significance to adherents of both Abrahamic and Eastern Dharmic religions. 
Discrimination against Buddhism
The discriminatory stance against Buddhism in Europe has had several detrimental effects such as categorising Buddhists as being members of sects and cults among other things. 
Official recognition would allow Buddhists certain rights, such as access to the media, financial support, legal standing, and recognition equal to those of Christian Churches, and right to be taught in a school. It would allow them the legal right to form voluntary societies as exclusive Buddhist Societies with membership restricted only to Buddhists. 
It is regrettable to note that concepts such as Secularism, Diversity, Multi-culturalism and the like have now become code words for demonising the Sinhalese majority and removal of Buddhism (Despite its singular and overwhelming contribution to national life since it was introduced by Arahant Mahinda to Sri Lanka in circa 300 BC) from public life. 
Manipulation of Secularism
Secularism in the West began with the objective of separating the Church (Which was trying to usurp the power of the State) and the State. Nevertheless, the Secularism in Christian countries remains unequivocally promajoritarian. 
In contrast in the Eastern countries such as India and Sri Lanka, Secularism has been manipulated to become antimajoritarian. 
Religious discrimination en masse and public policy wise, really began in Sri Lanka after the arrival of the Portuguese in 1505. They had an Inquisitorial mindset shaped by events commencing in Europe in the 15th century which required all non  Christians e.g. Muslims, Jews to convert to Christianity or face the Inquisition, which meted out a series of harsh punishments including burning the victims at the stake for being  heretics. 
The Portuguese Inquisition in Sri Lanka (1505  1658) deserves a close and careful study as it was introduced to Sri Lanka by the Portuguese following the Catholic Inquisition in Europe and the Goa Inquisition. There were several Portuguese Captain  Generals like Jeronimo de Azavedo who were in charge of the Inquisition both in Goa and Portuguese occupied territory in Sri Lanka. 
Secularism as a concept was conceived and evolved in an European context. 
It is euro-centric in its very nature like the European Union and even the United Nations, which today is unashamedly promoting re-colonization and the right to intervene in the affairs of nation states that seek independence, self  reliance and non  alignment. 
Instead of transplanting ideas grown in contexts that are far removed in respect to both time and space, the challenge for us in Sri Lanka is to develop our own home grown political ideas taking into consideration Lankas heritage and history, and more importantly the setbacks this country sustained as a result of nearly 450 years of western colonialism. 
Unreasonable demands of the EU
How should Sri Lanka respond to constant unreasonable demands made by the European Union and the USA, to shape our public policy, Constitution, method of governance, national security and the like in line with hidden agendas drawn by these countries to suit their parochial interests and objectives 
Let me conclude with an edited quote from a very perceptive Indian writer: 
I would like to reiterate that non-Europeans are better off being always suspicious of the motives behind the preaching of democratic, liberal and civilized forms of governance by the West. Being at the receiving end of colonial oppression for centuries, non-Europeans should naturally be distrustful of those lecturing them about the virtues of liberty, who had trampled these virtues the most. Just recount these events in last couple of centuries, Atlantic slave-trade to plantation slavery in Americas, violent and repressive colonies in Asia and Africa, brutal world wars in a span of thirty years accompanied by genocide (by US in Japan) and holocaust (by Nazis on Jews) on a scale never seen before, waging a cold war in its most violent form in Asia. If this were the track record of those lecturing the virtues of democracy, liberty and human rights then only the insane would listen to their diabolical propaganda. China feeds more than 1.2 billion of her people and the West is too worried about the lack of democracy in China. Let China start taking the Western panacea (by the way, isnt communism a Western theory), famine would run havoc, automatic weapons will flood the streets of her cities, drug and narcotics will intoxicate her people and a total lawlessness will pave the way for Western powers to intervene and colonize using R2P. Therefore, we should remember that preaching Western (Anglo-Saxon) style democracy and liberty to any non-Westerner for serious implementation would be a one way ticket to frustration, chaos and turmoil in a non  Western country.

PM came to know only in the morning: Rajitha
	
Cabinet spokesman, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne today said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe got to know about the investor of the proposed tyre factory in Horana only on the morning of the stone laying ceremony and was considering whether to go or not.
He added that Mr. Wickremesinghe decided to participate in the ceremony on January 5th as it was a major employment generating investment and the plaque had already been erected at the site.
Minister Senaratne also said the government would reassess the land value of the 100 acres given to the proposed tyre factory in Horana and added Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was reluctant to participate in the stone laying ceremony on January 5th after he learnt as to who was the investor.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet news briefing yesterday, Minister Senaratne said it was a blunder made by the subject minister to give the 100 acre plot of land at Rs. 100 per acre on a 99 year lease for the controversial project and added the land would be given on lease on its commercial value.
Minister Senaratne admitted that the clearing of the land at the site has been suspended at the moment.
When I was the Minister of Land, I changed the law in 2003 that permitted to lease state lands for Rs. 45 per acre that had been enacted during the colonial period. Under the current law, no state lands could be sold and maximum lease period is 99 years. Therefore, this land will be re-leased after a proper assessment and charged the commercial value of the land, Minister Senaratne said.
Responding to a journalist, Minister Senaratne admitted that the investor Nandana Lokuwithana was a close buddy of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family and added people with money change their colours as and when they feel opportune.
Mr. Lokuwithana is to invest US$ 75 million (Rs.11. 25 billion) as a BOI project and the stone laying ceremony was held on January 5th. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) has also given a huge tax holiday to the project in addition to leasing the land for a pittance.
Under the agreement reached with the BOI, Mr. Lokuwithana will also receive a discount of 70% for the premium he must deposit for the 100 acres at Rs. 10,000 per year for the 100 acres.
Minister Senaratne said the Cabinet and the CCEM discussed the project at length and President Maithripala Sirisena decreed that the subject Minister must submit the Cabinet paper for any project hereafter despite the CCEM giving the nod to go ahead for any project. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Almost 30 COPE reports had been swept under the carpet by the previous government, said Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella yesterday.
Speaking during the adjournment debate on the bond issue, Mr. Kiriella said a presidential commission had been appointed to look into one COPE report by this government while it had also allowed a debate to go ahead.
He said the present government had appointed an opposition member as the Chairman of COPE unlike governments in the past.
Mr. Kiriella said the Supreme Courts had dismissed a petition filed on the bond issue, as the petitioner had only assumed that the bond issue of February 2015 had cost the government billions of rupees. He said the Supreme Courts had asked the petitioner to show how he had calculated the losses. (Yohan Perera)

A senior top team member from the Green party is said to be fuming with anger over the cut-back of a major part from the Ministrys budgetary apportionment thereby sending its development programmes for the year into a tailspin.

Of the Rs.6 billion allocated to the Ministry, Rs. 3 billion has been taken back even without informing the top team member who has set his heart upon implementing an ambitious housing programme. The part of the financial provisions withdrawn from the Ministry had gone to a Swami from the North and the balance to a Gane promoting dialogue, they say.
The angry top team member had threatened in the presence of his colleagues to quit his portfolio if the full amount set apart for his Ministry was not restored. At this stage, Number One had interceded to resolve the issue. However, informed sources say that what was brought about was only a ceasefire and a full blown battle is in the offing.

Sri Lanka becomes more corrupt
	
Sri Lanka ranked at 95 in the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2016, dropping down the rank by 12 slots when compared to 2015.
The report released by Transparency International, the global movement against corruption, ranks countries according to the perceived level of public sector corruption.
Sri Lanka was ranked at 95 out of 176 counties with a poor score of 36 when compared to 2015 when the country was ranked at 83 among 168 countries.
Denmark together with New Zealand topped the list with a score of 90 followed by Finland, Sweden and Switzerland ranked 3rd, 4th and 5th respectively, as the least corrupt countries.
India was ranked the least corrupt in the South Asian region with a score of 40 and was ranked at 79 in the overall index. Following India, Sri Lanka and Maldives were jointly ranked at 95.
The ranks based on a scoring system that ranges between 0 (public sector perceived as highly corrupt) to 100 (public sector perceived as very clean).
The Corruption Perceptions Index aggregates data from a number of different sources such as the business community and country experts on the level of corruption in the public sector. CPI 2016 is calculated using 13 different data sources from 12 different institutions that capture perceptions of corruption within the past two years.
Globally, the data reveals that a staggering 69 percent of the 176 countries scored below 50 in the 2016 CPI, indicating high levels of perceived public sector corruption prevalent throughout the world. 2016 also marks an alarming trend where more countries declined rather than improved in the overall performance.
Executive Director of Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) Asoka Obeyesekere said that despite the passing of the Right to Information Act and the adoption of the Open Government Partnership National Action Plan, Sri Lanka was yet to see anti-corruption rhetoric which would lead to strong action.
He said a legislative reform agenda alone is insufficient to put an end to impunity. Controversies such as the Bond issue, the alleged Australian corruption scandal implicating the President and delays in corruption related prosecutions have raised serious questions about the governments commitment towards yahapalanaya and anti-corruption.
Obeyesekere added that it is often forgotten that the 19th Amendment gave CIABOC (the Bribery Commission) the power to institute prosecutions  therefore beyond the government the public must hold the Independent Commission to account.(DS)

Supreme Court set for landmark Brexit ruling
	

The British governments Brexit plan will be put to the test on Tuesday with a landmark court ruling on whether it has the right to kick-start the countrys EU departure without parliamentary approval. 
The 11 Supreme Court judges are expected to rule against the government in a move which could delay Prime Minister Theresa May triggering Article 50 of the EUs Lisbon Treaty, which would formally begin exit negotiations. 
Tuesdays decision follows a High Court ruling against the government in November, in a case which attracted protests and abuse against the lead claimant. 
Businesswoman Gina Miller said she has suffered death threats and racist taunts since bringing the case. 
Things that were considered unacceptable are now acceptable, she told AFP ahead of the Supreme Court decision. 
Anger was also directed at the High Court judges following their decision, being branded Enemies of the People by one newspaper. 
The legal challenge has tapped into divisions within British society after the June referendum which saw 52 percent vote to leave the EU.  Brexiteers have claimed the case is an attempt to block Britains departure from the European Union, but MPs are not expected to vote against triggering Article 50.  If they lose the case ministers are preparing to rush emergency legislation through the Houses of Commons and Lords -- and the opposition Labour party has promised not to block it. 
Even if the Supreme Court rules that May cannot bypass parliament in Westminster, parliamentarians will be unlikely to go against the vote of the British people and block Brexit, said Agata Gostynska-Jakubowska, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.

The Tamil Question: Agony of an unsettled ethnic inequality
	

Every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud, adopts as a last resource pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and happy to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.
~ Arthur Schopenhauer, Essays and Aphorisms 


Kadiresan woke up early morning, a couple of hours before sunshine, looked up towards the starless skies and let out a deep sigh; he knew it was going to be another scorching, hot day in the peninsula. In the distance, beyond a parched landscape full of palms and groves lay his oasis of land; although it was only a quarter of an acre in area, it was watered regularly and with the rich red soil to nourish a crop of vegetables from cauliflower to beets, carrots and red onions, Kadiresan knew that his harvest promised more than an average cash inflow into his family of three, his wife and a school going daughter who was only seven years old and quite bright in her studies. Kadiresan managed to get his daughter admitted to the great Vembadi Girls High School, which according to some educators, is the best secondary school in all of Sri Lanka, surpassing Ananda, Royal, Nalanda,and other elite schools in the Island. 
Kadiresans journey has not been an easy one. His middle-class parents bequeathed the land and other properties to him via Thesavalamai law. Whereabouts his parents are yet unknown and that is after the war. Right through the life story of Kadiresan flows the tale of our Tamil brethren in the North and some parts of the East. It is absolutely futile to run through the history of Tamils and try to portray a picture of negativity or one of positive genre, depending on the readers prejudices. Erudite historians and scholars may disagree with me when I point out that you see one, you see all notion applies to Northern Tamils. However, the canvass that I intend to paint on seems too broad and the finesse and training that a specialist historian needs, I confess, I do not possess. Yet, the simple, but not simplistic, approach I intend to take would have equipped me to confront the issues that our Tamil brothers and sisters had to face over the last century or so. 
However, my task here is not to catalogue what had happened in the past, ancient or modern, the various events that had provoked the subsequent actions by succeeding generations, sometimes as a response to the varied State-sponsored or otherwise-underwritten legislations, regulations, constitutional changes or proactive measures initiated by the Tamil leaders over the last few decades. But I can certainly talk about events and proceedings that had a direct or indirect effect on the overall status of the mindset and psyche of a community that has been sharing the same land, traditional values and cultural bonds with the majority which happens to be Sinhalese Buddhist. 
Human values whether they are born and nurtured by one community or another do not dis-empower our inherent powers. On the contrary, they enrich the very core of our being, they continue to upgrade our responses to various crises and every now and then catapult us from treacherous chasms to subliminal heights. When crises that are born essentially out of prolonged suppression of a people, in India in the eighteen hundreds and early nineteen hundreds, the world was blessed to see a Mahatma Gandhi; in the nineteen fifties and sixties in America we saw Martin Luther King Jr.; in the latter part of the Twentieth Century we saw Mandela in South Africa. All these leaders managed to stay above the fray and transcend the mundane issues that irritate and annoy people at large. 
The Tamil Question in Sri Lanka could be analyzed and understood only in the context of a rich environment of two able but inwardly narcissistic communities battling it out in the dark shadows of racial discrimination and ethnic mistrust. However rich the respective histories of these two communities, Sinhalese and Tamils, when it came to real decision-making levels, discrimination and mistrust crept in and any resolution to the issues at hand got buried under a sandstorm of vitriolic barrage and non-participation at meaningful discourse of real propositions. I have written earlier and I would not hesitate to repeat now, any attitudinal changes that are essential to a long-lasting resolution of the fundamental divisions and breakdown of mutual trust and faith have to be preceded by objective changes in our societal structures and societal makeup. As much as the 56- transformation made a change in the psyche and mindset in the Tamil people, the Thirteenth Amendment did have a very serious and grave adjustment in the mindset of the majority Sinhalese Buddhists. The minority mindset that has crippled the minds of our majority Sinhalese and provoked them to pogrom-like massacres of innocent Tamil civilians in the South as was evidenced in the 83 ethnic riots was given additional fodder when the Thirteenth Amendment was passed in Parliament under severest of conditions in the country in 1987. The political leadership in the Opposition was led by the SLFP and further strengthened by the then JVP which had turned into an ultra-chauvinistic protest group which later graduated into a mindless killing machine in the 87  89 Second Revolution phase. 
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam, (LTTE) led by a murderous Prabhakaran of the Northern Tamils on the one hand and Rohana Wijeweera and Deshapremi Janatha Vyaparaya (DJV) - Patriotic Peoples Movement- an even more ruthless killer-group of the Sinhalese Buddhists on the other, held the nation and the central government led by an Executive President to ransom, particularly between 1987 and 1989. Sharpening of the already distorted mindsets had already occurred and what was necessary was the settling of the residue at the bottom of the barrel. Two peoples, who boast about their respective cultural heritage, two peoples who claim two non-violent religions- Buddhism and Hinduism- as their religious foundation, two peoples who are seen almost each Sunday at the front entrance of their Temples were entangled in a bitterest of all bitter battles, some at the negotiating table, Colombo, Timpu, Bangalore etc and more in the thickest jungles of Mullaithivu, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi and Jaffna. 
In quelling these two wars, one commandeered by Prabhakaran and the LTTE and the other by Wijeweera and the JVP, General Sarath Fonseka and Ranjan Wijeratne, both battlefield leaders, showed remarkable traits of leadership from the front. And at both these violent uprisings, Sri Lanka showed the world that she is not ready nor is she willing to surrender to the whims and fancies of dictatorial and unrealistic leaders in the likes of Prabhakaran and Rohana Wijeweera. With all her flirtations with so-called revolutions and militant-led uprisings, Sri Lanka is yet to succumb to the unknown devil. That is the lesson that all our political leaders should learn. 
In recent history, the Tamil Question was argued by the Ponnambalam brothers, C. Sunderalingam and G.G. Ponnambalam in the Legislative and State Councils and later in Parliament by Chelvanayagam, Amirthalingam and others. Demands from Fifty-Fifty to Tamil Traditional Homeland have done their usual rounds in the corridors of discussion in local and international domains. The violent expressions rendered unto these demands have been defeated with equal or even more ferocious violence. A caste-ridden community in its most discriminatory form, Tamils at one time were led exclusively by the Vellala caste leaders until Prabhakaran appeared on the horizons of Valvedditturai. When Prabhakaran took over the leadership of the Tamil militant struggle, the Colombo elites of the Tamil community buckled down and their Vellala-ness was thrown out the window. At that time, all power ran through the barrel of the LTTE guns. Wijeweera too tried these tactics in the 87  89 struggle, but could not subject the majority Sinhalese community to his will and guns. However, in historys strangest of ironies, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) although named as a common mans party, founded by a Sinhalese, Govigama, low-country, aristocrat, remains a political party, led exclusively by a man or woman of Govigama origin. In the SLFP, when caste is the issue, common man ceases to exist. 
In this convoluted context, the Tamil Question remains unsettled to date and the mistrust the Tamil leadership holds against its Sinhalese counterparts has contributed to the aggravation of the issue. Prabhakaran managed to kill almost all of the moderate Tamil leadership; Amirthalingam, Yogeswaran, Thiruchelvam and Kumar Ponnambalam are all not in the land of the living; after the defeat of the LTTE forces in 2009, the leadership of the Tamil community once again has fallen on the shoulders of the leaders who belong to Vellala caste. How other caste-MPs are treated by the leadership is totally another matter. Yet this caste issue, though invisible to society as an obvious notion of grave division and discrimination, continues to keep the Tamil community, a people dwelling in a past once torn apart by this anachronism withholding talented and able men and women from the upper echelons of community leadership. 
If the leadership of both communities need to resolve this irksome problem that has been haunting the souls of our people, they need to start afresh; they need to negotiate on a clean slate; they need to shed all their past prejudices, past philosophies, past mistrusts and everything that stood as an impediment to a long-lasting solution to the Tamil Question. One cannot go forward if one cannot forget the past. Future is not a mirage; it is a very real thing. One cannot step into that future with age-old baggage. Are our present leaders ready for that kind of a relationship Are they capable of thinking of such an adventurous beginning, leave alone taking action on it  Otherwise, Kadiresans toiling is in vain; his sweat is in vain, his very existence would be in vain. H.G. Wells said long time ago that, Our true nationality is mankind. Let us be worthy of it.

Their angry query: Why only us
	

Betel-leaf partys chief secretarial one is a long-faced one these days, they say.

His main grouse is that the special Police unit established by the unity government has become a veritable spectre stalking the Blue party politicos while turning a blind eye to more grave offences being committed by some big guns in the other main political party.
The elderly politico from the Colombo Central whose beard has turned grey with his years in the Blue party was summoned by the special Police unit reportedly to question him about the misuse of some government vehicles, but was quizzed about an entirely different issue linked to a lady, they say.
Meanwhile, the decision taken by the lady from Mulkirigala to give up the post of party organizer and the young politico from Chilaw quitting his office are attributed to the harassment they had to suffer.
The chief secretarial one, highly disconcerted by the numerous complaints made to him by the victimized party members have decided to place the issue before Number One who is also the leader of the Blue party and the multi-party alliance for a final decision.

Three top team members have been hamstrung due to funds to their Ministries being deliberately blocked by a powerful colleague, they say.

The three top team members in question are known to be bold critics of certain moves by the government and it is believed that funds to their Ministries are being blocked by way of punitive action against them.
Not to be outdone, the three top team members  a doctor, an engineer and a lawyer - are said to have hit upon an alternative means of raising funds for the smooth running of their Ministries. The trio now in an ugly mood over the unkind cut are planning to raise a big ruckus, our sources say.

To hook them by hook or by crook
	

A senior purohita has now got a contract from a political authority in the highest echelons to induce certain JO-leaning Betel leaf Diyawanna members to stay put by offering each of them a suitable carrot.

The senior one who has been given this contract is a party stalwart who managed to scrape through at the last general polls thanks to manape despite losing his constituency.
This worthy has already met several JO-leaning members and dangled carrots before them while painting a frightening picture for them if they crossed over to the other camp, they say.
Already alerted to this carrot dangling move, the JO leaders are said to be planning a counter-move.

Trump to order construction of Mexican wall
	
US President Donald Trump will begin rolling out executive actions on immigration Wednesday, beginning with steps to tighten border security - including his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border.
The president is also expected to take action over the next few days to temporarily ban immigration from Muslim countries deemed a 'threat to national security' - namely Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia.
In addition, Trump is set to sign other domestic immigration enforcement measures that will include targeting sanctuary cities that decline to prosecute undocumented aliens.
One key policy shift being discussed is whether to follow through on a campaign promise to scrap an Obama era initiative granting protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of children of illegal immigrants.
The 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) has shielded illegal immigrant children from deportation by granting them work permits, but Trump vowed during the campaign to end the initiative.
'Many options are being worked through on DACA,' a White House official told The Washington Post.
The Donald will get started with an executive order authorizing the wall on Wednesday, while the immigration bans are still being finalized and could come later in the week.
The president posted a tweet on Tuesday evening signaling that major announcements were in the offing.
'Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow,' Trump tweeted. 'Among many other things, we will build the wall!'
The new Trump directives will also stop most refugees including those from Syria coming to America while vetting processes are reviewed.
The one exception is religious minorities fleeing persecution - which would apply to Christians fleeing Syria and other Muslim majority countries, according to several congressional aides and immigration experts briefed on the matter.
In total over the next few days, Trump is expected to:
 Direct federal funds toward the construction of a wall along the southern border
 Target so-called 'sanctuary' cities that decline to prosecute undocumented aliens
Measures still being finalized and subject to change include:
 A four-month freeze on admission of all refugees
 Grant exceptions to Christians and other minorities fleeing Muslim persecution
 Halt visas to people from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen because the Muslim-majority countries that are 'terror prone'
 The visa bans would last at least 30 days while vetting processes are reviewed
 Stop protecting illegal immigrants who arrived in the US as children from deportation
The proposed plans include at least a four-month halt on all refugee admissions, as well as temporary ban on people coming from some Muslim majority countries, according to a representative of a public policy organization that monitors refugee issues.
There is also likely to be an exception in the refugee stoppage for those fleeing religious persecution if their religion is a minority in their country.
That exception could cover Christians fleeing Muslim-majority nations.
The Republican president was expected to sign the orders at the Washington headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security, whose responsibilities include immigration and border security.
On the campaign trail, Trump initially proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States to protect Americans from jihadist attacks.
Both Trump and his nominee for attorney general, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions, have since said they would focus the restrictions on countries whose migrants could pose a threat, rather than placing a ban on people who follow a specific religion.
Many Trump supporters decried Democratic President Barack Obama's decision to increase the number of Syrian refugees admitted to the United States over fears that those fleeing the country's civil war would carry out attacks.
Detractors could launch legal challenges to the moves if all the countries subject to the ban are Muslim-majority nations, said immigration expert Hiroshi Motomura at UCLA School of Law. Legal arguments could claim the executive orders discriminate against a particular religion, which would be unconstitutional, he said.
"His comments during the campaign and a number of people on his team focused very much on religion as the target," Motomura said.
Stephen Legomsky, who was chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, said the president had the authority to limit refugee admissions and the issuance of visas to specific countries if the administration determined it was in the publics interest.
'From a legal standpoint, it would be exactly within his legal rights,' said Legomsky, a professor at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. 'But from a policy standpoint, it would be terrible idea because there is such an urgent humanitarian need right now for refugees.' 
To block entry from the designated countries, Trump is likely to instruct the US State Department to stop issuing visas to people from those nations, according to sources familiar with the visa process.(Daily Mail)

United Russia re-elects PM Medvedev as leader
	
RT.COM/23 Jan, 2017 - Dmitry Medvedev has been reelected as chairman of parliamentary majority party United Russia. Other senior leaders of the party also retained their posts and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin joined itsSupreme Council. 
Boris Gryzlov was re-elected as head of United Russias Supreme Council and Sergey Neverov remains as chairman of its General Council. Former State Duma Speaker Sergey Naryshkin, who currently heads Russias Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), remains in the Supreme Council. 
In his speech before the party congress, Medvedev called United Russia the presidents main political resource and emphasized the importance developing the partys regional branches. To facilitate this, he proposed increasing the representation of regional groups in the General Council from the current 20 percent up to 30 percent. 
He also announced plans to increase the number of United Russia grassroots-level organizations to make it the same as the total number of Russias electoral constituencies. This would allow us to send monitors to every ballot station and, through this, to make the polls cleaner, Medvedev said.

Yahapalana Govt. as corrupt as its predecessor: ACF
	
The Yahapalana Government promotes corruption and protects fraudsters just as the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa Government, the Anti-Corruption Front said today.
ACF Advisor Keerthi Tennakoon said the current government which was elected to eradicate corruption had become a government of fraudsters and thieves.
A proper investigation is yet to be launched into incidents of corruption and acts of fraud with a proper judicial process to bring the perpetrators to book only a memory. This is the main reason for the country to slip further down the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) this year, he told a news conference.
He said the number one reason for corruption within the government was the Central Bank (CB) Treasury Bond sale in which former CB governor Arjuna Mahendran was involved.
Mr. Tennakoon said Mr. Mahendran still continues to interfere in state activities despite all the allegations levelled against him. We revealed that Mr. Mahendran attends meetings at the Finance Ministry to which the ministry replied by saying that the former CB governor doesnt hold any position in the ministry. We would like to know from the ministry secretary how a person who doesnt hold any post in the ministry still attends its meetings, he said.
He said the coal tender fraud was the second reason which had made the government look more corrupt. Maithri Gunaratne, who refused to sign the corrupt deal, was removed from his post as Chairman. This is how the government takes action with regard to incidents of fraud. When we reveal these deals, the government says amendments are on the way and these revelations just hurt the government. If its not corrupt, why bother he asked.
He said current situation is such that civil organizations arent even allowed to speak about the faults of the government. We have to overcome these obstacles. Otherwise, this government will also face the same fate the previous government faced and end up in the garbage heap, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
