Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will visit the Lord Balaji temple at Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh, on December 22, an Indian news agency PTI reported today.

“Wickremesinghe will arrive here (Chennai) on Dec 21 for the visit,” it said quoting officials referring to the Sri Lankan Prime Minister's tentative itinerary. 
He will take a chopper from Chennai to reach Tirupati airport (Renigunta) which is about 130 kilometers from here and proceed to the temple by road from there, they said. 

Wickremesinghe is set to return to Sri Lanka on the same day after offering prayers at the hill temple, they added. 

He was in India in October last, for an official visit and had last year offered prayers at the Sri Krishna temple at Guruvayur in Kerala.
