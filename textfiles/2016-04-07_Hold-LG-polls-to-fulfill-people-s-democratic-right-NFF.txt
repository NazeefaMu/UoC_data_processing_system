Hold LG polls to fulfill people’s democratic right: NFF


	

The National Freedom Front (NFF) today urged the government to immediately hold the local government election in order to offer peoples’ democratic rights.

Addressing a media briefing, NFF Media Spokesman Mohammed Muzammil said the local government election had been postponed since a year by depriving the peoples’ voting rights in an anti-democratic way.

“The authorities stated the delimitations issues in provincial council level as the reason for this delay. It is kind of a joke. It can be sorted out within two months if the government has well planned the delimitations. The government is not giving their priority to this issue despite of the ability to do it,” he added.

He said the Election Commissioner and the institutions such as Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE), People’s Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) and the Election Commission remained silent when it came to this issue.

“To my knowledge the Election Commission is to hold elections but not to postpone,” he added.

Meanwhile, he said the Independent Police Commission was not performing its duty in a democratic way when referring to the recent incidents such as the removal of the walking path in Wattala and the controversial accident at Rajagiriya. He also said even the Independent Election Commission was the same.  (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
