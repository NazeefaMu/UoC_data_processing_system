Issuing a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said the mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries would be enhanced by establishing bilateral diplomatic relations.

“It will also help to explore new avenues of bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade, culture, tourism, and investment,” it said.

The Joint Communiqué was signed at the Sri Lanka Permanent Mission in New York between Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations, Rohan Perera and Permanent Representative of the Principality of Andorra to the United Nations, Elisenda Vives Balmaña.
