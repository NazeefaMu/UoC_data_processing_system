Supporting academic excellence of youth with the potential to become future leaders of the country’s insurance industry and seeking further development of the company, Asian Alliance Insurance PLC has entered into a far-reaching, mutually-beneficial agreement with the Department of Finance (DFin) of the University of Kelaniya.


The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed recently by the country’s leader in innovation in the insurance industry and one of the leading local academic institutions paves the way for cooperation in many areas – including rewarding academic achievement, knowledge-sharing and social activities.


Accordingly, Asian Alliance Insurance will award the ‘Asian Alliance Gold Medal Award’ to the best student in the unit of ‘Risk and Insurance Service Management’ of the Finance Degree Programme at the Annual General Convocation, as well as a Rs. 100,000 scholarship to assist the respective student to pursue further studies in the same subject area. In addition to creating strong ties between the company and some of the country’s brightest young minds pursuing academic studies in the subject areas of finance/insurance, the agreement can lead to other areas of collaboration – including guest lectures by experts of Asian Alliance and feedback from the company on the course contents of the Insurance Degree programme expected to commence in 2017.      “Considering the dearth of professionals in specialized areas such as actuarial operations, this agreement represents an important landmark to us, as well as perhaps to Sri Lanka’s entire insurance industry, by drawing attention and directing talent towards the insurance sector,” Asian Alliance Insurance PLC Managing Director, Iftikar Ahamed said. “In addition, being an organisation which continuously strives to be ahead in the sphere of learning and development, we are pleased to support and reward 
academic achievement.”
