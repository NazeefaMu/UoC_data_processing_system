Reiterating its commitment in adding value to the citizens of Sri Lanka, Seylan Bank introduced the ‘Seylan Income Saver’, a novel proposition devised for corporates and employees to offer a wide array of benefits for savings account holders and their fixed incomes.


Seylan Income Saver encompasses a two in one offering that includes the Seylan Income Saver payroll, a service that offers corporates to automate their salaries in real time to employee’s accounts and the Seylan Income Saver service which is the only account that values salaries and all other fixed incomes with a multitude of benefits.

Account holders with an income between Rs.50,000 – Rs.149,000 will be entitled to a personal loan valued at 12 times of their total income whilst being offered an additional interest of one percent for maintaining an account balance exceeding Rs.50,000. Customers of this scheme can also avail themselves to a home loan and enjoy the many benefits offered through the Seylan Gold Debit and Credit Card.


Furthermore, account holders with an income between Rs.150,000 – Rs.299,999 will receive a host of benefits that include a Seylan Platinum Debit Card with a daily ATM withdrawal limit up to Rs.250,000 with personalized services from a dedicated bank representative and personal and housing loans. Additionally, income savers with an earning of over Rs.300,000 will receive exclusive privileges such as personalized services by a senior bank representative with 50 percent off for safe deposit lockers subject to availability at the branch and will become eligible for Seylan personal loan and housing loans as well.


Commenting on the launch Seylan Bank Retail Banking Deputy General Manager Tilan Wijeyesekara said: “The Seylan Income Saver service was conceptualized to fulfill the aspirations of both corporates and employees alike. This proposition will enable companies to transform its traditional way of depositing salaries to a faster and efficient salary upload system. Therefore, employees will experience fast and convenient transactional solutions with multiple benefits that not only value their salary account but all other fixed incomes as well. This service further offers greater value for corporates by providing the option of coupling the product with their company’s ERP system which significantly improves the efficiency and allows better management of the employees’ payment system. The Seylan Income Saver will further enhance banking solutions for its customers by providing the best products and services at their fingertips.”


A saving can be enjoyed for corporates that enroll with Seylan Payroll and enjoy special interest rates for credit packages subject to business volumes. Companies under Seylan Payroll are eligible to obtain a business credit card, which can be used to carry out safer and faster business transactions.
Seylan Income Savers will receive free mobile and internet banking services coupled with the opportunity to win gifts and rewards from Seylan Sure rewards scheme, a benefit scheme designed to offer special gifts for occasions such as weddings, during birth of a child, and in the event of passing the grade-five scholarship exam, O/L with eight A’s and A/L with
