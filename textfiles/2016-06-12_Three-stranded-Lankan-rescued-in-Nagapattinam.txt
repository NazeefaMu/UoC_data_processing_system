Three Sri Lankan, including a two-year-old girl, were rescued from a stranded fishing boat off Kodiakarai coast by fishermen of Nagapattinam on Saturday.

Fishermen of Akkaraipettai, who ventured in a boat owned by Kumar, rescued the Lankans after seeing them struggling for life at mid sea.

The Sri Lankans, said to be from Vavuniya, were identified as Dushyant (27), Dwaraka (24) and Kakitha (2).

They were reportedly starving for food for a few days till the fishermen spotted them and subsequently brought them to Nagapattinam on Saturday night.

Commandant S.M. Patnaik, Commanding Officer, Coast Guard Station, Karaikal, told The Hindu that there was no immediate information on how their boat got stranded in the Indian waters.

Upon reaching the shore, they were provided with first aid and food.

They had been sent to a hospital for medical check up. Asked whether they were heading for Australia, he said it could not be ruled out. However, it would be ascertained only after a detailed enquiry.(The Hindu)
