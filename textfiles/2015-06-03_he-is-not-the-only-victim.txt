He is not the only victim!


	


	
	So the Customs Chief finally bade farewell to his job. He is reported to have bowed out because he could no longer stomach the harassment and interference by a certain political heavyweight. 

They alleged that the political heavyweight would often give the official orders like release that container, grant that person some relief and give him a duty waiver. And he never listened when the official tried to explain the legal snags in the way of carrying out his orders. Incidentally, an excise bigwig also quit his job about three weeks ago, because the same political heavyweight had become a severe headache to him, they say.
