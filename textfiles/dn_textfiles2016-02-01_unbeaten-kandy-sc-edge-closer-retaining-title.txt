Police fought back with two back to back penalties fired by full back Reza Mubarak to reduce the lead to 6-8.
In the 18th minute a desperate kick ahead by a Police defender was cleanly collected by winter Richard Dharmapala who went a quick pass to centre Gayan Weeraratne who blitzed his way nearly 40 metres to score by the right corner flag. Ratwatte missed a difficult conversion. Kandy 13-6.
A 30-metre penalty fired by Mubarak saw the gap narrowed down to 9-13. But Kandy did not allow the game to slip away and in the 22nd minute scrum half Roshan Weeraratne collecting a loose ball made good ground before slipping a pass to winger Dharmapala who scored near the post. Ratwatted surprisingly kicked astray. Kandy 18-9.
In the sixth minute after the short break Ratwatte joined the three quarters to score mid left and he also added the extra points for Kandy to extend their lead to 25-9.
In the 10th minute full back Mubarak fired his fourth penalty of the match to close the gap to 12-25.
Kandy further increased their lead when scrum half Roshan Weeraratne picking the ball from the scrum sent winger Dharmapala who sprinted about 40-metres to score far right and Ratwatte added the extra points. Kandy 32-12.
It was winger Dharmapala who scored again by slicing through Police defence to far left and full back Arshad Jamaldeen goalled the try. Kandy 39-12.
Police scored their only try of the match when centre Mushin Faleel made the break for Mohammed Afsal to score mid right but Mubarak’s convension attempt was off target. Police 17-39.
