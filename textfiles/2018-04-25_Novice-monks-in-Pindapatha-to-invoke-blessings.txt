A Pindapatha, organised by the Colombo Municipal Council and the Ministry of Buddhasasana to coincide with Vesak, was held in Colombo this morning giving an opportunity to lay people to perform the meritorious deed of offering food to the monks.  Several novice monks took part in the Pindapatha and were seen being helped by the laity.
