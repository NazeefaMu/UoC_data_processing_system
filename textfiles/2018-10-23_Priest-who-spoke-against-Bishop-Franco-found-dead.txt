Hindustan Times (Thiruvananthapuram), Oct 22, 2018 - Senior priest Father Kuriakose Kattuthara who had testified against former Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal accused of raping a nun, was found dead Monday morning, reports said.   


His family said they suspected foul play.   


His brother Jose Kattuthara, told local news channels that church authorities called this morning and informed him that his brother was found dead in his room which had been locked from inside.   


Church officials reportedly told the priest’s brother that Fr. Kattuththara possibly died of a heart attack.   


But Jose Kattuthara remains suspicious. He said he would be filing a complaint and will move the Kerala High Court to cancel Bishop Mulakkal’s bail.  Father Kuriakose Kattuthara had claimed that there were attempts by the church to hush up the sexual assault complaint of the nun against Bishop Mulakkal of Jalandhar diocese.
