Will surround Colombo on 15: GMOA


	

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today warned that it would surround the Colombo City on Friday (15) if the government failed to provide an lasting solution to the SAITM issue.

It said that the Presidential committee appointed to look into the matter headed by Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was to hand over its report last Monday (11) but had failed to do so leaving them with no option put to launch a trade union action.

GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa said the there was no use in appointing Presidential committees as only the Health Minister’s views were being sought and would be implemented.

Therefore he warned the government to brace itself for a backlash as the whole of Colombo would be surrounded by members of the GMOA and many anti-SAITM forces on Friday (15), thus causing the authorities much inconvenience if they did not solve the issue before that.

He advised the general public to get ready to be inconvenienced as a result or to avoid entering Colombo during the time the trade union action would take place.

Further, he said the GMOA had given the government a deadline, which was September 21 to come up with a solution to the SAITM issue and warned that an Islandwide trade union action would be launched after the deadline date. “After the 21st the government will experience unprecedented trade union action that would be launched by us,” he said.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
