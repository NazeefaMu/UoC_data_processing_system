SL floods seen in before-and-after NASA animated image


	

Before and after images captured from space show the severity of flooding that plagued Sri Lanka in late May after rains that triggered hundreds of mudslides and killed more than 200 people.

The MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite captured a false-color image of the flood on May 28, according to NASA. An earlier image taken on Jan. 29 by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 shows the same area before the waters rose.
The false-color photos combine infrared and visible imagery to enhance the shading, where greens and blues are sharpened to highlight the flood's widespread impact.

Torrential rain fell for more than 48 hours in parts of the country in late May, with the southern city of Matara receiving the brunt of the deluge. More than half a million people have been affected by the flooding. (Weather.com)
