Tug o’ war stalls appointment


	



 

The administrative head of a statutory body in the telecommunications sector got his walking papers recently due to falling foul of the political heavyweights. 

 


A person to act in the vacant post was appointed soon after, but so far no permanent appointment has been made to fill the vacant post.  A tug o’ war between the powerful Greens and Blues, both keen on having their own pick for the key post has resulted in the inordinate delay in making a permanent appointment, they say.    


So the indications are that acting person may have to bat on for an indefinite period.
