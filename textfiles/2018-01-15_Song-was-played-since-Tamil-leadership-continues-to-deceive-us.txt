We aired the Tamil song “Niththiraya Thamila Nee Nimirnthu Parada” as the Tamil leadership continued to deceive the Tamil people, Jaffna District Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan said.

The introduction of the SLFP candidate for Jaffna and the election manifesto was released on Friday. The event began followed by airing the Tamil song “Niththiraya Thamila Nee Nimirnthu Parada” and certain songs composed by the LTTE.

Apparently, the matter became the topic in the Southern politics when Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa twittered whether Maithri had granted recognition to Tamil Eelam. Under these circumstances, news flashed across the social websites on Saturday, that President Maithripala Sirisena had reprimanded Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanathan.

However, when he was questioned about it, Parliamentarian Ramanathan said that he had too viewed the news on social websites and was amused as there was no truth, whatsoever, in it and such an incident did not take place at all.

"A Tamil renaissance song was aired and hence one need not view that with an ulterior motive. We belong to the SLFP and just because we support them, we need not shelve our sentiments as Tamils. When the Tamil leadership continued to deceive us we cannot close our eyes and maintain silence. That was the reason that we aired the song. Meanwhile, I will respond to Namal’s question at the appropriate time in the proper place," he said. (M. Roshanth)
