Report on SLPA corruption in two to three weeks

The report of the Committee headed by President's Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty to probe allegations of fraud and corruption at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority will be out within another two to three weeks, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana.
The Minister said the report would be handed over to the President and the Prime minister as soon as he receives it. He also said the report would be forwarded to the relevant authorities to take necessary action. The Committee is comprised of four members and was assigned to probe fraud and corruption charges in the Ports Authority during the previous government.
