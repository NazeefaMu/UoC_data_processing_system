	The death of former Havelock’s Rugby captain, Wasim Thajudeen was not accidental but a murder, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) informed the Colombo Additional Magistrate today.
	The CID informed Magistrate Nishantha Peiris that the investigations conducted so far had revealed that Mr. Thajudeen’s teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death. The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of broken glass.
	The CID said the government analyst's report and the postmortem report on the death of the ruggerite appeared to be contradictory and that the death was not an accident but murder.
	Further magisterial inquiry into the matter was postponed for tomorrow (28).
	The former Havelocks SC captain Wasim Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo in May 2012.
	Earlier the police had said that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds on Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.
	Although police said the death was accidental, SSP Ajith Rohana, on February 26 this year, said there were grounds for suspicion. He said that according to the JMO his death could not have been due to the accident. (Lakmal Sooriyagoda)
