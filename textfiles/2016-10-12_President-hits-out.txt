President hits out


	

President Maithripala Sirisena expressed his extreme displeasure and disgust today at the dragging to court of the former defence secretary and three former commanders of the Navy, in a case filed by the Bribery Commission.

He said lawyers who appeared in the case had alleged that he was behind these actions. He said he did not know about them until later.

“I knew only that morning that there was such a case,” he said.

“There are objectives and a policy in establishing independent commissions. Those who are in these commissions should know their subject areas. Those who are not aware of national security, military administration and management are taking various wrong decisions without thinking,” he said.

President Sirisena said the top officials of the respective institutions had a right and a responsibility to inform him and the Defence Minister of these matters.

“Some people may say that it should not be so as these are independent commissions. Even though commissioners were appointed by the constitutional council, it is I, the President, who appoint the Chairman and the Director General of these commissions,” he said.

He expressed these views at a function, “Sathviru Urumaya” held at the Foundation Institute to hand over the deeds of houses and lands to military officers.

He said if there was an issue with regard to the Defence Ministry and Avant Garde, there were a procedure and methodology to investigate it.

He said some people, including former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, took political advantage when they were taken to court.

“I was not elected President to intervene in judicial matters or influence independent commissions or pressure the Attorney General to release rapists. I was elected to carry out political reforms and uphold democracy, judicial independence and law and order. I will not surrender to anyone when meeting my responsibilities. I will not act to weaken the security forces nor allow others to do so,” he said.

Commenting on the remanding of some army intelligence officers in the Ekneligoda case, he said he had advised the relevant officials to take action against them if they had done wrong, grant them bail and hear the case -- or release them if they were not guilty.

“I did not talk about these matters in public earlier, but I have to do so now and take action,” he said.

He said that he had raised the matter at a special meeting with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet and pointed out that he would have to take action if the CID, FCID and Bribery Commission were acting according to some political agenda.

“These institutions cannot function according to a political agenda. The law should be the same for everyone. People allege that I was behind these things. I do not want to remand or imprison anyone. I want to tell you this today, if not I will be blamed,” he said.

He said his government had been able to mitigate the allegations of human rights violations and settle proposals for hybrid courts and international judges.

He said that, despite this, some were accusing him of betraying and weakening the security forces and destroying the country for his political advantage.

“Anyone can come and discuss these matters with me, “he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
