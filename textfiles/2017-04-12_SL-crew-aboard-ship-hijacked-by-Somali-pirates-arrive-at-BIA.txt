Eight Sri Lankans, who were aboard the oil tanker captured by the Somali pirates recently, arrived at the Bandaranaike International Airport a short while ago.

They were welcomed by family members after disembarking the Qatar Airways QR 654 flight from Doha.

The oil tanker they were working on was hijacked by Somali pirates while it was in the Indian Ocean on March 13, the first such successful hijack of a commercial ship by Somali pirates since 2012.

They were released without a ransom be made. (T K G Kapila)
