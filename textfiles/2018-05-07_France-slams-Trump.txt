France, (rt.com), 6 May, 2018 -France’s foreign ministry and some former top officials have condemned the US President for claiming that the Bataclan carnage and other 2015 terrorist attacks could have been avoided if the country had looser gun ownership laws.   


“France expresses its firm disapproval of the comments by President Trump… and asks for the memory of the victims to be respected,” said a statement from the foreign ministry, in relation to the series of coordinated attacks in which 130 victims were killed in suicide bombings and by gunfire by a group of Islamist terrorists. “France is proud to be a country where acquiring and carrying firearms is strictly regulated,” the ministry emphasized.   


Calling Trump’s comments “shameful” and “obscene” on his Twitter, former President Francois Hollande noted that the US leader’s statements exposed “what he thinks of France and its values.”   
Manuel Valls, prime minister at the time of the attacks, called Trump “indecent and incompetent,” adding “What more can I say?”
