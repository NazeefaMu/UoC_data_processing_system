Govt. wants ‘Online Referendum’ on Interim Report


	

The Government has decided to get public opinion on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee on Constitution making via online.

Sources from the Prime Minister's office told the Daily Mirror that the Facebook and a number of other websites would be used for this purpose.

“Opinion of the public would be sought through web comments and postings on Facebook pages,” sources said.

They said Sri Lanka would become the first country in the Asia Pacific region to do so.

Officials, who called this exercise as Online Referendum, said the process of gathering public opinion online would be done when the debate on the new Constitution ends on Wednesday. (Yohan Perera)
