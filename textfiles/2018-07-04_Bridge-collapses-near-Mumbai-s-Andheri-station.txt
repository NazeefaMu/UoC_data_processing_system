 Hindustan Times(Mumbai), Jul 03 2018-A part of a foot overbridge collapsed at Andheri station in Mumbai on Tuesday morning following heavy rain, hitting suburban local train services, a Western Railway spokesman said.  The bridge is part of the Gokhale bridge on SV Road that connects Andheri West to East. The collapse damaged the overhead wire structures, hampering train services on Western and Suburban lines.  Central railway trains were also running late due to heavy rain.  Five people injured in the bridge collapse have been sent to the hospital, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) told ANI.
