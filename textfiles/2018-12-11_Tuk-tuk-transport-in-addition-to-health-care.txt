Tuk-tuk transport in addition to health care!


	

A coterie of henchmen of an upcountry politico well-known for his napping habit at public functions has taken over the full control of a medical institution in his area.   

 


These henchmen who account for most of the minor staff of this institution is reportedly taxing the outdoor and indoor patients for every odd job they perform for them though these jobs are part and parcel of their official duties.   


Most minor employees also function as tuk-tuk owner-drivers and the indoor patients are compelled to hire their vehicles to get back home when they are discharged on recovery.   


When an inhouse patient is discharged, a minor employee on duty would shed his uniform and offer him transport back home by his tuk-tuk. These tuk-tuks are taking up a major part of the space in the hospital premises, they say.   


The hospital authorities turn a blind eye to the activity of these minor employees fearing reprisals from the powerful politico responsible for appointing these employees.
