This politico, a former purohita is about to make yet another pole-vault, they say.

 


A well-known political turncoat, the man had been keeping a low profile for some time.


Now set to ride with the tide, he is said to have recently met a group of constituents to feel their pulse about his intention to throw in his lot with Pohottuwa. 


Once this politico came in for severe flak when he tried to whitewash a close buddy who had drawn pay from a government establishment while working elsewhere.
