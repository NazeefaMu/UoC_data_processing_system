SYDNEY REUTERS Oct 16 -  Crowds thronged the Sydney Opera House and the shores of the city’s sparkling harbour on Tuesday to catch a glimpse of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, on their first public appearance in Australia since the announcement they were expecting a child. 

 
 The royal couple began their official tour of Australia with a ferry ride across the harbour to greet cheering crowds packed in front of the Opera House, which was opened by Harry’s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, 45 years ago.   


 “We’re both absolutely delighted to be here. We genuinely couldn’t think of a better place to announce the upcoming baby, be it a boy or a girl,” Harry told a reception at Admiralty House, the official residence of the governor-general.
