The charred body of a former Member of Pradeshiya Sabha was found inside a trishaw which was destroyed by fire along with another vehicle in front of a house at Palayvila, Unalla, Matara this morning, Kotavila Police said.

The deceased had been identified as former PS member Charles Ananda (48), a resident of Eduwa, Godagama who was a father of two children.

According to preliminary investigations the police learned that the trishaw had collided with a car which had been parked under the porch of a house in the area.
