Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) said it will extend its fullest cooperation to the International Cricket Council to investigate the latest allegations levelled via media reports, over ‘’match fixing’’.

CEO of the SLC Ashley De Silva, is in contact with the CEO of the International Cricket Council, David Richardson and the ICC Anti-Corruption Unit on the matter.
 
“Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to state that it has zero tolerance towards corruption and will take immediate action against any person involved in the alleged incident, if found guilty,” the SLC said.

In the meantime, SLC is constantly engaged with the ICC and is following its guidelines on how to handle anti-corruption operations for the forthcoming tours in Sri Lanka, according to the SLC.
