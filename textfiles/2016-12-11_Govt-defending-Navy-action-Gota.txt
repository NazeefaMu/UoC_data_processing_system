Former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa commenting on the yesterday’s incident which took place at the protest held at the Hambantota harbour said the government was defending the Navy's unlawful action.

A tense situation prevailed at the Hambantota Port when the navy tried to release the two ships seized by workers staging a protest at the port. Navy personnel fired warning shots to disperse the protesters. The Navy Commander is also alleged to have threatened a journalist who was present  at the scene.



In a tweet, Mr. Rajapaksa said “The same government that persecutes our military for winning the war is now defending the Navy's unlawful and embarrassing recent action.”
