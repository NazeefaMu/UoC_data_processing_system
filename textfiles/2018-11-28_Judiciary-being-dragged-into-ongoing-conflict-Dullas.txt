Judiciary being dragged into ongoing conflict: Dullas


	

UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday said the judiciary is being dragged into the ongoing conflict between the Executive and the Legislature.

He said convening of parliament when two cases are pending in the Supreme Court over the dissolution of parliament was one example of judiciary being dragged into this conflict.

“The parliament, which represents the supremacy of the people, did not even have an agenda when the session commenced on Tuesday. The content of the court cases are being distorted by convening parliament. This is an attempt of dragging Judiciary into the current conflict,” the MP said, speaking at a news briefing held at the Prime Minister’s Office.

Meanwhile, he said there were previous examples where speakers of parliament had allowed the government to give majority representation in the Committee of Collection in Parliament.

“When W.J.M. Loku Bandara was appointed Speaker in 2004, he allocated 14 slots out of the 23 to the UPFA government. Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa assigned nine slots out of 15-member PSC to the UNP led unity government in 2015. This is the tradition ,” he said.

He also said the people should be allowed to make a decision about the governing party of the country at this moment. “The General Election is the only solution,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
