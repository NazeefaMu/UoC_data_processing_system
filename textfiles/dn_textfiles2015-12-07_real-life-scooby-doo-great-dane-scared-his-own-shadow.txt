Real life Scooby-Doo Great Dane is scared of his own shadow

Standing 3ft tall and weighing more than 13stone, Presley the Great Dane should have other dogs cowering in fear at his size.
But Presley is a real-life Scooby-Doo who hides timidly behind his owner Sian Barratt when smaller dogs approach him.
Following our story last week, he captured the hearts of fans across the world, with Sian even receiving messages from the US.
So we went along to meet Presley to see if he really is a scaredy cat, or rather, dog.
The problem becomes immediately clear when we arrive at Sian's detached house in Oldbury, West Mids.
Presley has not one but four mums - two doggy, two human - making him the baby of the family.
He lives in the specially converted garage with mum Echo (six) and Gran Daisy (eight) and is also mothered by Sian (47) and her daughter Levi (23).
Presley has his own comfort blanket that he carries around the house, and snuggles up next to Sian on the sofa at night.
Dog breeder Sian says: "We definitely baby him. I've had him since birth and as soon as he was born there was something about him - we knew we were going to keep him. Levi adores him, and he adores her." But it isn't just Levi who Presley loves - he follows Sian around the house like a little, or rather, big lapdog.
"He wants to be with me all the time," she says. "He's not allowed upstairs and if I go up he cries. It is like having a toddler."
Sian lets him out of his garage suite and he nervously pops his head around the living room door. Following reassurance from her, he trots in. I have seen smaller ponies.
But Presley is obviously a people dog - soon he is poking his big jowls in my face and wagging his tail at the attention.
"Be careful of his tail," warns Sian. "I once ended up with a black eye when he ­accidentally wagged it in my face."
We try to set off for a walk, but it is raining - and Presley is scared of the rain.
Sian tries to coax him out the front door, offering him a brolly. But it is no good, Presley isn't having any of it.
Even simple chores can be a problem. As he is glued to Sian's side most of the time she has to pick her moment even to empty the bins.
She explains: "He doesn't like bin liners." She gets one out and Presley darts out of the room.
He also isn't keen on having his claws clipped. As soon as the clippers appear, Presley gives her a look as if to say: "You aren't coming near me with those."
Let's see how he fares with TV's Mr Nasty, Simon Cowell. The X Factor supremo has reduced many contestants to tears, but this time Presley just wags his tail, perhaps sensing that Simon is a real animal lover. Sian explains: "It's not the big things that faze Presley - it is random things that scare him. The other night I lit some candles and he wouldn't go near them.
"I used to keep my exercise bike behind the living room door, but Presley wouldn't come in the room. When I take him out, people cross the road. But he is just a gentle giant."
Fed on a diet of raw chicken carcasses and tripe, he is pure muscle. A lean, mean, machine. Well, not so mean.
"He's a lover not a fighter," says Sian. "I was in the park with him and two West Highland terriers ran up. He ran off. When I take all three dogs out, Daisy and Echo protect him. His mum doesn't like other dogs coming up to him."
But Presley is no longer a baby. He turns three in January on the birthday of his namesake Elvis Presley.
And while he may have gained fans, there are others who have criticised his nature. Sian says: "I've had loads of wonderful messages, but some people have said I shouldn't have such a big dog if I can't train him, or I don't socialise him or he needs to see a behaviourist. "He doesn't need that at all. He isn't generally anxious, he is just a lovely natured dog with a few quirks."
Levi adds: "He just has a timid nature. The other night he was going to sleep on the sofa and I went to say good night and he nearly jumped out of his skin." Someone walks in front of Sian's house and Presley leaps forward barking - then thinks twice about such bravado and jumps back nervously.
This barking dog never bites.
