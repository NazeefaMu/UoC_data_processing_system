	TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran said the TNA friendly people were being led astray by Chief Minister of Northern Province C.V. Vigneswaran.
	Commenting on the Tamil People’s Council established recently under the Chief Minister, the parliamentarian told the media during the Tsunami commemoration in Jaffna that the Tamil community would not desert the TNA or its leadership. He pointed out that they would take a decision on the politicians who attempt to overlook the TNA. The parliamentarian said the Tamil People’s Committee was a clear indication of the Chief Minister’s anti-TNA movement.
	Meanwhile, TNA leader R. Sampanthan and the Chief Minister had met at the TNA’s Legal Advisor K.Kanageshwaran’s residence in Bambalapitiya to sort out the differences. Although the media was not allowed the cover the meeting, the Chief Minister told the media that the talks were a success.
	However, the TNA leader said that the talks were based on the Tamil Peoples’ Council. He said the Chief Minister was a public representative just as the members of the TNA and that they discussed on their responsibility to fulfil the aspirations of the people. (Romesh Madusanka)
