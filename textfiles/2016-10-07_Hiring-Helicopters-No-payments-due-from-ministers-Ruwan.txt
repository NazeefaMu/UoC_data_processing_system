State Minister of Defense, Ruwan Wijewardene today confirmed that there were no payments due from any minister or professional for hiring helicopters from the Sri Lanka Air force.

The following is his statement on this matter:

"A front page story of the Daily Mirror on October 7, 2016 says, 'Several ministers, officials did not pay for hiring helicopters.' This is in connection with the answer I tabled yesterday in relation to the question asked by MP Udaya Gammanpila. The news item had implicated several ministers including John Amaratunga, Rajitha Senaratne, Harin Fernando, Sagala Ratnayake, Gayantha Karunatilleka, and Faizer Mustapha and some officials.

"I have to clearly state that this is false. None of the ministers or officials have to pay any dues to the Air Force. All the ministers and officials have paid for their trips. There is no truth in the story that they had not paid. Most of these ministers have accompanied either the President or the Prime minister. Therefore no money is due from these ministers. I would also like to say that we do not invite foreign dignitaries and tell them to pay for travelling by helicopters," the state minister said. (Yohan Perera)
