State Minister and SLFP media spokesman Dilan Perera yesterday questioned as to how and why the controversial Primary Dealer Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.still remained in the Bond Market if the Central Bank conducted an internal inquiry on its conduct and took action accordingly.

He said the SLFP would take a decision on incumbent Central Bank Governor Indrajith Cumaraswamy if action is not taken against the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd,.

Minister Perera responding to a journalist at the weekly SLFP news briefing at the party office said the SLFP still had confidence in Mr. Cumaraswamy as a man of words and a professional with integrity but his stand on the controversial bond market dealer was confusing.

The journalist referring to a Central Bank communique released yesterday on the issuance of Rs. 57,000 million Treasury Bonds had instructed the public to purchase Treasury Bonds from 16 Primary Dealers including Perpetual Treasuries Ltd.

The journalist asked Minister Perera as to how and why this particular controversial Primary Dealer still remains in the Bond Market after allegations had been leveled against the company by the COPE inquiry report in Parliament. The COPE inquiry had found the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. had engaged in improper bond dealings.

“I can’t understand as to how and why the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. Continues to deal in the Bond Market after Mr. Cumaraswami’s repeated claims that he had conducted several internal inquires on this company and took appropriate measures accordingly. I would like to know about these so called inquiries and action taken against the company if what Mr. Cumarswami tells us is true,” Minister Perera stressed.

Minister Perera added that the Parliament would debate the COPE report in January and the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will send the report to the Attorney General for his review and necessary legal action on the bond scam. (Sandun A Jayasekera)
