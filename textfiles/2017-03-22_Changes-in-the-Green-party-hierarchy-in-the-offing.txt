The Green party is going to have three assistant leaders soon. The creation of these three posts came under discussion at the Working Committee meeting held last week, they say.

 


Meanwhile, the number of Deputy Leaders are to be increased to three. There is the likelihood of the young politico from Kuliyapitiya who had a meteoric rise to the top team status overnight, being elevated to general secretarial status. The Working Committee will approve some of these new appointments at its next meeting, they say.
