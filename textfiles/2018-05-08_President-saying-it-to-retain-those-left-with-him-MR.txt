Responding to President Maithripala Sirisena’s statement that he won’t retire in 2020, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa told the Joint Opposition’s May Day rally in Galle yesterday that President Sirisena had to say so to hold on to those left with him today by his side.

Addressing the rally which was held at the Samanala Grounds in Galle, Mr. Rajapaksa said the people rejected the United National Party (UNP), Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) at the previous local government election.

“That was the clear mandate of the people. However, the President had to make the statement at the May Day rally to keep those who left with him by his side. Otherwise, he would lose them as well. At the same time, Mr. Sirisena is afraid of taking important decisions whereas the government keeps making unproductive decisions such as changing the day of May Day and Vesak,” he said.

He said the government lacks the capability of managing the country as the number of dengue cases had increased due to mounting garbage dumps, garbage dumps have been collapsed killing people, prices of essential items including gas and milk power had increased and the underworld figures are roaming free.

“Police officers have been deployed to provide security to a wedding of underworld figures. Police baton charges women. The government is incapable of administrating a Grama Niladhari areas let alone a country,” he said.

Referring to the Salawa Army Camp Fire, he said the incident was not an accident but a planned event. "Salawa was exploded systematically. Still, no compensation had been paid to the victims," Mr.Rajapaksa said.

Meanwhile, he said both the President and the Prime Minister were attempting to outdo each other. “The President said the Premier was surrounded by the corrupt and the Premier set the trap for the President’s Chief of Staff,” he said.

Taking a swipe at the government for fiscal mismanagement, Mr. Rajapaksa said they would salvage the country from what he called a ‘state financial terrorism,’

“We are ready to fight the state financial terrorism which burdens the masses. We won’t dance to the tune of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or other powerhouses,” he said.
