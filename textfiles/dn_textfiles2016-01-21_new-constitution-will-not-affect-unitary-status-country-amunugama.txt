New Constitution will not affect unitary status of country - Amunugama

The unitary status of the country would never be affected by the new constitution to be drafted in the near future, said Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Dr. Sarath Amunugama.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have clearly noted that the unitary status included in the the present Constitution would remain unchanged in the new Constitution scheduled to be drafted. He said so addressing an SLFP weekly media briefing yesterday at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo.
Minister Amunugama added that certain politicians in the opposition, including Professor G.L. Peiris, Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila levelled baseless allegations that the unitary status of the country would be removed from the Constitution that is to be drafted.
“The unitary status and prominent place for Buddhism would not be changed with the new Constitution under the presidency of President Sirisena, since unitary status was included to the Constitution by a then SLFP government on the advice of then Prime Minister the late Sirimavo Bandaranaike,” he said.
Even though Professor G. L. Peiris speaks much on the unitary status of the country now, there had been no word about unitary status in the 2,000 Constitution which was drafted by him.
Speaking on the Therawada Kathikawatha Bill, Minister Amunugama said that it was formally drafted in 2011 due to continuous requests by the Three Chief Incumbents and the general public. The move to draft the Therawada Kathikawatha was accepted by all Sanga Sabhas. The Therawada Kathikawatha Bill was presented in Parliament for the betterment of the Maha Sangha and Buddhism.
However, the measures taken to present the Therawada Kathikawatha Bill in Parliament is being highly criticized by certain Bikkhus and people. Therefore, President Sirisena had said at a Cabinet meeting held recently the the Bill be studied at leisure and make amendments if necessary after considering the views of the Maha Sangha and the public.
Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that not even a single phrase of the new Constitution had yet been drafted. But several politicians are trying for political advantages, by leveling baseless allegations. The new Constitution would be prepared with the active participation of 225 members of Parliament.
When questioned as to whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and several SLFP parliamentarians were forming a new party with the aim of contesting the forthcoming local government elections, he said that no SLFP parliamentarian had said so.
“No SLFP parliamentarians have said so. But opposition members of other parties say so. But people who are unable to win elections contesting alone, are trying to divide the SLFP,” he said.
