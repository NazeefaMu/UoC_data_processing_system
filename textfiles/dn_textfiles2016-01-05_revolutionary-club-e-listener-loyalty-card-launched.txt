Revolutionary 'Club e' listener loyalty card launched

 
In a thrilling, Sri Lankan-first E FM has unveiled the revolutionary "Club e" listener loyalty card, which rewards fans with unique giveaways and never-to-be-sold collectible "Club e" branded merchandise. This move by Sri Lanka's Lifestyle station E FM allows loyal fans exciting, ongoing opportunities to earn valuable prizes, and all they have to do is listen to E FM programmes to take part in on-air and online promos and other special offers. All it takes to become a "Club e" member is to visit clube.efm.lk, sign up and fill in your profile. Listeners will earn points by watching out for and participating in on-air and online promos and special offers. They will then have access to tons of "Club e" merchandise including pen drives, mobile power banks, mugs, bags, t-shirts, umbrellas when earning enough points to redeem these exclusive items. And, for those wanting to show their on-air skills, there is also an option having earned 1,500 points to use them towards a 30-minute on-air Live Studio Sitting accompanied by their favourite E FM Radio Personality.
Importantly, "Club e" members can also earn and redeem points provided by sponsors and partners of E FM programming, which finally answers the age old marketing question: "How do we get radio audiences into our stores?" Simply take your "Club e" card to a selected partner merchant and swipe the card to earn points. If a listener chooses to buy an item from a partner merchant then they get even more points and, in addition, they will be entitled to special discounts only available for "Club e" members.
"The revolutionary 'Club e' card allows loyal E FM fans to earn points and, following that, redeem these points for exclusive 'Club e' merchandise and giveaways. They can do this only by listening in for special 'Club e' promo codes that are periodically given out on-air and online, which they then enter after logging-in to clube.efm.lk. This novel concept has never been tried before in Sri Lanka and we are proud to bring this solely listener-centric innovation to our loyal fans, allowing them the chance to win even more while listening to E FM", EBC Radio Chief Operating Officer Chalaka Gajabahu said.
