UNP Matara District MP Buddika Pathirana today said he has been subjected to different kind of treatment in Parliament at times.

Mr Pathirana came out with this remark when Speaker Karu Jayasuriya hailed him for raising oral questions on the cultivation of medicinal plants in Sri Lanka.

“Raising oral questions about the cultivation of medicinal crops continuously is commendable" the Speaker said.

“Thank you Mr Speaker but some MPs laugh at me for raising such questions. My intention is to help the promotion of medicinal crops" he said.

“It is not a thing to laugh about" the Speaker responded. (Yohan Perera)
