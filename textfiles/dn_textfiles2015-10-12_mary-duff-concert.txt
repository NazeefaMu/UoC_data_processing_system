Mary Duff in Concert

Mary Duff considered one of the most popular and finest female singers will be in Sri Lanka for her solo concert this month on Saturday 24 and Sunday 25 at BMICH starting at 7pm. She will be accompanied by her 6 member band, some of whom have already performed with Daniel O'Donnell last year. She will be supported by the extremely talented young Irish country singer Jordan Mogey.
Mary Duff started her singing career at the age of 12 performing with a Rock n Roll band singing hits of Bill Haley, Fat Domino and Chuck Berry. In the 80's she was asked to join Daniel O'Donnell as the supporting singer which she still does whenever he performs in any part of the world. She has done live performances in front of 60 million American viewers which speak volumes of her success as a singer. She was in the UK Top 50 with her best selling CD “The ultimate collection”. Her other album ‘Voice of an Angel’ has given her to sing her favourite Inspirational songs. In May 2013 when she celebrated 25 years in the music industry she was awarded the ‘Female Vocalist of the Year’ by the World Irish music association.
Her concert in Sri Lanka is part of an international tour covering UK, Europe and Australia. She has picked Sri Lanka for a show as she enjoyed performing here with Daniel O'Donnell in 2014. According to her, the audience in Sri Lanka was absolutely great and that it was fun performing for them. Also this becomes a rare show as she does not get time to do solo acts because of her collaboration with DOD as she tours with him most of the time. The year 2016 and 2017 will be totally engaged with Daniel touring Europe and USA and Australia.
She will be performing for approximately 3 hours and she has informed the organizer Damayantha Kuruppu of DK promotions that she will do a wide repertoire of songs covering various genres of songs endorsing why she is labeled as “Singer of songs without classification”.
The tickets for the 2 concerts are on sale right now and one can purchase them the Events Desk at the Hilton Poolside from 10am till 6.30pm. Since there is much enthusiasm about the concert it is recommended to buy the tickets early. For details please contact Damayantha on 0777744950.
