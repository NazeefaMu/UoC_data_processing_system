The police report on the shooting at the SAITM Chief Executive Officer's vehicle will be submitted to Parliament no sooner the investigations are over, Prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

"We don't know anything about the incident and the investigation has just begun," he said when Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake requested that the investigation report on the incident be presented to Parliament to avoid any serious situations that might arise.

"Speculation is rife on this shooting incident in the wake of several speaking against SAITM while several are defending the medical school. Therefore it is essential that a proper investigation is done and the report presented to Parliament," Mr. Dissanayake said.(Yohan Perera)
