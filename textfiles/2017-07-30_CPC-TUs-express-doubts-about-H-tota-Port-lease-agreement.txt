Despite the signing of US$1.1 billion deal to lease the southern Hambantota port to China, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's (CPC) trade union Collective today expressed their concerns whether they were hoodwinked by the President Maithripala Sirisena.

CPC TU Collective Convener D J Rajakaruna told Daily Mirror the Union doubts whether the appointment given for a discussion with the President Sirisena on August 01 will be canalled and therefore sent a letter to the President for a re-confirmation.

He also said Unions were not informed about any agreement so far signed by the government on leasing the Port to China or handing over the China Bay Oil Tank Farm to India.

However, He said the Union members are still looking forward to attend the scheduled discussion with the President Sirisena and later will decide their trade union action depending on the outcome of the discussion.

Meanwhile, Mr. Rajakaruna warned the government that CPC trade union would take stern action with the support of country’s leading trade unions if the government had signed the Hambantota port original agreement without making the amendments as per assurance given by the President Sirisena.
