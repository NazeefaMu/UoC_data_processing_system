The Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) politburo member Kumar Gunaratnam has been granted Sri Lankan citizenship effective from yesterday, officials said a short while ago.

He was granted Sri Lankan citizenship following an application for citizenship earlier.

However, the authorities had directed him to cancel the Australian citizenship within the next three months.

Gunaratnam was arrested in November 2015 for violating Immigration and Emigration Laws after arriving in the country on a tourist visa. He was released from the Anuradhapura Prison after the completion of his one-year prison sentence on December 2, 2016.
