Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary MP Udaya Gammanpila today opposed the quota given to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) when allocating its members to the Parliament Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).
He said the JVP has only six parliamentarians but they have been given two members in the 12-member Committee.
“We, the other 11 parliamentarians left in the opposition had only been given the opportunity for one member. However, the JVP had been given two quotas though it has only six MPs. Therefore, we request a reasonable representation in the committee. We should be given the opportunity to allocate at least three of our members to the Committee,” he told a news conference.
