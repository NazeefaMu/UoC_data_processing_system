The army contingent provided for former Defense Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa numbering 50 had been reduced to 25 as from yesterday and they had been replaced by the Police STF.

This had been made following a decision taken by the security council to remove army contingents from providing security to VIPs and replacing them with STF cadres. It has also been decided that in the near future the remaining army cadres would also be replaced with STF cadres. (Indika Ramanayake)
