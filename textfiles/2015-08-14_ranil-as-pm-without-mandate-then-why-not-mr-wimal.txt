National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal weerawansa said if the premiership could have been given to Ranil Wickremesinghe without any mandate,President Maithripala Sirisena would certainly have to give it to former president Mahinda Rajapaksa who would win the election with a majority seats and have majority support in parliament.
Mr. Weerawansa said President Sirisena allowed Mr. Rajapaksa to lead the UPFA election campaign and as such he would certainly offer the premiership to him as well.
“President Sirisena gave nomination to Mr. Rajapaksa even with displeasure and so we are sure he will give the premiership as well even with displeasure. He is sure to say that he gave it with displeasure,” he said.
Mr. Weerawansa said president in his letter to former president Rajapaksa had accepted that UPFA would win the election and Mr. Weerawansa added that the UPFA leaders had already agreed to appoint Mr. Rajapaksaas executive prime minister.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
