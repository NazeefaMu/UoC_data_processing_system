Venus can make one either a great selfless lover or a cheap philanderer


	

Venus, the planet associated with love and beauty represents worldly happiness and sensual pleasures.


Venus also rules music, literature, good women, luxury, poetry, fine arts and wife or husband.
Venus owns the signs of Libra and Taurus. He is exalted in Pisces ruled by Jupiter and is debilitated in Virgo owned by Mercury. Mars and Saturn are his friends and Moon and Sun are enemies.
Venus rules over the venous system, kidneys, throat, and ovaries.


Ancient Rishis of India have attributed sublime qualities like kindness, compassion and Ahimsa to Venus.

 

Gets easily corrupted
Venus, the most benefic planet next to Jupiter, despite the sublime qualities he possesses, has no strong will and gets easily corrupted by powerful planets like Saturn and Mars. Venus also loses his good qualities when he is in evil Houses.

 

Factors that change his natural qualities
Now let us examine the changes Venus undergoes when he is different in signs, Houses and when associated with different planets.


Purity of Venus gets spoilt when he is in the house of Mars or when conjunct with malefics like Mars, Sun, Saturn and Rahu unless the evil effect is nullified by the aspect of Jupiter, a strong Mercury or Moon.

 

Death-inflicting power
Venus gets death-inflicting powers when he is in the 2nd and 7th Houses. His lordship over the 3rd, 6th or the 11th makes him a malefic.

 

Venus in signs owned by Mars
Venus in signs owned by Mars at birth will result in the native having intimacies with other women. He would lose his honour, reputation and all worldly possessions in the pursuit of women.

 


Venus in Libra, Taurus, Gemini, Aquarius and Pisces
Native would be handsome, healthy, intelligent and honourable, and would possess love or aptitude for music and fine arts if Venus at birth is posited in Libra, Taurus, Gemini, Aquarius and Pisces.
Venus confers marital happiness and prosperity on Aries natives if he occupies Taurus, Gemini, Libra or Aquarius.


In Aries and Scorpio, Venus causes marital problems.

 

Delays marriage
Venus delays marriage when he is in Cancer, Leo, Sagittarius, Capricorn or Scorpio.


Native would become very passionate and lascivious and would even ruin himself by going to extremes to satisfy his sexual desires if Venus occupies Taurus while being aspected by Mars from the Scorpio sign. Similar result would occur if Mars occupies Taurus when Venus is in Scorpio.


Venus in the 5th House of Leo can deny the native marital happiness. Venus in the 6th of Virgo where he is debilitated can give a sickly or impotent partner.


Venus in Sagittarius would give a good partner who is cultured and reasonable. Marriage would not be a success if Venus is posited in Capricorn.


Venus in Aquarius assures a cultured and virtuous partner from an affluent family.


Venus in Pisces where he is exalted holds out a happy married life with a kind, compassionate and considerate partner.


An Aries or Scorpio native with Venus in Gemini would get a partner from among the close relatives. Partner can be a highly qualified academic, but he would not be in good health.


A native with Venus in Cancer would get a partner from overseas who may not be attractive.


Venus in the 10th House of Leo would make finding a suitable partner very difficult.


Venus posited in the 12th of Libra brings about a happy married life with a partner from a distant place. Venus being conjunct with Mars in Libra would not affect the marriage. But Rahu joining the Mars- Venus combination would make the character of the native suspect.
