A Pohottuwa politico has decorated his house frontage with green flags and pennants these days, they say.




A son of a onetime gung-ho politico of an area of ancient glory, the young politico threw in his lot with Pohottuwa following a dispute with a bigwig of the party.


Despite sending the intended message through the display of green flags, he is yet to receive an invitation from the party headquarters, they say.
