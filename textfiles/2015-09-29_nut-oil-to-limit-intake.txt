	Taxes on salt, sugar and coconut oil should be increased to limit their consumption because they are known to cause heart ailments, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
	Addressing a Ceremony held at BMICH to mark World Heart Day, he said he hoped to discuss this matter with the Finance Ministry.  
	He said not only should the taxes on tobacco be increased, but the taxes on salt, sugar and coconut oil should also be increased.
	“Healthy diet is essential for a healthy heart. We Sri Lankans are used to food that tastes good. Foreigners introduced sugar, salt and oil to us and now they are suggesting that these are not good for our health,” he said.
