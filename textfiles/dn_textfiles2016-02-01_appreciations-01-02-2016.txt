MEL GUNASEKERA:
You cared so much for the people around you
The painful memory of that horrible day - February 2, 2014, the darkest day in the lives of our family has dawned again...
We are forced to relive that gruesome day, when you left us all in a matter of 20 minutes. To me your eldest cousin and all of us in the Malawana / Gunasekera family this day will haunt us for the rest of our lives.
On a personal note, to me February 1 - St. Bridget's Day will now always be a painful day. This year it will be especially painful and emotional to me, as the school day celebrations, Holy Mass, and the March Past won't be held in the Hockey Field unlike in the past years, but in the Primary School grounds beside the Montessori which is the very place you spent your final hours in this world on the Feast of St. Bridget, February 1, 2014.
The school choir (of which you were also once a member when in school) will be positioned co-incidentally in the place, in the Primary grounds to sing for the Mass, where ironically you stood for the last time chatting to me, and your friends, classmates and your teachers on your last day on earth. God planned and destined that you came personally to say goodbye to St. Bridget's on her feast day and to all those you loved.
Recalling our close bond during your childhood and my early teen years at Nawala, how you sat on my lap in the school bus, with your baby chatter in heavy British accent (acquired from your play school in the UK) without a care in the world.
Whenever we missed the school bus, your Thathi - Uncle Marcus took us both on his scooter with you in front enjoying the ride, and me on the pillion with my school books, we travelled at full speed to get to school by 7.30, and once inside the primary gate I used to carry you with your bag and drink bottle and run to the Montessori, leave you in your class, and run to my class in the Upper school. Your days in the Primary School especially in the Choir and band with Miss Lorna, and also the Upper School Choir and Western Band were treasured moments, where your musical talents shone.
These loving memories engulf me and hurt me during these days as I prepare to celebrate our school day- the Feast of St. Bridget on February 1 with the School Choir and the Western Band, walking around the very place you bade me farewell in the Primary grounds.
The unusual expression in your eyes that night, gazing at me intently, with your head tilted to a side on February 1, 2014, after which you hugged me and kissed me saying "Good night Priyanthi Akki, Bye God Bless, take care, love to Mariella."
The memory of your voice and final words will echo in my heart, and bring tears to my eyes for the rest of my life. Meli you cared so much for the people around you, and so gentle that you would never hurt a fly. You loved your friends and family and no matter how hard you worked, you were always there whenever someone needed you, to go the extra mile.
The Catholic Church celebrates the feast of the Presentation of Our Lord on February 2, the day commemorating Mother Mary and St. Joseph carrying Baby Jesus in to the temple and offering Him to the Father.
Simeon the Prophet received Jesus from the hands of His parents Mary and Joseph, and told Mother Mary: "This Child is destined to be rise and fall of many, and a sword will pierce your own heart" And it's incredible that such a kind hearted Angel like you, suffered 54 wounds on your body in a matter of 20 minutes, at the merciless hands of your inhuman murderer at the very moment, your Ammi and Thathi were offering you to the Lord at Holy Mass during the Offertory and Consecration on that Sunday Morning, February 2.
It is humanly impossible to explain or fathom the plan and purpose of God. All I can say is your death was a reflection of the sufferings of Jesus on Calvary while Mother Mary remained at the foot of the cross praying. It is this immense faith in God and His Mother Mary that that keep your parents and brother strong, after your tragic end.
Meli, I know that if you are here today, you would be telling us all to cheer up, and to think about how wonderful your life was. You would want us to celebrate your life and not be sad about losing you. You touched our hearts with so many things. The hearts of your Ammi Manel, Thathi Marcus and brother are filled with so much pain. We know you are watching over them and dwelling in their midst unseen to human eyes, carrying them on Angels wings. After you left us, Radhika has been a gift of God and also your gift to the family, showering them with love and care, being a rock and great support to your parents and brother in your absence.
As two years have passed, we pray with all our hearts, ask our loving God that Divine Justice will have the last word, even though we know you will not come back. The wounds in the hearts of your parents and loved ones will never heal as memories of the sparkle and twinkle in your eyes, your laughter which we will cherish and keep a flow. Rest in the peace of Christ our darling cousin Meli. We love you and You will live on in our lives forever.

John Dhanapala:
He stood tall
I was much saddened to receive an overseas call from my friend H.P. Wijewardhane that our mutual friend John Dhanapala had passed away.
Dane as he was known to us entered the Arts Faculty of the University at Peradenya from Richmond College, Galle. We first met in Marrs Hall but it was in Ramanathan Hall that I came to know him much better.
Having passed out before me, he became a teacher. It was during the long vacation before our final year that he hosted me and my other close friend W.M.K. Wijetunge (later Professor of History) when we visited his home at Thihagoda, Matara in the course of a cycle tour covering four provinces in the mid fifties.
A year or two later I came to appreciate his gentle and graceful ways when we worked together as members of the tutorial staff at Trinity College, Kandy. The British Principal who made it a habit of visiting class rooms to judge for himself the quality of teaching on the part of the untrained teachers complemented him for his high standard of teaching.
This was probably why Dane chose pedagogy for a career while we birds of passage were looking for government jobs which were more remunerative. There was a mild surprise to the students and teachers when he broke ranks by donning the national dress in place of the usual western dress worn by the teachers in the Upper School of this century old public school which cherished and nurtured western cultural values.
More on the diminutive side he stood tall among senior teachers like Gordon Burrows, Hilary Abeyratne, Sahayam, Sinnathamby, Daniel, Toughie Silva, Jacob, RL Kannangara whom I came to know during my short stint there.
He stuck to this noble profession teaching in two more schools here, his alma mater Richmond College and Royal College, Colombo. Retiring prematurely he obtained employment as a teacher in a Catholic school in Pakistan.
He was kept in employment by the Marist Brothers for almost two decades although he was not a Catholic being a Methodist by conviction.
Even after returning from the long stint in Pakistan, Dane chose to continue teaching religion on a voluntary basis in a former missionary, now government controlled school in Kotte. On the last occasion I spoke to him, about a year ago, he tried to recall the lines of the Sinhala songs and Latin hymns teacher Lionel Perera and I sang in harmony recorded by Rev. Eliot on the tape recorder and relayed over the amplifiers during the carnival nights at Trinity College.
Our fading and failing memories were unequal to the task of recalling the lines of the duets.
Dane's wife predeceased him about 10 years ago. He leaves a son and daughter and four grand children. Self effacing as he was he lived a full life in accordance with the tenets of his religion and the ethical values and the culture of our motherland devoting time and energy in the service of the many young generations of students here and abroad.
May he rest in peace!

Tribute:
Putting yourself in others' shoes
Seven years ago, I met a professor who delivered a talk on peace and conflict resolution at the University of Kelaniya.
He spoke about 'Empathy' which was not a familiar topic in our day to day conversation. Later on, empathy became a word that we loved the most and used the most. The person who communicates the beauty about empathy with thousands of students in Sri Lanka is Professor Jayantha Senavirathne who is about to retire from his university career.
I met Professor Senavirathne as my teacher, instructor and supervisor at the University of Kelaniya where I studied my first degree on peace and conflict resolution.
What makes Professor Senavirathne a groundbreaking academic on the Sri Lankan peace education arena? He is a key member among Sri Lankan academics who work on promoting peace education at a time period that no one spoke out about peace education.
Peace education is educating people for peace. Or in other words, peace education attempts to transform society by creating a peaceful consciousness that condemns violent behaviour. It attempts to transform ways of thinking that have been developed over time.
It questions the structures of violence that dominate everyday life and tries to create a peaceful disposition to counteract the omnipotent values of militarism. Irrespective of political and personal level threats, Professor Senavirathne has been questioning violence in the Sri Lankan society for the past three decades.
He is still questioning and condemning the violent political and social structures. Betty Reardon, one of USA's groundbreaking peace educators, suggests that peace education is . . . [the] transmission of knowledge about the requirements of, the obstacles to and possibilities for achieving and maintaining peace, training in skills for interpreting the knowledge, and the development of reflective and participatory capacities for applying the knowledge to overcoming problems and achieving possibilities.
Professor Senavirathne transformed knowledge and also interpreted knowledge. As a young university student we were brave enough to question our professor and challenge him. But the beautiful thing was he always says "find solutions, always putting yourself in others' shoes".
I still can remember how he emphasises each letter in that sentence. He puts life into the sentence. In holistic definition, peace education is about influencing people to behave more peacefully, or to develop caring and non-aggressive people who relate peacefully to others in their own lives, facilitate the well-being of others, and work to promote peace and prevent violence in society and the world at large.
We travelled together with Professor Senavirathne with the message of peace and ethnic harmony. South to North, North to East and around Sri Lanka. He is not a typical academic who doesn't have ground level experience. He is a practical academic who brings practitioner's skills and academic's knowledge into one hand.
Professor Senavirathne is a groundbreaking peace educator in Sri Lanka. We wish you long life!

Ansar Jabir:
Reminiscing fond memories of our father
It has been a year since your death but time seems to have made no difference to the pain of your absence. Memories of you are still fresh in our minds and continue to be played over and over like a record in perpetual playback.
We revisit that fateful day and wonder what could have been done to change the outcome. We come up with several solutions but alas you're not here anymore and we unwillingly have to succumb to the divine plan every time. We believe in the infinite mercy of the Almighty and pray that you're basking in its shade right now and will be forever.
You taught us countless things about life. To be generous to those less well off, to be upright in our dealings with our fellow human beings, to live within our means and several more things too many to enumerate here.
You proved to us that formal education does not necessarily correlate with intelligence or success. You enabled us to pursue our goals in life and tempered our dreams with a dose of pragmatic realism that only a father and a husband could apply.
You left people with memories of your tact, generosity, business acumen and your down to earth attitude. You mixed with people at every level of society from presidents, diplomats and monarchs of nations to those who came home yearly to ask for some sort of monetary aid.
What made you stand out was your acumen as an expert gem merchant. This expertise lead you to the unique distinction of being the one to provide the beautiful blue sapphire in Princess Diana's engagement ring which Kate Middleton now wear's.
It makes us immensely proud to be your sons when people mention these traits of yours and inspires us to be sons that you would have been proud of.
Despite the difficulties entrusted on us by your absence. We try to be thankful to the Almighty. Your passing away is part of His divine plan and apt lesson for us all.
It has most importantly taught us not to take for granted the loved ones in our lives and to be thankful to them as their loss can never be replaced.
May Almighty Allah grant him Jennathul!
Dr. Shehab Jabir and brothers
