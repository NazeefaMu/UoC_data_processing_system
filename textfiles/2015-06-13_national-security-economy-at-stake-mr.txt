Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa alleged yesterday that the backbone of the nation was breaking while the separatist eelamist flag was being hoisted in one part of the country.
He said this in a letter addressed to the crowd that attended the meeting organized by a group within the UPFA yesterday in Matara in order to demand the SLFP leadership to field him as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the forthcoming Parliamentary election.
The former President who had made a guest appearance to the venue for a few minutes at the Matara rampart said in his letter that the patriots in the country were shocked to hear that 59 army camps were withdrawn from the North, people in the government suggesting the release of terrorists and so-called peace makers in Europe such as Solheim were reviving their secessionist agendas.
He said the national security and national economy that had been strengthened during his tenure was waning and the large scale development programmes were at a standstill. ( Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
