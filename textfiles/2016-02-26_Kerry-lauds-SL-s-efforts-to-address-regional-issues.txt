US State Secretary John Kerry on Thursday said it was noteworthy to mention the efforts made by the Sri Lankan Government to address regional issues and most importantly to make peace in its own country.

While welcoming Foreign Minister Managala Samaraweera to the US to take part in the US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which will be led by UN Under Secretary Tom Shannon, Kerry also congratulated Sri Lanka for continuing steps towards reconciliation.

“I’m very happy to welcome my friend Mangala Samaraweera here, the foreign minister of Sri Lanka. I had wonderful occasion to visit with him in Sri Lanka and I want to congratulate the Government of Sri Lanka for their very impressive continuing steps towards reconciliation. We are very much looking forward to defining the roadmap ahead for continued progress,” he said.

Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Samaraweera recalled the visit undertaken by State Secretary Kerry to Sri Lanka, the first visit by a US Secretary of State in 43 years, the cabinet-level visit of Samantha Power last May and many other visits by high-level officials of the State Department.

“This has elevated what has always been a very cordial relationship to what I would call a very special friendship between the US and Sri Lanka. That is why I’m looking forward for the inaugural meeting of the US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue, which I’m sure, will further strengthen and broaden the relationship between our two countries,” he said.
