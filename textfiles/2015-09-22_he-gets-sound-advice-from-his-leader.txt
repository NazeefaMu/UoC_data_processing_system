This Green one from the East made it to Diyawanna for the first time and was soon raised to Cabinet rank. According to the portfolio assigned to him, he is expected to oversee ‘small’ industries. 
This being a new subject, the Ministerial one wanted to have a clear idea about its parameters and he approached his leader, the second in command of the regime to seek a clarification.  But the query had nettled the Green leader. His stern reply was: “You have to be innovative. Start new ventures. Look for areas where you can develop the existing ones…  I acted on my own initiative when I was appointed a Minister in 1977. For instance, start industries to turn out new products out of coconut husk.  We may earn millions in foreign exchange by exporting such products!”  
Thereafter, the new Ministerial one had complained that he was yet to find suitable accommodation for his office. Pat came the Green leader’s answer: “Share space with your wife in the building where she now works as a Deputy!”
