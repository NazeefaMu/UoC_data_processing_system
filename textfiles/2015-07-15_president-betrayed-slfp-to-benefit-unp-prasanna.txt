	Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga charged today that President Maithripala Sirisena had indirectly acted to cover up corruption by dissolving Parliament before the no confidence motion against the government could be taken up.
	He said the no confidence motion was to be brought against the government following the Central Bank bond scam, and there was no action taken regarding it since Parliament was disolved.
	He said the President had betrayed the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its people by making a speech detrimental to the interests of the party.He added the party had been betrayed in this manner so that the the United National Party (UNP) would benefit from it. (Kelum Bandara)
