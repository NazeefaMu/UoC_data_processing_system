Former parliamentarian Tiran Alles was granted permission today by Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa to travel abroad to seek medical treatment.

Court allowed him to travel to Singapore for two weeks within next three months to be treated under the supervision of his specialist doctor.

Alles was suspected to have allegedly involved in a fraud of Rs. 167 million at the Reconstruction and Development Agency (RADA) purportedly set up to reconstruct houses for tsunami-affected people and an inquiry was conducted at the Fort Magistrate's Court.

Earlier, his request to travel abroad was denied by the Fort Magistrate, however, later filed a revision application at the Colombo High Court seeking legal permission to travel to Singapore to undergo a special treatment for his heart condition.

The Judge considering the medical report of his health condition submitted by the Colombo Chief JMO, Ajith Tennakoon, allowed the former parliamentarian to travel abroad to be treated under the purview of his specialist doctor.

The court also imposed an additional cash bail of Rs. 100,000 with one surety of Rs. 500,000 on behalf of the suspect. He was released on bail following the inquiry at the Fort Magistrate's Court. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
