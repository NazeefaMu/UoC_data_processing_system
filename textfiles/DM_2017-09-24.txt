Govt. to introduce new tourism promotion law:PM
	
The Government would bring in a new Tourism Promotion Law shortly in a bid to boost tourism related sectors of the economy, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the weekend said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe made this statement at the AGM of Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association in Tangalle.
"There will be a new Tourism Promotion Law. The Tourism Authority will not alone run the industry. I have also told the Tourism Authority Chairman to come up with a restructuring plan," he said.
"We must make Sri Lanka a 365-day destination. There will be rain somewhere but sunshine in another place. You can fly anywhere within two hours. If you land in Mattala if it is raining there you should be able to go on another direction. Why aren't we making Sri Lanka 365 days, he asked.
We are like a shop in Bambalapitiya which is closed for 150 days an year. We will have more festivals. We have to bring in internationally famous singers. We will have an international Choir Games this year," the Prime Minister added.
The World Choir Games (formerly named the Choir Olympics) is the largest choir competition in the world. Organised for amateur choirs, the event is organised by the Interkultur Foundation.
He said development of tourism was key in developing the economy.
"Tourism brings in foreign exchange. We need the foreign exchange to correct the balance of payment and to repay national debts.
When we took over in 2015 we did not have enough money to service debt. We needed money to pay debt and for recurrent expenditures. What we have done during the last two years is trying to manage the debt situation. Today our revenue exceeds debt services.
However, we are still behind as we have to borrow for Government expenditure other than debt services. We got the economy moving. These two years are important. Highest debt repayment comes in 2018 and 2019.
During these two years the investments should come in so that it would be plain sailing for the country," the Prime Minister said.
Mr. Wickremesinghe said world tourism market had changed as it was no longer Europeans coming in here with travel agents.
"Travel agents are no more. Travelling is controlled by others. We are living in another world. Big airlines we once knew are no longer there. Even budget airlines are having trouble.
However, people are traveling here. It is Asian travellers we are going to have. Market is changing. Did we here of Trip Advisor some years ago Things have changed. We have to fit in to the change," he stressed.
We are in the Indian Ocean in the middle of Indian market, Middle Eastern market and East Asian market. Our target is 5 million tourists.
How do we go for it Tourism will have to be a key sector. What are we going to do to market the country We can think of nature but should think of theme parks There are 500 to 800 acres in Galle to become resorts.
There will be golf courses in Galle, Kandy, Iranawilla. We got to think of activities for the tourists. We can think of cruise lines, luxury trains etc. There will be two new museums," he added.
"We will be talking to stake holder in the tourist industry. We got to help the small timers. Some countries have separate focus on informal accommodation sector. We will get all of them registered. We got to think of non-accommodation sectors as well," he said
If we have enough musicians, dancers we have to focus on it. These trades, needed for the tourism industry, will be thought in schools in the upper grades," he said. (Yohan Perera)

Joseph raps UNP Youth Front at Gampaha and gets booed
	
A tense situation erupted at the Gampaha United National Party (UNP) Youth Front meeting on Saturday, after Ja-Ela UNP organiser Joseph Michael Perera was refused an opportunity to address the meeting, it was reported.
Mr. Perera had attended a function at Weligampitiya, Ja-Ela following an invitation by UNP Youth Front President Kavinda Jayawardene, to initiate the UNP Youth Front Action Committee.
It was reported MP Ravi Karunanayake participated at the event as the Chief Guest for the event and the invitee speech had been done by him.
Later, during the vote of thanks Mr. Perera, who stood up from his seat questioned the organisers that he was not given an opportunity to address the meeting therefore requested a speech but was refused.
I was invited. Wont I be given a speech Im the national Coordinator. Are these youth afraid of me, he asked.
He also told the MP Karunanayake that it was wrong not to allow him to address as the Party leadership had provided him the national coordinator position.
However, replying to Mr. Perera, Mr. Karunanayake said that he accepted the fault and he took the full responsibility for what had happened.
Mr. Karunanayake also said that the event was organised by him.
That is also wrong, Mr. Perera respond.
However, later Mr. Perera had given the opportunity to address the gathering but the microphones not function at the time.
Again Mr. Perera continued to lambast at the organisers from the podium for their shortcomings pointing the finger that such shortcomings tarnished the image of the UNP.
Suddenly, MP Karunanayake left the building with the other members and the crowd, who were present, was also seen following Mr. Karunanayake, without considering Perera at the podium.
The crowed was also seen booing at Mr. Perera. (Thilanka Kanakarathna and Dewapriya Chandrasiri)

New Constitution to please separatists: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said today that the government was trying to bring in the new Constitution on the requirement of the Western forces and Tamil Diaspora to please Tamil separatists.
He told a news conference that President Maithripala Sirisena had assured UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zaid Al Hussein that Sri Lanka was carrying out UNHRC recommendations and added that the new Constitution was also being drafted according to that.
He said countrys Constitution, which was its basic legal system, could not be changed on the whims of foreign forces.
He said the Central Government, President and the Prime Minister would function for their name sake as all the powers including Police, Administration, Finance, Land and Enacting Laws would be granted to Provincial Councils in the new Constitution.
The country will be divided into nine regions, where separate laws and administration would prevail. The country will become jumbled. Is this for what 27, 000 war heroes sacrificed their lives he asked.
Mr. Weerawansa said Tamil separatists had been trying to fulfill their needs through the Constitution for a long time, where they once did it through the 13th Amendment under J.R. Jayewardene.
He said the then President J.R. Jayewardene acted to pass the 13th Amendment by seeking advice from the Attorney General without going for a referendum and added that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also following the same suite by bringing in amendments during the committee stage going against the Supreme Court decision.
He followed the same strategy in bringing in the Provincial Councils Amendment Bill and Local Government Elections Bill, where amendments were made during the Committee Stage contracted to the bill forwarded to the Supreme Court.
It is possible to bring in such contradicting amendments to the new Constitution also during the Committee Stage. The concept of Unitary State may also be changed to Federal State during Committee Stage and get a two thirds majority in Parliament, he said. (Ajith Siriwardana)
