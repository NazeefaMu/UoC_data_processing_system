Solomon Police have been urged to investigate a Sri Lankan, who was involved in an accident at the Mendana Avenue in Honiaraon the night of October 29, 2016, Solomon Star reported today.

The Sri Lankan who was in his mid-40s was an Information Technology (IT) Manager of the Pan Oceanic Bank (POB) and was reportedly drunk at the time of the accident.

Sources have relayed the information and urged the police to investigate him after noticing that the investigation into the accident has vanished completely - where they think some fishy dealings might be the cause.

Solomon Star was tipped about the incident in early December 2016, where an inquiry was carried out thereafter.

Pan Oceanic Bank’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was asked on 14th December 2016 about the incident.

He replied and confirmed the accident which also involved a girl who was correspondingly a staff of the bank.

“We are aware that there was an accident involving a local staff member on holiday, outside normal working hours.

“Bank will do whatever it takes to ensure the wellbeing of any staff member of the bank,” the CEO stated in a reply email to the Solomon Star.

The couple hit a street light post located opposite the Honiara Casino, when travelling eastward to town in a black car owned by the bank – both were believed to be drunk.

The suspect and the local girl were then taken to the police station for questioning and remanded in the police custody.

They were later released the same night.

According to sources within the bank, the Sri Lankan was supposed to go to court on a given date but he did not turn up.

Solomon Star was told that the suspect left the country towards the end of November, seeking medical attention in Australia after falling ill after the accident.

After over a month away from the country, he returned on January 18, a fortnight ago.

When this paper contacted him to comment on the incident, he denied being involved in any accident.

On January 19, he visited the Solomon Star headquarters at Henderson insisting that news about the accident did not go into print.

“I have other issues with the bank.  My return here is to question my status as an employee of the POB.  When I reached here, I was restricted entry into the bank premises,” he said.

When questioned about his involvement in the accident, he declined to comment but stated that the police have already taken care of the matter.

He then returned to see the Solomon Star editor on January 20 to ensure that the article was not published.

Knowing that the paper is well aware of the incident, he said he did not want to comment but will send a response to the Solomon Star by email.

To this date, this paper did not hear anything from him, though he was given the opportunity to respond.

Solomon Star also received photographs of the location of the accident and the vehicle that was involved.

Meanwhile, the informants have insisted and urged that police officers that are handling the case to continue with the investigation honestly as this is their mandated job.

Solomon Star was informed over the weekend that the suspect received his marching orders from the bank last week – he was previously suspended following some other issues he formerly had with the bank that are currently under investigation.
