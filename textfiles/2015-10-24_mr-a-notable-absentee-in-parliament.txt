Former President and UPFA Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa who was listed to speak during the adjournment debate on the UNHRC resolution in Parliament was a notable absentee yesterday. 
Mr. Rajapaksa was allocated fifteen minutes for his speech, according to Parliament sources.
The news that the former President would not participate in the debate was conveyed by MP Dullas Alahapperuma who said the news was actually conveyed to him by MP Sarath Amunugama.
Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella and Deputy Chief Government Whip Ajith P Perera later insisted that the former President should speak during the debate as he was responsible for the engagement of UNHRC on Sri Lanka.
