The CID said today that it would inform court that the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) had failed appear to give statement.

The CDS left for Mexico this morning without appearing at the CID offices.

Sources close to him said that he left for Mexico after informing the CID and requesting for a different date.

However, a high-up in the CID said that it would inform court against CDS Wijegunaratne if he failed to appear today and that they would take necessary action on his return.
