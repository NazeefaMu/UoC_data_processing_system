KHOST AFP May 6, 2018- A blast at a voter registration centre in Afghanistan’s restive east on Sunday killed at least 13 people and wounded 33, a health official said, capping a bloody week in the war-torn country.   


The bomb had been placed in a tent being used to register voters on the grounds of a mosque, marking the latest attack on preparations for long-delayed legislative elections.   


 “A crowd of people who had come out of the mosque had gathered to register” when the blast took place, Khost provincial police chief Abdul Hanan Zadran told AFP.    Zadran said the casualty toll stood at “about 30”.   


But provincial deputy director of public health Gul Mohammad Mangal told AFP at least 13 people had been killed and 33 wounded in the explosion. Among the dead was a female election worker.   


Mangal warned the toll could rise, with several of the wounded in a critical condition.   
 “Ambulances are still bringing more people,” he added.
