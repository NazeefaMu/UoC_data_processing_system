The investigative report, of the five-member committee appointed to look into the alleged kidney racket involving Sri Lankan doctors, was handed over to Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne a short while ago, the ministry said.

Health Ministry Spokesman Nipun Ekanayake said the ministry will request for police assistance to conduct further investigations into the case.

He said action would be taken by the Health Minister based on the report.

The five-member committee headed by Deputy Director General of Health Services, Dr. Jayasundara Bandara was appointed last month on the instructions of the Minister to investigate the alleged kidney racket involving six Sri Lankan doctors.

The committee was expected to visit the private hospitals in which the alleged transplant surgeries were performed. (Piyumi Fonseka)
