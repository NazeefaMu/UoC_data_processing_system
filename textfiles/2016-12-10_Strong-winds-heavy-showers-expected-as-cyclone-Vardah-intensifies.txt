Strong winds and heavy showers were expected in the sea areas off the Northern and Eastern coast of Sri Lanka until 12th December due to the influence of the cyclonic storm “VARDAH”, the Meteorology Department said today.

It said the cyclonic storm “VARDAH” was now located around 800 km away from Trincomalee coast, to the north-east of Sri Lanka and it was likely to intensify further and move north-westward.

Due to the active cloudiness in the deep sea areas off the coast extending from Kankasanturai to Batticaloa via Trincomalee, sudden roughness of the sea areas associated with sudden increase of wind speed up to 70-80kmph was expected.

Naval and fishing communities were advised to be vigilant in this regard.
