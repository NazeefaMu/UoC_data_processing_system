The CEB Engineers and Superintendent Union (CEBTESU) said today that they would also support the Ceylon Electricity Employees Union (CEEU) ongoing trade union action from midnight tomorrow (18).

CEBTESU President A.J. Munasinghe told the Daily Mirror around 200 out of the total of 1,500 of their membership had already took part in the CEEU action and the rest also decided to join the TU action if discussions to be conducted with the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy failed.  

He said the union consists of Mechanical and Civil Superintendents and could expect disruptions in the areas of power generation, transmission and distribution if the employees withdrew from operations. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
