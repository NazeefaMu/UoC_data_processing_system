MP Udaya Gammanpila said today the joint opposition was likely to submit a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to Parliament tomorrow.

He said the motion would be based on 14 allegations.

“We hope to obtain the signatures of the members of other opposition parties to the no-confidence motion and expect a majority of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Party and United National Party (UNP) MPs to support the motion at the debate,” the MP told a Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) news briefing. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
