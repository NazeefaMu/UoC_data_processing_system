Northern Provincial Council Chairman C.V.K. Sivagnanam said US Ambassador Atul Keshap’s visit to Jaffna did not yield any benefits to the Northern people.

He said the Ambassador did not give any assurance of relief when they directed their problems to him.

“When we ask him to help improve the economy of the Northern people, he remained silent,” Mr. Sivagnanam said. (Romesh Madushanka)
