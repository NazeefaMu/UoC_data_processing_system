The resolution approved by the Northern Provincial Council prohibiting the construction of Buddhist temples in the North will have no legal value, Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe told Parliament today while taking part in the committee stage debate on the Budget.

He told Parliament that there were no constitutional provisions for provincial councils to introduce such resolutions and that the government would in no way accept such a resolution.

The minister said an amended Buddhist Temporalities Act and the Theravada Kathikawath Bill will be presented to Parliament soon after discussions with the relevant stakeholders. (Yohan Perera)
