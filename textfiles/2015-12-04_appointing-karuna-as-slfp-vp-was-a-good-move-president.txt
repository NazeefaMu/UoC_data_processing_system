Appointing Karuna as SLFP VP was a good move: President


	

President Maithripala Sirisena today said appointing former LTTE member Vinyagamurthi Muralitharan alias Karuna Amman as a minister and as a SLFP Vice President was the right decision.
    
He said instilling ethnic extremism in the minds of the people is a dangerous move.
The President made this point by stating that extremism is being inflicted in the minds of the people by certain forces that make false allegations against the government on the steps it had taken to release those who are held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and on the steps taken to de-proscribe diaspora organizations.
Speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget in Parliament today, the President questioned as to how one could point his or her finger at the government when the previous government had released 12,000 detainees.
“Please don't use communalism and extremism to win votes as such an act will end up with a crisis" he added. (Yohan Perera)
