SIMFEROPOL AFP Nov29, 2018 - Ukrainian sailors held by Russia since it seized three of Kiev’s ships have been taken from Russian-annexed Crimea to Moscow, two of their lawyers told AFP on Thursday.   


Crimean courts sentenced the 24 sailors to two months of detention this week, despite international calls for their release.    “They are being taken to Moscow’s Lefortovo prison,” said Dzhemil Temishev, one of the lawyers defending the sailors.   Temishev said he and several other lawyers were barred from seeing the sailors in a detention centre in Crimea’s main city Simferopol, where they were brought to court earlier this week.
