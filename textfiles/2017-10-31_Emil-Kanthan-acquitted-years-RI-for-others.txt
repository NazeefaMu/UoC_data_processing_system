The Colombo High Court yesterday acquitted LTTE activist Emil Kanthan from all charges of attempting to kill EPDP leader Douglas Devananda when he visited the Kalutara Prisons while sentencing six other suspects to ten and a half years of rigorous imprisonment.

High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe gave this order on conclusion of trial in which 16 accused were indicted by the Attorney General on three charges of unlawful assembly and attempting to kill Mr. Devananda on June 30, 1998.

The case was heard in in the absence of several of the accused including Emil Kanthan.
