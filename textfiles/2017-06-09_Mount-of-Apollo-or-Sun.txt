Human hand – trailblazer of human civilization – Part 12

 

 

BY A.S. Fernando.
The Mount of Apollo or Sun is located at the base of the third finger or the Finger of Apollo and on the upper part of the Line of Heart.


This Mount is very significant in that it indicates the success or the failure of a person in life. A person who has no Mount of Apollo would lead an ordinary life ‘unknown and unsung.”


A person with a prominent Mount of Apollo is a genius and a celebrity. If the Mount is well developed and pink in colour, the owner would certainly attain very high status in society.

 

Friendly, cheerful and courteous
People with a    prominent Mount of Apollo are called Apollonians. Apollonians are friendly, cheerful, and courteous by nature. They get along well with friends and others. They are honest and trustworthy and are highly respected for their sterling qualities.

 

Recipients of unexpected wealth
Apollonians are wealthy and have more than one source of income. If this Mount is prominent in the hand of even an illiterate ordinary person, he would become wealthy and prosperous. Apollonians receive unexpected wealth several times in their life. Apollonians like to live in grand style. They are large-hearted and are ready to admit their mistakes. They are forthright in their dealings with others and do not mince words in telling the bare truth.

 

Frustrated and poor
If the Mount of Apollo is leaning towards the Mount of Saturn, the owner is a frustrated person who likes to remain aloof from others. Such persons often find themselves in reduced circumstances.

 

A successful businessman or an entrepreneur
If the Mount is leaning towards the Mount of Mercury, the owner will be a successful businessman or an entrepreneur. Such persons are wealthy and are respected in society. A clumsy Finger of Apollo minimizes the favourable characteristics of the Mount of Apollo. Such persons are vindictive and they fail to get along with fellowmen.

 

Many lines indicate a sickly person
If there are too many lines on the Mount of Apollo, the owner is a sickly person.A person with a prominent Mount of Apollo and a conical finger, is idealistic. Such persons are artists, writers and poet.Those with a square fingertip are artists of a high calibre and they are practical too.If both the Mounts of Apollo and Mercury are equally prominent, the owner would be endowed with a sense of justice and a love for scientific research.
