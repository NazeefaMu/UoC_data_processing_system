A case of abuse of the public property misuse law
	
	Nowadays there are court cases galore relating to misuse and abuse of public property. Recently a Bodhi Pooja was conducted at a well-known Buddhist temple in the Kalutara area purportedly to invoke blessings on the deposed strongman and the war heroes.
Incidentally, it is no secret to the people that there is bad blood between the political strongman in this area, a former Ministerial one, now a Deputy and the chief monk of the temple.
The Chief Monk had asked the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha in the area whether he could lend the Pradesdhiya Sabhas four-wheel tractor to haul to the temple the power generator hired by him for use at the Bodhi Pooja ceremony. Considering that the tractor asked for was meant for use in connection with a religious ceremony held in the area itself, the chairman readily agreed to release the tractor for the purpose.
However, Police lying in wait seized the tractor carrying the generator when it was on its way to the temple and a case was filed for using the tractor, a public property, for a private purpose.
When the case came up for hearing, the magistrate asked the prosecution counsel: If we are to go by the same token, isnt it an offence under the public property law to transport a monk in a Police jeep for a Dhamma sermon at a temple That question stumped the prosecution.
Now it is a well-known secret that the political strongman in the area was behind the case filed against the Pradeshiya Sabha chairman for lending the tractor for hauling the power generator.
Despite this incident, the Bodhi Pooja was conducted as planned. And the chief monk in his Punyanumodana sermon had invoked blessings on the politico who tried to sabotage the ceremony as well, they say.

DFCC Bank recognized for Sustainable Development Financing and Reporting
	
		 		 
		 
			
DFCC Bank won three awards at the Outstanding Development Project Awards 2015, organized by the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP).
Besides being a founder member of the Association, DFCC has been winning awards every year for its outstanding project work.
This year the Bank received a special award for the Best Sustainability Report, and was presented a Plaque of Merit for the developmental impact of projects carried out under the Environmental Development and Local Economic Development categories.
DFCC has been constantly pushing the boundaries of reporting. Titled Game on, the Annual Report for 2013/14 provided a holistic view of the economic, social and environmental impact of its operations, drawing on the concepts and principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Guidelines G4, the International Integrated Reporting Framework and the Smart Media Methodology for Integrated Reporting. This report was also recognized locally by the Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka when it won Gold at the awards ceremony held last year. Noteworthy also is that DFCCs Annual Report for 2011/12 titled Multiple Strands of Business Lend Strength was recognized at the ADFIAP Awards in 2013, when it won the overall award for Best Annual Report.
The award of merit for Environment Development was conferred to the Bank, for financing Sri Lankas first commercial scale grid-connected solar power project. The Bank guided and financed the venture and is now on record for being the pioneer financier in all renewable energy projects (hydro, wind and solar) undertaken by the private sector in Sri Lanka. This project, located in Hambantota, will cover 45 acres for the generation of 10MW of energy and will boost the role of renewable energy in the power supply to the national grid.
The Bank also won a merit award in the Local Economic Development category, for financing Sri Lankas first and only rice bran oil manufacturing facility. This operation uses rice bran which is a by-product of the milling industry to manufacture an edible oil, which is healthier than other similar products, and has cholesterol reducing properties.
It is also used in the cosmetic industry as a skin moisturizer. Currently rice bran is exported to India for use as an animal feed and in the production of rice bran oil. The project utilizes state-of-the-art machinery, from Veltech Masters India; a leading manufacturer of equipment for rice bran production. Located in Polonnaruwa this operation provides employment to more than 50 direct and 50 indirect persons, mainly to the people in the locality.

Video: FCID will probe bond issue if necessary: PM
	
	The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) would be asked to investigate the controversial bond issue if it was found to be necessary, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
	Mr. Wickremesinghe, who spoke to the media at Temple Trees last evening (and later also accepted copies of several books written by media personnel) said the final decision on whether to hand the matter over to the police would be made after he received the report from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on its ongoing investigation into Perpetual Treasuries and the Bank of Ceylon -- which had made highest bids for the bond.
	I cannot yet say whether the SEC report will be handed over to the FCID as we have to decide that after we get it, he said, when Daily Mirror sought a clarification from him later.
	The Prime Minister said (concerning a statement by UPFA MP G. L. Peiris that the government had always to be responsible to Parliament) that he had done that since becoming prime minister. He said the present regime had briefed Parliament monthly on the progress of the hundred-day programme.
	Being responsible to Parliament, especially with regard to financial matters, is a principle which I spoke of and practiced even when I was in the Opposition; and I have not sent these principles on compulsory leave, he said.(Yohan Perera)WATCH

SF says will welcome war crime investigation
	
	Former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka says his conscience is clear and he would welcome a war crimes investigation to prove his innocence.
	The allegations are there, Field Marshal Fonseka said in an interview with the Guardian. We have to clear our name.
	In May 2009 the then General Fonseka was the head of the Sri Lankan army that defeated the Tamil Tigers, or Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, ending Sri Lankas brutal 26-year civil war.
	Nearly two years later, a UN secretary generals panel of experts reported that both government forces and the Tamil Tigers had potentially committed serious human rights violations in the final stages of the war.
	Shocking footage of the wars end emerged shortly after, suggesting widespread crimes had been committed by forces under Fonsekas command.
	While accepting that some crimes occurred during the war, Fonseka insists that these were acts of individual offenders, and not systematic. The army as a whole, I can give the assurance that we never committed war crimes, he said.
	There were no rapes, no torture during my command during the war. I know there have been a couple of allegations. But there should not be reason to try to declare war against the media or against the international community. We can clarify it.
	To his supporters, Fonseka is a war hero. But to others he is a war criminal. He insists he has a clean conscience.
	My intentions are clear. I did everything in good faith. My job was to save the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of the country. I have done it. I did it as per the rules.
	In 2010 Fonseka unsuccessfully contested presidential elections against his former boss, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
	Speaking to the Guardian in Sri Lankas capital, Colombo, Fonseka claimed the former president and his family had acted like dictators after their 2010 victory.
	Rajapaksas conduct was not acceptable to this country, especially after we finished the war, he said. He and his brother  secretary of defence  his whole family, his children, his wife, everybody was trying to behave like a king here; they were behaving like dictators.
	Thats why I left him. I wanted to be away. Then he started harassing us. He thought that he could intimidate us, terrorise us and keep us silent.
	In 2010 Rajapaksa stripped Fonseka of his military rank and decorations. The following year Fonseka was jailed for suggesting that the presidents brother, the defence secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, had ordered Tamil Tiger leaders to be killed as they surrendered.
	The Rajapaksas have denied any wrongdoing during the conflict.
	In January 2015 Rajapaksa, who had won two consecutive terms as president, suffered a surprise defeat at the ballot box at the hand of a broad coalition of civil society and political powerbrokers.
	The winning candidate, Maithripala Sirisena, had been Rajapaksas health minister and the secretary general of his party, the Sri Lanka Freedom party.
	The main opposition party, the United National party, as well as former president Chandrika Kumaratunga (herself a Sri Lanka Freedom party member), influential Buddhist monks, and the leadership of the Tamil and Muslim minorities supported Sirisenas candidacy.
	Votes from the island nations religious and ethnic minority groups were key to his victory. The new president vowed to implement widespread reforms within 100 days of his election, including transferring powers away from the president to the parliament. But he has had difficulty delivering his pledges.
	The UN human rights council delayed the release of its report on humanitarian crimes during the civil war to give more time to the new administration.
	There have long been calls for Sri Lanka to allow a full international investigation, but Sirisena promised only a domestic inquiry into wartime human rights violations. Last week the government announced the inquiry would begin in June.
	While observers say there have been some positive developments in public accountability, including a reform package passed last month by the Sri Lankan parliament, concerns about human rights remain.
	Sirisenas appointment as army chief of Major General Jagath Dias, who led an army division linked to war crimes in the final months of the war, is worrying, according to Human Rights Watch.
	The new government, the result of a fragile cross-party political compromise, is negotiating a delicate path, seeking to fulfil the aspirations of the minorities whose support helped bring it to power while also retaining support among the majority Sinhalese community.
	Despite his electoral defeat, the arrest of one of his brothers, and ongoing corruption investigations into another, Rajapaksa remains a political force in the south where he is positioning to run for prime minister on a wave of Sinhalese nationalism in forthcoming parliamentary elections.
	Fonseka, who was exonerated by Sirisena and promoted to Field Marshal, said he no longer harboured ambitions to be president or prime minister. I am ready to say goodbye to politics at any time. My ambition is not to become president or become prime minister, but to ensure that the country is taken on the right path.

Go-getter Deputy acquires an office room the easy way!
	
	Some of the Ministerial ones and Deputies appointed recently have not been provided with office accommodation let alone the basic facilities for them to function in their new positions.
The Deputy appointed to look after urban development was one of the new appointees who had to suffer this fate. However, this one, a typical go-getter was not prepared to resign himself to it. He was scouring the premises when he discovered that the chairman handling urban development had left his office. He walked into that office and summarily established himself there.
The chairman made no fuss when he found himself unexpectedly displaced. And he quietly continued doing his work at a desk inside the conference hall. And he is now compelled even to use the common toilet.
This chairman, a former Ministry secretary and a top executive in a leading bank in the world had kept mum about the unhappy episode until a group of Bell party members called on him the other day, they say.

He is waiting to say, Sorry and make up!
	
	This occupant of a big chair in the opposition incurred the wrath of the deposed strongman when he avoided answering an urgent telephone call by the latter. Of course, at that time he had a blown-up sense of self-importance.
He sensed that his political clout was on the wane when he learnt that his Betel leaf associates were meeting the deposed strongman on and off on the sly. Reading this as ill wind blowing him no good, he decided he too should meet the former boss and patch up the differences with him.
The opposition bigwig made a plea to several political intimates of the deposed strongman to arrange a meeting between him and the latter without avail. He later appealed to the scion of Boralugoda to help him to fulfil his wish. I hear that our former boss is mad at me these days. I want to dispel whatever misunderstanding that stands between us. Therefore, kindly take me to him when he is in a good mood.
But the Boralugoda colleague had turned a deaf ear to this impassioned plea. Finally, the opposition big gun had decided to call on the former boss alone come hell or high water. 
A few days later he met the estranged former boss by chance at a wedding, but found the place too crowded to hold out the olive branch.

	Eighteen out of the 25 Blue Ministerial ones at Cabinet, State and Deputy Levels in the National Unity government had vowed to quit office if the term of office of local government bodies were allowed to expire. Now several days have passed since the local bodies in question had come under the purview of special commissioners, only four of the 18 Ministerial ones have quit office so far.
A sidekick asked a certain Blue Ministerial one who conveniently forgot to make good his threat why he backed out. The politico replied: Machang, we thought the dissolution of our Diyawanna council would immediately follow the expiration of the terms of local bodies ruling out the necessity for us to quit office. Resigning before the dissolution would mean having to forego all official perks  vehicles, security and the salary apart from hundred and one other concessions.

The Thera said the regions in the country should not be created based on ethnic groups or religions and the marriage laws should be equal for all the citizens regardless of their religion.
We had several discussions with some political parties about our proposed laws but we would never form political alliances with main political parties.

Rise of the living inheritance puts pressure on Asian retirees: HSBC report
	
HSBCs report, The Future of Retirement - Choices For Later Life, reveals the existence of a living inheritance whereby 65 percent of retirees in Asia on average are providing regular financial support to their family and friends, compared with the global average of 60 percent. The numbers peak at 86 percent in Malaysia, followed by 83 percent in Indonesia and 80 percent in India.
In particular, it found that wealth is already being passed down the generations, with over a fifth (22 percent) of Asian retirees regularly giving to grown-up children and more than one in 10 (15 percent) doing the same for their grandchildren.
While giving while living is on the increase, the traditional inheritance may be dying out. Only 30 percent of working age people in Asia are confident about leaving an inheritance to their children.
The living inheritance is a cause for concern for retirees in Asia, where more than two in five (44 percent) retirees in Asia are worried about not being able to support family or friends financially, or of being reliant on family or friends for financial support (42 percent).
Also, more retirees in Asia (80 percent against the global average of 73 percent) have been unable to realise at least one of their hopes and dreams since retiring, a potential consequence of giving while living. The mismatch between dreams and reality is predominant among retirees in Hong Kong and Indonesia (88 percent) followed by India and Malaysia (87 percent) and Taiwan (86 percent).
HSBC Regional Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management Asia-Pacific Kevin Martin said, Asias strong family support system is a key factor to the rise of the living inheritance, which adds another dimension to the already complex financial pressures faced by Asian retirees. Helping out other family members during ones working life through to retirement is remarkable. The reality is, it can put your retirement plans at risk.
To ensure a comfortable later life, retirees should consider their wider financial commitments, including continued financial support to their loved ones. The level of retirement income they planned for earlier as workers may no longer be sufficient for their needs in retirement. Retirees today may even need to generate additional income to cope with these expenses, the rising costs of their own requirements such as healthcare or to ensure they can still refill the inheritance pots they intend to leave with their children. Regular financial reviews remain integral to wealth planning at post-retirement.
Living abroad is a retirement aspiration that the survey covered in more detail. Australia and New Zealand figured among the top six retirement locations, especially among Asians. Of working age people who plan to move to another country, 43 percent, 37 percent and 20 percent in Singapore, Malaysia and India, respectively, aspired to spend later life in Australia, while 28 percent, 24 percent and 23 percent of those in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore, respectively, opted for New Zealand.
However, only 8 percent of surveyed retirees in Asia say they have realised their hope of living abroad since retiring.
Kevin added, As Asian families become more mobile and international, spending their retirement in two or more locations is an increasingly common goal. The costs of maintaining such a lifestyle could be daunting as people spend for travel, varied costs of living and property. With continued financial planning and active FX management, people with such aspirations can avoid surprises and enjoy the retirement of their dreams.
HSBCs research identified four actions that may help todays retirement savers plan a better financial future for themselves:
1. Be realistic about your retirement aspirations
2. Review your long-term working plans
3. Consider your wider financial commitments
4. Have a clear retirement plan

Vienna Airport employees caught smuggling Lankans to US, UK
	
Austrian police have arrested several security employees at the Vienna Airport including a Sri Lankan for allegedly smuggling illegal immigrants from Sri Lanka to the UK and the US, The Telegraph reported yesterday.
Two members of airport security staff are being held in custody on suspicion of allowing passengers without visas or proper travel documents onto flights to the UK and US.
A further 11 security staff members are being questioned by police in connection with what appears to have been a sophisticated trafficking operation.
The suspects are believed to be employees of more than one private security company responsible for different areas of airport security.
The British company G4S confirmed that one of those being held in custody is a former employee who was fired over the case.
Friedrich Khl, a spokesman for the local prosecutors office, said that the two men being held in custody are a Sri Lankan and a Polish citizen.
The suspicion is that they allowed an unknown number of foreigners to travel abroad from Austria illegally, he said. Most of those under suspicion are Sri Lankan, as were most of the illegal immigrants involved.
Police are investigating around ten separate instances of security staff allowing passengers on board flights without the proper documentation, he said.
The smuggling was conducted entirely by the employees, and none of the companies involved are suspected of any wrongdoing, Mr. Khl stressed.
According to unconfirmed Austrian press reports, the smugglers charged 7,000 (5,000) to 9,000 (6,400) per head to get illegal migrants through airport security.
The suspects are believed to have worked for different companies allowing them to pass illegal migrants through several different layers of airport security.
G4S, for instance, was only involved as a contractor for Austrian airlines carrying out hand baggage and passport checks at the departure gate.
An illegal migrant would have to pass through checks conducted by another company before he reached them.
I can confirm that in compliance with Austrian labour law, an employee responsible for checking visa documentation at Vienna Airport on a contract with Austrian Airlines was dismissed in March following his arrest, Graham Levinsohn, G4S regional chief executive for Europe said.
He added that he could not comment further as the case was in the hands of prosecutors.
