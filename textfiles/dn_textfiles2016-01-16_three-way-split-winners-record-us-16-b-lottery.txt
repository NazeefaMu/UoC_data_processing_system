Three-way split for winners of record US $1.6 b lottery

US: Three winning tickets in California, Florida and Tennessee are to split the profits of a world record $1.6 billion lottery jackpot drawn in the United States and watched live by millions.
The winning numbers were 4, 8, 19, 27 and 34, drawn from five white balls, and 10 as the so-called Powerball number on a red ball, capping weeks of frenzied ticket buying for the record jackpot.
The odds of winning were at least one in 292 million, but so great was the mania that lottery executives warned people not to splurge life savings or retirement plans on what they called cheap entertainment.
The three-way split means that each ticket holder is entitled to $528.8 million -- which they can either choose to claim in a one-off cash payment or receive in annual payments for 29 years. That means that Gloria Mackenzie, an 84-year-old woman from Florida, still holds the record as the highest individual winner in a Powerball jackpot after her solo ticket scooped $590.5 million in May 2013. "It's official! There were three jackpot-winning tickets in tonight's Powerball draw: California, Florida & Tennessee," California Lottery tweeted.
The bonanza payout was the result of 20 Powerball draws with no overall winner and had started at a modest $40 million on November 7.
Swarms of people, many cheering and chanting, descended on the Los Angeles convenience store where the California ticket was sold, local television stations reported. There was a windfall too for Balbir Atwal, owner of a 7-Eleven franchise in Chino Hills, a Los Angeles suburb, who will pocket a $1 million bonus for selling a winning ticket.
"I didn't expect this big crowd but my Chino Hills customers love me, and I love them," he told CNN, grinning broadly.
In the southern state of Tennessee, the winning ticket was bought in Munford, a small town of just 5,000 residents, northeast of Memphis.
