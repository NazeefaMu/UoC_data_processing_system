Popular artiste Jackson Anthony is to be summoned before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) to obtain a statement on the exorbitant finances spent on the entertainment acts performed at the Hambanthota harbor opening, sources said.
Anthony was the creative director for the ceremony held in 2010 and Rs. 15 million had been spent for the dance acts alone, which was performed by the Channa-Upuli Dance Academy run by popular dancers Channa Wijewardena and Upuli Panibharatha.
In their statement to the PRECIFAC regarding the charges when summoned last week, the duo had stated only Rs. 6.8 million was paid to them and had rejected charging Rs. 15 million for the performance.
