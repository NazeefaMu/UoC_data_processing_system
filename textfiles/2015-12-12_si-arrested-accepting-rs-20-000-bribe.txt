A Police Sub Inspector (SI) attached to the Haputale Police was nabbed by bribery sleuths this morning, while accepting a bribe of Rs. 20, 000 for preparing a Police report on a three-wheeler destroyed in a fire.
The SI was arrested inside the Police station, while accepting the bribe of Rs.20, 000 out of the Rs. 30, 000 that he had solicited.
The Sub Inspector had solicited the bribe from an individual, who had come to the Police station to obtain a Police report to submit it to an insurance company.
The SI is to be produced in the courts today. (Saman Palitha Nanayakkara)
