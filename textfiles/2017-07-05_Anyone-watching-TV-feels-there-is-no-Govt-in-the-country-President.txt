Anyone watching the TV in the evenings, would think that there is no country and or a government in the country.

Assumptions are made about what is going to happen the following day. The media reveals the opposite of what is really happening in the country.

The Development activities, people's welfare, the peaceful situation in the country are all portrayed turning these facts upside down, mainly to attract people’s attention.

They always show tense situations and destructions, said President Maithripala Sirisena at Ratnapura after declaring open a children’s ward.

Philanthropists Punsiri Tennekoon, Priyantha De Silva Subash Karunarathne and American national Louis Allen had spent Rs 100 million in constructing this two storey children’s ward.

The President went on saying that he was happy to have officiated at this opening of a ward that would cater to the sick people of Ratnapura, and he had made frequent visits to this hospital for various development activities done at this hospital.

He said that he attended a state officials meeting in Gampaha in the morning where emphasis was made about the anti-Dengue activities and garbage clearance work. There were reports of landslides in the Ratnapura District resulting from unauthorized mining and construction of buildings without following stipulated conditions. (Ajith Lal Shantha Udaya and P. A.
