Unable to confront him for the affront


	

A prominent politico in yahapalanaya has gone into a sulk for not being invited to a grand ceremony held to mark the commissioning of a factory of an export commodity despite his being the state purohita in charge of the subject.

 


However, the politico is said have had second thoughts about articulating his displeasure over this slight to him because the head of the institution that organized the event happened to be a teacher of his when he was pursuing his professional studies. 


Three leading purohitas had attended the opening ceremony in question as guests of honour.


The unhappy politico smarting from the affront, had expressed his impotent anger while chatting to his colleagues the other day. “I can’t stomach this insult. But damn it… How can I say anything against him? After all, he was my teacher!”
