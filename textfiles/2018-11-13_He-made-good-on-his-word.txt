He made good on his word!


	



 

This politico had to face a disciplinary inquiry held by his party for teaming up with another political party about three years ago. And he had made a bold statement to the disciplinary committee that held the inquiry: “You may expel me from the party now. But I am coming back to the party in another two or three years.”

 


This politico did make good on his word when he boldly walked into a group of big names of the party that expelled him at a key official residence in the country last week. And he was given a warm welcome, they say.


Spotting a member of the disciplinary committee that expelled him, the politico approached him and asked him with a derisive smile: “Remember I told you that I would be coming back?” A son of a former political stalwart, this politico represents an area, once part of an ancient kingdom. His father was known for tough and tumble tactics and thuggery unleashed on his opponents in his heyday.
