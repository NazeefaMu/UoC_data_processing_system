Beginning from May 12, 2018, the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) will meet the public including family members of the disappeared in Mannar, Chairman Saliya Peiris PC said yesterday.

He said arrangements had been made to hold public meetings countrywide till early July.

“In May, June and July, we will hold meetings in Kilinochchi, Matara, Mullaitivu, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Trincomalee and Kandy. In line with its outreach programme OMP, will hold a series of discussions with the families of missing persons, members of civil society organisations and the media, on how we hope to proceed,” he said.

When asked whether the OMP proceedings of the OMP will be similar to the Paranagama Commission, Mr. Peiris said it would be different and that there would be separate investigation units at the OMP.

He said they were still in the process of recruiting people to the OMP and setting up procedures.“We will keep the public informed on how we hope to gather the material,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
