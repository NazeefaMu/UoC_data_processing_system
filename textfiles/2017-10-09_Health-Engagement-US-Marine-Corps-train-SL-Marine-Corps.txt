A team of US Marine Corps conducted a two-week medical training to 70 selected Sri Lankan Marine Corps from September 11 to September 21, at the Welisara Naval Base.  
The medical training was aimed at increasing effectiveness when responding to disaster situations and to conduct humanitarian relief programmes.  
US Navy Commander Adolfo Granados, the group surgeon assigned to the 3rd Marine Logistics Group, said the Health Engagement-17 between the Navy Marines of the two nations was of paramount importance.  
“This programme helps enhancing partnership between the two nations. Since the Sri Lankan marines passed out only recently, it is important for both countries to understand, what Marine Corps is all about,” he said.   
Intractability, he said, was important to the US as they were trying to build partnership in this region.

“When we have partner nations like Sri Lanka, we need to understand each of our Marine Corps and how each of our Navy works. So when we come together as partners, we can be more effective in developing partnerships,” he said.  
Commenting on the medical response training, Commander Granados said the group of Sri Lankan Sailors and Marines had undergone training well and now they could train their own sailors and marines.   
“They have demonstrated quite a mastery of the materials and are teaching very well. Seven members of our team who are here, taught to a group of 20 of Sri Lankan Marine Corps. They are teaching their own members now. What we want to do is expand the training to more Sri Lankan sailors and marines so they can train their own. That way, our intractability with the Lankan Navy will be greater in the years to come,” he said.   


"We hope to expand the training in the coming years. We trained 20 Marines who would train others in the future."

The training included basic life savings and trauma combat care methods. Commander Granados said the training was not only essential for combat situations but any disaster situations as well.  
“Sri Lanka had floods recently. So the skills acquired by the Sri Lankan navy sailors could be used for such tougher situations. Learnt skills will help them in any kind of disaster situation and humanitarian relief situations,” he said.   
Commander T.P. Malalgama of Sri Lanka Navy’s Medical Unit said the US training was provided to Sri Lankan Marines belonging to several units, including the Medical and Rapid Deployment Squadron.  
He said the training expected to treat the casualties not only at war conditions but also during emergency disaster situations .  
The first training session with the US, he said was launched in 2015 in Punewa camp as a concept of now Navy Commander.   
Two Indian medical doctors had taken part in the training as observers this year.  
“We hope to expand the training in the coming years. We trained 20 Marines who would train others in the future,” he said.

The Sri Lankan Marines were new to the Navy and the first batch graduated only in February this year.  
Meanwhile, Doctor Lieutenant Rathnasekara, shed insight as to how the training was conducted.   
“Mainly, the training was conducted under two phases. Initially, the US marines’ medical team taught us how to give first aid and respond at battle or disaster situations.   
“Under the second phase, we were taught by Special Boat Squad and Medical Battalion Marines. We taught them how to provide first aid as Navy is mostly the first respondent in disaster situations. We can train our Marines to save more people,” he said.   
Dr. Rathnasekara said the medical unit, keep updating regularly and the US team was in possession of advanced techniques and equipment. “The Combat Application Tourniquet is one such equipment. We can, in any situation, treat the injured and save lives by preventing blood loss using this device,” he said.
