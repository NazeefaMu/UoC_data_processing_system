AIA Group Limited, the largest independent publicly listed pan-Asian life insurance group, yesterday announced the signing of a multi-year agreement with David Beckham, under which he will become the company’s Global Ambassador. 
In this newly created role, Beckham will support AIA in its goal of helping people in the Asia-Pacific region live longer, healthier, better lives. 
AIA Group Chief Executive and President Mark Tucker said, “We are delighted to welcome David as AIA’s Global Ambassador. David is an incredibly successful global sporting icon, a committed family man and is hugely respected for his long-standing community and charity work, most notably as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador over the past 12 years.”
AIA Group Chief Executive and President Designate Ng Keng Hooi said, “David is a natural fit with AIA as we pursue our purpose to play a leadership role in the social and economic development of the communities we serve and in doing so, helping millions of people across the Asia-Pacific region to live longer, healthier, better lives.”
Beckham said, “Joining the AIA family was an easy decision for me. I am a passionate believer in the value of wellness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle and I share AIA’s commitment to encourage people to take charge of 
their health. 
Throughout my career in elite sport and in my role as a parent, I have always tried to be the best I can be by training hard and setting a positive example to those around me. I am looking forward to working closely with AIA and supporting the company’s efforts to improve the quality of people’s lives across the Asia-Pacific region.”
As Global Ambassador, Beckham will be present at a number of AIA’s most important community and business activities to personify and demonstrate the benefits and the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These will include events for its customers, agents, partners and employees.
The new role has been created following the launch of AIAVitality, Asia’s first and only comprehensive science-backed wellness platform. It provides members with the knowledge, tools and motivation to help them make achievable steps to meet health goals and bring about long-term positive behavioural change regarding dedication to maintaining a healthier lifestyle.
