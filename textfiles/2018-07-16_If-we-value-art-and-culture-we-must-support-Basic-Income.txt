If we value art and culture, we must support  Basic Income


	



It’s a tough world out there for artists. Sustainable support for the arts has been literally non-existent in the past, in Sri Lanka. 
There is a general feeling that stage artists and other forms of art aren’t worth paying for because the gains for the society cannot be computed in monetary terms. In other words the jobs in theatre, drama and the like are not marketable jobs and the artists are more or less pushed into a corner where they have to self-fund productions or spend valuable time fundraising which they would have otherwise spent on creating their artistic productions. 
What this means in real terms is that the one who should have been an artist is forced to become the creative entrepreneur thus changing not only the creative process, but also the character of the art that is produced.   

"Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) has been working with artists in the theatre world and has initiated a study to explore the effects of Basic Income on their lives"


Ruwanthi de Chickera and Tracy Holsinger, two of the leading dramatists in the country, lead two very significant groups of artists who have produced very remarkable productions that are transforming, educative and informative. Stages Group and Mind Adventure Group are known for their critiquing without criticizing: Their innovative commentary on social issues through the medium of theatre has been an explorative experience for the youth. Their contribution is valuable to art and culture in this country. But the artists, despite their dedication to this art form find themselves in an income trap that they cannot overcome.   
Uncertainty plagues them at every step because income is rarely stable even at the best of economic climates. As the whole economy becomes more unstable, the situation gets worse for the average artist who finds it hard to depend on the craft to survive.

Another concern expressed by the artists at workshops organised by Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) is the lack of recognition of the artist’s work as a ‘proper job’. The general perception of the theatre art as a hobby makes it necessary for the artists to look for ‘real jobs’ that give them the image of being gainfully employed thus forcing them to do unfulfilling work to earn the needed cash.   
Many more issues were presented by the artists who showed their predicament as being financially vulnerable. There must be a better way to support artists so they can be free to create the works they feel are essential; not just those that will be popular with consumers and donors.   
Artists and their unique issues, when studied in earnest, it becomes clear that there needs to be patronage at the state level for art and culture: It becomes obvious that the best solution is to adopt a Basic Income policy which will cover the basic costs of living of the artists. This will give the freedom to the artists to bypass the market, allowing them to choose their message, to create pieces that communicate ideas that might even challenge prevailing socio-political mind sets. A Basic Income supports the choice of artists to be independent to produce and distribute their work on their own terms.   


The financial security of the basic income frees them from worry and anxiety and gives them the space to become more imaginative and creative and makes them become socially relevant. A Basic Income would be a transformative policy shift that would not only grant stability and freedom from the income trap, but lead to a thriving cultural sector.   
Basic Income Sri Lanka (BISL) has been working with artists in the theatre world and has initiated a study to explore the effects of Basic Income on their lives. The study has selected two of the artists together with a randomized control group and is awarding a Basic Income for 2 years for the two artists. The award ceremony will take place on July 18, 2018 at 4.30 pm at the OPA Auditorium. At this event Dr. Sarath Davala will be the keynote speaker presenting the case of India’s pilot sturdy. He is the coordinator of the India Network for Basic Income (INBI) and will be speaking on “Emancipatory power of Basic Income. India pilot study and debate.”
