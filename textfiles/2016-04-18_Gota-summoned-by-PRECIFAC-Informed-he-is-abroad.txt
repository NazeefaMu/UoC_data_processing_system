Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was summoned by the PRECIFA C to appear before the Commission today over alleged misuse of SL Air Force flights, did not turn up as he was out of the country, sources said.

An official of the Commission said Mr. Rajapaksa had been asked to appear before the Commission to give a statement but he had informed the Commission that he was unable to make it as he was leaving the country for medical treatment.

He said a new date would be given after Mr. Rajapaksa arrived in the country.

Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa and his wife Pushpa had also been summoned before the Commission over the same matter on two previous occasions. (Ajith Siriwardana)
