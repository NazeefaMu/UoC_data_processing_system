Filing a motion in Colombo Fort Magistrate's court today, the Defence Counsel submitted a new bail application on behalf of MP Wimal Weerawansa who was accused of misusing 40 government vehicles and thereby incurring a loss of Rs. 90 million to the State.

The Counsel put forward the bail application on the ground of exceptional circumstances that the suspect's daughter was admitted to hospital due to bad health condition.

Considering the bail request subsequently, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne fixed April 3 to deliver a decision on the request. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
