Siddharthan vows more hartals

Jaffna District Parlimentarian Dharmalingam Siddharthan said more hartals will be staged in the future too, until all Tamil political prisoners are released unconditionally.
Speaking to the Daily News, MP Siddharthan said President Maithripala Sirisena promised that he will take a strong decision with regard to the issue on November 7, 2015, but, no proper decision has been taken so far.
He further said " The decision has to be taken to release all Tamil political prisoners. On November 9, 32 prisoners were released on bail. That was a legal decision taken by the courts, but, we are seeking for a political decision for the unconditional release of all 230 prisoners.
"President Maithripala Sirisena told Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Vigneswaran that a firm decision pertaining to the issue will be taken on November 16, 2015 (Monday). Similar promises were given before and we are looking forward to see what would happen this time," Siddharthan added.
MP Siddharthan said that a harthal was very successful. Almost all schools, shops, restaurants and banks were closed.
