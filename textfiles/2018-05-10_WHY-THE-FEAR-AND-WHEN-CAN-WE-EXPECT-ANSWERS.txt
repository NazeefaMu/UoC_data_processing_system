WHY THE FEAR AND WHEN CAN WE EXPECT ANSWERS ?


	



 

The Cabinet has been shuffled and reshuffled but no one is happy! The burning question is why are they so afraid to give Law and Order to Sarath Fonseka? Let’s take a look at the President’s Chief of Staff facing violent corruption charges and sabotage of US$100 MILLION FOR OVER 2 YEARS, MANIPULATION OF DISCARDED MACHINERY SCRAP IRON ETC, AND YET WAS MADE CHIEF OF STAFF! WHAT A HIDEOUS GAFF! Why are all these known corruptions and sabotages set aside and positions of power given to these rogues? It smacks of the position of Finance Minister being given to Ravi K! The Heads seem to thrive in having them around! Mahanama and Dissanayake were apparently produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate and remanded till May 9 pending further investigation. The question here is, despite this knowledge, why were they given such positions of power? Who is hiding what? I guess we will never know! Mahanama had blocked both projects in regard to the Kantale Sugar Factory. Following negotiations, Mahanama and Dissanayake had agreed to accept the 100 million in installments! Initiate a SCAM and wham, you are in business, or so it seems from things that are happening in this country!  Mahanama had purposely thwarted the joint venture undertaken by M.G. SUGARS LANKA (PVT) LTD., AND SRI LANKA FOR REVIVAL AND RESTRUCTION OF THE KANTALE SUGAR FACTORY! 

 

While all the other SCAMS remain unresolved, we have another new one on our hands! But, that is not enough, the price of Milk Powder, Gas and other products have also risen and the beauty of it is they seem to be rising, bit by bit, little by little! Let’s not hit the people with all that we are trying to give them, let’s do it gradually so they feel how thoughtful and kind-hearted we are!
  


The Yahalpalana leaders are aware of all that is happening in the country but they don’t seem to give a damn! They are only interested in what can be GOT before TIME runs out! Make no mistake, the President who is now saying he will not resign in 2020, is the same man, the very same man, who promised to do away with the Executive Presidency in 100 days! Didn’t someone say “ABSOLUTE POWER, CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY”! We have a glaring example in front of us today but what are we going to do about it? What should we do about it? We can’t ask them to do the EXEMPLARY THING AND RESIGN, which in reality they should have done long ago! The country is in chaos, the Cabinet is in a bigger chaos, and we seem to be thriving on SCAMS! Why don’t the people demand answers? People power is what we have, it is our power that put these rogues into POWER which they are now using to their own personal advantage!!! In the Philippines, when the people had enough of the desecration of power, they came out on the streets and threw Ferdinand Marcos out! Absolute unmitigated People Power! Why can’t our people do the same here??? THROW THEM ALL OUT, HAVE A GENERAL ELECTION AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT???

Last week, they laid Dr. Lester James Peiris to rest! What a man among men he was, a doyen if ever there was one, yet they had to wait for him to die before they sang his praises! People of the culture, the finesse and men among men that they were, will never grace this country again! All we have are uncultured ‘Yakkos’ with no education, no culture, no background. To emphasize the immortal words of John Kennedy, we must now say: “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” We must indeed ask what we can do for our country as those who were elected with the sacred trust are doing NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR THE COUNTRY, JUST ONLY FOR THEMSELVES!

 

We have talked about SCAMS, so many of them, CHILD ABUSE AND THE PUNISHMENT SUCH ABUSE DESERVES, and then we read that a young girl from a Home for Girls has been ABUSED OVER 16 TIMES! WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT? Why are these maniacs allowed to get away with this? What is happening in our Justice System? Why does not someone with a spine get up and say “COME DOWN HARD ON THESE PERVERTS, GIVE THEM A PUNISHMENT THEY WILL NEVER FORGET; BECAUSE FOR SURE, THAT POOR GIRL, IS NEVER EVER GOING TO FORGET THAT SHE WAS RAPED! Do we do anything? ‘NO!’ Probably send the pervert to jail to live a life of common place luxury, while this poor girl has to live with the horrifying nightmare of THE FACT THAT SHE WAS RAPED REPEATEDLY! It is not a nightmare that will easily go away, so she has to learn to live with it because you see it is imprinted on her subconscious forever! It is not just RAPE that is rampant, MURDERS TOO. Continuously we are told “STERN ACTION WILL BE TAKEN!” WHEN AND WHERE? IT IS A LONG TIME COMING! Forget the politicians, what is the Judiciary about? Don’t they realize there is no LAW AND ORDER in 
the country?


   
Unless we, the people of this country stand up and demand what is our inalienable right, nothing is going to happen. We need to work together as brothers and sisters, as one family, to bring this country to the paradise it was in the days gone by. When anyone and everyone could move about freely with no fear, when children went unharmed, when murders took place just once or were never heard of. Selfishness, Greediness, Inhumanity and most of all MAN’S INHUMANITY TO MAN MUST CEASE, IF WE ARE TO CALL THIS COUNTRY “PARADISE” AGAIN!
