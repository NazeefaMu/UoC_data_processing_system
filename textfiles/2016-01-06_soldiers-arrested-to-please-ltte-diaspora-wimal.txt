UPFA MP Wimal Weerawansa today accused the government of imprisoning officers of the army intelligence unit over the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda to satisfy the LTTE Diaspora.
He made these remarks to the media outside the Welikada Prison after visiting the imprisoned army officers and former Chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Dr. Nalaka Godahewa.
“The arrest of these soldiers as well as Dr. Godahewa had no legal basis. The soldiers were arrested to satisfy the Diaspora while Dr. Godahewa was arrested because he criticized the government,” he said.
MP Udaya Gammanpila and former Minister of External Affairs G.L. Peiris accompanied MP Weerawansa on his visit.
Commenting on the work of the Financial Crime Investigation Division (FCID), Professor Peiris said it was not a branch of the Police Department but an entity established by the government to hunt down political opponents.
