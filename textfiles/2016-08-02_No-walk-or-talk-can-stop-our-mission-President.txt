Though there are people who try to criticize us and our mission to rebuild the country by working in harmony, we will not be deterred by such tactics even if they walk on the roads or talk bad of the government, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Polonnaruwa yesterday.

“Let the people who don’t wish to see the government working in unity, criticize us. The country is used to hostility for sixty years and we will change it by being different,” he said. (K. G. karunaratne)
