Men, beware!

Prostate cancer has been detected as the ninth commonest cancer among Sri Lankan men. Worse still, the majority prostate cancer cases are diagnosed only during later stages. Consultant Oncologist of National Cancer Institute, Dr Prasad Abeysinghe explains what steps could be taken to deal with the cancer.
Q: What is Prostate cancer?
A: The prostate is a gland found only in males. It sits below the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The glandular cells of prostate produce fluid that is added to the semen. The cancerous growths arising from these cells are commonly called prostate cancer. However there are other rare cancers that arise from prostate such as sarcomas. Early prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms.
The symptoms caused by prostate cancer are similar to those caused by benign enlargement of prostate. They are frequent urination, increased urination at night, difficulty of maintaining a steady stream of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination.
The examination by inserting a gloved finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland enables a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. Ultrasound scans, CT, MRI and bone scans are used to confirm those abnormalities.
If cancer is suspected, a biopsy from the prostate via the rectum is obtained preferably with a biopsy gun. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the grade of the tumor.
The grade suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test is also done. This value is also used to determine the risk of spread.
Q: Who are at risk and why?
A: If you are above 65, and have a family history of prostate cancer, high consumption of red meat or high-fat dairy products, obesity, smoking and high exposure to toxic fumes, you are more prone to prostate cancer.
Q: What is the Sri Lankan situation of prostate cancer?
A: Prostate cancer is the ninth commonest cancer among Sri Lankan men. The age adjusted rate of prostate cancer among men in Sri Lanka is 7.2/100,000.
Majority of prostate cancers in Sri Lanka are diagnosed at later stages.
Prostate cancer may be cured when localized, and it frequently responds to treatment even when it is widespread. The rate of tumor growth varies, and some patients may have a prolonged survival even after the cancer has spread to distant areas such as bone.
Q: What are the treatments available in Sri Lanka?
A: The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems. Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management.
Many patients, especially those with localized tumors, may die of other illnesses without ever having suffered disability from the cancer, even without an attempt at treatment.
Prostate cancer thrives on male androgen hormones.
For the majority of patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer towards later stages, androgen deprivation is the treatment. This can be achieved by undergoing a surgical removal of the testicles or by tri-month injections called GNRH and LHRH agonists which can be given underneath the skin for patients who wish not to have their testicles removed. However these injections are expensive in the long run.
There are other second line options such as chemotherapy injections and tablets for those who progress after androgen deprivation.
For patients who are diagnosed at early stages, there are several options. Those with low risk cancer can be closely monitored without treatment to avoid treatment-related side effects such as rectal toxicity, bladder toxicity and sexual impotence.
If there are signs of progression, they can be treated at that stage. Another approach is to wait until they give symptoms and treat at advanced stage. Those who get selected should be treated right away can either have surgical removal of the prostate or a course of radiotherapy with or without anti androgen treatment.
Most of the modern treatment modalities such as advanced external radiotherapy facilities are available in Sri Lanka at both government and private sector. These new techniques can minimize treatment-related toxicities.
Q: How could prostate cancer be prevented?
A: Avoid the risk factors I have mentioned earlier. Safe sexual activity could be good for prostate health. High ejaculation frequency may possibly be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer according to research.
Prostate cancer can often be found early by testing the amount of PSA in blood and rectal examination.
There is no question that screening can help detect many prostate cancers early. Men thinking about having prostate cancer screening should make informed decisions based on available information, discussion with their doctor, and their own views on the benefits and side effects of prostate cancer screening and treatment.
