Plantation sector employees to get seven perch plot of land

The new government is granting a seven perch plot of land to plantation sector employees to end the line room concept, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
The minister said only this government was able to find a solution to the plantation sector employees' problem of living in line rooms introduced by colonialists.
He said under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the issue will be addressed soon.
Dissanayake said each employee becomes a tea smallholder with this grant.
The minister said the employees could sell their harvest to the factory.
Dissanayake said many governments attempted to solve this issue.
He said his father, Gamini Dissanayake also attempted to solve this issue.
The minister made these observations at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry auditorium, Sethsiripaya, Baththaramulla yesterday.
Dissanayake speaking on plantation sector employees' salaries said employees are paid Rs. 550 a day along with several other welfare facilities.
He said although these employees demand a higher salary, it was impossible with the low tea price in the world market today. Dissanayake said the best solution for the issue is to link the salary with productivity. The minister said this was the practice in other countries.
Dissanayake said this matter does not come under his ministry but Trade Unions have to discuss the matter with Plantation Companies and the Labour Ministry.
