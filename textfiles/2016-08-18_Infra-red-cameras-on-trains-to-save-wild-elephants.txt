Infra-red cameras on trains to save wild elephants


	

The Wildlife Conservation Department has decided to install Infra-Red cameras in trains travelling through forest areas known to be frequented by wild elephants. This new move is an attempt to save the wild elephants from being run over by trains.

Wildlife Conservation Department Director W.K.S. Pathirana said he decided to take this step in view of the increasing death toll of wild elephants run over by train in the Northern and Eastern railway lines.

Talking to BBC about his plan to save wild elephants from train accidents, he said experienced Wildlife Conservation officers would also accompany train drivers. Mr. Pathirana said for a start, they were deployed in Polonnaruwa and Welikanda areas to accompany the drivers.

However, he said the project might be held up for want of funds to procure infra-red cameras. (Romesh Madusanka)
