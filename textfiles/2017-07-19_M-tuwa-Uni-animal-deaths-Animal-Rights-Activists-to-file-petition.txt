Animal Rights groups yesterday said they would file a petition at the Supreme Court over the alleged sedation of dogs and cats that led to the animals' death at the Moratuwa University.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Animal Rights Activist, Attorney Lalani Perera said the petition preventing such inhumane acts in the future will be filed with the support of animal rights organizations and will be backed by students of the Moratuwa University.

After a shocking video of at least 23 dogs and some cats being stunned with toxic substance went viral, animal rights activist had collected evidence and witness statements which would be submitted to Court, Mrs. Perera said.

Meanwhile, another animal rights activist Ms. Hasini Silva said their main focus now was to save the remaining animals at the university premises by seeking legal assistance. The activists hoped to request measures be taken for the safety of the animals when the petition was filed, she said.

“There aren’t many laws for Animal Welfare, but we are trying to bring those responsible before the law. We believe the Court would do justice and prevent these barbaric acts in the future,” she said.

Ms. Silva also said the biggest struggle was to ensure the Animal Welfare Bill and the Dog Registration Bill was passed in parliament soon.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)
