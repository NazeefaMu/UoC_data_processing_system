A 47-year-old German national was arrested on charges of operating a cannabis cultivation project at a villa, in guise of a greenhouse, at Katukurunda in Habaraduwa yesterday.

The German national was taken into custody and was due to be produced in the Galle Magistrate's Court.

Police said the type of cannabis which was found during the raid has not been found in Sri Lanka before.

Cannabis seed plots, bottles of dried cannabis were found in rooms of the villa.

The police is suspicious that the foreigner who maintained the villa in the guise of a greenhouse might have been selling these cannabis to foreigners at a higher price.

The raid was conducted by a police team led by Habaraduwa OIC Chief Inspector Chandana Prasad Jayathilaka on the instructions of Galle ASP Gamini Ihalawela. (D.G. Sugathapala)
