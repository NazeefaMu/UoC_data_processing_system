The fact that the ugly scene played out in the presence of a distinguished guest like the head of the ICC  increased in no small measure the embarrassment and chagrin caused to the cricket authorities in particular and the country in general. 
Police and army personnel who rushed to the scene nabbed six youth involved in the free-for-all.  Police had also collected a bonus when they succeeded in rounding up 11 drug addicts who had been either smoking or sniffing the stuff while watching the match.
Even before the Police  party could reach the Police station with the drug puffers  and  ‘sniffers’ taken into custody, the OIC had received a call from an influential politico requesting that  one  particular addict among the  11  arrested be released forthwith.
Police following inquiries found the youth that the politico wanted released hails from a leading business family.
Pressure on Police to release the particular addict had increased as they proceeded with formalities to prosecute the 11 drug addicts. The drama reached an anti-climax when the former Sri Lanka Cricket Chief who called at the Police station at midnight secured the release of his son.  
Police high ups who found themselves pathetically helpless, had no alternative but to release the balance 10 drug abusers as well.
