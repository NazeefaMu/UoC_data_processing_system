“Half of the marine movement in the world goes though the Indian Ocean bringing benefits to the nations in the region and to the countries in the Middle East and the emerging offshore terrorism had posed a threat,” he added.

He said focus should be made on the digital terrorism as well.

“One cannot consider terrorism of one man as the freedom of another,” he said while highlighting that all nations in the region should play a role in defeating offshore terrorism through communication, dialogue and through cooperation,” he added.
