The biggest and most powerful warship ever built by Britain arrives at her home port today for the first time with photographs revealing what life will be like on and below her four-acre decks.

HMS Queen Elizabeth will send a message to the UK's allies and enemies that the country means business, according to her captain.

The £3billion behemoth is set to be the nation's future flagship, and her 700-strong company plus 200 contractors are poised to enter Portsmouth Naval Base at around 7am this morning. (Daily Mail)
