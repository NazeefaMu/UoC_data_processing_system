Sir Arthur Conan Doyle brought to life the character of Sherlock Holmes almost a century ago. Known as the ‘Great Detective’, his analytical thinking and deductive abilities are admired universally. ‘How to think like Sherlock Holmes?’ is a unique book on personality development which shows you six ways to inculcate the analytical thinking patterns of the great detective into your life. Kelum Weligama, (www.kelumweligama.lk), the author of ‘Jeevithaya Wenas Karanna Katha’ 1, 2 and 3 (Stories that change your life), ‘Tharangaye Weeraya’ (Man of the Match), ‘Mahamolakaraya’ (Mastermind) and Persona, all bestsellers, is the author of ‘How to think like Sherlock Holmes?’

This can be considered the first Sinhala language personality development, inspirational and motivational book written based on the character of Sherlock Holmes and will help anyone interested in analytical thinking to change their lives for the better.
