SC and AC judges must resign: Purawesi Balaya


	

The Purawesi Balaya Organisation which played the major role in bringing the present government to office today urged the judges of the Supreme Court and the Appeal Court to resign so that new judges could be appointed under the 19th Amendment.
Purawesi Balaya Convener K.W. Janaranjana said the 18th Amendment became ineffective after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was signed into law and as such the judges appointed by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa under the powers vested in him through the 18th Amendment should resign forthwith.
“The SC and AC judges should contribute to the fulfillment of the aspirations of the people who clamoured for the removal of the state mechanism from political clutches,” Mr. Janaranjana said.(Ajith Siriwardana)
