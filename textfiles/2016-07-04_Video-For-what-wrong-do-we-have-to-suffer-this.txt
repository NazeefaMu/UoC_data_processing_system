The day to day medical services at the National Hospital came to a standstill due to a token strike launched by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), resulting in many patients left stranded. The patients were kept waiting for doctors for many hours in long queues at the out-patient department and clinics of the hospital. Pix by Samantha Perera
