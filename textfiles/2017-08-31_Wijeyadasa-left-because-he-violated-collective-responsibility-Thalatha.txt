Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Atukorale today said that former minister Wijeydasa Rajapakshe had to leave because he violated collective responsibility of the cabinet and does not know whether he exerted any influence on the Attorney General's Department to delay filing charges against anyone as suggested by certain politicians, civil society and individuals.

Minister Rajapakshe was removed from the cabinet for violating the collective responsibility of the cabinet and not for any other offence, she said.

However, I expect to study the charge of such legal delays and take swift action against corrupt politicians and officials and take action to rectify it if they were true.

Minister Atukorale assumed duties as the new Minister of Justice last morning at her office at Hulftsdorp following the expulsion of former Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the cabinet on charges of breaching collective responsibility of the cabinet.

Speaking to the media, Minister Atukorale said the entire judiciary and AG’s department were under the thumb of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa during his rule but no one talked about it. With the newly found freedom under this government people have resorted to protest even for banning the use of polythene.

She also said that the joint opposition had lodged complains with the bribery commission against UNP ministers Malik Smarawickrama, Kabir Hashim, Ravi Karunanayake, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne and her under their top 10 propaganda but the Yahapalana government is determined not to let real criminals to grab power in future

Minister Atukorale vowed that she would do anything and everything to safeguard the independence of the judiciary and Attorney General’s Department. She thanked President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for having trust in her and appointing her as the Minister of Justice.(Sandun Jayasekara)
