The railway strike, which was launched seven-days ago, was called off by the railway employees today following a meeting held with the four-member ministerial committee.

The strike was launched by the trade unions of railway guards, station masters and engine drivers last Thursday over a number of issues including the alleged irregularities in the recruitment process of employees. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
