Anticipating another term in office!


	



 

The Northern Provincial chief has reportedly triggered a new issue by seeking an extension of the lease of his official bungalow despite the term of office is to expire in another month, they say.

 


The house now being used as the official residence of the provincial chief owned by a leading member of the Northern Alliance had been taken on lease by the Council and the lease is due to expire by the end of this year.


Meanwhile, the provincial chief had written to the owner seeking an extension of the lease and intrigued by this request, the owner had quietly inquired from the head of the Northern alliance whether they were going to re-nominate the incumbent as their candidate come the upcoming polls.


The alliance leaders had felt offended for seeking an extension of the lease of the house when the party had yet to decide on its nominee for the chief post and the alliance chief had asked Wiggy to meet him in Colombo early to sort out the matter, they say.
