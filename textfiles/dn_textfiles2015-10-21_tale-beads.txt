A tale of beads

If a new and exotic genre of jewellery is likely to take your fancy, book a date for Saturday (24 October) to view ‘Pabalu’, an exhibition of finely-crafted beadwork necklaces, earrings and pendants happening at the Lionel Wendt, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The exhibition showcases the creative talents of Janaki Pethiyagoda, who employs ‘kumihimo’, a technique of braiding strands of cord to create intricate coloured braids first invested in Japan. Some 170 exotic items are to be on show, most of them available for sale at very reasonable prices.
Having acquired her skills under leading experts in Australia and the United States, Janaki has brought her own flavour of stylistic elegance to kumihimo. “Since multiple strands of cords are used,” she says, “the necklaces are very strong but slender. Samurai warriors once used kumihimo as laces for their armour. In fact, even the traditional belt of the kimono was bound by a cord of kumihimo.” In earlier times, she says, a traditional tool known as a ‘marudai’ used to be employed to form the chains. This used about eight strands of thread to form a braid. But today this has been revolutionized and beaders have invented a portable disk in its place. Adding beads to braids is a relatively recent innovation to this ancient technique, she explains. “Designing a piece of bead jewellery is quite a challenge”, she says.
“But once you master the art, it is fascinating to create your own designs and colour-schemes.” In recent times, different new types of beads coming in to the market has attracted international interest and launched the craft to a wider base of users internationally. This has made it possible for the beading community and jewellery designers worldwide to innovate fascinating designs which are also original. Swarovski and Preciosa, traditional Czech bead-makers, are continually inventing new beads and paving the way for new designs. Super Duos, Double twin beads, Triangle beads, and Rivolies, to mention just a few. Japanese Toho and Miyuki seed-beads in different sizes too, are used for bead weaving, using an altogether different technique. “Whenever I travel”, says Janaki, “I head straight for the local bead store and pick up local specialties. As a result of a trip to Italy last May, for example, she discovered the beautiful beads and focals made in Murano, the famous glassworks. “Most of these can be seen on necklaces at the exhibition”, she adds.
“The stitches used to make jewellery are ancient but universal,” explains Janaki. “So it becomes a common language worldwide.” Social media, she adds, have helped the craft enormously. It is a small community of beaders scattered across the globe, but through Facebook, beaders living in different countries can communicate and exchange their designs and ideas with astonishing speed. Janaki's passion for beads began when she started a course in jewellery-making in Sydney, Australia. The course was intensive, working with silver, copper and steel, amongst other metals. “This was exciting”, she says, “but you had to work within the framework of a well-equipped studio, complete with industrial equipment and kilns. It was far too involved and expensive to do as a hobby, in our small apartment.”
But when she started designing with beads, which was another module of the same course, she realized that here was something she could do within the comfort of her home. It was therapeutic, and for her it has now become a passion. The result of this addiction is a collection of two years’ work, leading to her first exhibition.
“It is an enormously creative and enjoyable way to spend your time”, she says. “I hope some interesting people will come to the exhibition, be excited by what they see, and want to learn the art. For my part, I have no secrets: I am happy to teach what I know!” she noted.
