He said that politicians and public servants should act in a way which is acceptable to the common citizen.

“Their action should not be subjected to people’s hatred. To build a better society, the government sector should always be free of bribes,” the President said.

He said he would take action against incidents of bribery, corruption, waste and misuse of public property without any favouritism.

Meanwhile, he said the Presidential Commission appointed to look into the fraud and corruption took place at SriLankan Airlines would reveal much important information similar to the way the Presidential Commission on the Central Bank bond issue had fulfilled its responsibilities.
