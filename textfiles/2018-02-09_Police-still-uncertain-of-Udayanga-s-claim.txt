Police said today they had not been officially informed of the claim made by former envoy to Russia,Udayanga Weeratunga that he was released by INTERPOL.

Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told a media conference that the delegation sent to Abu Dhabi to bring back Mr.Weeratunga to Sri Lanka was still holding discussions with the authorities on this matter.

Despite the warrant issued by INTERPOL on request made by the Sri Lankan government, a delegation had been dispatched to bring back the ex-diplomat based on the bilateral understanding and the diplomatic relations between the two countries. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
