The Marketing and Sales Forum of the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) has proudly announced the seventh National Forum for Life Insurance Advisors (NAFLIA), which is scheduled to be held on August 19, 2016 at the Main Hall of the BMICH, 
at 9:00 a.m.
IBSL Chairperson Indrani Sugathadasa will grace the occasion as chief guest. The other distinguished invitees will include keynote speaker K. Ravikumar, Zone Chairman, South Asia, Membership Communication Committee, Ambassador, Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) (USA) and motivational speaker Dr. Kuma Iddamallena. 
Based on the theme ‘Towards a day all Sri Lankans are insured’, the forum’s principle purpose is to provide the life insurance fraternity with an opportunity to share key insights and knowledge on the importance of innovation to gain customer loyalty as well as gather different perspectives from international and local insurance experts.    A novel item on this year’s agenda will be the panel discussion featuring some of the most respected professionals in the insurance industry. This high-powered panel will discuss the essence of the event’s theme under the skilled moderation of Sugathadasa. 
The other events on the agenda include a motivational speech, delivered by Dr. Iddamallena and a second panel discussion featuring the top MDRT qualifiers of insurance companies, who will share their success stories.  
“The insurance industry plays a vital role in society and its economy. The purpose of the NAFLIA is to remind the insurance advisors of the important role they play and to provide them with the inspiration and encouragement they need to ensure the industry continues to grow and evolve in a manner that is relevant to all Sri Lankans,” stated IASL President Dirk Perera. “We are delighted to organise such an important gathering in order to provide key insights to life insurance advisors,” said IASL Marketing and Sales Forum Chairman Samitha Hemachandra.  “The reason behind the organisation of this event is to ensure that all professionals in the life insurance fraternity are provided with the necessary tools and motivation to work ‘towards a day all 
Sri Lankans are insured’.
