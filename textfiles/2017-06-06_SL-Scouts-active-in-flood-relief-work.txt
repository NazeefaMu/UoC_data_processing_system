The Sri Lanka Scout Association (SLSA) the largest co-educational youth organisation in the country has mobilized many of their scouts and leaders to carry out relief work to those affected by the recent floods and landslides. Scouts from areas not directly affected have collected bottled water, dry rations, biscuits, milk powder, sanitary pads, diapers and medicines and distributed them to those affected. In addition a large team of Doctors who are scouts, Rover scouts from Kurunegala District, Commissioners from Colombo District, National Headquarters and scouts of Vidura College led by their leader Capt. Kithsiri Jayatilleke, conducted 4 health camps at Thummodara, Dabora in Avissawella area and Ilukpotha and Badureliya in the Kalutara district, together with scouts of Matugama led by Mr. Chamila Kumara.  


Hundreds of patients were treated and free medicines were provided.   


The scout teams have been able to visit these areas and clean up some of the buildings and also distribute packs of dry rations sufficient for a family for 4 days to a week. Some scouts engaged in distributing clothes, whilst others were involved in counselling some who were suffering from depression.   


Deputy Chief Commissioner Attorney-at-Law Janaprith Fernando stated that the Secretary General of the World Organisation of the Scout Movement (WOSM) Mr. Ahmed Alhendawi joined a meeting of the SL Scout Flood Relief Team via SKYPE and discussed the work being carried out, and pledged immediate and further contributions from the WOSM and the Asia Pacific Region. Mr. Alhendawi also requested the SLSA to prepare project proposals to be supported by the Messengers of Peace, which is an arm of WOSM.   


The SLSA stated that their next step is to identify some schools and support them fully in infrastructure, counseling and providing requirements of teachers and students to resume their school activities, and called upon the former scouts, scouts, parents and the general public to assist in any way possible.  For more information contact the Executive Secretary at the National Headquarters on telephone 011 5840687 or fax 011 2433131.
