MYTH: Crossing your eyes can make them stay like that  

BUSTED: “Nothing will happen when you do that. When you are younger you have the ability to see very close and focus on closer objects, but gradually as we age we lose that ability. Adults might not be able to see things closely, but children can see objects close to their eyes. They can see them very clearly. That is called accommodation and with age they lose that accommodative power. When you look at your nose your pupils converge together and that converging power is very high in children.” Explained Dr. M. Wijetunge, Retired Consultant Eye Surgeon of the Ragama Teaching Hospital.
