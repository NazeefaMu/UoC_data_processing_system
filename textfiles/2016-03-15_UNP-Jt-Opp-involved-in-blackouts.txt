One of the main constituent parties of the government, the United National Party (UNP) accused the joint opposition today of sabotaging the economic development programme and said that it would shortly make an interesting disclosure on the involvement of joint opposition in the recent blackouts and the ongoing crisis in the power sector.

This pledge was given by several ministers and deputy ministers at a rally and procession organised by the UNP-led National Youth Front and the young MPs of the party, and held at Lipton Circus this afternoon -- against the joint opposition which the party is accusing of sabotaging the country’s development policy.

Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fenando said the government would make an interesting disclosure on the recent power outage. He said the present government would run the country for ten years and deliver the goods. Elaborating, Mr. Fernando said the Norochcholai Power Plant which broke down 34 times was one of the main causes of the blackout.

Minister Sarath Fonseka said no one would be able to fool the people any longer as they were well informed of the ground situation in the country. “The crooks who robbed the country will not be able to have their way any longer," he said.

Deputy Minister Sujewa Senasinghe said the government had so far created one hundred thousand jobs out of the one million it had promised. He said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema and Minister Sagala Ratnayake who had travelled to China recently had managed to create one hundred thousand jobs through Chinese investments here.

Deputy UNP Leader Sajith Premadasa requested the people to give the government some time to deliver the goods it had promised. He said time was needed to deliver the country from the debt trap.

The procession which commenced from Nelum Pokuna Mawatha proceeded to Lipton Circus where the speakers addressed the crowd from the cargo bed of a truck.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who participated in the rally was seen amidst the crowd. However he did not get on to the truck. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)
