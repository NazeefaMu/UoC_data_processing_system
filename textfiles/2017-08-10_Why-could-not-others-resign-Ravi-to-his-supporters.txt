Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake who resigned from his ministerial portfolio today questioned why others, against whom allegations had been made, could not resign if he could do so simply because there were allegations against him.

Arriving to his residence at Rajamalwatta after the special statement made in Parliament on his resignation, he said he had resigned with pride from his ministerial portfolio to set a good precedent.

“I have made this sacrifice in order to show the innocent people that they could witness a ‘new dawn’ in future. I am truly grateful for the people who still stand by me even during a difficult phase,” he said.

He said they would continue with this government in a positive manner with the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

However, he said the media institutes had given publicity to him for the past twelve days even more thatn what was given to the President.

“I can tolerate all these things. But is it justifiable to do this for my wife and three children?” he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Karunanayake’s residence was seen crowded with his supporters soon after he made his statement on the resignation.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)
