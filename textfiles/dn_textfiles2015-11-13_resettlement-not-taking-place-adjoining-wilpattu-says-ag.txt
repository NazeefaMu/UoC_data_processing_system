Resettlement not taking place adjoining Wilpattu, says AG

The Attorney General yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that resettlement does not take place adjoining Wilpattu National Park.
State Counsel Manohara Jayasinghe appearing for the Attorney General made these remarks consequent to a writ petition filed by the Centre for Environmental Justice (CEJ) which sought an order to quash the clearing of the Wilpattu National Park forest and constructing a housing project adjoining the National Park.
State Counsel Jayasinghe said the people displaced during the war had been resettled at their original places.
He said resettlement does not continue adjoining the Wilpattu National Park.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal President Justice Vijith Malalgoda directed the respondents in the petition to file objections regarding the petition before January 7.
The CEJ filed the writ petition through counsel Ravindranath Dabare and Nilmal Wickramasinghe and named Conservator General of the Forest Conservation Department, Central Environmental Authority (CEA), Director General of the Wildlife Department, Commissioner General of Lands, Commissioner General of Archaeological Department, Mannar District Secretary, Rishad Bathiuddeen, Minister of Industry and Commerce, Minister of Environment and Mahaweli Development and the Attorney General as the respondents.
The petitioner stated that 2,000 hectares in the forest complex adjoining Wilpattu National Park (Northern Sanctuary of Wilpattu National Park and Maraichukkaddi /Karadikkuli Reserved Forest Stands west ward of Wilpattu blocks II and IV) has been cleared, divided into plots, paved roads and unauthorised settlement established making irreparable damage to the whole environment and the Eco system and wildlife habitats.
The petitioner stated that approximately 1,000 hectares of forest in Madu, Periyamadu and Sannara rea which is part of the Forest complex (Madu Road Sanctuary and Madu road Reserved Forests) has similarly been destroyed for settlement.
The petitioner stated that around 1,500 families have been illegally settled in cleared areas belonging to Maraichukkaddi /Karadikkuli Forest Reserve and in the forest complex of Madu Road reserve and Madu road sanctuary which come under the purview of Forest Ordinance No. 02 of 1937 as amended.
The petitioner stated that in several plots of land, approximately 50 acres in the Northern sanctuary of Wilpattu National Park, which come under the purview of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, permanent and temporarily houses and other structures have been erected, cleared for road construction.
The petitioner has information that Minister Bathiudeen has been involved in mobilising the deforestation of these forest reserves and establishing settlements under the pretext of resettlement of internally displaced people (IDPs).
The petitioner sought an order in the nature of Mandamus ordering the first respondent to take action against the illegal removal of forest cover and reinstate the forest lands to the forest reserve and organise forest replanting programmes and in terms of the provisions of the Forest Ordinance No.16 of 1907.
