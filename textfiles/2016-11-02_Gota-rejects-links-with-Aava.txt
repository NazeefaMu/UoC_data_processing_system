Gota rejects links with 'Aava'


	

Former Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa today vehemently denied the allegations made by Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne that the ‘Aava’ gang was established under the approval of Mr. Rajapaksa during the previous government.

He said Minister Senaratne should focus on executing duties of his ministry instead of making ‘malicious’ allegations.

“He (the minister) has been given a ministerial portfolio and he should stick to its duties. He shouldn’t come up with stories which are utter nonsense,” Mr. Rajapaksa told the Daily Mirror.

In response to the minister’s claim that Mr. Rajapaksa and those who are behind the ‘Aava’ gang are spreading violence to destabilise the situation in the North even today, the former defence secretary said, “If he thinks I’m capable of such things, I will take it as a compliment.” (Lahiru Pothmulla)
