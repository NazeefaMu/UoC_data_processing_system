China, (Daily Mail, London), 25.02.2017 - Call it divorce counselling with a morbid twist.  
A businesswoman in south west China has begun offering ‘grave meditations’, which allows divorcees to exorcise their marriage demons. Students are invited to lie in freshly-dug graves to reflect and develop the ability to be more self-reliant.  


First time attendees are encouraged to shout out their frustrations and disappointments.The class was founded by Liu Taijie in the municipality of Chongqing.   


She said: ‘You have to be a strong woman. What if your husband abandons you and finds a stepmother for your kid. In that case, how are you going to survive.’The class has attracted an almost cult-like devotion from it’s students.  


One of them said: ‘When I was lying in the grave, I felt like I was dead. I just realised I wasted a lot of time on meaningless stuff.
