We are now discussing the significance of numbers based on the numerical and vibrational value of the name of an individual.


In a previous article we pointed out that a name could be modified to produce a numerical value corresponding to a favourable number if the present name does not relate to a favourable number due to its unfavorable numerical value. 


In the previous articles, we have discussed the significance of numbers from 10 to 30, based on the numerical and vibrational or resonance value. 


In this article we propose to discuss the significance of Numbers from 31 to 40.
