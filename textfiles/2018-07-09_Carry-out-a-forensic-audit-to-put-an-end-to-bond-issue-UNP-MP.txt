Carry out a forensic audit to put an end to bond issue: UNP MP


	

It is high time that a forensic audit was conducted to determine the exact losses, which the Government had suffered from the bond scam and recover that amount from those who were responsible for it, a UNP backbench MP said today.

“Losses from the bond issue seemed to differ from time to time. Therefore it is essential to carry out a forensic audit to determine the exact losses,” UNP MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena told a media briefing.

He said a sum of Rs 12 billion belonging to the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd’s bank accounts have been frozen already.

“If a forensic audit reveals that Rs 12 billion is the real loss, then there is no issue. However, if the losses are higher, the remaining amount should be recovered from those who are responsible and they should be penalised. There are some people who want to keep dragging the bond issue,” MP Amarasena said.

He said it would not be possible for the Prime Minister to bring former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran when he returns from his current tour to Singapore, as he is not aware as to where the latter was residing.

The MP who referred to the New York Times story, which had alleged that former President had obtained money from the Chinese company, said President Maithripala Sirisena should show the same enthusiasm which he showed to the bond issue, to the New York Times issue. (Yohan Perera)
