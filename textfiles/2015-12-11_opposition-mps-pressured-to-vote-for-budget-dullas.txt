Opposition MPs pressured to vote for Budget: Dullas


	

UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma today charged that there was a move by the government to forcibly obtain the consent of 23 UPFA MPs of the joint Opposition for the 2016 Budget.
He said the government was threatening some of the MPs while intimidating others and pressuring their family members to force them to join the government.  
“An MP who has been a businessman for more than a decade has been summoned to check his tax files of 14 years ago. Family members including children have also been summoned and questioned for no apparent reason.
The government is trying to show that there is no other option for these MPs other than joining the government,” Mr. Alahapperuma told a news conference held at the Dr. N.M. Perera Centre. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
