The brand agnostic solution helps ensure that fraudulent activity is accurately detected while genuine business is protected.Merchants can securely store cards of repeat customers on file with Simplify’s PCI-certified platform and set up automatic recurring payments. They can integrate Masterpass, the digital wallet from Mastercard that simplifies the checkout process, with one secure account, into their checkout with a single line of code.

The open Simplify platform allows developers to access the APIs and Software Development Kits (SDKs). Merchants and acquirers can work with developers to build Simplify’swhite labelled features into their own sites, using sample source code and engineering support available to them.

“The initial response from our local customers and partners has been very encouraging. We are working together on integrating it into their existing systems.
