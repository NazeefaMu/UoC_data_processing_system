Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament yesterday that he summoned IGP Pujith Jayasundara to his office on Monday and discussed the alleged plot to assassinate the President and former defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, for more than one hour.

As the Speaker, he telephoned the IGP, the Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara and the Police Commission Chairman as soon as he got to know of the incident.

He said he also had the responsibility to ensure the security of the President and VIPs and added that he had taken necessary action regarding the matter.

He made this statement in parliament when Joint Opposition MPs alleged that the Speaker did not provide them adequate time to discuss this serious matter in the House yesterday. (Ajith Siriwardana)
