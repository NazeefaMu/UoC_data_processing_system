SLFPers in joint opposition will never quit party - Alagiyawanna

Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) members in the joint opposition will never quit the SLFP to form a new party.
He was addressing the media at the Information Department, Colombo yesterday.
He added that most SLFP members in the joint opposition have pledged not to quit the SLFP to form the so called new party. "They do not want to be a cats paw of certain people of the minor and minority parties".
Alagiyawanna said that certain persons who gained various benefits from the SLFP and came to power with the assistance of the SLFP are trying to split the party for personal political gains. Whatever they say, it is clear that these persons can never come to power without the assistance of the SLFP and without being in an alliance.
"However, I am sure that the hardcore SLFP members in the joint opposition will never allow the party to be split" he said.
He said that the last UPFA government was liable for various forms of misconduct and malparactices including the destroying of democracy by implementing 18th Amendment to the Constitution and unnecessary mediation to courts and so on.
"These reasons resulted for the election defeats of the previous government," he said.
Central Province Transport, Power and Energy Minister Ediriweera Weerawardena said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has become a prisoner of certain politicians. "Mahinda Rajapaksa is being controlled by them," he said.
Southern Province Agriculture and Irrigation Minister U.G.D. Ariyathilaka said Basil Rajapaksa was accused by Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa as been the main cause for Mahinda Rajapaksa's election defeat at the Presidential election. However, both are trying to form a new party now.
Refuting allegations by the joint opposition that several weak persons have been appointed as SLFP organizers, he said that those appointees cannot be categorised as weak as they have rendered a dedicated service to the party for a long period.
He said the Party leader has the authority make new appointments.
