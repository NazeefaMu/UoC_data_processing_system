House Leader Dinesh Gunawardane said today it was the government which could move a financial motion whereas the opposition handed over a motion to the Speaker limiting the Prime Minister's expenditure.

He told a news conference held at the parliament complex that the opposition had planned to move the motion in the House today but they had to hand it over to the Deputy Speaker in writing.

"He informed the opposition that their motion cannot be taken up today. According to Standing Orders, it has to be included in the order paper for five days," Mr Gunawardane said.

He said what they insisted from the beginning was to adhere to Standing Orders and added that only they as the government could present motions in parliament. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
