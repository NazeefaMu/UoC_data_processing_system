Politics in the country appears to have run into a turbulent time with the dawn of New Year 2017. 
Amid street protests and demonstrations creating a tense atmosphere, verbal duels within the yahapalanaya and talk about crossovers and resignations in the offing, have given rise to much confusion and uncertainty in the polity.

 


One state purohita has already quit office and there is speculation that several other state ones and deputies have decided to follow suit; four of them are about to say adieu to yahapalanaya, they say.
The foursome poised for the second round jump are said to be hailing from the Puttalam, Matale and Galle districts and are reportedly waiting for an astrologically auspicious day in the second week of this month to make the move. 


The present hazy picture of the country’s political landscape will clear up soon after the 11th or the 12th of this month, informed ones say.
