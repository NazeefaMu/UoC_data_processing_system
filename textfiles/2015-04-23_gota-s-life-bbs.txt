The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) said today it would urge the government not to harm former defense secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa because he was a conscientious government servant who risked his life to bring peace to the country.
BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera said they were not supporting any politician but said the government should not risk Mr. Rajapaksa’s life.
“Mr.Rajapaksa was conscientious government servant who has done a great deal of work to beautify Colombo City and restore peace in the country,” he said.
The Thera said Mr. Rajapaksa’s life was in a great risk today as the LTTE Diaspora was raising its head in Europe.
He said it was not the intention of President Maithripala Sirisena or Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to imprison Gotabaya Rajapaksa but it was Chandrika Bandaranaike who wanted to do so because of a contract she undertook from the western countries.(Ajith Siriwardana)WATCH
