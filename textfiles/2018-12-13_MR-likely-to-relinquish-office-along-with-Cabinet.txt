Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who recently served as the Prime Minister, is likely to relinquish office in the government soon along with his Cabinet.

UPFA leaders attached to the Joint Opposition met at the Wijerama residence of Mr Rajapaksa this evening and discussed the way forward after the court ruled out the dissolution of Parliament.

Most members stressed the need to quit the government and sit in the opposition.

However, the final decision will be taken after the Supreme Court rules on the case challenging the legitimacy of the new government that was formed on October 26. (Kelum Bandara)
