He said a discussion was held with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Engineers’ society today to find lasting solutions to blackouts.

“The committee is comprised of myself, Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Sagala Ratnayake, Deputy Minister Eran Wickramaratne and Ajith P. Perera,” he said.

He said, after submitting the preliminary report of the committee, the ministry would consider on submitting a long term report to the President within three months.
