	President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday proposed that capital punishment should be given to those found guilty of drug trafficking in the country.
	He said he hoped to send his proposal countrywide through the media in order to obtain public opinion in this regard and take a decision following its outcome.
	Addressing an event to mark International No-tobacco day yesterday at the BMICH, the President said there would be opposition once this proposal is introduced.
	World human rights organizations as well as groups within our country would say that death penalty would not be the answer, but many countries in the world carry out this punishment, he said. (Ariyaratne Ranabahu)
