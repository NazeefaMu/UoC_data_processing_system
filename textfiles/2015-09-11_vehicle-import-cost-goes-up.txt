The total vehicle import cost had gone up by eight to ten per cent due to the appreciation of the Japanese Yen against the Sri Lankan Rupee, Vehicle Importers Associationof SriLanka (VIASL) President Indika Sampath Merenchige yesterday said.
“Most of the used vehicles are imported from Japan and due to the appreciation of the Yen and dollar, the total import cost has now increased,” he said.
The Yen and the US dollar rate had been increased between eight and ten per cent against the rupee during the past ten days, while the other currency rates have increased between five to six per cent, sources said.
“Prices of Honda Grace, Toyota Prius would increase by 0.5 million, while Toyota Aqua by 0.4 million and Suzuki Wagon-R by 0.2 million. As the Vehicle Importers Association, we have decided to sell the old stocks at the old price,” Mr. Merenchige said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
