Celebrating the success of its ‘DFCC Junior’ scholarship scheme for Grade 5 students, DFCC Bank proudly recognised the outstanding academic performances of its Junior accountholders at the important scholarship examination on World Thrift Day recently.

DFCC Bank rewarded Thigalolipavan Mahendran of J/Jaffna Hindu Primary School, who was ranked 2nd in the island; and Ayodya Udan Rajapaksha of A/Thambuttegama Model Primary School, who achieved all-island 4th place for their exceptional academic scores on the Grade 5 examination. These two top academic achievers received monetary gifts worth Rs. 100,000 each, in addition to Rs. 150 for every mark above 150 marks under the DFCC Junior Scholarship Scheme courtesy of DFCC Bank.  The event was attended by Junior accountholders and their parents who gathered to celebrate the students’ hard work. 

Committed to providing the necessary support and tools to the students at a crucial stage of their academic journey, DFCC Bank launched the DFCC Junior Scholarship Scheme in 2017 to reward and motivate children towards achieving superior academic performances starting from an early age. The Bank organised seminars by specialist lecturers to help the students prepare for the exams which has been significantly instrumental in adding value to them.

Lakshman Silva – CEO, DFCC Bank said: “The DFCC Junior scholarship scheme was launched with the idea of motivating students to excel in academics for a brighter future, whilst also impressing upon them the wisdom of adopting the savings habit from an early age. We are heartened by the fact that the scholarship scheme is empowering junior accountholders with the necessary tools to score top marks at the examinations, which forms the base of their academic achievements in higher classes. I would like to congratulate our two brilliant junior accountholders who scored top marks on this crucial examination. We are pleased to see the positive impact of the DFCC Junior scholarship scheme, further strengthening DFCC Junior as one of Sri Lanka’s leading savings products for minors.”
