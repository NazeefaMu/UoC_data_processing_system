Srimadi Nandarani Devi being honoured at the awards ceremony in India.

 

Srimadi Nandarani Devi of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) Sri Lanka was recently awarded at the 43rd Annual Aryabhata International Awards 2017 which was held in Bangalore, India recently .   

Speaking to The Daily Mirror  Nandarani Devi, better known as Mathaji among Lord Krishna devotees in Colombo, said that she was picked for the award after the organisers of the awards ceremony took into consideration what she has done as social service.   

According to Mathaji, she heads Bhakthivedantha Children’s Home which operates under the name Gokulan. The school is situated in Mabola, Wattala, where as many as 115 children receive education. These children receive an education up to the Ordinary Level Examination. When they finish this stage of their lives it’s time for them to bid adieu to the school.   

“I never expected to win awards nor did I apply for it. People who visit Sri Lanka have informed the organisers of this award ceremony, about us and our work. This is probably how I was picked for the award,” she said.   

 


She recalled how a documentary was done in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Tsunami in which some of the work done by the officials at the orphanage came under the spotlight. This documentary was shown in America


 

She recalled how a documentary was done in Sri Lanka after the 2004 Tsunami in which some of the work done by the officials at the orphanage came under the spotlight. This documentary was shown in America and the result was some philanthropist coming forward to donate a bus, a van and funds to make additions to the building at Gokulan.   



Mathaji said that the children at the orphanage engage in meditation, yoga, music and dancing apart from attending to school work. There are students who wish to work in the temple, which is part of Gokulan. “We don’t force them to be too spiritual because we are dealing with children. They pray to Lord Krishna, but lead a normal life,” said Mathaji.   

Students at Gokulan grow up in a spiritual atmosphere which resonates love and peace; two things which devotees of Lord Krishna are assured of if they practice Krishna Consciousness.   

Students at Gokulan practise four strict religious vows which make then refrain from eating meat, having illicit sex, gambling and harming or killing living beings.   

The students at the school are happy that their mother (Mathaji) won an international award. “An Award like this more than motivating anyone highlights the fact that this school is maintaining some regulations and serving the community. This award justifies the financial contributions individuals have made to maintain this institute,” said Mathaji.
