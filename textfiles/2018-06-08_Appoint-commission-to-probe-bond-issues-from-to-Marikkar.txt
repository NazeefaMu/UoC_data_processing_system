Appoint commission to probe bond issues from 2008 to 2015: Marikkar


	

UNP MP S. M. Marikkar yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint another committee to probe illegal activities pertaining to bond issues from 2008 to 2015.

“We urge the President to appoint another commission to probe how loop holes in the law were used to play illegal games through bond issues,” MP Marikkar said in Parliament yesterday afternoon.

“There is a wrong perception that the bond scam in 2015 was the only robbery that had taken place in this country. Arjun Aloysius had sponsored night races during the last regime while former Central Bank Governor Niward Cabraal’s sister was a director of Perpetual Treasuries but no one talks about these facts,” the MP added.

He said names of those MPs who had accepted cheques from Aloysius should be revealed soon, so that the dignity of MPs who had not accepted money could be safeguarded. (Yohan Perera)
