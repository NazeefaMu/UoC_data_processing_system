A group of Naval personnel attached to the Eastern Naval Command had to rescue two elephants that were swept out to the sea, in-between Round Island and Foul Point, Trincomalee this morning, the Navy media said. 

The jumbos were first noticed by an Inshore Patrol Craft during a routine patrol.

The Navy launched a combined rescue operation with the Trincomalee Wildlife Department; to save the two wild elephants with the support of the Navy divers and three Fast Attack Crafts.

Accordingly, the mammoth effort of the rescue teams saw the two jumbos being carefully directed to the shore without causing any harm to the animals. The animals were later released to the Foul Point forest.

In the same vein, a team of Naval personnel belonging to the same Naval command saved an elephant caught in current in the seas about 8 Nm off Kokkuthuduvai on July 11. (Amadoru Amarajeewa)
