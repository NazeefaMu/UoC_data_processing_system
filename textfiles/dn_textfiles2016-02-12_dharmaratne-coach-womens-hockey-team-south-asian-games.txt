Dharmaratne - coach of women's hockey team at South Asian games

Dharmaraja College, Mahamaya and St Anthony's Girls College hockey coach C C Dharmaratne is the hockey coach of the Sri Lanka women's team for the South Asian Games to be held in Guwahati India from next week onwards.
G G Dharmaratne affectionately known as 'GG' in the local hockey world is an Old Sylvestrian and is an experienced personality in the trade.
A very successful centre forward, he played for the Central Province Schools and the Sri Lanka Schools in many representative matches. He also turned out for the Kandy District in both Senior and Junior Nationals.
But it was as a coach he excelled most. He coached a school which was little known for hockey as table tennis, swimming and badminton were their forte. That was Mahamaya Girls College and within a short period they won the National Schools Games girls hockey championship. That was the only occasion in its history Mahamaya Girls College had on this prestigious title. They also won several of the titles in the junior age group in the earlier years.
But for some unknown reason this school shortly afterwards stopped playing hockey and a revival has been made a few years back.
Later he took over the coaching of Mahamaya St. Anthony's Girls College and this school won the National Schools girls hockey championship title in addition to winning several other titles. Last year they won the all island schools girls under 19 hockey title defeating Presidents College, Nawala 2-0 in the finals.
He also coached Dharmaraja College with tremendous success. Though they did not taste much success at national level but locally they were the undisputed champions. At one time the Rajans under his guidance won the under 15 title 9 years in a row and also the under 18 title for several years.
