Another 11 LTTE former cadres who were detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) were ordered to be further remanded till December 3 by additional Magistrate Aruni Atigala today.
The TID officer Kapila moved to remand the suspects as they had not received instructions on the suspects from the Attorney General’s Department yet.
Earlier on two occasions, thirty nine LTTE former cadres were released on strict bail conditions on the instruction of the Attorney General. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
