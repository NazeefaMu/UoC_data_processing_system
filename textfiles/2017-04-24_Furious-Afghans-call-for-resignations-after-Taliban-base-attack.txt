Afghanistan on Sunday observed a national day of mourning after at least 100 soldiers were killed or wounded in a Taliban attack on a military base, prompting angry calls for ministers and army chiefs to resign.   


The exact toll from Friday’s assault in the northern province of Balkh remains unclear, with some local officials putting the number of dead as high as 130.   


Flags flew at half-mast throughout the country and special prayers were said for the dead.   


The defence ministry gave a figure of at least 100 soldiers killed or wounded. It ignored media calls for a complete breakdown of casualties following the five-hour attack near the provincial capital of Mazar-i-Sharif.   


But local officials including, Mohammad Ibrahim Khairandish the head of the provincial council, put the death toll as high as 130.   


Ordinary Afghans vented their anger at the government for its inability to counter a series of brazen Taliban assaults, including a raid on the country’s largest military hospital in Kabul in March that left dozens dead.
