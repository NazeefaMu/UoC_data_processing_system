China lashed out Friday at international criticism after it denied Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo’s dying wish to leave the country and faced pressure to set the democracy champion’s widow free.   


Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing lodged official protests with the United States, France, Germany and the United Nations human rights office over their “irresponsible remarks” regarding Liu Xiaobo, and he took aim at his Nobel status.   


 “Conferring the prize to such a person goes against the purposes of this award. It’s a blasphemy of the peace prize,” he told reporters.
