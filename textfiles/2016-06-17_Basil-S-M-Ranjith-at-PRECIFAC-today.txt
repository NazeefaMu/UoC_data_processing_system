Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and former North-Central Province Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith have been summoned by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) today over two separate incidents.

A spokesman for the commission said Mr. Rajapaksa was asked to report to the commission at 2.00 p.m. to give a statement over the alleged misappropriation of funds belonging to the Economic Development Ministry.

Mr. Rajapaksa was questioned by the PRECIFAC on several occasions over the matter.

The spokesman said Mr. Ranjith would be questioned over the misuse of government funds during his tenure as the North-Central Province Chief Minister.

He said a complaint had been received by the commission alleging that Mr. Ranjith had misused over Rs. 6.7 million on fuel for the three extra vehicles used by him apart from the three vehicles allocated to him and another Rs. 5 million to pay for the extra staff employed for his work.

The Chief Minister’s private secretary had obtained Rs. one million for fuel and another Rs. 2.6 million worth fuel through the Chief Minister’s fuel orders. (Ajith Siriwardana)\
