UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra has created a world record by being the world’s first person to be bailed out within the shortest time ever after being arrested, UPFA MP Udaya Gammanpila said today.
He said that if it was an ordinary citizen who was arrested on Friday, he or she would have to wait till Monday to be bailed out but the MP who was arrested on Saturday had been released within a few hours on the same day.
“It seems even the registrar’s office had been kept open on Saturday in anticipation of the court order,” Mr. Gammanpila said.
He said former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Dr. Nalaka Godahewa was arrested and is being detained on baseless allegations but the MP was released when there was evidence against her. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
