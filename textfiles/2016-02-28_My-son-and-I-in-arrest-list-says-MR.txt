Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa’s elder son Namal Rajapaksa, his brother Basil Rajapaksa, MPs Wimal Weerawansa, Kumara Welgama, and Rohitha Abeygunawardene would be arrested very soon, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa speculated speaking to the media at the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy said today.

“I too will be arrested. We are closely watching the situation,” Rajapaksa told the media.

He reiterated that he would not quit from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) even though many tried to drive him out of the party.

“On the preference of the people, a new political party might be formed, but I will remain a SLFPer,” he said. (L.B Senaratne, J.A.L. Jayasinghe and Nadeeka Bandara)
