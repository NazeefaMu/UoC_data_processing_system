The JO was of the opinion that the Police was behind the conspiracy to assassinate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members, JO member MP Shehan Semasinghe said today.

The CID informed Colombo Magistrate's Court on Tuesday that the Indian national had claimed that there was a plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his family members.

Addressing a news briefing, MP Semasinghe said the Police were seemed to be unconcerned with regard to the spreading speculation on the plot on the lives of President Rajapaksa and his family members.

“We saw on Wednesday as to how Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera attempted to brush aside the widespread plot under the carpet, saying that nothing had yet been revealed in connection to such a plot,” the MP said.

“In such backdrop, when several news reports are being published in this regard, we can’t fathom as to why the Police has turned a blind eye,” he added.

He insisted the Government to tighten the security of Mahinda Rajapaksa and look into the matter seriously.

Meanwhile, D. V. Chanaka said both Arjuna Ranatunga and Dayasiri Jayasekara were responsible to the downfall of the Sri Lanka cricket.

“We recently heard both of them are accusing to each other on the pathetic state of the Sri Lanka cricket,” MP Chanaka.

“It is evident that officials are unduly intervening into the affairs of cricket which has resulted in such a desperate state in Sri Lanka cricket,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
