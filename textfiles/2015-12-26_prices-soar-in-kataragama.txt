Prices soar in Kataragama


	

An increased demand for accommodation, meals and other items in the Kataragama area following an unexpected influx of devotees during the long holidays has created a scarcity of these needs, with unscrupulous businessmen exploiting the situation charging arbitrary prices.
Most devotees complained that the expenses were unbearable having to pay about Rs.3,000 for accommodation at a makeshift cadjan thatched place with just a single bulb. Hotel rooms that generally cost Rs. 4,000 had shot up to Rs12, 000. Most houses and verandas of small shops were filled with pilgrims, they said.
Hoppers are sold at Rs.40 and Plain tea at Rs 50 in many eateries and hotels while rice with dried fish were sold at Rs.250 in many places.
They also said they had to pay Rs 180 for curd containers filled with about one inch of milk.
Some racketeers had even reserved rooms in advance for 4,000 and rented them out at higher rates making two to three-fold profits.
Meanwhile many devotees seemed to have arrived in their new vehicles to Kataragama in order to offer the poojas dedicated to God Kataragama.
Pilgrims also said there were brokers to reserve places in the queue for the pooja at the Devalaya to those who could afford to pay Rs.1, 000. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
