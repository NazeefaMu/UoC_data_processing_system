An electorate level Bala Mandala meeting of the Green party was held at the party’s Maha Gedara the other day. The meeting had been summoned by the doctor looking after the electorate where the Maha Gedara too was situated.

 


A number of party bigwigs had attended this meeting which saw a large gathering of party activists as well.


The meeting was already underway when a party high-up who recently lost his seat at the top table walked in. The late comer gave a bit of a jolt to the doctor who organized the meeting as he had come uninvited. The doctor got further disconcerted when he learnt that that the man had come prepared to deliver a talk as well. So he decided to nip it in the bud. 


Walking up to the lectern, the doctor addressed the gathering, “Now you are to listen to the last but the most important speaker for the day, Our much respected leader…”


The message conveyed went truly home for the disappointment was clearly writ on the faces of several bigwigs including that of the latecomer. 


Later referring to the former purohita’s disappointment the doctor had told a colleague: “The man got the same treatment at Kolonnawa too, but he is yet to learn a lesson!”
