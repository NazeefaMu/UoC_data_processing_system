An uncommonly sweet perfume that a certain fair member of the top team in yahapalanaya wears attracts Diyawanna members to her like bees to nectar, they say.

 


Certain Diyawanna members have developed such a liking to the fragrances she wears that they seem to consider it a privilege to sit by her side whenever an opportunity comes their way.


Some of the heady perfumes she wears are not available locally, they say.


Whenever this fair one visits a city like Paris, Singapore or Hong Kong, she would somehow find time to go shopping mainly for the purpose of buying expensive perfumes.
