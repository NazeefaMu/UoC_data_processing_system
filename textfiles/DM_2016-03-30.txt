CSE seeks foreign listings on new dollar-denominated board
	
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Maldives Stock Exchange (MSE), in association with the Capital Market Development Authority of Maldives (CMDA), acting under the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the two exchanges, conducted a roadshow for potential Maldivian issuers and investors.
The forum, hosted by the CMDA, was held on March 28 and 29, 2016 at the Maldives Monetary Authority Buildingin Male.
The forum presented the CSE as a secondary listing destination for Maldivian companies and promoted the Sri Lankan capital market to investors. The event marked the first Issuer Forum conducted by the CSE on foreign soil. Over 30 representatives from 20 potential issuers from the Maldives and seven investment banks from Sri Lanka were present at the event.
The Issuer Forum comes against the backdrop of a strategic initiative by the CSE to introduce a Multi-Currency Board to list and trade companies incorporated and operating outside Sri Lanka. The necessary approvals for the board have been obtained by the Central Bank and the CSE is awaiting approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC).
Maldives Economic Development Minister Mohamed Saeed, CSE Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka, CMDA CEO Ahmed Naseer and MSE CEO Hassan Manik spoke attended the event. CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike made a presentation on the benefits of listing and addressed the common concerns on a public listing by potential issuers while CSE COO Renuke Wijayawardhane made a presentation on the listing criteria and requirements.
The forum also featured a Sri Lankan listed company, where Softlogic Holdings PLC Chairman/MD Ashok Pathirage and Head of Strategy Chintaka Ranasinghe shared the experience of Softlogic Holdings using the Sri Lankan capital market to fund their growth. 
Saeed making remarks as the chief guest at the Issuer Forum commended the Sri Lankan listed companies for effective capital market engagement and called on the Maldivian companies to embrace the many opportunities available in the Sri Lankan capital market. Minister Saeed also went on to state that the Maldivian companies strengthened through regional economic corporation is vital to economic development in the Maldives.
Kulatilaka said that engaging Maldivian companies has long been an objective at the CSE and that reaching out to them first, represents the trust and confidence placed in the Maldives and its business sector. He stated, We have recently implemented a number of investment and policy measures to give the exchange world-class status. The CSE offers a unique opportunity to raise capital in one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, through an exchange that on average performed better than most major global indices in recent years.
Sharing his thoughts at the panel discussion, Naseer urged the Maldivian companies to make use of the opportunity to gain a perspective on investing in the Sri Lankan capital market and to embrace the best practices maintained by the listed companies in Sri Lanka.
Manik pointed out that listing on the CSE would provide the Maldivian listed companies an opportunity to achieve proper values for their shares. He noted that at present, the shares of listed Maldivian companies do not have the correct values, which is caused by the lack of liquidity in
the market. Pathirage noted that sourcing capital is just one benefit of listing on the CSE and outlined that listing also fosters good corporate governance, paves the way for an optimized company structure and helps in growing the organisation through attracting quality talent.
Commenting on the process of listing foreign companies, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike noted that initially only non-resident foreign investors would be permitted to buy and sell securities through the proposed Multi-Currency Board.
The CSE representatives held one-to-one meetings with the companies listed on the MSE on March 27. Sri Lankan investment banks also had the opportunity to meet the Maldivian companies that were present at the forum on March 28and 29.

While addressing the media briefing, he said that he contested the previous election representing the SLFP while being in the UPFA. The Central Committee of the SLFP took the decision to join the National Government.
Later, I also joined the National Government. I joined the National Government not because of my own decision, but to obey to the policy decision taken by the SLFP Central Committee, the Minister said.

Family member wooed in the last ditch peace move
	

Another team of peace makers from the Betel leaf leadership has swung into action to make yet another bid to patch up the yawning differences among the partys front-liners threatening to split the party right down the middle, behindthe-scene sources say.

The latest peace move comes in the form of a proposal to concede a key position in the party to a member of the former royal family. Even the highest authorities are in favour of the idea of offering a key position to a sibling recognized as a person who has rendered a remarkable service to the country. If the ongoing negotiations succeed, a former secretarial one too will soon be in lucks way.
The sibling who has won acceptance at the partys highest level is likely to be offered high office in addition to the post of the senior deputy chairman of the party.

He proves that everyone at his post is a king
	

A certain uniformed bigwig in the Defense establishment was among those who had received summons to attend a special high-powered conference at the nerve-centre of yahapalanaya.

The Big Boss and several purohitas holding key portfolios had arrived for the conference on time and they were about to proceed with the business when they noted the absence of the bigwig from the Defense establishment.  
In fact, the bigwig in uniform also arrived on time, but the office aide posted at the entrance to usher in the arrivals told him that his name was not among those listed to be allowed in. The Defense bigwig who found himself in a dilemma decided to sit outside and wait for what was to come.
The Big Boss who took the chair, the first to note the absence of the Defense bigwig, proposed to wait for his arrival to get on with the proceedings. They waited for about one hour, but the Defense one failed to show up.
A visibly angry Big Boss sent for the office aide on duty at the entrance and when the latter appeared, he asked him: Didnt .arrive for the conference
He turned up about one and half hours agohe is waiting outside, replied the office aide.
So why on earth didnt you send him in
But, Sir, I had been given strict instructions not to send in unwanted characters, the aide replied.
How can an official like ..be an unwanted character
He has not been listed as an invitee. So I presumed that he is not wanted, the office aide explained.
The Big Boss who looked highly amused dismissed the office aide and started the conference without further delay.

A powerful purohita in yahapalanaya received summons from a Big Boss recently.

The Big Boss had received a number of complaints saying that tariffs and some other levies imposed on a certain industry were highly discriminatory in that they favoured a few big companies and placed the small players at a severe disadvantage.
The Big Boss told the purohita that it militated against the core principles of yahapalanaya to impose discriminatory taxes and asked him to make necessary revisions to ensure competitive equality in the industry.
The purohita had later instructed his officials to make necessary changes to the tariff regime. Two tycoons who reigned supreme in the industry got highly upset on hearing this news,

Betel leaf organizers and activists in a certain electorate in Wayamba organized a party meeting recently.

The Betel leafs chief secretarial one who was present at the meeting as the chief guest emphasized the need for unity of the rank and file of the party at this grave hour and called on party members and sympathizers to sink their petty differences and rally round the current leadership. The audience greeted his speech with several rounds of applause.
The next speaker to address the meeting was a purohita who too is a secretarial one of sorts. He held out dire consequences for those breaching the party discipline and aimed an occasional barb or two at the former Big Boss.
As the purohita held forth attacking the disruptive elements trying to break up the party into pieces, the gathering began getting restive. An occasional interruption or a catcall gradually grew into a big din of protests and boos. In the midst of the big commotion that ensued, the purohita who was on his feet quietly faded from the scene.

Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardane today said a date for Local Government (LG) election should be declared within 14 days from tomorrow (31) because the term of LG bodies would be expired tomorrow.
He said regardless of what the Government or the Elections Commission said, the elections should be declared after tomorrow.
It was for this purpose the Elections Commission was established. Many Commissions were established and we too pledged our support to establish Good Governance. What is the point of having a Commission if it cant decide on elections, the MP told journalists after meeting the officials of the local election watchdog People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL).
The MP met PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi and questioned why they were silent on the Governments decision to postpone the elections for Local Government bodies. 
He said one of the key promises of the President was to hold elections on time.
Regardless of who is the President or who may win, the elections should be held to establish democracy. Even the countries with dictators have provincial council elections, MP Gunawardane said. 
He said the PAFFREL had accepted their argument on the matter and had assured in return to take up the issue as an independent group to hold elections for LG bodies on time. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

New laws to allow People to claim ownership
	
The Government hopes to have legislation approved in Parliament next week providing for war affected people in the North to obtain ownership to their land which they had abandoned even if it was for more than ten years because of the conflict.
According to the present Law of Prescriptive Rights, a person cannot claim the right to his land if it has been abandoned for more than ten years. However, the Act is to be amended to exempt those who had been forced to abandoned their land during the 30-year conflict. The problem is acute in the North and East.
These people encountered difficulties in claiming their lands due to restrictions in the present law. In the East, thousands of acres of paddy land could not be cultivated during the war. The new legislation, if enacted, will bring benefits especially to Sri Lankan refugees returning to the country.
The new legislation is listed for debate in the House next week. (Kelum Bandara)

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) yesterday called for explanations from the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for announcing a schedule for power cuts without the approval of the PUCSL.
Sending a letter to the CEB, PUCSL Chairman Saliya Mathew said the CEB was required to obtain prior approval from the Commission for scheduled interruptions according to the Transmission and Bulk Supply Licence.
However, it appears that the Transmission Licencee is scheduling and carrying out interruptions and therefore had violated and had not complied with the condition of the said Transmission and Bulk Supply Licence, he said in the letter dated on March 29.
The PUCSL called for explanations from the CEB within a week from the date of the letter explaining the reason for violation and to fully abide and comply with the licence conditions in future.
The CEB on Monday announced a daily three-hour power cut from March 28 till March 31 and withdrew its statement, which included a detailed schedule of power cuts, soon after it was published on the CEB website.

This stalwart who made it to Diyawanna from a distant district at the last general poll, nevertheless, suffered defeat in his constituency.
It is an open secret that this one was eyeing a high office under yahapalanaya and perhaps he gave vent to his pent-up sense of disillusionment when he recently spoke from his personal experience how luck favours some politicians and eludes others. Meanwhile, this politico had been seen moving closely with a Green party heavyweight in provincial development activity.
Our hero had been telling all and sundry crossing his path in the House lobby that he had decided to quit politics for good after his current stint in Diyawanna. Some observers say a sudden flash of  inspiration from some quarter has brought about a change of heart in him making him to turn to the Green party to seek the luck that eluded him so far.
By the way, the Green partys youthful talkative one hailing from the same district has received instructions from above not to rub the luck-seeking Betel leaf bigwig the wrong way.

Wigneswarans behaviour hindrance to reconciliation
	
Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) today charged that the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran was acting on a separatist and racist agenda and his conduct was a hindrance to national reconciliation.
JHU national organiser and western provincial councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said the government had taken several steps towards promoting national reconciliation in the country including re-establishing the northern provincial council and removing high security zones but Mr. Wigneswaran was not showing any cooperation on that direction.
Mr. Warnasinghe told the news briefing that the Northern Province Chief Minister did not attend the recently held 32nd Provincial Chief Minister's conference in Hikkaduwa, which gave an opportunity to discuss the issues in provincial councils together with other Chief Ministers and added that he continued to evade the Cabinet meetings as well.
He said: " If Mr. Wigneswaran was acting against the Constitution, action should be taken against him and it was the responsibility of the governor to reveal the reason behind Mr. Wigneswarans actions".
Mr. Warnasinghe challenged the Chief Minister to reveal what he had done for the betterment and to uplift the Tamil people in the north during the last three years.
He said only 20% of the funds allocated for the Northern Province were spent and the rest had been returned to the Treasury. (Ajith Siriwardana)
