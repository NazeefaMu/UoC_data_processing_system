The team included a manager - business development, regional sales managers, zonal managers, heads of branches and trainers. 


The sessions conducted as part of the event covered sales, marketing and IT – areas which are useful for success in a career in life insurance.


The APLIC’s objective is to bring together life insurance sales professionals and financial advisors from the Asia Pacific region. The main organisers of this year’s congress were the Asia Pacific Financial Services Association (APFinSA) and National Association of Malaysian Life Insurance Field-Force and Advisors (NAMLIFA).
