The move planned by the high-ups of the main alliance dominating the North to pit the former CJ from the North against Big-Wig who has now become a thorn in their side, has misfired, they say.

 


The alliance chief had readily welcomed the suggestion to field the former CJ against Big-Wig at upcoming provincial polls that had had come from the young legal colleague Thiran.  However, when the former CJ was sounded about the suggestion, he had flatly turned it down saying that he had no hankering to get bogged down in the political quagmire. Now they are looking for another candidate strong enough to take on Big-Wig.
