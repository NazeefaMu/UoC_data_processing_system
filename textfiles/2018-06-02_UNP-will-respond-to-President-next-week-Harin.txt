The United National Party (UNP) would reveal the truth and would respond to the statement made by President Maithripala Sirisena on the Hundred-Day Programme from next week, its newly appointed Spokesman Harin Fernando said yesterday.

“ We will speak about the programme and other things from next Monday when we launch out ‘Sathya (Truth) Campaign,” Minister Fernando said in response to a question raised by journalists as to how would the UNP respond to the sentiments expressed by President Sirisena on the Hundred-Day-Programme.

“We will launch the UNP’s Central Media Unit and the ‘Sathya’ Programme on Monday.

“The party has decided to start up a Central Media Unit and the Sathya Programme as the party feels that is being neglected.

“We feel that the truth is hidden especially considering what had taken place during the last few days,” he added.

“It is our duty to speak the truth and educate the people. Media has the responsibility to inform the truth to the people and people too, have the responsibility to understand what is right. Everyone should understand the truth,” he said.

He said one truth the UNP was going to reveal was that it was the only party that could get an ordinary citizen elected as the President of this country.

“The UNP is a party which has an ability to get an ordinary man elected as President though some have forgotten it. We have fielded those who emerged among ordinary people right form late President Premadasa, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and President Maithripala Sirisena, who comes from Polonnaruwa as our Presidential Candidate in the past,” he said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who handed over the appointment letter to Minister Fernando said the latter was given the task of heading the publicity unit of the party as he was a capable man.

“It was Harin who laid the foundation for us to win the Presidential and General Elections in 2015,” he said.

He said the publicity unit was created in line with the party’s decision to create a new generation of leaders. (Yohan Perera)
