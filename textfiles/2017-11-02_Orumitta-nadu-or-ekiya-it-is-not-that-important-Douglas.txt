An unwanted debate has started with regards to the meaning of the Tamil word 'orumitta nadu' and its Sinhala meaning, the word 'ekiya' when it refers to the nature of State proposed in the interim report on Constitution. This debate will create unrest among both Sinhalese and Tamils alike, MP Douglas Devananda told the constitutional Assembly yesterday.

" Harping on these words is unnecessary as including the word 'orumitta nadu' does not mean minorities would get more powers and 'ekiya' does not mean they get less powers" he pointed out. " Some people are named Ganesan after god Gnaapathi, but that does not turn that person into a God " he added.

He said this issue had made things so complicated that even the Maha Nayakes are perturbed over it.

The EPDP leader called for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution to be implemented fully. "The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution should be implemented even if a new Constitution is enacted. If not the necessary changes should be made to the Constitution," he added. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
