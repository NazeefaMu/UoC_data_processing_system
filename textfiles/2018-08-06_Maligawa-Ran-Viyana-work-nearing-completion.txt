Maligawa Ran Viyana work nearing completion


	



 

The Rs. 43 mn rehabilitation of the Ran Viyana of the Sri Dalada Maligawa or the canopy over the Sacred Tooth Relic is now nearing completion to be opened before the Kandy Esala Maha Perahera.
The work is handled by the State Engineering Corporation. 
The work was entrusted on a contract signed between the District Secretary H.M.P. Hitisekera and the State Engineering Corporation.
Even in the midst of heavy rain, work was continued to meet the deadlines, especially before Kandy Esala Perahera. Further the workers have to stop work on the Viyana during the periods of service as the Ranvana is right in line with the Golden Karanduwa, where rests the Sacred Tooth Relic.
The Renovation is the result of a massive donation by the President Maithripala Sirisena at the request of the Mahanayakes of Asgiri, Malwatte and also Diyawadana Nilame as the lay custodians.

 


"Renovation is the result of a massive donation by the President Maithripala Sirisena"


The Gold Canopy or the Ran Viyana was the grant of President Ranasinghe Premadasa, where a controversy arose as it is built over the oldest wattle and daub building known Vadihististanaya or the place where resides the Sacred Tooth Relic, but the Diyawadana Nilame Neranjan Wijeyratne and the Mahanayakes saw nothing wrong in building a canopy over the oldest building of the Maligawa Complex, When the work commended then they pointed out that it would be rather grant protection for the old building and would also ward off the moneys who gather over this old building., disturbing the tiles.

However, it was again the State Engineering Corporation who undertook this massive undertaking, taking care not to disturb the foundations of either the new building or the old building which stands today. In the recent period the present Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela had it renovated with gold strips. But, it needed a repair and the custodians had to call on 
the President for this purpose.
President Maithripala Sirisena magnanimously gave an outright donation for this purpose and now the work is been carried out.
