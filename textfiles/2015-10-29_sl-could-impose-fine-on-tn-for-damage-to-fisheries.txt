The government was contemplating the imposition of a fine on Tamil Nadu for the damages done to the underwater marine life and the pollution caused by its fishermen the Sri Lankan fisheries industry, Subject Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said today.
Minister of Fisheries Mahinda Amaraweera was speaking at a media briefing held this morning.
The Minister said the government had decided to take the issue up directly with the Central Government of India. “We have hold discussions directly with the Indian Central Government as we don’t see any point in having a dialogue with Tamil Nadu as the boats which encroach into our waters are owned by South Indian politicians and their supporters,” he said.
He said the talks between the Sri Lankan and the Indian fishermen, which had been going on following the request made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had been suspended as nothing fruitful came out of it.
According to the minister 54 South Indian boats and 120 Indian fishermen were presently being held in remand custody and that the Indian government had requested that that these fishermen be released. (Yohan Perera)Video by Nuwan
