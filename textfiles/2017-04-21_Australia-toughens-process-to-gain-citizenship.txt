Australia toughens process to gain citizenship


	

Australia, which hosts one of the largest Sri Lankan Diasporas overseas, will make it more difficult to gain citizenship in a major overhaul of its migration process, the BBC reported yesterday.

Aspiring citizens will undergo tougher tests on their English language skills and ability to demonstrate "Australian values", PM Malcolm Turnbull has said.

Applicants must also have completed four years as a permanent resident - three years longer than at present.

The move comes two days after Australia unveiled stricter visa requirements for skilled workers from overseas.



Turnbull said the changes would ensure that migrants were better integrated into the community.

"It is important that they understand that they are making a commitment to our Australian values," he said.

In explaining what constituted "Australian values", Turnbull said migrants must demonstrate support for religious freedom and gender equality.

"Respect for women and children ... that is a key Australian value," he said, adding domestic violence would not be tolerated.

A more stringent English language test involving reading, writing, listening and speaking is one of the other changes included in the citizenship process.

Providing evidence of integration into the community, such as employment history, school enrolment or membership of community organizations, having already been a permanent resident for at least four years, allowing applicants to apply only three times and automatically failing anyone who cheats on a test are also new changed made by the government in its migration process.

When asked about reports that applicants would be quizzed on whether they supported forced child marriage or female genital mutilation, Turnbull said it was important to "reinforce our values".

"If we believe that respect for women and children [is an Australian value]... then why should that not be made a key part, a fundamental part, a very prominent part, of our process to be an Australian citizen?"

The requirements would apply to all new applications for citizenship, the government said.
The opposition Labor Party accused Turnbull of making announcements for political gain.

"It seems a little odd to me that you would actually ask people whether or not they are going to obey the law when they already pledge to obey the law," said Labor senator Penny Wong.
