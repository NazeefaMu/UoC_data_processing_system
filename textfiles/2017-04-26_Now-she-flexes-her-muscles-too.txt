A heated exchange between a prominent purohita in yahapalanaya and a provincial ruler that took place at a main Buddhist temple in Senkadagala area made sensational news in the hill-country recently.

 


An argument the ruling one got involved in with the purohita when the latter called at this temple had led to the heated exchange, they say.


The provincial ruler who is said to have mastered the art of manipulating even the planetary influences to suit her purpose is known to be a frequent welcome visitor to the ‘palace’ in the city. 


She had even told the Green national list purohita, a leading businessman to boot that she felt like giving him the ‘punch-bag’ plus ‘football’ treatment. However, the purohita who ignored the challenge had left the scene post-haste in his vehicle, they say.
