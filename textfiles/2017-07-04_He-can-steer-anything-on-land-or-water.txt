A prominent politico had earned kudos from the fisher-folk when the other day he steered a multi-day motor boat into the sea for a considerable distance and back to the shore.

 


A large gathering who witnessed the ride by the politico had applauded and praised him for his feat. 
The politico was attending a ceremony held to mark the presentation of two multi-day fishing boats to the fisher folk in the area.  


Later addressing the fisher folk, the politico had said: “A politician must be able to drive, steer or navigate any vehicle on land or water.  He will be lost otherwise!”
