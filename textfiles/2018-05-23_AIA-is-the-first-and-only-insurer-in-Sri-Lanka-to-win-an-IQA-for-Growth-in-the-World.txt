AIA Insurance is proud to have been recognized as one of LIMRA’s  2018 Top 5 Companies for the ‘Advisor International Quality Award (IQA)- growth in the world’. This new award recognizes companies who have experienced the highest year- on- year growth percentage of over 20% of IQA qualifiers for the last two years.

The IQA was introduced in 1960 to recognize the outstanding performance of agents who promote quality business on a consistent basis, while providing superior customer service. AIA is the first and only company in Sri Lanka to win this award which is testament to AIA’s high calibre of financial advisors.

AIA’s CEO Pankaj Banerjee said in this regard, “we are delighted with this recognition as it speaks of the outstanding performance of our Wealth Planners who have consistently performed in promoting quality business and producing new business while priding themselves in delivering customer service. To attain this award, our qualifiers met rigorous minimum new customer acquisition standards for two consecutive years and have maintained an impressive persistency rate of these customers.”

Deputy CEO and Chief Agency Officer Upul Wijesinghe added “we are honoured to be the only insurer in Sri Lanka to receive this award and will continue to work hard and outperform to remain worthy of this prestigious recognition. This award reflects the importance we place in understanding the ever-evolving Sri Lankan customer and is a validation of all the effort we put in to trying to keep them satisfied. Customer focus and superior service is a priority for us will always continue to be so.”

Senior Vice President & Managing Director for LIMRA, Ian J Watts said noted “AIA Insurance Lanka PLC. has shown that it values its agents who understand the importance of new customer acquisition and high persistency rates- which is without doubt, imperative for the success of the business. For the continued prosperity of the Sri Lankan insurance industry, and the industry in the rest of the world, we encourage other companies to follow AIA’s leading example.”
