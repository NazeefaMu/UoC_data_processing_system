China and Sri Lanka celebrate diplomatic ties with Kung Fu show


	

The ‘Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu Show’ will be held in Sri Lanka for the first time from December 12 - 17. The five day programme is organized by the Association for Sri Lanka China Social and Cultural Cooperation, Sri Lanka China Friendship Association, Sri Lanka China Society and the Sri Lanka China Journalists’ Forum.   

The Shongshan Shaolin Temple Warrior Monk’s Training Base is considered to be the cradle of Kung Fu martial arts in China. This mythical, but practical style of martial arts was formed by studying the behavior and the survival skills of the wild animals.   

The Kung Fu relates to survival, which matters the most when in the Jungle. It is said that the Shaolin Monks spend time in the jungles in meditation with no apparent safety tools, such as weapons, being used. Martial arts aren’t used offensively to hurt anyone, but are put to use only to defend and protect oneself and also to protect those who are unable to defend themselves. Martial artists believe that this is the law of the nature.   


What’s special is that this is the first occasion where Sri Lankans will get to witness a display by actual Shaolin Monks


Long history 

The origins of Kung Fu dates back to 1500 years ago. However the world has got to know of this art of self-defence only in the recent times. The Chinese culture and history were discovered by the Wes in recent centuries. Thanks to many famous martial arts specialists Kong Fu is now considered to be a famous martial art in the world. Kung Fu has been included in movies made all over the world.   

This art and style of Kung Fu will come  alive in Sri Lanka with an exceptional performance to be produced by members of the Zhengzhou Song & Dance Theater as well as students from the famous Songshan Shaolin Temple Warrior Monks’ Training Base. What is special about this show is that this is the first occasion where Sri Lankans will get to witness a display by actual Shaolin Monks.   

An elaborate five-day show is organized in collaboration with the People’s Government of Henan Province and Ministry of Culture, China Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Sri Lanka, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development.   

The embassy of the People’s Republic of China has also partnered with the organisers with the vision of cultivating a lasting relationship between China and Sri Lanka.   

This event becomes special to all the associations and institutions working towards maintaining a stable bilateral relationship between Sri Lanka and China as the two countries are celebrating the 60th Anniversary in diplomatic relations. The occasion will also be used to mark the 65th Anniversary of the Signing of the Rice & Rubber Pact.   

The visit of the Chinese to Sri Lanka will further establish the friendship between the people of both countries specially at a time where ‘One Belt One Road Initiative’ is promoted by China. Today, China and Sri Lanka are at a new starting point of strategic cooperative partnership with Sri Lanka becoming a significant trade and cultural partner in the new Maritime Silk route.   

China is ready to join hands with Sri Lanka to brave the winds and waves along the 21st century maritime silk route, bringing the culture of both countries much closer to its peoples.
