Sampath Bank will yet again gratify its savings accountholders with a special gift scheme from January 1, 2017. 
Over the years, Sampath Bank PLC has constantly re-established its commitment to saving responsibly. With the dawn of the New Year, Sampath Bank embodies its vision of lighting the way towards a brighter future by rewarding all new and existing general savings accountholders with a solar-powered rechargeable torch cum lamp for every new deposit of Rs.15,000, which needs to be maintained for a period of one year. 
The torch can be charged through a silicon solar panel and through conventional alternate current. It can also be used as a substitute mobile phone charger.
“Sampath Bank has always encouraged its customers to be fiscally responsible. We stress the importance of saving and are firm advocates of offering our accountholders incentives to save,” said Sampath Bank PLC Head of Marketing Nadi B. Dharmasiri.
“We launched this special promotion due to the positive reception we’ve received over the years for savings promotions – also to remind everyone of the importance of saving during the first month of the year and well into the future. We have extended this promotion to both the existing and new accountholders.”
The bank’s commitment to working towards a financially-responsible society is paramount and is one of the key reasons Sampath Bank has strived towards providing its customers with unparalleled convenience and value-added services to its customers. The New Year promotion is an indication of the bank’s continued efforts to provide all Sri Lankans with the best services while enhancing their lives.
