SLT and TNL join forces for Christmas

Sri Lanka Telecom this holiday season from 10th to 24th December is teaming up with TNL for what they promise will be an impressive first for Sri Lanka.
While both sides are keeping tight-lipped on the specific details, they have shared that the event will have a strong Christmas theme, and that the spirit of giving will definitely be ever present at the location.
SLT certainly has the resources to back up the hype.
The total internet solutions provider offers multiple broadband technologies including both wired and wireless technologies, Fibre, 4G LTE andADSL.
Further, with two of the most happening companies involved, the possibilities are endless for what they might have in store.
The event activation was described as a “digital first”, implying that technology will most definitely be involved, as one would guess given SLT’s participation. Given that every floor of Majestic City will without a doubt be packed to the brim on the days leading up to Christmas, the public must surely have been factored in as well.
The pairing has already kicked off the holiday cheer with the implementation of a large touch-table at the heart of Majestic City for the general public to try their hand at a variety of touch-based games.
While the games have attracted quite a bit of attention from visitors to the mall, Social media is also bigger than ever, and with it comes the need for instantaneous updates and real-time happenings. If the games hint at anything, SLT and TNL will be targeting the youth yet again with sleek, futuristic experiences, so social media integration is essentially guaranteed. For now, we can only speculate until the big unveiling later this week, so here’s hoping for another jolly holiday surprise!
