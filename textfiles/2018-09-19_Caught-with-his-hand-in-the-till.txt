Caught with his hand in the till?


	



A top executive of the oil corporation had suddenly stopped attending his office giving rise to much perplexity and speculation among the staff, they say.

 


His non-attendance has caused much inconvenience to his immediate subordinates who are being compelled to contact him over the phone every time they have to seek his approval or ruling regarding an important matter.


“He does not come to work, but doesn’t resign either! Nor is he being disciplinarily dealt with or being asked to go! This is a funny situation,” a staffer remarked.


The high political authority concerned has been compelled to sort out certain issues by himself. “Things will soon fall into a melting pot if the boss continues to play truant,” the staffer added.


The obvious rift between the top executive and the high political authority has come as a surprise to many employees at the corporation as the duo had been on the best of terms all the time - getting along well together like milk and honey, according to some of them.


Meanwhile, a rumour says that man is only shying away after being caught with his hand in the till.
