	The mid-term economic development plan presented to Parliament by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will not be hampered despite amendments to several of the budget proposals, Deputy Minister Harsha De Silva said today.
	He told a media briefing that the mid-term economic plan would go ahead.
	“The midterm economic plan is like a ship that causes difficulties to those who are travelling in it whenever its direction is changed. Likewise the amendments brought to the budget are relief given to those who are affected as a result of the government’s effort to change the direction of the economy,” Dr. De Silva, who is also an economist, said.
	He said the main objective of the government was to introduce a system of economic devolution where the people would have a greater chance of deciding on economic development.
	Dr De Silva said the people should not be deceived by the misplaced ideologies spread by some intellectuals that the government was going to allow Indian professionals such as doctors and nurses would be employed in Sri Lanka.
	However, he said the government would introduce a new medical service in several modes where Sri Lankans could obtain medical treatment from Indian specialists without going to India by using modern technology while the second option would be for Sri Lankans to travel to India for treatment.
	Meanwhile, Dr. De Silva highlighted the fact that no Indian doctors or others would be allowed to carry out private practices in Sri Lanka.
	UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim said no other party or individual could claim credit for the amendments made to the budget proposals because the changes were decided by the Prime Minister during discussions he had with various stakeholders including trade union representatives.
