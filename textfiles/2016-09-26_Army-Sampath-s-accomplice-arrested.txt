They also seized Rs.44,900 in cash and 22 grams of heroin which were in his procession.  


Bimsara, who was earlier an accomplice of Bloemandhal Sanka, later joined Army Sampath’s gang.


The suspect was living in a luxury apartment in Grandpass and was married to a Muslim woman.
Police said investigations revealed that the suspect’s family members were unaware that he was an underworld gangster and that the High Court and Magistrate’s Court had already issued open warrants for his arrest.


A Court order was obtained to detain the suspect for further questioning and would handed over to the Colombo Crime Division (CCD).
