Dilhara Fernando recalled after four years

 
Fast bowler Dilhara Fernando was recalled to the Sri Lanka team after a lapse of four years for their three-match T20 international series in India starting next month. Fernando (36) comes into the squad on the wake of the national team suffering several injuries to key players.
Fernando last played for his country in July 2012 and despite turning out for SSC in the domestic circuit have been overlooked ahead of several younger players. Also recalled was leg-spinning all-rounder Seekkuge Prasanna.
The squad also includes two uncapped players Asela Gunaratne and Kasun Rajitha.
In the absence of regular T20 captain Lasith Malinga who is recovering from a knee injury Dinesh Chandimal will continue to lead the Sri Lanka team on its tour of India.
Chandimal captained Sri Lanka in the two T20Is in New Zealand which they lost 0-2.
An SLC news release states that Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekera, Rangana Herath and Nuwan Pradeep were not available for selection due to injuries.
Shehan Jayasuriya, Suranga Lakmal, Isuru Udana and Kithuruwan Vithanage were left out from the team that played in New Zealand.
The squad for the forthcoming Asia Cup and the ICC World T20 will be selected after the conclusion of the ongoing Super T20 provincial tournament, the release stated.
Sri Lanka T20 squad: Dinesh Chandimal (captain), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Seekkuge Prasanna, Milinda Siriwardena, Dhanushka Gunathilaka, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedara, Chameera Dushmantha, Dilhara Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, Binura Fernando, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey Vandersay.
