The branded mobile banking unit

 

Commercial Bank of Ceylon has introduced mobile banking in the literal sense with the launch of ‘Bank on Wheels’ – a modified and branded vehicle designed to provide basic over-the-counter banking facilities to the customers living outside the city limits.


The mobile unit is equipped with a cash recycling machine (CRM), which is an all-in-one deposit and withdrawal machine. It has an in-built banking counter that facilitates opening of bank accounts, accepts loan applications, utility bill and remittance payments. The unit also carries out marketing and customer awareness programmes. 


Operating from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on weekdays, the unit will reach identified locations at pre-planned times at frequent intervals and will function as a mobile bank for these locations. The scheduled visiting times for the locations on its route will be displayed on the mobile bank for the information of customers.
