Vidura tries to usurp Champika’s place at opening ceremony


	

A tense situation arose at the opening ceremony of the Moragahahena bus stand in Horana when MP Vidura Wickremanayaka forcibly attempted to preside over the ceremony.

Even though the organizers had invited Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Champika Ranawaka as the Chief Guest, Wickremanayaka had reasoned that the facility should be declared open by an SLFP member as the project was initiated by the previous government.
 
A tense situation occurred when the officials at the ceremony had refused to allow the MP to get into a bus at the station and take the minister’s place.

However, the facility was declared open as planned by Minister Ranawaka when he arrived at the scene a short while later.
