W. Ashoka Thilakaratne, 29, of Pussatota, Pallebedda in Weligepola lost his vision due to a motor accident during his student days.
He says many eye surgeons he consulted had concluded that his eye sight could not be restored.
But medical treatment received in recent times had given hope of slowly regaining his vision. But the regular medication received costs nearly Rs. 10,000 per month which is beyond his family’s financial means.
He says he would welcome financial contributions from philanthropists and the public to help him continue his medication to get his vision restored.
All contributions should be remitted to account number 245200120056034 at the People’s Bank Godakawela branch. His contact numbers are 0711747130 and 0721111540.
