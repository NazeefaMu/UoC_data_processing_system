State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Palitha Range Bandara said those who were rejected by the people at the last general election had been taken back to parliament by the President and entrusted with ministerial portfolios not with the intention of bringing the Rajapaksas back to power.
Minister Range Bandara referred to the appointment of Major General Gamini Hettiarachchchi, as the Chairman of the Vocational Training Authority, although he had been in charge of the Special Operations Room operated by retired Army officers during the Presidential Election period and had also worked to prevent Maithripala Sirisena becoming the President on January 8. He asked how this could be construed as Yahapalanaya.
He said this in response to Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe’s statement that officials for the ministry were appointed with the proper approval.
Minister Range Bandara said he had no intention going public with this, but that he had been constrained to do so on account of Mr. Samarasinghe’s remarks.
He said the person appointed to the post of the Chairman of the Skill Development Authority had no knowledge and was unfit to hold such a post. He added that everyone knew he was in charge of the operations unit for the sake of the Rajapaksas.
We should not forget these people worked under Gotabaya to capture power by force or in an unaccepted manner, he said.
