An astrological explanation for Earthquakes and Tsunamis
	

Supermoon disturbing the tectonic integrity
	Dramatic ocean tides causing earthquakes
	Uranus unleashing a vast surge of energy

By Sandagomi
Mundane Astrology is an important branch of Astrological Science as it deals with the effect and influence of the Zodiac and planets upon the earth in general and the countries, cities and segments of world population in a wider sense.

Earthquakes  an interesting subject under Mundane Astrology
The prediction of earthquakes in different parts of the world is one of the most interesting subjects that comes under Mundane Astrology.

On the heels of a Lunar or Solar eclipse
According to Mundane Astrology, earthquakes very often come close on the heels of a Lunar or a solar eclipse. But there are several other factors that singly and in combination lead to earthquakes.

Tsunamis in December 2004 and March 2011
The term, Tsunami was quite alien to the people of Sri Lanka until the country was hit by a tsunami triggered by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra on December 26, 2004 which left tens of thousands of our countrymen dead and a greater number homeless. 
In more recent times, an earthquake of 8.08 magnitude on the Richter scale that struck the North-East coast of Japan on March 11, 2011 triggering 13-metre tidal waves left about 20,000 people dead. The effects of this great earthquake were felt around the world from Norways fjords to the Antarcticas ice sheet.
Astrologers had predicted these devastating Tsunamis. However, it was after the catastrophic events that the predictions made by astrologers in terms of the principles in Mundane Astrology had begun receiving media publicity.

Prediction by Astrologer Richard Noelle
It was the British Astrologer Richard Noelle who took centre-stage in the recent discourse aimed at accounting for earthquakes and Tsunamis when he predicted the 2011 Tsunami shortly before the disaster during an interview with the ABC Radio.

Theory relating to Supermoon 
Noelle during this interview explained that the Moon will enter the maximum perigee on March 19, 2011 bringing it closer to the earth than it had been for the last 18 years and the effect of this perigee would be heightened by the Full Moon occurring at the same time.
Noelle had predicted that such a close perigee - a Supermoon  a term coined by himself- would disturb the Earths tectonic integrity so much, it would trigger major earthquakes and even volcanic eruptions.
Some scientists say that the Moon being at its closet to the earth in its orbit and being the Full Moon would not affect the internal energy balance of the earth.
However, John Vidale, Seismologist at the University of Washington at Seattle has conceded dramatic ocean tides do trigger earthquakes. Another American seismologist William Wilcock has said: The effect of tides on seismic activity is greatest in subduction * zones such as the Pacific North East where the tectonic plate is sliding under another.
Astrologer Noelle in support of his theory and prediction has referred to a series of earthquakes in the past which has coincided with the occurrence of the Supermoon.

 Uranus unleashing a vast surge of energy
Accounting for 2011 Tsunami that hit Japan, some astrologers ascribe the event to Uranus transiting in the last degree of Pisces. In Mundane Astrology, Uranus is considered as one of the most evil planets supposed to unleash a vast surge of energy when he is about to enter the next sign.
Footnote: subduction means the action or the process of one part of the earth crust moving underneath another.

## Title: Bond scandal: PT settled dues with borrowings from CBSL, EPF

Bond scandal: PT settled dues with borrowings from CBSL, EPF
	
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunathilake yesterday revealed to the Commission that Perpetual Treasuries Ltd (PT) had borrowed from Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) on April 4, 2016 when it was settling payments to the CBSL and EPF due three days earlier (1) pertaining to the bids accepted in the bond auctions held on March 29, 30 and 31 in 2016.
Concluding evidence from Director of the IT Department of the CBSL Wasantha Kumara Alwis, the Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) explained to the Commission that the PT had borrowed Rs.19.7 billion again from CBSL and EPF using it to settle the Rs.27.5 billion that was required on April 4.
In line with the bids accepted on the bond auctions held between March 29-31, 2016, PT needed to settle the payments to the Central Bank on April 1, 2016. The payment process was set in the systematic medium called Lanka Security System (LSS).
Perpetual Treasuries had then obtained loans on several occasions on the date of settlement (1) using the Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) of the Central Bank, which is given by the Central Bank to enable financial institutions to make payments in real time with the funds accessed during the particular business day, keeping the securities provided by the institution to the CBSL as security.
However, the borrowings from the ILF needed to be settled on the day it was due as it is regarded as a temporary loan given by the CBSL with no interest payable to the CBSL.
This meant that even though the monies owed on the accepted bids at the bond auctions had been settled at the end of the day on April 1, the monies obtained from the ILF by PT in order to settle the bonds were not paid on the same date causing a shortfall of Rs.11.05 billion in the ILF account.
It was revealed yesterday that despite the fact that the PT was not able to settle the ILF outstanding on April 1, they were again unable to settle the due amount before the LSS official closing time.The due amount was however settled by 5 pm on April 4, 2016.
As a result of the Rs.11.06 billion outstanding in ILF borrowings on April 1, the system had calculated the increase of the market value of securities and had charged an additional Rs. 88 million from PT on the basis that there was an increase in the market rate from April 1 to 4.
However, the witness told the Commission that the additional Rs. 88 million charged from PT was later repaid to the Perpetual Treasuries manually on the instructions of high ranking officials at CBSL. Such manual intervention to repay Rs. 88 million was an unusual and unprecedented occurrence as the sum to be paid by the company was calculated electronically by the system, said Mr. Alwis.
It was also revealed that PT was fined Rs.13.6 million by the CBSL over the non-settlement of ILF borrowings on April 1 and another fine of Rs.7.8 million had been slapped on them over a REPO agreement where PT could not furnish securities to the CBSL on time.
The witness was also cross examined by Nihal Fernando PC along with Counsel Romali Tudawe.
Subsequently, the Commission to inquire into the Treasury Bond issue, which comprised Supreme Court Judges Kankanithanthri T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardena and former Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Velupillai, decided to resume the inquiry today (7). (Shehan Chamika Silva)

'Brexit: SL should focus on non-traditional EU markets'
	
Sri Lanka would benefit immensely if it focused on accessing non-traditional markets of the European Union (EU) countries which would reduce the potential negative impact of Brexit on Sri Lanka, Ambassador of the Delegation of the EU, Tung Lai Margue said yesterday.
Delivering a speech at the National Symposium to develop a National Export Strategy, the Ambassador said accessing non-traditional EU markets would also help contribute towards Sri Lanka's ambitious target of doubling its exports revenue.
If Sri Lanka is to substantially increase its export revenues as it wishes to, then diversifying to new sectors is the key to success. Among the EU countries the UK is currently an important market for Sri Lanka and with Brexit becoming a reality, the country should focus on other EU markets which will help cushion the potential negative impact of Brexit, he said.
Commenting on the Sri Lankas re-application for GSP+ last year, the Ambassador said the European Commission had given its positive assessment in January this year and we are now awaiting the approval by the European Parliament and Council of this assessment which will happen by mid-May this year. 
He said GSP+ has the potential to benefit the country far beyond zero duty access to the EU, if utilised creatively,
The rules of origin criteria that needs to complied with to qualify for GSP+ requires that majority of the raw material and other inputs need to be of local origin giving opportunities for new companies to become suppliers to the existing manufacturing businesses and spurring more economic activity and creation of jobs in Sri Lanka. The country will also be able to attract foreign investors to set up manufacturing operations to export to the EU and benefit from zero duty access, he said.
At a time where worrying protectionism and nationalistic approaches are developing, Ambassador Margue said the EU on the contrary will continue to encourage multilateralism, fair trade and international rules based cooperation.
It will also continue to support developing countries and expand its cooperation with middle income countries, such as Sri Lanka, he said. 
The symposium which will pave the way in designing a National Export Strategy for Sri Lanka is an initiative funded through the EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance project - an 8 million Euro project that is the result of a request made by the Sri Lankan Government, at the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission in Brussels.

Depression Dont  keep  it silent
	
According to WHO, 350 million people worldwide suffer from depressionIn 
	Sri Lankaan estimated 800,000 peoplehave depression 
	Depression affects peopleof allages andall walksof life
For World Health Day this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has focused its attention on an important mental health issue, depression, which is increasing in magnitude both locally and internationally.

According to WHO data, some 350 million people worldwide, including 800,000 in Sri Lanka are known to suffer from depression. Depression affects people of all ages and all walks of life and if left untreated, may lead to suicide. Patients and caregivers must be made increasingly aware that depression is a treatable illness and that there is no reason to feel ashamed to seek treatment. 

At a recent media seminar co-sponsored by the WHO and the Health Ministry on the theme Depression: Lets talk, the emphasis was on the need to spread awareness on the disorder which is still stigmatized in Sri Lanka.

800,000 Sri Lankans, young and old of both genders suffer from depression
WHOs Acting Country Representative Dr. Belinda Loring, who spoke on the prevalence of depression, said, The topic chosen this year is of particular global health importance. Depression is a big problem, depression is a growing problem and depression is a human problem. People are suffering unnecessarily. 
She said the number of people suffering from depression had increased and that the WHO considered it to be the leading cause of disability worldwide. She added that patients should not suffer in silence. 
In some countries, stigma and misinformation are the main reasons people dont come forward to seek help. In Sri Lanka, 800,000 people, including young and old of both genders suffer from depression. They can lead happy, normal lives if only they get the help they need, Dr. Loring said, adding that while depression could be treated without medication, it was important to seek timely help without neglecting it.

IN SL 3,000 commit suicide each year
Health Ministrys Director of the National Mental Health Directorate, Dr. Chithramalee De Silva spoke about the problem from a Sri Lankan perspective. 

In Sri Lanka, 10% of the population have mental health disorders, while some 2% have major psychiatric disorders such as severe depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with nearly 3,000 people committing suicide each year, she said, highlighting the fact that the main causes for depression are diverse and included biological, psychological, social, environmental and economic factors. 
Dr. de Silva outlined the progress made in combating this disorder and highlighted further measures that could be taken to control it. 
She said much was being done to curb depression and to spread awareness about it and that the available mental healthcare provisions include Consultant Units, Acute Psychiatry Inpatient-Units and Intermediate Care Units. Mental health awareness is also being carried out in schools, at the workplace, among the elderly and for pregnant mothers. Some of the measures taken to promote mental well-being among these people include life skills development, stress management in the workplace, mindfulness programmes and social activities. For the elderly there are daycare centres while maternal mental health awareness and early childhood care and development are carried out for mothers, Dr. de Silva said. 
She said substance abuse such as drugs and alcohol were some of the methods used by patients to cope with depression and pointed out that this should be avoided at all costs. As a preventive measure, alcohol rehabilitation is being carried out, while domiciliary visits and follow-up visits are being carried out to check on patients with mental problems. Rehabilitation includes the promotion of hobbies such as horticulture while occupational therapy and other lines of work are also encouraged. Cultural shows are also held with recovering patients being given the opportunity to participate, Dr. de Silva said. 
She also pointed out the importance of the media in promoting community awareness on mental health and eliminating the stigma and discrimination attached to mental disorders, while emphasizing on the need for responsible and ethical news reporting so as to avoid negative outcomes among the populace. Investing in mental health, she said, could prevent disability and premature death. 

Depression is on increase
WHO Mental Health Officer Suveen Thirapathy focused on the key factors concerning depression in Sri Lanka. He said people suffered from both mild and severe depression, with women being more prone to the problem. 

Depression has been gradually increasing over the past few years since 2015. It can affect anyone between the ages of 5 and 70, with those between 50 and 69 years being in the majority. Only 40% of people suffering from depression obtain treatment while others are hesitant because of the stigma attached. There are comprehensive mental health programmes but only a few benefit from them, Mr. Thirapathy said. 
He described the symptoms of depression as sadness, loss of energy, loss of interest in daily activities, loss of appetite, difficulty in concentrating and irritability and restlessness, eventually resulting in suicide if left untreated. Mr. Thirapathy spoke about the somatic factors of mental disorders and about Sri Lankans being hesitant to admit they were depressed and complaining about chest pains and headaches instead.
He said the best cure for mild depression was to talk to someone while psychiatric treatment should also be sought for more severe forms. Having a supportive network consisting of family members, friends or family doctors is helpful. With the right kind of support and treatment, depression can be overcome easily. Meditation and exercise are other ways to deal with the problem, Mr. Thirapathy said. 

Talking about Depression is the best cure
Kothalawela Defence Universitys Consultant Psychiatrist and Senior Lecturer of the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Neil Fernando spoke on community-based perspectives on mental health. He explained how negative thoughts could lead to negative emotions and finally to negative behaviour and suicide. He pointed out that the best cure for depression, or vishadaya in Sinhala, was talking about it. Talking not only spreads awareness on the problem but also helps get rid of the stigma.

Dr. Fernando said depression was nothing unusual and gave examples of famous people including Abraham Lincoln, Sir Winston Churchill, Beethoven, Edwin Aldrin and in Sri Lanka, actress Anoja Weerasinghe, who were known to have suffered from the disorder.  Among those most prone to suffer from depression are women, especially mothers, who are vulnerable to both prenatal and post-partum depression. There have been cases of mothers committing suicide with their young children following suit. Midwives have now been trained in Sri Lanka to detect symptoms of depression in mothers Dr. Fernando said. She added that other victims of depression include students who have to deal with school pressures and are pushed to perform well in their studies, urging teachers to advise such students if signs of depression were detected.

He said men were usually the most reluctant to discuss their emotions and most likely to turn to alcohol and drugs but that they too should be encouraged to talk about their problems rather than keep them hidden. 
Dr. Fernando said another important section of the population vulnerable to depression are the elderly. The elderly population in Sri Lanka is increasing with most of them suffering from loneliness with no one to talk to. It is important to detect any signs of depression in them, he said.  Referring to preventive measures, Dr. Fernando said early recognition was important in preventing suicide while staying connected to family and friends and seeking professional help were also necessary.  He said depression was a result of chemical changes occurring in the brain and that daily physical exercise such as walking for 30 minutes in the morning was beneficial and would help a person get through the entire day. Exercise also helps release endorphins in the brain. It is a feel-good hormone that will greatly reduce negative emotions, Dr. Fernando said. 
He highlighted the need for people suffering from depression to engage in some useful activity or hobby. 
Depressed people will feel like they dont want to go anywhere and stay in bed. This worsens the problem. Do the opposite of what you want to do. If you want to stay in bed, go out instead. Do something you enjoy, it will help get rid of negative thoughts, Dr. Fernando said and added that it would be difficult to get into this pattern but it would be helpful in the long-run. 
He said depression could be almost as disabling as cancer if nothing was done and there was an urgent need to spread awareness on how best to overcome the disorder.

If Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had intervened to bail him out, it means it was the Prime Minister himself who had ensured he remained in remand custody, National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa said after he was released on bail today.
Responding to questions asked by journalists outside the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, the MP who was released on bail after being remanded for 87 days said the news which says the Premier has intervened to bail him out has caused serious disgrace to the judiciary which is independent.
On the other hand, the news has confirmed the allegation levelled by some factions. The Prime Minister cant instruct law enforcement authorities to release me. The cat has jumped out of the bag, he said and added that there was no need for him to beg for bail from either the President or the Prime Minister.
Bail was decided by the Court. If anyone is attempting to score marks for granting bail, it is only a cheap move, the MP said.
He said he was thankful to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for 'keeping him in jail without valid charges and giving the opportunity to restart with a boost.
When the hearth is heated, the iron gets seasoned and can be mended properly, the MP said.

Judging character  from the shape of the hand
	
Human hand  trailblazer of human civilization  Part 3


By A.S. Fernando
In the previous article under the above topic we referred to seven types of the hand each with a specific shape and also discussed the first three types of hand, namely the Elementary or the lowest type of hand, the Square or the Useful hand and the Spatulate or the nervous active hand. We propose to discuss in this article the remaining four types of hand namely:

The Philosophical or the Jointed hand
	The Conic or the Artistic hand
	Psychic or the idealistic hand and the
	Mixed hand
The Philosophical or Jointed hand is long, bony, and angular with knotty joints and is fairly thin. People with this kind of hand are great readers with literary talents. They prefer a sedentary work and a solitary and austere life. As a rule, the Head Line of such hands is rather sloping. People with this type of hand rarely earn as much wealth as those with the Square Hand.
The Philosophical Hand represents a very high mental plane of the human family.
The Conic or Artists Hand: This type of hand is soft, supple and tender and graceful in appearance. The fingers are thin, long, artistic and are well formed.
The owner of this type of hand may not always be a painter or any other artiste. But he would have an emotional and artistic temperament and the love for the beautiful and awe-inspiring creations of Mother Nature.
He is very sensitive to colour, music, and all fine arts.
The Head Line and the will power denoted by it would determine whether the subject is capable of developing his inborn artistic talents to their full capacity. 
They are great connoisseurs of art and for some reason they fail to become practicing artistes, they would spend a greater portion of their wealth on artistic pursuits.
From a worldly point of view these subjects are failures in life as they live in a world of fantasy. However, if an artists hand is not so supple and little stiff, the subject would acquire wealth and fame by means of his artistic skills.
The Psychic or Idealistic Hand: This type of hand represents the highest developed mental stage of man. But from a worldly standpoint this type does not represent success.
This type of hand is generally well formed and supple. with a single glance one can say that this type of graceful hand is not meant for hard manual work. These subjects develop psychic powers. They are mostly idealists and dreamers who are not adequately equipped  mentally and physically to deal with problems in life in practical terms.
Mixed Hand: This type of hand as the term suggests represents a mix of characteristics of other types, but it cannot be treated as belonging to any of the types we have so far discussed.
Often palmists have found some hands of this type with fingers shaped differently from one another. For example, one finger may be pointed or conical or square or spatulate and so on.

Philippines Duterte orders troops to disputed South China Sea islands
	

BEIJING - The Philippines president appeared to revive his quarrels with China on Thursday, ordering Philippine troops to occupy islands and reefs in the disputed South China Sea. 
Rodrigo Duterte said that the military should build structures on all of the Philippine-held islands, reefs and shoals in the contested Spratly Islands - not far from seven man-made Chinese islands in the area. 
Chinas construction of the islands is part of its claims of territorial sovereignty over the entire South China Sea, an important route for sea trade across Southeast Asia. Neighbouring nations strongly oppose Beijings moves and worry that the runways and docks on the artificial islands could eventually have a military use. 
Since winning the presidency last summer, the bombastic Duterte has struck a surpisingly conciliatory tone with Beijing. 
It is not clear if Duterte was making a policy statement or another of his high-stakes quips. 
If could suggest, however, that Duterte is returning to his confrontational stance with China after powerful domestic critics questioned his light-touch approach with Beijing. 
Duterte also mentioned that he would like plant a flag on one island for Philippine Independence Day on June 12. 
It looks like everybody is making a grab for the islands there, so we better live on those that are still vacant, he said.  At least, let us get what is ours now and make a strong point there that it is ours, he added.

Self-driving shuttle takes to London streets in trial run
	

HINDUSTAN TIMES, 06th APRIL, 2017-Four wheels, four seats, but no brakes and no steering wheel.
A driverless prototype shuttle bus is ferrying around 100 people on a route in Greenwich in London as part of the public trial over the next three weeks.
The computer-controlled vehicle travels just over 16 kph. It can seat four people and has no steering wheel or brake pedal. However, there will be a trained person on board who can stop the shuttle if required during the tests.
Officials behind the project believe the shuttles could improve transport links in Greenwich.
Passengers could begin using the system by 2019 on a trial basis and it may eventually be rolled out elsewhere, BBC News reported.
We hope to gain acceptance from members of the public for vehicles sharing this kind of space with them, said Graeme Smith, chief executive at Oxbotica, which developed the technology behind the shuttle.

## Title: The most disabling health condition  which needs an overall approach

The most disabling health condition  which needs an overall approach
	
Each year on April 7th  World Health Day, important areas of health are brought to the attention of the global community under the sponsorship of the World Health Organisation. The aim is to improve the health status of people and communities by raising awareness, generating interest and initiating activities among stakeholders. This years theme being depression, I wish to bring to the attention of the community a few important issues about depression in the context of Sri Lanka and the challenges faced in the country. 
What do we know about depression
Depression or sadness is a normal emotion. An abnormal and excessive degree of sadness is interpreted in different ways depending on the context and the circumstances. As a clinician, my focus is on clinical depression, a health condition that impairs physical and mental functions and is associated with personal distress and a very complex and rich personal narrative. Depression is characterized by pervasive and predominant sadness associated with low motivation, an inability to be happy, lack of initiative, short attention span, problems in concentrating, fear and worry. Many other symptoms often occur in depression such as disturbance of sleep, menstrual problems, impairment of sex drive, weight loss, physical symptoms and preoccupation with poor physical health, which significantly impacts the persons life. On detailed assessment of the mental state, many patients would go into detail on their mental world - worries, concerns, fears and preoccupations, often using colloquial words such as thonthu, kalakirila, asahnaya, kanagatu, duka, kanassalu. The diagnosis of clinical depression depends entirely on a detailed interview and criteria based on the international classification systems. The patients medical history will reveal whether there are other health conditions associated with mental dysfunction. 

This cluster of symptoms found in depressive episodes are associated with major depressive illness, and depressive phases of bipolar illness, the latter being increasingly seen as a different health condition. Similarly, many other health conditions including alcohol abuse, eating disorders, other psychiatric illnesses and physical illnesses including cancer, diabetes and heart disease may be associated with depressive symptoms. It is well known that sociocultural factors fashion the patients presentation, selection of interventions and the outcome of depression. 
Based on the estimation of years lived with the disability (YLD) due to a particular health condition or disease and the ranking of the diseases by patients, care-givers, professionals and others, depression has been found to be the most disabling health condition affecting three hundred million people, or four percent of the worlds population. Mental pain or distress associated with depression is much greater than physical pain according to those who experience these episodes and unlike physical pain, there are no interventions that could relieve it immediately. Those with depression have a shorter life span - being more susceptible to a premature death from physical illness or suicide. The economic impact due to the loss of productivity and healthcare costs as a result of depression are staggering, going up to an estimated figure of trillion dollars annually. Caring for a family member with depression or managing an employee with depression at the workplace could be challenging. While it is clear that genetic factors and brain dysfunction have a major role to play in the causation of depression, there is increasing evidence to show that social factors such as poverty, deprivation, early childhood experiences and psychological factors such as emotional trauma also play important roles in causing and influencing the course of the illness. The number of new depression cases per year is increasing globally among all age groups including children, adolescents and the elderly from all social and economic backgrounds. Females are likely to have a higher incidence of depression including after giving birth (post-partum depression).
How do we manage people with depression
We increasingly use the term comprehensive approach of treatment towards depression, which aims to relieve symptoms, prevent relapses and improve the quality of life of an individual. WHO defines quality of life as an individuals perception of his position in life in the context of the culture and value systems and in relation to his goals, expectations, standards and concerns. Drug therapy, other physical methods of treatment including electro-convulsive therapy, trans-cranial magnetic stimulation and psychological methods including mindfulness-based cognitive behaviour therapy, other forms of psychotherapy and yoga are used in treatment by psychiatrists as well as by other non-medical mental health professionals. Public health professionals and others undertake the primary prevention of depression through health promotion activities. As regards treatment, the optimism generated in the 1980s with the introduction of Happy Pills has not been fully realized, for now it is known that even with newer antidepressant drugs, improvement is hardly complete and some residual symptoms remain. 
Increasingly, the aim of mental health services is seen to reduce the burden of mental health. The burden is measured by a combination of two indicators; the number of years of life lost to disease and the number of years lived with disability by people suffering from depression. Modern services are community-oriented and organized around specific geographical areas, providing comprehensive services which are easily accessible and affordable. Special psychiatric or mental health services are those which are provided by a network of community-oriented mental health facilities, interventions and personnel in a given geographical area of the country. Since special services alone cannot meet all mental health demands, general health, primary care, social services, education and many other services have integrated selected aspects of mental health care into their programmes. 

The priority given globally today to emotional and mental health has led to increasing numbers of people recognising depression and seeking relief from health practitioners. The acceptance of mental health as an integral part of health has resulted in people today recognizing the emotional aspects of physical illness much more than before. With a better understanding of the nature of depression and the possibility of treatment, community attitudes are becoming increasingly favourable towards mental health resulting in less stigma being attached to the disease. The reforms of mental health services have responded to the United Nations resolution in 1991, calling for the protection of people with mental illness and the improvement of mental healthcare. This has led to a reduction of the traditional discrimination, marginalisation and exclusion of people with mental health problems. The increasing sensitivity attached to issues such as confidentiality, privacy and respecting dignity in clinical practice has improved patient care practices. The acceptance of the need to provide an equitable distribution of services affordable to people in local communities has led to reforms of traditional centralized mental healthcare. Accordingly, in keeping with national policies, each region, district or division based on population size is allocated resources for the provision of comprehensive mental health services. 
What are the issues inSri Lanka
Over the years, we have seen increasing numbers of people from different age groups, social classes and geographical areas of the country seeking relief for mental health problems. About thirty percent of patients seen by a psychiatrist are likely to have a diagnosis of depression. Similarly we have seen mental health services expanding significantly in the public sector, private sector and in the non-government sector, providing a wide range of services. At the same time, we continue to see very crowded public sector health facilities with limited resources serving the poor. Still, a large number of people suffering from depression in Sri Lanka either do not receive treatment or have inadequate treatment due to a numbers of major obstacles. 

What then are the major obstacles preventing the development of a better mental health service The first obstacle is gaps in our knowledge of mental health and depression in the context of our culture. We still do not have a good understanding of many aspects of depression, particularly the cultural influence on manifestations, personal experiences and response to psychological therapies in Sri Lanka. What influences do mindfulness-based therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy or yoga derived from eastern philosophies have on the treatment of depression A lack of knowledge on these prevents us from providing adequate care. The second obstacle is the low priority attached to emotional health including depression when compared with physical health problems. This not only slows the development of mental health services but also prevents or delays individuals from utilizing available services. In Sri Lanka, many tend to believe that emotional disturbance is the responsibility of the individual and the need to seek expert advice is not felt. The third challenge is stigma, which continues to be a major obstacle in mental health. As a result of stigma, patients are prevented from seeking relief, do not utilize services, do not claim insurance benefits, do not claim leave entitlements and eventually delay seeking and obtaining treatment, increasing their chances of developing disabilities and even death due to suicide.The fourth obstacle is the violation of rights of the mentally ill. This is common and often results in discrimination, marginalization or exclusion at the workplace, families or in the community. In an institutional setting, there is often indifference to respect of dignity, privacy or confidentiality. This is often reflected in the way patients are interviewed in open spaces, the free dissemination of medical information and treating personal case records as public property. 
The fifth obstacle is the compartmentalised approach towards mental health care. Individual therapists tend to work in isolation, fulfilling a few needs and leaving other needs unattended or leaving it to the patient to seek relief on his or her own from another source. Psychiatrists tend to treat patients using drugs, with minimal attention to psychosocial issues. Non-medical mental health professionals tend to focus on psychological approaches with little attention to other health needs. There is little coordination between education, social welfare, health and other special services with mental health services. Comprehensive care involves minimising symptoms, preventing relapses, promoting health and providing social support with the aim of improving the quality of life of the patient. Finally, a major obstacle interfering with efforts to reduce the burden of depression is the inadequate and inequitable distribution of mental health services, with most services concentrated in Angoda and a few urban centres, while rural communities have minimal services. 
How then can we overcome these obstacles or minimisetheir impact
This is the great challenge facing the government and agencies responsible for providing mental health services. The process of improving the quality of life in people with depression and reducing the burden of depression is a long-term goal needing the government, all institutions and communities working together for the common goal.
The government should take the leadership and mandate the relevant body to come up with a policy, plan, strategy and resources to realize the stated objectives. Once this is achieved, it is essential for all stakeholders including the health directorate, mental health directorate, clinical services, public health services, academic departments, training agencies and other relevant institutions to be partners in its implementation.

Trinco oil tanks to be leased out to India
	
After deliberations involving President Maithripala Sirisena and Indian High Commissioner Taranjith Singh Sandhu, the government has decided to lease out the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm for development jointly with India, a Minister said yesterday.
In the lower farm, there are 14 tanks currently being used by Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC). However, there are 84 tanks in the Upper Tank Farm that are not being used at the moment.
Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Chandima Weerakkody told the Daily Mirror that ten of these tanks would be retained by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), and the rest would be developed jointly with LIOC under a joint venture.
He said the government decided on this after a series of meetings involving President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe , the Indian High Commissioner and him.
The initial move was to hand over all the tanks to the Indian authorities. However, the Minister said President insisted that at least ten tanks should be vested with the Sri Lankan side. (Kelum Bandara)

Trump launches military strike against Syria
	
The United States launched a military strike Thursday on a Syrian government target in retaliation for their chemical weapons attack on civilians earlier in the week.
On President Donald Trump's orders, US warships launched between 50-60 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian government airbase where the warplanes that carried out the chemical attacks were based, US officials said.
"Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air field in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched," Trump said during short remarks to reporters at Mar-a-Lago. "It is in this vital national security of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons."
He added: "There can be no dispute that Syria used banned chemical weapons, violated its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention and ignored the urging of the UN Security Council. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behavior have all failed and failed very dramatically."
A US defense official said the strike was targeted on runway, aircraft and fuel points. The missiles were launched from warships in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Strikes are over "until another decision is made," the official said.
The strikes are the first direct military action the US has taken against the leadership of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's six-year civil war and represent a substantial escalation of the US' military campaign in the region, which could be interpreted by the Syrian government as an act of war.
There were Russians at the base that the US struck Thursday night, a US defense official. It was not said what the Russians' role was at the base. In addition, according to the official, the US had multiple conversations with the Russians today to warn them of the coming attack.
Separately, in an effort to tie the US strike to the chemical attack, the US military showed reporters an image of the radar track of a Syrian airplane leaving the airfield and headed to chemical strike area on Tuesday. A second image of bomb damage craters at the airbase was also shown to reporters at the Pentagon.
Lawmakers generally supported Trump's decision to strike back against Assad Thursday night, but cautioned the President against unilaterally starting a war without first consulting Congress.
A pair of defense hawks -- Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham -- who have frequently been critical of Trump, roundly praised his decision Thursday night.
"Acting on the orders of their commander-in-chief, they have sent an important message the United States will no longer stand idly by as Assad, aided and abetted by Putin's Russia, slaughters innocent Syrians with chemical weapons and barrel bombs," McCain and Graham said in a joint statement.
But Sen. Rand Paul called on Trump to consult on Congress.
"While we all condemn the atrocities in Syria, the US was not attacked," Paul said.
The US began launching airstrikes in Syria in September 2014 under President Barack Obama as part of its coalition campaign against ISIS, but has only targeted the terrorist group and not Syrian government forces.
Trump met with his national security team before his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago Thursday, where he made the decision to pull the trigger on the biggest military action of his presidency, an administration official says.
He sat through dinner with the President Xi as action was under way.
Hillary Clinton: US should 'take out' Assad's air fields
Defense Secretary James Mattis has been updating Trump about the missile strikes in Syria following his dinner with Xi, according to a US official.
Mattis, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Trump's national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster were with Trump at Mar-a-Lago at the time. Vice President Mike Pence remained in Washington, where he returned to the White House after dinner.
Trump's order to strike the Syrian government targets came a day after he said the chemical attacks -- whose grisly effects were broadcast worldwide where videos captured in the immediate aftermath -- "crossed a lot of lines for me" and said he felt a "responsibility" to respond.
"I will tell you it's already happened that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much," Trump said.
"When you kill innocent children -- innocent babies -- babies -- little babies with a chemical gas that is so lethal, people were shocked to hear what gas it was, that crosses many, many lines. Beyond a red line, many, many lines," Trump said.
Trump's decision to launch the strikes, the most significant military action of his young presidency, came nearly four years after the US first concluded that Syrian forces had used chemical weapons in Syria. The Obama administration concluded that Syria had violated the "red line" Obama had set a year earlier in discussing the use of chemical weapons, but ultimately decided against military action against Syria in favor of a Russian-brokered deal to extricate the country's chemical weapons stockpile.
Trump at the time said the US should "stay the hell out of Syria" and urged Obama on Twitter to "not attack Syria" in the wake of the 2013 chemical attack.
"There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your 'powder' for another (and more important) day," he tweeted in September 2013.
Trump repeatedly criticized Obama during his presidential campaign for not acting on his "red line" threat, but the real estate mogul also argued against deepening the US' military involvement in Syria, particularly as it related to Assad.
Trump argued last May in a TV interview that he would "go after ISIS big league," but said he did not support targeting Assad's regime, arguing the US has "bigger problems than Assad."
Syria's six-year civil war has claimed the lives of at least 400,000, according to a United Nations estimate released a year ago. More than 5 million Syrians have fled the country and more than 6 million more have been displaced internally, according to UN agencies.
But guided by his "America First" ideology and rejection of the US' propensity for "nation-building," Trump did not argue in favor of stepped-up US intervention during his campaign for president.
Instead, he signaled the opposite: He argued that the US should remain laser-focused on defeating ISIS and vowed to try and partner with Russia, which has heartily backed Assad's regime, in order to defeat ISIS and bring the conflict to an end.
Those views appeared steeped in his longstanding criticism of the Iraq War, which he called a "stupid" decision, lamenting the billions of dollars funneled toward that war effort instead of on domestic programs, like infrastructure spending.
While Trump rejected the isolationist label some placed on him during the campaign, he made clear that his preference was for limiting the US footprint around the world and refocusing US foreign policy around core national security interests. (CNN)
