'Trail', a remarkable journey organised to raise funds to build a Cancer Treatment Unit at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital in Galle, came to a successful end yesterday, following a strenuous 28-day walk from Point Pedro to Dondra Head. During the journey, a total of Rs.400 million (US$ 3 million) was raised from collections on the road alone -- carried out with Trail Brand Ambassador Mahela Jayawardena playing a key role in the initiative. Trail was initiated in conjunction with Colours of Courage Trust founded by Sarinda Unamboowe and Nathan Sivagananathan. The picture shows cricketing legend Mahela Jayawardena breaking into tears at the emotional moment of completing the worthy work. Pix by Pradeep Pathirana
