Have you thought about your retirement? Or has planning for it seemed so complicated and overwhelming that you put it aside for later? If so, then you are not alone. Most people find planning for retirement an expensive task with tons of paperwork, laborious medical testing and general stress. It is therefore often postponed or at times disregarded all together.


But the fact remains that retirement is imminent and so is inflation. If we don’t plan now, we won’t be able to afford to continue the lifestyle we are used to after retirement. Needless to say, the earlier you start planning, the more time you have to build your fund. The key is to start saving early and save regularly – even if it is small sums of money.


That is why AIA has developed a brand-new pension plan that allows you to do just that – introducing AIA Easy Pensions, an affordable, uncomplicated and comprehensive way to save for your retirement.  For this retirement savings plan, you don’t have the hassle of filling pages of complicated paper-work or taking time consuming medical tests. With minimum premiums starting as low as Rs.2,100 – it is not only easy to process but also easy on the wallet.


You can now get an AIA Easy Pensions in three simple steps that are as easy as ‘tak, tik, tuk’: ‘Tak’ – select how much you wish to save for retirement (four savings and protection packages to choose from). ‘Tik’ – select how long you wish to pay for (select how long you wish to commit to paying your premiums). ‘Tuk’ – decide if you want a lump sum or a monthly pension (you can collect your pension fund as a lump sum or as an increasing monthly pension for a period of 10 to 30 years). 


What’s more AIA Easy Pensions comes with more features that not only get you retirement ready but offer protection along the way; a loyalty bonus on the 10th year to boost your retirement nest egg, life insurance to ensure the family is provided for in case you die, an increased accident cover if death is not due to natural causes and the flexibility of withdrawing funds in the event of an emergency. 


AIA’s Easy Pensions campaign, which was launched on October 8, to coincide with the National Pensioners Day, also coincides with the AIA Pension Month. Now in its third consecutive year, the AIA Pension Month is rolled out in October, with a concentrated effort to create more awareness about the need to start planning for retirement. During this time, AIA’s nationwide team of wealth planners will put all their energy into guiding Sri Lankans to a more secure and ideal retirement.
