Speaker on Vijayakala: Opp. MPs tarnished the image of House


	

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today said he had done his utmost in taking action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran.

Making a special statement in Parliament, the Speaker said informing Attorney General to take action against the State Minister was the best option he had in his capacity as the Head of the House.

“It was sad to see several MPs behaving in an unruly manner even after I have done my utmost to take action against Mrs Maheswaran.

“Two MPs behaved in a most unruly manner using foul language. This action had tarnished the image of Sri Lankan Parliament,” the Speaker said.

Also, he said it was sad to see Parliament losing the opportunity of debating and approving an important piece of legislation.

The Speaker said the House was to debate and approve the regulations imposed under the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority Bill under which the people were going to get several benefits. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardana)
