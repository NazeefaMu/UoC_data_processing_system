All bakery products, except bread, would be increased by Rs. 5 from midnight today (15) because of the recent fuel price hike and domestic gas price hike, the All Island Bakery Owners’ Association (AIBOA) said.

“We have to recover our costs to protect bakery industry, we are compelled to increase the prices of bakery products,” AIBOA Chairman N.K. Jayawardane said in Gampaha while speaking to the media.

“However the price of a loaf of bread will not be increased now considering the people,” Mr Jayawardane said.

“If the Government failed to take any action to provide relief for bakery owners, the price of a loaf of bread would have to be increased by Rs.10,” he added.(Chaturanga Samarawickrama)
