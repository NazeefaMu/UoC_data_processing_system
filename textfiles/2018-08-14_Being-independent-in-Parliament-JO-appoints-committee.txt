The party leaders of the Joint Opposition (JO) today appointed a committee of experts led by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman Professor G.L.Peiris to study the matter of becoming independent in Parliament.

Some of the MPs of the JO were considering the notion of becoming independent in Parliament, after leaving the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in their crusade to obtain the Opposition Leader’s post.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, Prof. Peiris said the matter of becoming independent was discussed at great length at the party leader’s meeting which was held under the leadership of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

“There appears to be various aspects of this issue and it was decided that all these different aspects needs to be considered in depth and in great details before a final decision is made. Therefore, it was decided to appoint a committee of experts under my chairmanship and consisting of party leaders and others, to look at all the issues and to make a report,” he said.

He said the committee would look at the matter carefully and would present a report to the party leaders. “The final decision will be made only after considering the report of this committee of expert,” he said.

Opposition Leader nominee of the JO, MP Dinesh Gunawardane and MP Dullas Alahapperuma have also been appointed as members of the committee. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
