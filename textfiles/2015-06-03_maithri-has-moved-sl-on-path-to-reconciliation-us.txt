	The US on Tuesday said President Maithripala Sirisena had moved Sri Lanka away from divisive politics and crony capitalism toward a new path of reconciliation.
	“Democratic elections have brought about a sea-change in US- SL relationship, where the new President has moved the country away from divisive politics and crony capitalism toward a new path of reconciliation and inclusive development,” Richard E. Hoagland, the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said.
	Speaking at the Washington International Business Council, he said they would support Sri Lanka’s pursuit of strengthening its governance, especially its judicial and financial institutions.
	“This new path will be a boon for the Sri Lankan people, as well as U.S. interests. We can now work together with Sri Lanka to promote good governance and human rights abroad, as well as improve maritime security in the Indian Ocean,” he said.
