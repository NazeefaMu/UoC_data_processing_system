Harsha rejects GMOA allegations


	

Rejecting the allegations by the GMOA on government’s decision to set up an ambulance service operated by an Indian organisation, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva said today

that it would not pose a threat to national security as alleged by the GMOA and would instead be beneficial to the people.

Dr. De Silva said no one would object to such a meritorious act, which would be of immense help to the people who have to die in three-wheelers or on the road without proper transport facilities to rush to hospital in an emergency.

Responding to the allegation that Indian personnel would flow into Sri Lanka with the implementation of the India-aided emergency ambulance service handled by the Hyderabad-based GVK Emergency Management and Research Institute (GVK-EMRI), Dr. De Silva said only Sri Lankans would be employed apart from three to four Indians involved in technology transfer.

Dr. De Silva said the ambulance service would be operated by GVK-EMRI for the first year and, after that, the government would decide whether to take it over or allow the company to continue running it.

Dr. De Silva said this move would be beneficial to the ordinary people as it would be free of charge and would reach the patient within 20 minutes -- with a doctor on board. (Ajith Siriwardana)
