National security, Economy at stake: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa alleged yesterday that the backbone of the nation was breaking while the separatist eelamist flag was being hoisted in one part of the country.
He said this in a letter addressed to the crowd that attended the meeting organized by a group within the UPFA yesterday in Matara in order to demand the SLFP leadership to field him as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the forthcoming Parliamentary election.
The former President who had made a guest appearance to the venue for a few minutes at the Matara rampart said in his letter that the patriots in the country were shocked to hear that 59 army camps were withdrawn from the North, people in the government suggesting the release of terrorists and so-called peace makers in Europe such as Solheim were reviving their secessionist agendas.
He said the national security and national economy that had been strengthened during his tenure was waning and the large scale development programmes were at a standstill. ( Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)

SL refugee flees from custody in Chennai
	
A Sri Lankan Tamil refugee fled from custody while being escorted to Puzhal prison at the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus in Koyambedu on Thursday.
Police said 28-year-old Suresh aka Nishanthan, of the Ramanathapuram refugee Camp, was brought back after being produced in a court in Pudukottai on Wednesday for remand extension. The court has dismissed his bail plea.
Booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, in Erwadi, he was lodged in Puzhal Prison. Brought back to the city around 9 pm on Thursday, he insisted that his handcuffs be removed to use the public toilet. That done, he pushed a cop escorting him, Lawrence, down, and fled. Lawrence, who leapt to catch him fell down and suffered a fracture on his leg. He was taken to Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.
The escort personnel had also brought four other prisoners facing trials in different Courts and moved them to Puzhal in a police vehicle and lodged them in the prison before returning to attend to Lawrence. The cops also informed the Prison authorities about the incident besides alerting Ramanathapuram Police to keep an eye on the Refugee Camp for Suresh. Meanwhile, a case was registered with Koyambedu CMBT Police who are on the look out for him.
It appears that Suresh was upset all through the trip to Chennai from Pudukottai since his bail was dismissed. He was otherwise fine and composed. We believe that he couldnt have gone far, said a senior police official privy to the investigation.(The New Indian Express)
