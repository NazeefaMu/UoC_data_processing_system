A ten-year-old boy was killed when attempted to bite into a ‘Hakka Patas’, a locally made explosive device which was lying in the back garden of his home.


The boy was rushed to the Hambegamuwa Hospital but had died soon after admission.  Police said a villager might have placed it at that spot to kill wild boar which stray into the garden.
