The government was looking into the possibility of giving some redress to the people in the wake of fuel prices going down in the global market.
Minister of Petroleum Chandima Weerakkody said this in Parliament on Saturday in response to a statement made by Chief Opposition Whip Anura kumara Dissanayake who urged the government to reduce fuel prices and allow the people to enjoy the benefits of oil price reductions in the global market.
Mr. Dissanayake said a barrel of crude oil had come down to $ 46 from the earlier price which was $ 102.
Minister Weerakkody explained that at present Sri Lanka purchases fuel on credit and it would have to pay an interest if the payments were delayed by more than a month. However, he said plans were afoot to make these payments in a shorter period of time, in which case the benefit would be passed down to the people in the form of a fuel price reduction, he said.
