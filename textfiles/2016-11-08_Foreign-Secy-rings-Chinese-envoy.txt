Foreign Secy rings Chinese envoy


	

In the wake of Chinese Ambassador Yi Xiangliang'a critical remarks on Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake , Foreign Secretary Esala Weerakoon yesterday contacted the envoy over the phone and said the government of Sri Lanka was always prepared and open to discuss any issue of concern, it is learnt.

As a result, Mr. Weerakoon is reported to have said that there is no need for the Ambassador to discuss such matters through the media.

The Ambassador told a news conference last week that he asked the Finance Minister as to why fresh Chinese loans were sought if they were expensive.

It created a diplomatic furore between the two countries with the Minister responding to it. (Kelum Bandara)
