Kotahena shooting: Underworld clash?


	

Preliminary police investigations had revealed the yesterday's shooting might be related to a longstanding clash between two underworld factions in the area.
Unconfirmed reports allege that supporters of ‘Dematagoda Chaminda’ had carried out the attack on supporters of the ‘Bloemendhal Sanka.’ Several supporters of Bloemendhal Sanka were reportedly injured in the shooting.
Bloemendhal Sanka was abroad for several years because of the threat from ‘Dematagoda Chaminda’ and had returned to the island recently.
