Use electricity sparingly between 6pm and 10pm: CEB


	

Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairman Anura Wijepala today requested consumers to use electricity sparingly between the peak hours of 6pm and 10pm until Monday because of the breakdown at the Lakviajaya Coal Power Plant (LCPP) in Norochcholai.

The LCPP broke down in the wake of yesterday’s countrywide power failure.

Mr. Wijepala told Daily Mirror that the LCPP would begin functioning from tomorrow and it was expected to reach the usual capacity by Monday and until then the public were requested to use electricity wisely.

“We have a manageable capacity until the LCPP’s power generation resumes operations. Consumers are advised to switch off air conditioners and refrigerators between the peak hours of 6pm and 10pm,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)
