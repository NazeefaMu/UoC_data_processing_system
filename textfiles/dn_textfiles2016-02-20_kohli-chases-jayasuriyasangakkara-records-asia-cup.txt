Kohli chases Jayasuriya/Sangakkara records in Asia Cup

NEW DELHI: With the commencement of the Asia Cup 2016, the focus from Virat Kohli's personal life is bound to shift on his professional life.
Having recharged his batteries with a break during the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka, India's vice-captain will be rearing to go come February 24.
The right-hander was in supreme form on the recent Australia tour, further cementing his reputation as the batting heir to Sachin Tendulkar. While Kohli has continued to accumulate runs in ODI and Test cricket, a marked improvement was witnessed in his T20 batting Down Under. This makes him the most lethal batsman in the world, especially on sub-continent wickets.
