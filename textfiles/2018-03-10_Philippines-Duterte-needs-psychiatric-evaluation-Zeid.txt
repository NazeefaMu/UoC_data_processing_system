REUTERS, 09th MARCH, 2018- Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s slurs against U.N. human rights activists suggest he needs to see a psychiatrist, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein told a news conference on Friday.


“These attacks cannot go unanswered, the U.N. Human Rights Council must take a position,” Zeid said, after Duterte’s government sought to get a U.N. investigator, a former Philippine lawmaker and four former Catholic priests declared as “terrorists”.


“He needs to submit himself to some sort of psychiatric examination. This kind of comment is unacceptable, ” Zeid said.
