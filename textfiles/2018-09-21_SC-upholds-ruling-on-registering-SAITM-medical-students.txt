The Supreme Court today upheld a Court of Appeal ruling which directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register MBBS graduates of the SAITM.  

Earlier, the SLMC filed an application in the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeal’s ruling to provisionally register South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) degree holders.

The Supreme Court today rejected the SLMC application and ordered the SLMC to pay Rs.100,000 as cost to the the MBBS graduate of SAITM, who filed the first petition in the Court of Appeal. (Farook Thajudeen)
