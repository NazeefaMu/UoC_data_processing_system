SLFPers can join SLPP on an individual basis: Basil


	

Former minister Basil Rajapaksa, who spearheads the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), ruled out the possibility of accommodating the members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as a distinct political group under the SLPP banner.

However, he said the MPs who quit the government could join the SLPP-led alliance as individual members rather than as a separate political group.

“It is not possible for us to allow them to stay within the SLPP as a separate political group. Instead, they can join hands with us as individual members,” he said. (Kelum Bandara)
