A compromise to have their clothes on!


	



 

A group of Green backbenchers had met recently and their discussion had mainly centred on the doings of the khaki chief.

 


Their collective opinion was that Yahapalanaya was sure to get into more serious trouble if the man was allowed to continue in office any longer.
One of them expressed his disgust over the passive attitude of the top duo towards the issue.


Meanwhile, another member suggested: “If the JO moves a No Confidence against the man, let us support it!”


This suggestion drew an instant protest from yet another member.


“I say, are we to support a motion by the JO with our clothes on?” And that drew a chorus of ayes.


Later they reached a compromise: to fade from the scene at the voting time if a No Confidence motion was moved by the JO.
