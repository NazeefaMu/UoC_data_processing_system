The vociferous JO group set to form either a new political party or a new political alliance had decided to make an assessment of the political might of the two main parties based on their respective strengths in the Diyawanna council. Having arrived at their conclusions, they had met their leader, the former strongman for a discussion.

 


“Do you know the real numerical strength of the Blues in Diyawanna?” the former strongman had asked. After a pause, he himself had provided the answer: “Only 82”


“How many genuine Green members are there in Diyawanna in your opinion?” he had asked again.  As the JO members quietly looked on, their former boss had given the answer to this question too.
“The correct figure is the same: 82”


He continued: “All others accounting for the balance in both parties are outsiders – allies from other minor parties. Therefore, as regards, the de facto political strength, both main parties are in the same boat. The political reality of this situation is that those in power can go out of power at any moment Those out of power may come into power at any moment by the same token.”


He added: “The stark fact is that most have failed to come to terms with this reality!”
