One wonders whether the main qualification needed to get a cabinet portfolios is engaging in corruption, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake said yesterday.

Ramanayake came out with this statement responding to the cabinet reshuffle and the reshuffling of state and deputy ministers during the last two days.

“I have not been engaged in corruption and had got only a deputy minister’s post but I wonder whether the main qualification needed to get cabinet portfolios is engaging in corruption,” Mr. Ramanayake said.

“I have engaged in fighting against corruption and exposed some corrupt deeds and will do so in the future as well. I don’t care whether the people I expose are in the government or in opposition,” he added.

Asked whether the present government has enough time to fight corruption he said the government should however work towards eradicating such acts. “ My perception is that the present government is better than the previous one as some steps have been taken to avoid corruption though it is not hundred percent successful,” he said.

Responding to a question as to why some of the UNP MPs did not participate in the meeting with Prime Minister on Tuesday he said it may be because some of them though there has not been a radical change in the UNP as promised. (Yohan Perera and Chathuranga Samarawickrama)
