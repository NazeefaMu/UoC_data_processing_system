For excellence in business and contribution to the economic progress of the country, Softlogic Finance PLC was recognized with its third consecutive National Business Excellence Award (NBEA) in the ‘Non-Banking and Financial Services’ category recently.
Softlogic Finance was recognized with a ‘Merit’ award at the prestigious awards forum hosted annually by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL), at a gala event held at Hilton Colombo recently, at which some the country’s leading corporates were honoured. 
The National Business Excellence Awards recognize and reward Sri Lankan organisations that have excelled in all-round performance. The awards are given following a three-tier evaluation process which includes review of applications by a technical panel, interviews and an assessment by an independent panel of judges. A range of criteria is taken into account including corporate governance, capacity building, performance management, global and local market reach, corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability and business and financial results.
“We take pride in this achievement, which we attribute to the skills and determination of the entire Softlogic Finance team and the support of key stakeholders including our valued customers,” Softlogic Finance PLC Director/CEO Nalin Wijekoon said.
“Our success at this prestigious forum for the third consecutive year reflects Softlogic Finance’s consistent and continuous adherence to high standards.” 
“Award ceremonies present useful opportunities to assess one’s performance against the industry benchmark,” Softlogic Finance PLC Deputy Chairman Harris Premaratne said.
“While such national level achievements can also provide motivation and impetus, we are confident that ongoing developments including strategic and community initiatives will propel Softlogic Finance to even greater heights.”
