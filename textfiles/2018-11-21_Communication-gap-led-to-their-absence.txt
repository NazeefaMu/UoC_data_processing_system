Communication gap led to their absence


	



 

Some prominent Pohottuwa members had been conspicuous by their absence at the ceremony held to ‘solemnize’ the Pohottuwa-Betel-political marriage.

 


Later, Pohottuwa high-ups on the advice of the former strongman had made inquiries why these party front-liners failed to turn up at the historic occasion.


And the inquiries had revealed that the parties responsible for conveying the important message to the party stalwarts had floundered. 


One of the high-ups who had failed to carry out this duty entrusted by the party leadership is said to be the politico hailing from the political cum cricket family in Gampaha, they say.
