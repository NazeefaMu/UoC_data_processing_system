Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has not been stripped of his membership of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) though he obtained Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) membership recently, the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) said yesterday.

Addressing a press briefing, PHU leader Udaya Gammanpila said there was speculation that Mr. Rajapaksa could not be given leadership in the opposition as he held SLPP membership.

“According to sources, we got to know that Mr. Rajapaksa has received SLPP membership. However, it is MP Basil Rajapaksa who knows whether or not Mahinda Rajapaksa was given SLPP membership. MR has neither been expelled from the SLFP nor from the SLFP advisory post. Hence, he is eligible to hold the opposition leader’s post,” Gammanpila said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
