Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said yesterday that Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake had no authority to give orders to lotteries board officials according to the Lotteries Board Act.

He told parliament that the finance minister should be the subject minister of the lotteries board according to its Act and added that the government had not amended the Act to authorize the foreign minister to handle the activities of the lotteries board.

He said the assigning of the lotteries board to the foreign ministry had violated the Lotteries Board Act and added that the President or the Prime Minister should correct the blunder. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
