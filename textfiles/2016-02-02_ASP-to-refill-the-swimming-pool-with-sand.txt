Businessman and Sri Lanka Labour Party Leader A.S.P. Liyanage said today he would refill the swimming pool at his Peacock Mansion with sea sand after the police failed to find any valuable items.


He said the Colombo Magistrate was scheduled to inspect the pool on February 5.


“Thereafter I will refill the pool with sand because I believe that filling the pool with sand instead of water will bring good luck,” Mr. Liyanage said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
