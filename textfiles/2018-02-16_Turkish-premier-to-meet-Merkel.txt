DPA, 15th FEBRUARY, 2018-  The case of a German-Turkish journalist who has been detained in Turkey for a year is likely to overshadow a meeting between Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim and Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday. In an interview on German television aired on Wednesday, Yildirm stressed that the decision on whether to release Die Welt correspondent Deniz Yucel would be made by Turkish judges and not his government.
