HSBC to bring customers closer to age-old Avurudu traditions


	

Bringing a new world to love the old traditions is no easy journey. This year, HSBC plans to bring customers closer to their traditional roots with an Avurudu campaign that is purely centred on long-lived ‘traditions’ that have passed on through generations. 
HSBC notes that traditions associated with the Sinhala and Tamil New Year are manifold, colourful and meaningful. Thus, the campaign hopes to not just bring customers amazing savings on everything they could want to celebrate this auspicious time but also to reconnect them to the many traditions that are followed during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. 
Wearing new clothes with prescribed colours is a marked aspect of the New Year celebrations. HSBC customers will be able to dress up in style to celebrate the season with special savings across a wide range of clothing stores that offer great savings. 
The exchanging of gifts is another tradition that is made easy. The bank has partnered with over 190 popular merchants in the country to offer savings of up to 50 percent on a range of categories such as retail and fashion, jewellery and wrist watches, salons, spas and gyms, dining, household, supermarket, insurance and others. 
HSBC Sri Lanka Head of Marketing and Communications Tharanga Gunasekera said, “We have been in Sri Lanka for 125 years and we have seen different traditions and customs around Avurudu through the years. Given that the new world we live in is fast paced, age-old traditions have become fragmented and we believe this is a good time to remind customers of those traditions. It is also another way to connect with our customers through the New Year season that is widely celebrated by most of our customers in the country.” 
Moreover, with April being the perfect holiday season, HSBC customers who don’t celebrate Avurudu but look to spend cheerful family vacations, can do so at a range of local hotels. They can join in the celebrations by participating in fun Avurudu activities and age-old traditions such as beating the raban (drums), among other associated traditions.
