We must be thankful to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for his intervention to prevent the killing of journalist Keith Noyahr in 2009, State Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday.

State Minister Perera told a news conference that Mr. Rajapaksa intervened to stop the killing of Noyahr when his abductors were about to assassinate him. “We thank Mr. Rajapaksa for his intervention,” Mr. Perera said while adding that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also played a role in saving the life of Keith.

At the same time, the State Minister said Former President knew very well that who had abducted the journalist. “Several journalists were killed and assaulted under the previous regime. However, there is freedom for journalists under this regime.

Responding to a question raised by journalists on the recent incident where former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga had preventing the media from covering a certain event, the State Minister said chasing the media away was wrong, especially if they were invited to cover the event. State Minister Perera also focused on the situation with regard to the judiciary, said the first High Court with Trial-at-Bar will be opened on August 24, 2018, and said the remaining new High Courts under the Judicature Amendment Bill also be opened within a few months.
