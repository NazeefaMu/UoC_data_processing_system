Each day is a chance to learn, to heal and to see the inherent goodness of the self and others. When we forget these things, we become polluted by stress and animosity. 

 


The exhibition will be held tomorrow (9) from 10.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m. at Anderson flats Community Centre in Narahenpita


 


How to remember when there seems to be so much to get done and so much negativity to face; the theory is inspiring, but in practice, how can it all be achieved?   


Once again, an opportunity to experience and explore the depths of silence to love and appreciate the self and others.
