CPC not involved in tomorrow's strike - JSS


	

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Unions today denied their involvement with the countrywide strike to be launched tomorrow by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), as lengthy queues were forming up with panicked motorists around the city filling stations this evening.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, CPC Jathika Sewaka Sangamaya (JSS) Secretary Ananda Palitha said there was no need to develop any hoax-fear on fuel shortage.

He said according to false news spreading, people had been panicked and seen rushing towards filling stations to refuel their vehicles causing long queues outside the filling stations.

Palitha said a minimum of 13,200 litres of fuel which is received by a filling station would be sufficient for a couple of days. However, the stocks could be drained rapidly due to long queues and unnecessary panic.

He said there is no need to go for a trade union action as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has given a written assurance saying no decision on the Trincomalee China Bay Oil Tank Farm will be taken without discussing with the trade unions.

“No need to panic because CPC employees are not on strike. The false rumours has been aired. We request the public to stay calm,” he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep and Thilanka Kanakarathna)
