GMOA opposes appointment of Dr. Kahandaliyanage


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday condemned the appointment of Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage to head the Health Ministry's Disaster Management Centre.

It said the appointment was a violation of the World Health Organization (WHO) rules and the regulations.

In a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena, the GMOA accused Dr. Kahandaliyanage of having direct contacts with multinational dairy companies and on that basis he was disqualified from participating in any Health Ministry work.

GMOA President Anuruddha Padeniya said the appointment tarnished the Health Ministry’s image which was nurtured by the President when he was Health Minister.

He said based on scientific evidence the WHO had put a stop to multinational dairy companies being involved in disaster management because these companies were known to use such situations to promote themselves.

Dr. Padeniya requested the President to rescind the Health Ministry decision immediately. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
