Seven persons had been arrested by the Police last night in connection with the recent unrest situation at the Galaha hospital where an infant child had died.

Police said the suspects were arrested on charges of causing damage to public property.

A group of angry mob had attacked the hospital in the wake of the death of a one-and-a-half year old child at the hospital on August 28.

The residents claimed that the child, a resident of Delthotawatta, who was brought to the hospital after a sudden illness had died because of the delay in attending to the sick child by hospital authorities.

A doctor’s car and several windows of the hospital were damaged while a hospital doctor had also been attacked by the mob.
