People’s Bank recently held an awards ceremony to felicitate the winners of the second month of People’s Bank Foreign Remittance Gold Fortune 2016. 
This promotion was launched for those living and working abroad who frequently send money to loved ones in Sri Lanka. The ceremony was held at the People’s Bank Staff Training College under the auspices of People’s Bank Deputy General Manager International Banking Shobhani Prathapasinghe. The winners selected via weekly draws in the month of August each received a gold sovereign at the event. 
People’s Bank Foreign Currency Gold Fortune 2016 encourages those working abroad who use services such as Telex, People’s InstatRemit, People’s e-Remittance and Swift, to send money to their loved ones in Sri Lanka. The aim of this is to appreciate those who work abroad and to add value to their savings. 
One winner of People’s Bank Foreign Currency Gold Fortune 2016, Nadeesha Priyadarshani from Horana, who has been a loyal customer of People’s Bank for 15 years, at the ceremony said, “My sister, who is working abroad, sends me money via e-Remittance. In all honesty I didn’t expect a win, even though I was aware of the promotion. I carry out transactions with the Milladeniya branch as well. The bank has provided me an excellent service thus far. This is the first gift I have won from the bank, my mother and siblings also have accounts at People’s Bank.”
Another winner, W.A. Hemapala from Saliyawewa, has been with the bank since 1996 and his wife frequently sends money for the family through e-Remittance. Commenting on the win he said, “When I got a letter informing me that we had won this prize, I immediately called over to confirm it. We save all we earn for my daughter’s future; this prize will most definitely go into those savings as well.” 
D.M.D.S.K. Fernando, an account owner of the Katunayake branch, was also a winner of the August draw. “As soon as I finished my A/Ls, I opened an account with the Rs.500 I got from my mother. My aunt’s son, who is like a brother to me, sends money from abroad. I live very close to the bank. When I got a phone call informing about the victory, I thought it was a joke. I was not aware of this draw. But the manager explained it to me. My wife and child also have People’s Bank accounts. My child has won gifts before but this is the first time that we have got such a valuable gift.” 
The other second month winner was Ranjith Sarathchandra from Thambuttegama. Commenting on the victory he said, “I have been a loyal customer of People’s Bank for 25 years now. My son sends me money from abroad. I was aware of this draw and I was overjoyed when I was informed about the victory via a phone call. This is the first time I have won a gift from the bank and I think that it provides us great service.”
The People’s Bank Foreign Currency Gold Fortune 2016 promotion encourages people to make remittances of any amount to be eligible to receive a 22k sovereign gold coin on a weekly basis for 28 weeks. Sri Lankans who live overseas are entitled to participate in People’s Bank Foreign Remittance Gold Fortune 2016 by simply making remittances of any sum to loved ones in Sri Lanka, enabling them the chance to win a valuable gold coin.
