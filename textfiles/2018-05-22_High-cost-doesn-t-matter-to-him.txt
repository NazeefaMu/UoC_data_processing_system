High cost doesn’t matter to him


	



 

This person who took over a Ministry newly constituted combining two separate portfolios, has planned to shift all his Ministry offices to a building with a lesser floor space but for a much higher monthly rental.

 


The purohita’s new Ministry is currently housed in a spacious building where his additional offices could be easily accommodated. The monthly rental for this building is Rs. 4.4 million. However, the Ministry will be required to pay a whopping monthly rental of Rs.11.7 million if it is to be shifted to the proposed building which has lesser space than the one where the Ministry is already located.  The proposed new building is reportedly owned by another politico who is running a business in a section of the building. 


The Ministry employees have already complained to Number One about the move on the part of the purohita to relocate the Ministry offices to the proposed building despite the glaring disadvantage in regard to floor space and rental payment.
