Basils Pugoda property: Court to contemplate issuing forfeit order
	
Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige requested the Pugoda Magistrates Court to issue an order to forfeit the property in Malwana which former minister Basil Rajapaksa rejected ownership.
The case was filed by the Police Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) against Mr. Rajapaksa on charges of purchasing a land in Malwana and building a house there by misusing State funds.
The Presidential Counsel who appeared on behalf of Mr. Rajapaksa today informed the court that his client had ownership neither to the land nor the house.
He also told the Court that the land has been registered under the ownership of architect Muditha Jayakody.
However, the Lawyer appeared for Muditha Jayakody had informed that even though the land registration, his client had no real ownership to the land or the house and therefore Court can take any further action with regard to the property.
The Courts decision whether to forfeit the property is to be given on October 14. (Tony Karunanayake)

BIA closure: Airlines reschedule, curtail flights
	
While some airlines have rescheduled flights from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) during the first quarter of 2017, other airlines have taken measures to reduce the number of flights temporarily.
This comes after the BIA announced plans to renovate its outdated runway from January 6 to April 6 next year.
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) officials said flights will mostly be allowed at night as construction work will go on from 8.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m.
The BIA handles an average of 150 flights a day. They said the decisions about the rescheduling or curtailing the flights would be decided by individual airlines according to their route networks.
Qatar Airways said they had already rescheduled their flights and the revised flight details could be accessed via their web site http://www.qatarairways.com/global/en/homepage.page.
FlyDubai Commercial Manager Gihan Silva said they had decided to curtail their weekly flights.
Currently, FlyDubai operates 28 flights a week via the BIA. Due to the closure of the BIA, we will be curtailing it to 19 a week while some of the flights will be operated at night, he said.
Emirates and AirAsia were not able to comment on the matter immediately due to ongoing discussions. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Colombian President Santos wins Nobel Peace Prize
	
The 2016 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end Colombia's long-running civil war with the FARC guerrilla group, CNN reported today.
The peace prize committee awarded Santos the prize for "his resolute efforts to bring the country's more than 50-year-long civil war to an end, a war that has cost the lives of at least 220 000 Colombians and displaced close to six million people."
"The award should also be seen as a tribute to the Colombian people who, despite great hardships and abuses, have not given up hope of a just peace, and to all the parties who have contributed to the peace process. This tribute is paid, not least, to the representatives of the countless victims of the civil war."
Santos' government spent four years negotiating a peace deal with the former rebel group FARC that would have ended five decades of war.
But Colombians narrowly rejected the peace deal in a referendum last weekend. Critics of the deal said it didn't do enough to punish the rebels. It was a major blow for Santos, whose popularity has suffered in his support of the deal.
Now it seems the rebels and the Colombian government, facilitated by international leaders, will have to go back to the drawing board to reimagine a peace that is acceptable to victims of murder, extortion and kidnapping.
"Well knowing that the accord was controversial, he was instrumental in ensuring that Colombian voters were able to voice their opinion concerning the peace accord in a referendum," said the Nobel Committee.

First Capital Holdings ICRA long, short-term ratings reaffirmed
	
ICRA Lanka Limited, a subsidiary of ICRA Limited, a group company of Moodys Investors Service, has reaffirmed the issuer rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook for First Capital Holdings PLC (FCH).
ICRA Lanka has also reaffirmed the issue rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook for the Rs.500 million senior unsecured redeemable debenture programme of the company. ICRA Lanka has also reaffirmed the [SL]A2+ rating to the Rs.1,000 million commercial paper programme of FCH.
ICRA Lanka has taken a consolidated view of FCH and its subsidiaries due to their common brand and senior management team and other operational and financial linkages between the group entities. The ratings factor in FCHs status as the holding company of First Capital Treasuries PLC (FCT), a standalone primary dealer in Sri Lanka with issuer rating of [SL]A- with stable outlook.
The ratings take note of the potential improvement in the business and financial performances of the other group entities, which are engaged in corporate debt structuring, corporate finance, asset management, stock broking, extending margin trading facilities and trustee services. ICRA Lanka however notes that FCHs performance is largely dependent on performance of FCT, as the contribution from the other entities presently is quite modest. FCT accounted for 74 percent of the total consolidated asset base of FCH as on March 31, 2016.
Thus, FCHs performance is expected to be susceptible to the risks inherent in the primary dealer business. The rating also factors the FCH groups established clientele of over 2500, which is expected to support the business growth of the group entities.
FCH, being a holding company, derives its income from the dividends from the group entities and income from its investments, which includes interest income and profit from investments. Total standalone income for FY2016 was adversely affected (Rs.350 million total income in FY2016 vis--vis Rs.590 million in FY2015) due to non availability of dividend income (Rs.212 million in FY2015), which is linked to performance of the principal subsidiary, FCT. The expected improvement in the performance of FCT in FY2017 vis--vis FY2016 is likely to support the overall performance of FCH. The companys funding profile is characterised largely by short-term funding (commercial papers), which accounted for close to 85 percent of the total standalone debt as on March 31, 2016, while the remaining was in the form of long-term debentures. FCHs asset profile (standalone) largely consists of short-term loan funding to its group entities. The companys standalone gearing has increased to about 5.3 times as on March 31, 2016 vis--vis 3.4 times as on March 31, 2015; however the FCH groups access to the sanctioned bank lines and its liquid assets provides comfort from a liquidity perspective. 
First Capital Limited (FCL), which is 99.9 percent held by FCH, is involved in corporate debt structuring and corporate finance advisory services, reported a total fee income of Rs.111 million in FY2016 (Rs.127 million in FY2015). FCL is the step-down holding company for the other entities in the FCH group including, First Capital Asset Management Limited (FCAML), a licensed investment manager and licensed managing company for unit trusts by the Securities and Exchange Commission, First Capital Markets Limited (FCML), which is involved in providing margin trading facilities and dealing and broking of listed debt, First Capital Equities (Pvt.) Limited (FCEL), which is engaged in stockbroking activities and the newly formed First Capital Trustee Services (Pvt.) Limited.
FCAML reported a fee income of Rs.56 million on a total AUM of about Rs.5.4 billion in FY2016 as compared with Rs.29 million on a total AUM of about Rs.4.2 billion in FY2015. FCML reported a total income of Rs.59 million (Rs.59 million in FY2015) and FCEL reported a total income of Rs.56 million (Rs.86 million in FY2015) in FY2016.
FCAML, FCML and FCEL together accounted for 11 percent (7 percent in FY2015) of the FCH consolidated income and 60 percent (2 percent in FY2015) of the consolidated profit before tax for FY2016 as profits from FCT was quite muted due to the unfavourable interest rate regime during the period. ICRA Lanka notes the improvement in the business volumes in the above-mentioned entities over the recent past; however, the group performance is expected to be driven by the primary
dealership, FCT.

State Minister of Defense, Ruwan Wijewardene today confirmed that there were no payments due from any minister or professional for hiring helicopters from the Sri Lanka Air force.
The following is his statement on this matter:
"A front page story of the Daily Mirror on October 7, 2016 says, 'Several ministers, officials did not pay for hiring helicopters.' This is in connection with the answer I tabled yesterday in relation to the question asked by MP Udaya Gammanpila. The news item had implicated several ministers including John Amaratunga, Rajitha Senaratne, Harin Fernando, Sagala Ratnayake, Gayantha Karunatilleka, and Faizer Mustapha and some officials.
"I have to clearly state that this is false. None of the ministers or officials have to pay any dues to the Air Force. All the ministers and officials have paid for their trips. There is no truth in the story that they had not paid. Most of these ministers have accompanied either the President or the Prime minister. Therefore no money is due from these ministers. I would also like to say that we do not invite foreign dignitaries and tell them to pay for travelling by helicopters," the state minister said. (Yohan Perera)

Pavithra retaliates at Minister John
	
UPFA MP Pavithra Wanniarachchi today rejected claims made by SLFP Senior Minister John Seneviratne with regard to the refusal to release the Seevali Grounds in Ratnapura for the joint opposition rally on Saturday.
At a media conference, she released a letter received from Municipal Commissioner M.W. Kulathilaka and claimed that she had never lied in the past and had no intention of doing so in the future.
Former municipal councillor Tyronne Attanayake last month applied for the Seevali Grounds as well as the lorry parking area saying it was required for a sports event to be held on October 7 and 8. On October 3 we sent a letter to the Commissioner requesting for the Seevali Grounds on the basis that we are expecting more people for a propaganda rally to be attended by the supporters of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa for the launching of the new party, Ms. Wanniarachchi said.
She said the Municipal Commissioner in his response to their letter said the Seevali Grounds could not be used for the putting up of a stage and the putting up of huts.
Ms. Wanniarachchi said the Commissioner had first allowed the use of the Seevali Grounds and lorry park for the sporting event but refused their use no sooner the propaganda campaign was mentioned.
The Seevali Grounds was used to mark World Environment Day under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. But we have been deprived its use because we are opponents of the Government, she said and added that it was her father who had taught the basics of politics to Minister Seneviratne.
Considering the ministers behavior, I am confident that this is not what my father taught him, she added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Petition for army deployment against SL dismissed
	
The Madras high court on Thursday had dismissed a public interest litigation filed two years ago by an advocate seeking deployment of armed forces to protect Tamil Nadu fishermen from the Sri Lankan navy.
In 2014, advocate S. M. Ananda Murugan filed the petition. He said the Katchatheevu Island, the Palk Strait and the Gulf of Mannar have been the areas of conflict between the Tamil Nadu fishermen and the Sri Lankan navy.
The central government unilaterally ceded the Katchatheevu, which was under the Ramanathapuram parliamentary constituency in Tamil Nadu, to Sri Lanka through an agreement.
The Indian government claimed that fishing rights and the right to worship at St Antony's church vested with the Indian fishermen. However, the Sri Lankan government misinterpreted it and said that the Indian fishermen have only rights to dry their nests on the island. Due to it, the Sri Lankan navy has been killing and injuring hundreds of Tamil Nadu fishermen, he said.
When the case came up for hearing on Thursday, the government side said it was taking all necessary steps to protect the Tamil Nadu fishermen.
Following this, the court dismissed the petition. (Times of India)

Sri Lankan teen lured to Singapore to be prostitute
	
A 16-year-old Sri Lankan, whose family was having financial woes, was recruited by her neighbours to work in Singapore as a prostitute.
Over 12 days, she serviced 207 men in a brothel at 20 Jalan Suka in Geylang. The neighbours had promised the teen that she would be able to make $1,400 within a month.
But she was arrested on the night of Aug 6 last year, after policemen saw her soliciting for customers in the area. She had yet to receive any earnings from her prostitution.
Yesterday, a 68-year-old man who ran the brothel was jailed for three months. Goh Tiang Ho pleaded guilty to one charge of managing a brothel. A 27-year-old Bangladeshi national, Sahadat - who goes by one name - was also jailed for three months for helping to manage the brothel.
A District Court heard that the teen, who cannot be named due to an order by the court, lived with her father and grandmother in Sri Lanka. In May 2015, her family was in financial difficulty as her grandmother was suffering from stomach cancer and her father was unable to work because of high blood pressure and asthma.
She told her neighbours of her woes.
"The victim's neighbours recruited the victim to work in Singapore as a prostitute," said Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Amanda Chong Wei-Zhen.
"The victim was told by the couple that she would be able to make 150,000 rupees (S$1,400) in Singapore as a prostitute within a month. Her recruiters made arrangements for the victim to travel to Singapore."
She arrived in Singapore on the night of July 24 last year and was met by two Sri Lankan men at Changi Airport. Her customers paid $30 for 15 minutes of sex with her, including $10 for the rental of a room at Goh's brothel.
One of the men who picked her up, Hathamune Liyanage Pushpa Surange, 29, had arrived in Singapore on the same day on a social visit pass. The other man's identity has not been established.
Hathamune, also known as Ranga, left Singapore on Aug 6 last year and is wanted by the police. He is suspected to be a member of a vice syndicate. (straitstimes.com)

Wont allow any Chinese naval bases in Htota: PM
	
In an interview with CNBC in India, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would not permit China to set up a naval base or a monitoring facility in Hambantota.
When the interviewer asked him whether he would turn it down if China made such a request, the Premier said, Ah yes yes.
The full interview
PM Ranil Wickremeshinghe (RW): This is not the first time that the SAARC meeting has been postponed. Sometimes because of terrorist strike, sometimes because of natural disasters and sometimes for other major disagreements. But in this instance the crossborder terrorism has now been laid as the main item on the agenda if not, intended to be so.
I would use the word gatecrash onto its way onto the agenda and you will have to deal with it. On early occasions, there was this aspect of terrorism that came up then one part will not attend the meeting then after that discussions, certain steps taken to reduce tension, the talks begin and then SAARC kept on, but in this instance it looks as if it will not be possible to get the SAARC government moving unless you discuss the issue of cross border terrorism.
Martin Soong (MS): These fears in some quarters of India that Sri Lanka is leaning way too much towards China, opening the door etc. I know you have been quoted several times saying look, relax most of these projects are commercial in nature, they are not military, they are not strategic. Is that really true when you think about the String of Pearls and whether it is Hambantota or Colombo we are talking about deep water ports here which can very easily be used and converted for military purposes no
RW: Sri Lanka cannot be used for any deportmentary purposes. The Chinese have also decided on a strategy where they want to industrialise outside. It is sort of a, though they deny it, it is sort of a martial plan, it is economic martial plan the same thing thatpart of it come back to China, part they will use it to send to Europe. But they are pushing into this area. I don't know why I still keep talking with them and maybe I don't know in the next few years. But it is a plan, but remember the global population growth is going to take place around the Indian Ocean and Africa. China, Japan and all, certainly the growth will be less.
So here is the market, the potential market. What they were there doing is about a 25 year plan and at the end of it if it works.. so it is not only down to Sri Lanka, they have the One Belt all the way into Europe ending up in Poland and Rotterdam so it is building up a big economic network and this is just one part of it, this suits us as far as we are concerned, told them no military ships, our navy we have a base in Hambantota and of course we will operate from...So we can look after that.
MS: So if you don't mind, let me ask you a cheeky question because of the scale and intensity of Chinese involvement in Sri Lanka, including monetary investments, if China were to come to you while you are PM and say look Hambantota is fine, the commercial interest there is fine but hey, let's talk about I'd like some access for our military, the Chinese navy or some sort of logistical base there or a monitoring sort of facility there for the record, would you turn them down flat
RW: I would say you're blue water navy, learn to sail in the Pacific.
MS: So you would turn down them flat
RW: Ah yes yes.
