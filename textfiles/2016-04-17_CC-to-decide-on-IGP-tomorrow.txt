The Constitutional Council (CC) will meet tomorrow to decide on the appointment of the 34th Inspector General of Police (IGP) of Sri Lanka in consideration of three names proposed by President Maithripala Sirisena, it is learnt.

The President has sent three names to be considered in making the appointment in conformity with the provisions of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.

They are senior DIGs S.M. Wickramasinghe, C.D. Wickramaratne and Pujitha Jayasundara.

The CC has to decide on the appointment of one of them. It will meet at 3.00 pm in the parliamentary complex.

The CC, chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by virtue of his office, is a ten member body that includes seven members from Parliament and the rest from outside. The post of IGP remains vacant at the moment after the retirement of N.K. Ilangakoon who held it.

According to sources, the CC may decide to pick someone out of these three to the post, or else refer them back to the President to nominate one instead. In the appointment of the present Attorney General, the President only sent one name to be approved by the CC.  (Kelum Bandara)
