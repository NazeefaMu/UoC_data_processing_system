Reason why she left the country in a huff


	


	
	Now it is a public secret that the former Madam left the country in a huff.

The initially adduced reason for her sudden departure from the political scene was that she had felt affronted when she was elected as a Patron of the Blue party putting her in the company of the deposed Big Boss. Everyone knows that there is no love lost between the deposed Big Boss and the former Madam.
However, the latest story coming down the grapevine says that the former Madam wanted to be the chairperson or the de facto and de jure head of the Blue party. But the party Constitution requires the Head of State to lead the party as well if that Head happens to be a party member. Her request that she be made at least the Chief Patron of the party too had received no positive response.
According to those close to the former Madam, she is not expected back in the country in the near future.
The absence of the former Madam also means that her son’s advent to politics on time to participate in the general elections in the offing goes off the cards.
