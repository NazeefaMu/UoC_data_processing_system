Guidelines  for peace and prosperity  from the Bhagavad Gita


	



Humanity seeks peace and prosperity. Everybody wishes to be successful and happy in their endeavour. The question is are they able to achieve this despite their efforts. A careful observation of the world reveals that most of them enjoy either success or peace, not both. Those who are peaceful are not very productive and prosperous. Those who are prosperous are relatively not peaceful. A man living in a village leads a peaceful life. But he is not so dynamic hence not prosperous. A businessman in the city is dynamic and successful at the same time gets stressed out, so not as peaceful as the villager. Why is this paradox in life? Can this be solved? Bhagavad Gita the ancient scripture gives the solution. The understanding and practise of the teachings of the Gita help one to enjoy the rare combination of peace and prosperity.   
The Bhagavad Gita enunciates Vedanta philosophy. Vedanta presents the eternal and universal principles of life and living. It gives out the technique to develop dynamism in action, purity in emotion and clarity in thinking. Above all, it ushers one to the ultimate perfection of Self-realisation.   

The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between Lord Krishna, a spiritually Enlightened soul, a person of great wisdom and his friend Arjuna in the battle field of Kurushektra. Arjuna was a great warrior, a commander in chief, an active and dynamic person in the modern context.In spite of his mastery in the art of warfare he was incapacitated to fight a crucial battle where his opponents happened to be his friends, relatives and teachers. He became emotionally overwhelmed, the great warrior got confused and confounded.Even physically collapsed in the battle field.To his favour he surrendered to Lord Krishna and sought his help. It was then that Krishna delivered the great sermon of the Bhagavad Gita. The knowledge of the Gita resurrected the fallen Arjuna. Having understood his role and purpose in the situation he fought the battle and emerged victorious, achieved peace and success.   


 

In the present world also most of the people are in the state of Arjuna. They may be skilful in business and successful in their career but when they are faced with a crisis they collapse



In the present world also most of the people are in the state of Arjuna. They may be skilful in business and successful in their career but when they are faced with a crisis they collapse.When the mind gets agitated one cannot think properly.This makes the person incapacitated to function.A powerful intellect alone can keep the mind calm and face the challenges of the world.One can develop the intellect through a systematic study of Vedanta.This involves a method of questioning everything and applying one’s reason consistently.   


The eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita starts with a question. Wherein Arjuna asks Krishna the difference between sannyasa renunciation and tyaga relinquishment. Krishna defines Sannyasa as renunciation of egocentric desires by dedicating action to the supreme goal of Self-realisation. Tyaga as relinquishment of fruit of action.Tyaga is the cause. Sannyasa is the effect. Desire propels action. As long as one has desires one cannot drop actions. He can only practise dropping the anxiety to enjoy the fruit of action. Arjuna is a man of action with many desires, what is suitable for him is tyaga and not sannyasa. The same is applicable for a common man who is full of ambitions and aspirations.   
Again the natural tendency of the mind is to slip into the past and future. It always worries about the past and get anxious about the future. Never stays in the present. This saps one’s energy. When the mind is not in the present the action is impaired. There is no success, no peace. One needs a powerful intellect to hold the mind in the present. Thus dropping the worry and anxiety for fruit brings about peace of mind as well as success in action.   

To enjoy peace and prosperity one has to perform yajna sacrifice, dana giving and tapa austerity as well. Yajna is fixing a higher ideal and working towards it unselfishly without ego and ego centric desires. Dana is giving. One can enjoy peace and prosperity by giving, not by aggrandising. Aggrandisation corrodes the personality. Tapas is conserving energy and directing it towards the achievement of the higher ideal. The mind gets attracted to the worldly indulgences. Intellect needs to guide the mind and prevent its deviation from the set path.   
Thus when one develops a powerful intellect and imbibe higher values of life he is bound to enjoy peace and prosperity.
