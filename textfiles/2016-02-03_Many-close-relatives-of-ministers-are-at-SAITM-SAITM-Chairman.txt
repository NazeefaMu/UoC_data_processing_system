The Chairman of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe Dr. Neville Fernando yesterday said not only Minister Senaratne’s daughter-in-law, but also the daughters and daughters-in-law of other ministers in the current government are also studying at the SAITM.

Even though there is heavy criticism of the educational qualifications of those who study at the SAITM, Dr. Fernando said that they had students with better grades -- ‘A’ levels with 3 ‘A’ s who were  unable to enter state universities because of the district quota system.

He said that state university students must give up their superiority complex, because education is a fundamental right for all students, whether state or non-state. (PiyumiFonseka)
