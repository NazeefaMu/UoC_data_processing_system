When tensions were rising and controversies were raging with no solution to the unprecedented political crisis in sight, the political party leaders of the Green-led alliance had arrived at the main secretariat for another round of talks the other day.

 


Once at the secretariat, the party leaders, pending the call to the roundtable, were enjoying a chit-chat, when the party leader hailing from Vilpattu area interposed: “Take it from me we have come here today too for talks destined to come to nothing. Let us in the meantime, do something that will last for a long time!”


“What is your idea?” the other leaders inquired.


“I’ll show it. Come this way…. Okay! Now stand in a row!”


Then the Vilpattu politico began taking selfies including them one by one.


Presently they were called in and they sat down to talks which ended in smoke!


Later, the Vilpattu politico addressed them: “Didn’t I say it?”  He continued: “What remains from this visit today are only the selfies taken by me!”
What the Vilpattu politico said turned prophetic when later his photos hit big in social media!
