The 17-year-old student and the 32-year-old man, who were arrested in connection with the killing of Seya Sadewmi, were admitted to the Gampaha Hospital this afternoon.
The two had admitted themselves to undergo treatment for injuries claimed to be caused by the assaults of Kotadeniyawa Police officers.
They were arrested on charges of sexual abuse and killing of five-year-old Seya Sadewmi in Kotadeniyawa and were released today as their DNA samples did not match with those recovered from the body of Seya.  (Tony Karunanayake)
