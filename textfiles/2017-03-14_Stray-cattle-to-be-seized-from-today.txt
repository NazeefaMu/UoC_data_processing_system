Stray cattle to be seized from today


	

Stray cattle in the Western Province, who have no owners, will be captured by the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development from today.

In a press release, the ministry said the move was made due to the increasing number of fatal accidents, public disturbances and traffic congestion caused by these roaming herds.

A committee appointed to identify road blocks to development in the Province had found the cattle were a major nuisance.

The project was launched by the Ministry in collaboration with the Urban Development Authority (UDA).
The Ministry also said owners who disregarded the notice would lose their livestock to Divisional Secretariats and other Provincial authorities. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
