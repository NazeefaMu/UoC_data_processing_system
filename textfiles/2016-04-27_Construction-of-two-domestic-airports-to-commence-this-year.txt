The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation said yesterday that construction work on two out of four proposed domestic airports would be commenced this year in Bandarawela and Palavi.

Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva visited the Nayabadda Estate in Bandarawela where one of airports is to be constructed.

The airport, with a run-way length of 1.5km and a width of 20 metres, is to be constructed at a cost of Rs.1.3 billion. It would also include a small terminal building and a controlling tower. The construction is expected to be completed within a year.

The airport will be built on about 75 acres of an abandoned land which belongs to the Janatha Estate Development Board and will have a capacity of a maximum of 45 passenger aircrafts.

The feasibility report will be finalized after the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) visits the location for inspection.

Earlier it was decided to build an airport in Haputale, but due to technical reasons it was decided to shift the venue to Bandarawela.

The Ministry expects to construct four domestic airports in Kandy, Palavi, Trincomalee and Bandarawela.

“Once the construction of the airports is completed, they would be operated under a public–private partnership,” the ministry said. (Darshana Sanjeewa)
