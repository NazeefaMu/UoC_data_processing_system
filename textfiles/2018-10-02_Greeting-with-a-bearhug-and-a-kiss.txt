Greeting with a bearhug and a kiss!


	

There is a zonal head in the education sector known to be a buddy of an influential politico, who has made it a habit to greet young female teachers with a bearhug and a kiss, they say.




This high-up would smooch a lady teacher and say: “I hear that you’re doing your work well!”


The female teachers resent his conduct but are afraid to complain to higher authorities fearing a reprisal like a punishment transfer, given the political clout the man wields.


However, there is a single case reported from an area named after a lake covered with lotus flowers where a female teacher had complained to her Principal about the outrage she had to suffer, they say.
