The theft of a mobile phone belonging to a police officer who was inquiring a clash between two women inside the police station was reported in the Mawathagama area recently.

A woman who was fighting with another woman has made a complaint with the police.

Both parties were summoned to the police station and the inquiry was conducted by a police officer.

Concluding the inquiry the Police Inspector was looking for his mobile phone which was lying on the table a moment ago. As he could not find the phone, he had asked one of his colleagues to ring his phone.

To his utter surprise, the phone rang from inside the handbag of one of the women who was summoned for the inquiry.

The Inspector searched the handbag and recovered his phone whilst the owner of the handbag turned red in sheer embarrassment. (Kanchana Mala Bandara)
