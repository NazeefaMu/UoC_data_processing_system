BBS accuses law enforces of double standards


	


	Different standards were applied by the law enforcers to MP Hirunika Premachandra (when she was arrested for allegedly kidnapping someone) and the Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera when he was charged with contempt of court and the disruption of court proceedings, alleged the Collective of National Bikkhu Organisations today.
	The Collective of National Bikkhu Organisations comprises the BBS, Ravana Balaya, and Sinhala Ravaya.
	The Ven. Pahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera, speaking at a media briefing held at the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) head office, alleged that the manner in which the law enforcement agencies took action on the two incidents demonstrated that the judicial system was not the applied equally to everyone.
	He asked whether the law enforcement agencies acted only against Buddhist monks when there were many serious problems which should be addressed by them.
	Condemning the prime minister’s statement in parliament that some robe wearers were causing a tense situation in front of the Homagama Magistrate’s Court, the Thera alleged that the robe wearers were not BBS members but persons sent there by the prime minister.
	He referred to them as the “Sirikotha/Temple Trees Force.” He requested all Buddhist monks in the country to come together to protest against injustice. He said a dharma war may erupt unless the government ensured that Buddhism could function without hindrance.
	“We were shocked upon hearing that Gnanasara Thera was remanded. They could have granted him bail because he apologised to the magistrate,” he said. (Piyumi Fonseka and Chaturanga Pradeep)
