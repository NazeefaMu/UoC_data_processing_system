Call to include pragmatic proposals in budget

A group of intellectuals on Tuesday urged the government to come up with progressive and pragmatic proposals in the the upcoming budget which addresses the country’s basic economic issues.
Addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Kelaniya University Vice Chancellor Senior Professor Sunanda Madduma Bandara said the government should pay its attention especially on basic economic issues of the country, when preparing the budget.
He said the budget has to balance the revenue and expenditure of the government. The budget is based on taxes such as income tax, customs duty and excise duty.
There should be a proper procedure to identify the rich who are not paying income tax. It is necessary to implement a proper tax collection procedure, he said.
A slump in main exports such as tea and rubber has affected the country’s economy. Creating an investor friendly environment to attract more investors is another important factor the government should pay its attention to, when preparing the budget, he said.
Prof H.D.Karunaratne said the income gap between the rich and the poor has increased in the world today. Jobless growth is another challenge.
The economy is affected by the heavy debt burden which has resulted in an unbalanced economy, he said.
He proposed to increase government expenditure on education. Attention should be paid towards entrepreneurship development and human resource development, Karunaratne said.
He stressed the need of implementing advanced data and information management procedure to collect island wide data and information. Data and information should be computerized for easy handling, he said.
Former Higher Education Ministry Secretary Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawaratne said that the private sector is the engine of the country’s economic growth. The public sector is the gear box of growth. The people are the wheels and politicians are the drivers of the economic growth, he said.
