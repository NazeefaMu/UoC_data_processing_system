Over 300,000 mails stuck in CME


	

More than 300,000 mails had been jammed inside the Central Mail Exchange (CME) to date due to the 48- hour strike since Monday midnight, United Postal Trade Unions’ Front said today.

However, Post Master General Rohana Abeyratne rejected the Union’s statements and told the Daily Mirror that the CME was dispatching mails at the end of each day.

“A backlog of mails is not possible at CME as claimed by the TUs,” he said.

Front’s President Chinthaka Bandara charged that though the country’s entire mail delivering and collection had come to a standstill, the Postal Department had not came forward to hold discussions to find solutions to their demands.

Mr. Bandara said the trade union action would be concluded midnight today.

However, he said they would resort to strike action on June 26, if their demands were not met. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
