He has gone absurdly green


	



 

A political appointee holding secretarial status of sorts in a Ministry handling the public purse had made it a practice to sign all official documents including agreements and vouchers in green ink. And the general audit who had come for the annual inspection had queried this irregular practice at the start of their work.

 


It is common knowledge in the public service that only the general audit has the right to make notes on official documents in green ink and they have now called for the political appointee’s explanation for violating an important government regulation.
