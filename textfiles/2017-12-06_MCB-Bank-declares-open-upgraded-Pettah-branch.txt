“It is a source of pride as we re-launch the Pettah branch which is a fully-owned property of the bank and the first one of MCB Sri Lanka operations inaugurated in 1996. The journey with some of the key customers started here and today it continues to be stronger through multiple solutions that cater to their emerging financial needs.
