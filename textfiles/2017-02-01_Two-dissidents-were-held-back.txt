Two dissidents were held back


	



 

On hearing that two Deputies were set to attend the Nugegoda JO rally, the yahapalanaya high-ups had swung into action to hold them back.

 


One of them hailing from the Puttalam district had received a call asking him to get ready to make a visit to the United States.


 After giving the call, the interested parties in yahapalanaya had done a rush-job of arranging the jaunt for January 26. It was no secret to the high political authorities, this Deputy had been a despondent one for some time and was poised for the jump.  The other Deputy who had planned to attend the Nugegoda rally, a  character from the South appears to have had second thoughts at the eleventh hour, they say. 


However, according to JO sources, this member has not changed his mind and his crossover is just a matter of time.
