We hope that our regular readers may remember that we explained the significance of the Basic Numbers from 1 to 20 in two previous articles.

 We have already explained to you that if the numerical value of your name corresponds to a number which is not favourable, you can change its numerical value to a value that is favourable to you by modifying the spelling of the name by adding or removing an innocuous letter.
