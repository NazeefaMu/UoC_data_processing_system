The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) today alleged that the government was attempting to put the blame of the shooting at the SAITM CEO on the student unions and civil society groups and urged it to conduct a broad investigation over the incident and reveal the culprits.

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the SAITM issue should not be allowed to be suppressed through this sort of drama.

“The government is trying to put the blame on the student unions and civil society groups over the SAITM shooting. The UNP government had done this sort of actions such as the 1983 Black July in the past to suppress forces against them. They even acted to ban political parties hiding behind the incident. This shooting also indicates a similar story. Therefore we urge the government to conduct a broad investigation and reveal the culprits,” he said.

Mr. Dissanayake said the government’s involvement in the incident would be justified if the government failed to conduct an investigation and revealed the people behind the incident.

“This should be revealed if there was no government blessed force behind this. Our Police Department was clever to find any type of crime. The government was behind the crimes that the police have not been able to solve including the cases of Wasim Thajudeen and Lasantha Wickramatunge,” he said.

Mr. Dissanayake told a news conference that they had reasonable doubt that the SAITM may be doing this sort of actions to divert the mounting protest over it after the verdict of the Court of Appeal. (Ajith Siriwardana)
