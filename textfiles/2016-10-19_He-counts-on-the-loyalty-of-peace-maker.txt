Two JO members from the Gem-city are out to lock horns with John the Silent from the same district. 

 


John the Silent widely considered a gentleman-politician has been a consistent advocate of party unity and some Blues were surprised when they learnt that the two JO stalwarts are out for John’s blood.


However, informed sources say that the antipathy towards John the Silent has resulted from the rivalry over the party’s district leadership.


The JO politicos who organized the Gem-city rally had set the stage for the former strongman to direct a barb or two at John during his speech. In fact, a group of party supporters had positioned themselves immediately opposite the stage as pre-planned and shouted: “Say something about John,” when the former strongman was addressing the rally. However, the former strongman, a seasoned politician with a keen political scent had disappointed the organizers by telling the vociferous group: “Don’t say anything against him. He is due to sit with us in the near future…”
The former strongman’s announcement about John the Silent drew several rounds of applause from the crowd while making a few on the stage look sheepish.
