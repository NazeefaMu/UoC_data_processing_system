Differences between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) are not an obstacle for to appreciate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremeisnghe's good qualities, SLFP Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva told Parliament yesterday.

He said this when the motion of felicitation was taken up in the House to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s 40th year in Parliament last morning.

“The line of thinking of SLFP including its economic policy defers from the UNP but that does not stop the SLFP from appreciating the Premier Wickremesinghe's good qualities,” the minister said.

He said the SLFP would not hesitate to felicitate others in Parliament as and when they reach millstones in their political careers like the premier.

“SLFP has been battling with the UNP since 1977 and had been criticizing Premier Wickremsinghe many times but he had taken these criticisms in good spirit. Many of us have been treated with smiles when we come to the lobby after criticizing him during our speeches inside the chambers. I have seen with my own eyes the maturity shown by Mr Wickremeisnghe when dealing with foreign delegates,” the minister said. (Yohan Perera)
