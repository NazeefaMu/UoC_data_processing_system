Commercial Bank of Ceylon (ComBank) has enhanced the value of its savings products for women and senior citizens through a partnership with Asiri Group of Hospitals to offer customers in these categories an exclusive discount on selected diagnostic services.


A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the two entities paves the way for holders of Commercial Bank’s ‘Anagi’ savings account for women and ‘Udara’ savings/fixed deposits for senior citizens to be eligible to receive substantial discounts on health checks done at the Wellness Centres  of four hospitals of Asiri Group of Hospitals.


This exclusive discount will be available till December 31, 2016 at Asiri Surgical Hospital in Kirimandala Mawatha, Colombo 05, Central Hospital, Colombo 10 and at two Asiri Hospitals in Matara. 


In addition to investigations at Wellness Centres, Anagi women’s savings account holders will be eligible to this special discount on special screening packages for cancer and other medical check-ups designed for women under 40 and over 40, the bank said.


Among the health checks for Udara account holders to which the discount will apply are the Well Woman Health Check-up, Well Man Health Check-up, Special Cancer Detection Health Check, Heart Health Check and Diabetic Health Check.


The discount will be available either when an Anagi debit card is used to pay for the health packages or is produced at the counter or when an Udara senior citizens entitlement card is produced at the hospital counter.


“Our Anagi and Udara products are unique because they have been developed after research into the needs of the specific customer segments they are intended for,” said Commercial Bank Executive Director/Chief Operating Officer S. Renganathan.


“Each of these schemes has tangible value additions and this latest benefit will significantly augment the value of both products.”


“Asiri Group of Hospitals is delighted to support Commercial Bank in its efforts to promote the wellbeing of its customers,” said Asiri Health Chief Executive Officer Dr. Manjula Karunarathne.
“Asiri Group of Hospitals is the largest private healthcare services provider in Sri Lanka and is an appropriate partner for the largest private bank in the country.” 


The signing of the MoU between the two companies was attended by Commercial Bank Chief Operating Officer/Executive Director S. Renganathan, Commercial Bank Deputy General Manager Marketing Hasrath Munasinghe, Asiri Health CEO Dr. Manjula Karunarathne and Asiri Health Head of Marketing Corporate Dasarath Hettiarachchi.


Commercial Bank’s Anagi women’s savings account offers one of the best interest rates in the savings account category for women, gold loans at a concessionary rate for the purchase of jewellery and a Combank shopping debit card. An Anagi account can be opened with a minimum deposit of Rs.1,000. Account holders have a choice of a branded passbook or statement-based savings.
