	Deputy Minister Sagala Ratnayake is to be sworn in as Minister of Law and Order either today or tomorrow, informed sources said yesterday.
	Sources close to Mr. Ratnayake told Daily mirror that all arrangements had been made to appoint him as the new Law and Order Minister following the resignation of UNP parliamentarian Tilak Marapana who held the portfolio earlier.
	However, it is learnt that the subject of Prisons Reforms earlier under the purview of Mr. Marapana would be vested with Minister D.M. Swaminathan, who is also the Minister of resettlement, rehabilitation and Hindu Affairs. (Yohan Perera)
