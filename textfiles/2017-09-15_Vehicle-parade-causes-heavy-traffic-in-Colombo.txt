Heavy traffic was reported in Colombo today because of a vehicle parade oraganised by the GMOA and several other groups calling for a solution to the SAITM controversy.

GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge said they would launch a countrywide joint trade union action on Thursday if the government did not provide a reasonable solution to this matter even after the vehicle parade.

“The vehicle parade which began on Tuesday from five districts reached Colombo today. We have also launched a district-wise work stoppage during the past few days against SAITM,” he said,

Dr. Aluthge urged the government to solve this SAITM controversy without further delay and said students attached to State universities and SAITM and several others were inconvenienced because the government was not solving this longstanding matter.

He said they would be forced resort to trade union action on Thursday if the government failed to provide them with a people-friendly solution and that they would await a positive response from the government before Thursday.

Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge said that by refusing to register SAITM graduates the British General Medical Council (GMC) had also supported the GMOA’s views on SAITM. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
