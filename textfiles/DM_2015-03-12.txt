Avant Guarde Chairman refused business travel
	
	Colombo Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya today refused the Chairman H.N. Yapa Senadipathi of Avant Guarde Maritime Service (Pvt.) Ltd to go to Nigeria for business as the CID objected asserting that if the petitioner travelled to Nigeria it would hold back the on-going investigations.
	IP Sunil Samaratunge appearing for the CID said according to the Courts direction they obtained reports from the Secretaries of the Defence Ministry and the Foreign Ministry giving their opinion on the issue.
	They said they forwarded those letters to the AG to seek his advice and the AG had still not conveyed his opinion to the CID.
	Counsel Dulinda Weerasuriya PC appearing for Mr Senadhipathy said that his client had entered into an agreement with the Rakna Lanka Company to provide storing facilities to store the firearms of Rakna Lanka in his clients care.
	He said however the agreement was already lapsed. He also said if the Court imposes travel restrictions to his client, this would bring a loss of Rs 3500 million to his client and to the country. The case was postponed for July 11.(T.Farook Thajudeen)

Video: Elections only after reforms: Sobitha Thera
	
Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who heads the National Movement for Social Justice and the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) which were instrumental in the setting up of this Government yesterday stressed the need to put in place the promised electoral reforms before declaring a general election.
They insisted that the next general elections should be held under the new electoral system even if it was held after April this year.
We dont mind the government holding the elections after dissolving Parliament in April this year but it should be held under a new electoral system, Ven. Sobitha Thera told a media briefing last afternoon.
He said no one wanted an election soon while it was the government which fixed the 100-day deadline on its own.
JHU President Venerable Athureliye Rathana Thera said the Government could not buy time by talking of delimitation because the election chief had assured that this process could be completed within 30 days and as such the Government should introduce electoral and constitutional reforms immediately and deliver on its promises.
JHU Leader the Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera said the punishing of people who had been accused of corruption was moving a snails pace. He said it was disappointing to note that this Government had failed to penalize even one person who faced obvious corruption charges and pointed out that it was politics that was delaying this process.
The monks warned that this was the last chance the country would get to implement the necessary reforms and emphasised that the people would not tolerate any more delays. (YP and SD)

	Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says if this is Yahapalanaya may the gods have mercy on us.
	Whenever arrests are made, the statements regarding the arrests should be issued by the IGP or the Attorney General and not by government politicians as happening now. With the development of the country is at a standstill, the people are now forced to look to the gods for mercy under the so called Yaha Palanaya, he said.
	He made these remarks when he paid a courtesy call on the Chief Prelate of Mihintale today and added that both the development and good governance of the country has deteriorated.
	He told the media that he wish anger, hatred and revenge to stop and peace and prosperity to be ushered into the country.
	People are being unemployed and vengeance has re-emerged. The papers are filled with statements made by politicians about the pending arrests, which are normally announced by the IGP or the Attorney General. Some individuals say that so and so will be arrested within a day or two. Is this the good governance they promised he questioned.
	He also expressed his views on the stalling of certain development activities, which in turn he claimed has affected the jobs of labourers and engineers and prevented income generation.
	The port city project should not be stopped, as the development of such a magnitude would never be achieved by the country for centuries, and I wish development activities continue uninterrupted, he said replying to a question posed by a journalist on the Port City issue.
