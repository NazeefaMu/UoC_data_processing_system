Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, who was admitted to Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital (SJGH) following a complication in the area where a surgery was done, has been transferred back to the Welikada Prison Hospital, SJGH Director Dr. Susitha Senaratne said.

“The Thera was fit to transfer back to the Welikada Prison Hospital. I do not wish to disclose more details of his condition as it was not ethical to reveal such details to the media”  the director said.

The Thera, who was serving a 6-year prison sentence, was transferred to the Prisons Hospital on August 30 after undergoing surgery at the Sri Jayewardenepura General Hospital. However, the Thera was again transferred to the SJGH on September 06 due to an allergic reaction.

Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera was convicted of four charges over Contempt of Court and sentenced by the Appeal Court to 19 years of rigorous imprisonment, to be completed within 6 years on August 08. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)
