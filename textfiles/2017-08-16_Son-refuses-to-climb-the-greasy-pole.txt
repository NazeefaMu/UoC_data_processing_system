Son refuses to climb the ‘greasy pole’


	



 

A recent news story said a scion of a well-known political family was being groomed for a role in national politics by his illustrious mother. Taking a cue from this story, a party leader hailing from a political family in the upcountry estate sector too has made a bid to bring his son to the national political scene. 

 


This politico leading the ‘cockerels’ has asked his young son fresh from the kingdom with a law degree to get ready to make his debut on the political stage. 


However, the son had given a firm ‘no’ saying he was not prepared to climb the dirty ‘grease pole’.
The politico who had long planned to hand over his leadership mantle to his son in due course, just as he inherited it from his grandfather, is a highly disappointed man these days, they say.
