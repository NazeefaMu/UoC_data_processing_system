The Mahanayaka Theras of three Nikayas and other Sangha Sabhas, who convened in Kandy today, unanimously decided there was no need to bring in a new Constitution or an Amendment to the Constitution.

They also stated that the Government should take immediate steps to resolve the SAITM issue and to take necessary steps with regard to the particular Medical University considering the patients.

The Maha Sangha also proposed that bringing the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances Bill to Parliament should be delayed to enable the Parliamentarians to study the bill.

They also proposed that a special committee should be appointed to look into the grievances that Buddhists were facing, with regard to religion and culture, the prevailing racial and religious unrest, and to pay attention to protect the archaeologically important religious places in the country.

The special Sangha Council was attended by three Mahanayakas of the three Nikayas and 75 other Theras at the Sri Chandrananda Hall in Asgiriya.

Ven. Ellawala Medhananda Thera, Ven. Balangoda Sobhitha Thera, Ven Welamitiyawe Kusaladamma Thera, Asgiriya Maha Lekakadhikari Medagama Dhammananda Thera, Dr. Godagama Sri Sumangala, Asgiriya Deputy Lekakadhikari Dr. Narampanawe Ananda and Keppetigoda Siriwimala Thera also attended the council.
