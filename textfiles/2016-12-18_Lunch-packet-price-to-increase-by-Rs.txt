The price of a lunch packet will be increased by Rs. 10 from tomorrow, Canteen Owners Association said today.

Organiser of the Association Asela Sampath said the decision was taken after considering the increase of the rice prices in the country. “The decision was not to gain profit. But the prices of rice are being increased day by day.

He said rice is being selling at various prices in the market and even in the Sathosa.

He said average price for a vegetable food packet is Rs. 100 and it will be increased to Rs. 110, a fish food packet will increased from Rs. 130 to Rs. 140 and a chicken food packet from Rs. 160 to Rs. 170.

Sampath said the government had failed to control the price for rice. “There was no shortage of the rice at the moment in the country. However, some businessmen are hiding the rice to sell for animal food. We challenge the Consumer Affairs Authority, STF or any other institution to conduct an islandwide raid to find hidden rice being stored. ” he said.(DS)
