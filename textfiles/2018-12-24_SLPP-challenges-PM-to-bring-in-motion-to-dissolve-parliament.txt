The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) today challenged Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to bring in a motion to dissolve parliament.

Addressing a news briefing, MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana said they were ready to support the United National Party (UNP) if it submits a motion to dissolve parliament. "We also invite the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), which is a branch of the UNP, to accept this challenge. 

Unlike the previous opposition comprised of the JVP and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), we won't allow the UNP to misbehave. 

We will criticise their wrong moves. What we have today is a genuine opposition which won't dance to the tune of the UNP," he said. 

Meanwhile, he also noted that the government had lost its two-thirds majority in parliament as only 102 MPs supported the Vote on Account last Friday. “The government is like a dilapidated vehicle which will cease to function in a few months,” Mr Abeygunawardana stated. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
