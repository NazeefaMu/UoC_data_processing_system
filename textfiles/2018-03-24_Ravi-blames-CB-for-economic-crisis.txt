UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday slammed the Central Bank saying it was responsible for the bond scam and the present economic crisis.

“The President, Prime Minister, the former president and the politicians are blamed for the economic crisis but no one speaks of the wrong doings which Central Bank officials are involved in" the MP said.

He said the Central Bank officials were to be blamed for the interest rate hikes. “Can a person run a business by borrowing at 16 per cent," he asked.

Joint opposition MP Ranjith Soysa then asked whether the MP was saying that politicians should run the Central Bank and give the Officials of the bank to run the country,

“Sri Lanka will become another Uganda if Central Bank officials run the country," he said.

Mr Karunanayake said the main issue was that central bank officials remained though governments changed. (Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwadana)
