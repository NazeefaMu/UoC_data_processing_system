Malinga named Sri Lanka's ODI, T20I captain


	

Sri Lanka's leadership roulette continues with Lasith Malinga now being appointed as the limited-overs captain, and Niroshan Dickwella as his deputy, for the upcoming ODIs and a lone T20I in New Zealand.

In the aftermath of home series defeats to England - first in Tests and then ODIs - Sri Lanka took the decision to overhaul the limited-overs side, particularly the 50-overs one for the way forward.

The board took a big call in reinstating Angelo Mathews into the side, after dropping him for the England series, citing fitness concerns. The Mathews axing episode got quite ugly, with the all-rounder accusing the board of making him the scapegoat of an abysmal Asia Cup campaign.

Sri Lanka will be without their lead spinner Akila Dananjaya, who is under suspension after being called for illegal bowling action. Upul Tharanga, who played just the first two of the five-match series against England (didn't bat in the first, scored a duck in the second) - has also been left out.

The pair of opener Sadeera Samarawickrama and left-arm spinner Amila Aponso - who played three and four fixtures respectively in the England series - also didn't find a place in the 17-man shortlist. SLC went with Danushka Gunathilaka at the top of the order, while Asela Gunaratne also comes in after having played his last ODI in Bangladesh in January this year. Sri Lanka also recalled leg spinner Seekkuge Prasanna who played the last of his 38 ODIs in October 2017.

Top-order batter Kusal Perera has recovered completely from his quad strain that he sustained in the second ODI against England and missed the remainder of the series. Kusal Mendis, who came in as his replacement and scored a half-century, has managed to hold on to his spot.

ODI and T20I Squad: Lasith Malinga (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Angelo Mathews, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Perera, Dinesh Chandimal, Asela Gunaratne, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandakan, Seekkuge Prasanna, Dushmantha Chameera, Kasun Rajitha, Nuwan Pradeep, Lahiru Kumara
