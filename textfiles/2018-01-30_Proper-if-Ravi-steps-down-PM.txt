Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is reported to have indicated that it will be proper if UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake steps down from his post as the assistant leader of the party.

This was revealed by the Prime Minister, when he presided over a meeting with the leaders of the parties aligned with the UNP.

Meanwhile it was also revealed by UNP sources that the commission appointed to look into the action that had to be taken against any UNP member found to have been involved in the bond scam had also recommended that Mr Karunanayake should be removed from his post.

The committee headed by Minister Tilak Marapana was appointed to look into whether any UNPer is involved in the scam and to advice the party leadership on what action should be taken against those who are involved.
