They had their fun after all


	



 

A regiment of henchmen of a prominent politico who checked into a high-end hotel for a good time after attending a religious ceremony at the periphery had looked for another hotel with better comforts to spend the next day, they say..

 


Earlier, this regiment had taken over the conducting of the ceremony from its local organizers and begun blaring out repeatedly from a public-address system a long string of names of politicos both in power and out of power expected to participate as distinguished guests in the religious ceremony. 


Most people in the area who were irked by the racket being made had boycotted the event, they say.
