A stay order was issued today by Supreme Court preventing Colombo Magistrate’s Court from hearing the case filed by the Bribery Commission against former Chief Justice Mohan Pieris.

The Bribery Commission had filed a corruption case against Mr.Peiris, former Solicitor General and currently Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Navas and Lanka Electricity Company Secretary M.M.C. Ferdinandes in the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.

They were charged with preparing an erroneous Attorney General's report to avoid taking legal action on irregularities connected with the lands purchased for LECO during December 1 and 30, 2010 when Mr.Peiris was the Attorney General. (S.S. Selvanayagam)
