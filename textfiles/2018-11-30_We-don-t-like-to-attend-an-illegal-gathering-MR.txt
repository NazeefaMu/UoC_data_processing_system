Responding to a question as to why the government MPs had boycotted parliament sittings once again, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday explained that they don’t intend attending an illegal gathering.

“We are not avoiding anything. We simply don’t like to attend an illegal gathering,” he told journalists in parliament, adding that parliament sessions were being held illegally and accused Speaker Karu Jayasuriya of not respecting the law. “The Speaker doesn’t respect the law. We decided not to attend because of his arbitrary actions,” he said.

When asked how the crisis situation would be resolved if the situation continued in this manner, Mr. Rajapaksa said it would be resolved. “We are awaiting,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)\
