Anushan Perera – Grooving and Cooking

When you say Chef Anushan – there’s only one chef that’s talented in so many levels and balances his talents very well in his ever so busy schedule. Chef Anushan is the Sous Chef at the Galadari Hotel and heads their fine dining restaurant California Grill. Anyone who has tasted his cuisine will undoubetly agree with me, when I say they are just ‘exquisite’.
And apart from whipping up some great dishes, Anushan also dances. Not just move to a beat but actually move his body to the rhythmic sounds of Latin American music. Yep, he’s one of the champions in Sri Lanka Latin American Dance. And on special occasions, you get to see him take off that apron and hat and get into one of those sexy dance outfits and entertain his guests.
Name, location and background:
Anushan Perera – Sous Chef Galadari Hotel Colombo.
I am from Kandy and have an older brother and sister. My parents are Malini and Arthur. We are a close knit family. I have been in this profession forever and simply enjoy every moment of it.
How long have you been at your present work place?
I have been at the Galadari Hotel for donkey’s ears.
Why are you a chef?
My mum is an excellent cook and she is my inspiration.
What do you feel when you cooking, creating and working in the kitchen?
Well, all I can say is that I am in my element when cooking. Nothing more could give me a better satisfaction in life. I love to cook and create new recipes.
Who is your biggest critic?
My grandmother was so difficult to please….I learnt the art of perfection from her.
How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen?
Never experienced that and do not intend to.
When at home…do you cook or do you let your partner take control?
I do not cook at home I let others cook for me!!!
If you were not a chef…what would you be today?
My first ambition was to join SriLankan Airlines but my dad never allowed it. I remember I secretly applied and got chosen, but that was not my fate.
Of all the places you worked, what are your greatest memories of them?
My memories are many, so I feel it’s unjust to mention a few. However at the end of the day when people appreciate your hard work and efforts that is the greatest gift of all.
