For a nation to have the unity there should be a good communication among each other among the communities.




In communication, there are various ways and means to communicate with each other as human beings than the other animals. Language is the main tool that humans use to communicate.
As a person, we use four ways of language skills to have a better communication.
Listening, reading speaking and writing are the four ways of skills that a person should develop to maintain a good communication skill. If a person fails in any one of these skills, one can say that he or she has poor communication skills.
To avoid that problem, improving skills of the second language among citizens is very important.
As a strategy, the 2nd National Language (2NL) development programmes have been implemented in National Colleges of Education.

 


"Language clubs are expected to be more fun when they are multi-generational and multicultural. When members have various target language abilities it is easy to learn the target language ..."



This effort was launched with a wide vision and prospective teachers in the colleges are expected to learn 2NL in order to perform effectively for the benefit of the entire nation as they are suggested to improve the language abilities of the students when they go to the schools.
In addition to that, it will act as a special programme for promoting social cohesion concept through their learning-teaching process.
As a result, prospective teachers are produced to promote peace and harmony through social cohesion and reconciliation.
To be good professionals as well as good human beings it has already been implemented this special language development program as Language speaking clubs (LSC) programme in National Colleges of Education.
Language speaking club is a place for language learners to use the target language in a stress-free environment.


Establishing a language speaking club (Tamil/ Sinhala) is the best way to improve the spoken target language.
Language learners get chances to practise their language skills in a setting that is more similar to their real-life situations.
In addition to that, it is a good way to make new friendships among the members of the club.
Learners get a chance to have good native language friends which motivate the learner confidence and they may feel more comfortable with using the target language with more trust and fun.
In fact, language clubs are expected to be more fun when they are multi-generational and multicultural.


When members have various target language abilities it is easy to learn the target language by focusing different language skills.
National colleges of Education (NCoEs) were established on 1985 as a concept of Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe with the objective of offering teaching qualifications through 3 year, full time, pre-service teacher education programme with utmost aim to improve the quality of the education system by moulding up quality teachers.
In this effort developing language competency of the prospective teachers is very much important as the communicative ability is the main factor of a successful person.
Therefore language ability is an important matter for a person to be successful and through this language speaking club programme, the Government expects to achieve the targets set out in the field of education.

 


"A language speaking club is the best way to improve the spoken target language. Language learners get chances to practise their language skills in a setting similar to their real-life situation situations."


 

This programme is conducted in all the National Colleges of Education as a collaborative effort of Ministry of Education - National Colleges of Education branch, National Institute of Education, University of Colombo and the Goethe Institute with the financial and technical support of GTZ. (Deutsche Gesellschaft for International Zusammenarbeit)
The aim of the Deutsche Gesellschaft for International Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through the Education for Social Cohesion (ESC) programme which is implemented by the Federal Republic of Germany is to enable school children to live together peacefully in a multiethnic and multilingual society.
In this manner GIZ - ESC programme focuses mainly on Second National language development of the individuals in order to achieve the communicative ability which directly leads to a peaceful nation especially in a country like Sri Lanka.
