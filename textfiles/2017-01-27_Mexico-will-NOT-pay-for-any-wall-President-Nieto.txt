‘Mexico will NOT pay for any wall’: President Nieto


	



 

Mexico’s President Enrique Pena Nieto hit back at Donald Trump’s order to start building a wall separating the country from the United States - and vowed that Mexicans would not foot the bill, despite what Trump has said.  


‘Mexico does not believe in walls. I’ve said it time and time again: Mexico will not pay for any wall,’ Pena Nieto said in a video published Wednesday evening. The Mexican president said he regrets and rejects the US decision to build a wall.  


Meanwhile Trump insisted in an ABC News interview Wednesday that Mexico would ‘absolutely’ pay for the wall, but failed to clearly explain how that would happen.  


Pena Nieto said in his video statement Wednesday that he had asked his government to strengthen protection for Mexican immigrants.’I’ve asked for the minister of Foreign Relations to re-enforce protection measures to our citizens,’ he said.’Mexico offers and demands respect like the fully sovereign nation we are,’ he said. ‘Mexico gives its friendship to the people of the United States and wishes to reach agreements with its government - agreements that will be in favor of Mexico and Mexicans.  


‘Trump’s order came the same day Mexico’s foreign relations and economy secretaries arrived in Washington for talks with his administration, and its timing was seen by many in Mexico as a slap in the face.
