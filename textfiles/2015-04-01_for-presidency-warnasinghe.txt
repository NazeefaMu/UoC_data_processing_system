Commenting on the reports that JHU General Secretary Champika Ranawaka was aspiring to become the Executive President and that was why he was against the 19th Amendment, JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Minister Ranawaka was more suitable for the Presidency than any of the others who were spreading rumours linking the minister and the presidency.
“The JHU will decide when to field him as the President or whether to nominate him. It is a decision for the party to take,” he said today.
He lashed out at Professor Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri, author Gamini Viyangoda and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for claiming that Minister Ranawaka was aspiring to become the Executive President in 2020 and that was why the JHU was against the 19th Amendment.
