New trends of glass and green

Glass and green buildings have one thing in common - versatility. This week Arch World features architect Bernard Gomez. As in our previous article Gomez elucidated how sequence can influence everything in a building. Last week Gomez spoke how well planned walls can influence shading and air flow creating cross ventilation. This week he touched on a similar factor - glass, while also touching on 'Green Buildings' and 'Zero Energy buildings.'
"When you think of using glass, it depends on the project. Our recent work has included several commercial multi - storey buildings, including the Corporate HQ for Dialog Axiata that are located in the heart of the city in a very dense site. You have to use a lot of glass to get in natural light and give the building a certain form and character that achieves the client's (expectations) for Corporate Identity," he said.
"You do have to understand that when you use glass there are issues of increased energy use and heat absorption into the building. This can have negative consequences in terms of increasing air conditioning and increasing visual discomfort in terms of glare. Although we use glass, what we try to do is use shading devices which are part of the facade design of the building itself - they can be cantilevered balconies or overhanging planters, which shadow and shades the glass. So when using glass, we mitigate the direct effects of heat gain by using cantilevers that shadow and shade the glass. We use glass, but in a controlled, designed way, not randomly, which can cause a lot of negative effects," said Gomez.
The concept of the green building is a little understood term. What do you mean by a 'green building'? Basically these are buildings that consume less energy because they are designed as such, and also have the capacity to generate renewable energy.
"These are buildings that are designed both in terms of the mechanical engineering aspect where they can utilize less energy in heating, cooling and lighting. There is technology which gives these buildings a green label. These are buildings where you have IT based management systems that increase the operating efficiency of a lot of their service components like air conditioning chillers. They are technology driven solutions. By doing so, you reduce your energy loads, and increase your efficiency in terms of power consumption. There are also buildings that use passive concepts of cooling to reduce heat gain and energy efficiency and these can be very effective in reducing heat gain into buildings" explained Gomez.
"You can take a passive approach which is more difficult to do. You design the building to reduce heat loads by using elements such as courtyards, shading by overhangs, and generate pressure differences causing wind tunnel and wind funnel effects. The other approach is of course using technology. All buildings have to have a good intelligent mix of both design approaches. Buildings can be an invaluable source of renewable power generation. There are Photovoltaics (PV) that can be put on a building which can generate electricity using photo voltaic cells which can be on the roof or integrated into the facade," stated Gomez.
The wonders of architecture seem to be boundless, from the concept of 'heat island effect' to 'Zero Energy Buildings.'
"There is something called 'the heat island effect'. Because the larger the footprint of a building and its volumetric mass, there is a lot of absorption of heat. Now this heat dissipates during the cooling hours which is in the evenings and the nights. There are a lot of products used on buildings for example stone, and metal claddings. These absorb heat which then dissipates during the hours of darkness," Gomez pointed out.
"There are many ways you can achieve zero energy buildings. To me it is a commercial tag line. You can achieve zero emissions by spending a lot of money on very expensive renewable, alternative energy systems - photovoltaics for one. There is also geo thermal energy which is being used in several countries. There is wind which is being used in several modern buildings to generate electricity. All of these are quite expensive.
"If you really want to get a zero energy building, you can add all these components and theoretically you can achieve a zero energy status. However, one must understand that the maintenance cost of some of these technologies is quite high. Even common renewable sources like Photovoltaic cells which generate solar energy, requires maintenance over a period of time, and if not maintained it can lose their efficiency which adds to the (life-cycle) maintenance cost. So one has to decide whether you are going to go to all that trouble just to get a zero energy building. It is very difficult to sustain a zero energy building," added Gomez.
Wind technology is the concept of wind turning a wind turbine like the windmills that you commonly see.
"Right now we are doing a high rise building for a corporate involved in power generation, where we are looking at photovoltaic and wind technology to achieve a fairly high renewable energy component."
Summing up, Bernard spoke about the value of hiring a good architect. A person can build his/her own house, but a having a good architect is indispensable.
"Building beautiful buildings is just one part of it. As architects, what we really do is, we design spaces and sequence them into an aesthetic composition. We design spaces for public use so that they are comfortable and easy to use, functionally, and technically competent, well organized and efficient both in terms of energy and usage. It is a large gamut of areas that we touch," he said.
It is in an architect's hands to make the project a success or a disaster, as the case may be. "I think it is important for the public to understand that an architect is more than the guy who gives you a beautiful building, or gives you a beautiful looking façade. He is so much more. An architect knows the inside and outside of a project. We take the basic need of a client from an idea to a finished building product. An architect takes a project, enhances it, and makes it financially viable, besides being a functional and technologically competent building," he said.
There seems to be a trend where there is increasing reliance on foreign architects and contractors.
"You can have so called professionals with dubious credentials who have very little idea about our culture, climate, or traditional building systems and way of building. Some of these buildings can be quite problematic.
There have been buildings done by foreign architects and consultants which have become disasters both functionally and aesthetically, even to the extent of basic functional necessities such as inadequate and inappropriate parking."

Italian villa heated and cooled by Earth
This extraordinary Alpine residence in Italy's Brescia province provides stunning views of the mountains that rise 1,200 meters (3,937 feet) above sea level. Every point in the interior is visually connected to the natural landscape-a large panoramic window in the living room frames views of the valley, while openings on the rear side provide glimpses of the grassy hillside that meets a sunken courtyard. Architect Camillo Botticini played with the concepts of harmony and tension between the building and the site, both through the structure and choice of materials, and incorporated sustainable technologies to curb the building's energy consumption.
The house is rooted to the hillside near the Passo del Cavallo pass in the Alps. A suspended metal staircase cuts through the grassy slope and connects a small entry area to the house above. The glazed entrance is sheltered by a broad window and a terrace.
“We are still in a place close to the urban noise but at the same time far away, where the aroma of mountain herbs and grazing sheep seem to have stopped time,” said Botticini about the location of the building. The house uses geothermal energy, features well-insulated walls and natural ventilation.
Treated Accoya wood and sheets of pre-rusted corrugated copper dominate the material palette of the house. The ventilated wall copper and the wood were used in a way which reflects light for more daylighting. Inside, the C-shaped layout wraps around the iroko wood patio. In order to blend into the surrounding, the house changes in height and includes a mezzanine with a study above the living area, while the kitchen is nestled beneath and opens up onto the patio.
