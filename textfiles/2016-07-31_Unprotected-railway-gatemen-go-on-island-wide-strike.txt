The keepers of unprotected railway gates would be on strike from this morning, urging a wage hike, their collective said.

The Organizer of the Collective of Keepers of Unprotected Railway Crossing Gates R.B. Ashoka Bandara said the monthly allowance of Rs.7, 500 was not enough for them and therefore it should be increased up to Rs.12, 500.

“The silence maintained by the Government had made us them to go ahead with an island wide strike,” he said.

“Further, the job security should also be ensured,” he said.

According to sources a total of 2,061 railway gatemen are taking part in the strike. There are 687 unprotected railway crossings in the country. (Dayarathne Abogama)
