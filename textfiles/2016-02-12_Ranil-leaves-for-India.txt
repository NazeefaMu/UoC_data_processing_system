Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe left for India this morning on a private tour.


A spokesman from the Prime Minister's office said Mr. Wickremasinghe and his wife Maithri Wickremasinghe were expected to return to the country this afternoon.

Meanwhile, Indian media reported that the Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister will offer prayers at the Guruvayur Sreekrishna Temple in Kerala amid tight security arrangements, today (12).

Wickramasinghe had visited the temple in April last year, along with his wife and had offered Thulabharam, an offering where a devotee is weighed against offerings with sandal wood.

Prime Minister Wickramasinghe is also likely to offer prayers at the Mamiyoor Mahadeva temple in Guruvayur, reported said.
