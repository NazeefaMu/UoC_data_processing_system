SAITM issue: GMOA threatens major TU action if deadline elapse


	

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday threatened to resort to major trade union action next week if the committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena to probe the SAITM issue does not give its final decision within one week.

GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda told a media briefing that the GMOA took this decision following an unanimous approval of its Central Committee.

He said they also decided to make a written complaint to the President against what they called the political-insanity of Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and former higher education minister S. B. Dissanayake on this issue.

He said the GMOA would further strengthen the awareness and protest campaigns in the coming days and added that they were expecting a justifiable decision on the questioned-standards of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe from the committee appointed by the President.

He said the Health Ministry and the Higher Education Ministry still hold the responsibility of the medical education’s standards and stressed that the SAITM was not an institute that has been accepted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).

Meanwhile, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the GMOA has discussed the issue on Wednesday with the committee appointed by the President.

“The committee has arrived to a decision to take alternative solutions to the issue. We hope that those alternative decisions will be in favor to protect the standards of the medical education in Sri Lanka,” he said. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)
