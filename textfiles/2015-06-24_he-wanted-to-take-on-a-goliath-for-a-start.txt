He wanted to take on a Goliath for a start


	


	This high flier who cut his political teeth on a heritage party later joined the mission to usher in an ‘immaculate tomorrow.’ He was appointed as a head of a state institution under the yahapalanya government.


	
The high flier was among the delegates from 41 civil society organisations and political groupings that attended a conference on the new electoral reforms held at the main secretariat the other day.
A reference made by a participant to ‘a counter-revolution’ within the government triggered heated exchanges at the conference. Our man from the ‘Immaculate Tomorrow’ who got involved in the exchanges had fired a broadside at the Green party leader.  The Green party leader who allowed his detractor to have his say later addressed him: “Do you think that you are qualified to teach politics to us? I have been an MP continuously from 1977.  Have you functioned even as a member of a Pradeshiya Sabha? Do you think that you can even contest a Pradeshiya Sabha election successfully?”
This tongue-lashing silenced the vociferous institution head, they say.
