Defeated ex-minister attempting to grab my seat: Geetha
	
UPFA Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe said the dual citizenship allegation was a conspiracy hatched by a former minister who was defeated at the general election in an effort to enter parliament.
She said she contested the general election after relinquishing her Switzerland citizenship.
I say this with responsibility that I am not a dual citizen of Sri Lanka and Switzerland. I cancelled my dual citizenship before the election, Ms. Kumarasinghe said.
She said she was the first woman who voluntarily cancelled the Switzerland citizenship which was a huge privilege for me.
I came to help the people by sacrificing a huge privilege I had. Switzerland is one of the best countries to live in. No one in history has canceled a Swiss citizenship like I have done. I did it despite objections from my husband and daughter. I cried a lot on that day. I even gave up my career as an artiste, she said.
Ms. Kumarasinghe said she had all the legal documents to prove her cancellation of Switzerland citizenship and that she was 100 per cent sure of securing her MP's post.
I am the only woman MP in the Southern province who was elected to parliament with 65, 000 preferential votes. I sacrificed all my privileges to help the people. What wrong have I done to face such allegations, she asked.
Ms. Kumarasinghe said the law was initially introduced to prevent Gotabaya Rajapksa and Basil Rajapaksa contesting the general election and added that she would file a case demanding compensations for the embarrassment caused to her by making false allegations.
She alleged that a certain minister who has Swiss citizenship by marrying a Swiss lady was closely working with the president while she was being harassed.
Am I being treated like this for supporting former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, she asked. (Ajith Siriwardana)

Eyeing and vying for three media outfits up for sale!
	
A story that has gone viral says that the ownership of at least three leading private media institutions is about to change hands.
One of the three institutions carrying the on sale tag is an electronic one and the other two are entirely print. The competent authority of two of these institutions is said to be a one-time powerful political figure. Incidentally, it is these two institutions  one electronic committed to promoting sports and the other a print one, run by the same owners  that are now attracting most bids, they say. 
Meanwhile, the owners of the electronic media institution on sale, have decided to accept the bid made by a media boss who had been a third eye to the former strongman. This means the Green politico who was eyeing this media institution is no longer in the scene. However, so far no bid has been accepted for the print media institution run by the same owners, they say. Meanwhile, a rumour making rounds says that a certain Ministerial one is set to buy a print media institution that took off the ground quite recently

He didnt wait for the promised earful!
	
The outlay on the construction of the railway extension to Kataragama from Matara estimated by a team of engineers has subsequently been highly bloated. This is a finding by the new Ministerial one presiding over Transport, they say.
The Ministerial one disclosed his findings to the mass media recently.
It was the former strongman himself who handled the Highway portfolio in the previous administration and he was directly responsible for all preliminaries relating to the proposed Matara  Hambantota rail line, which was incidentally a pet project of his. So it was obvious that he was the target of the barbed comment of the Ministerial one, but he is answerable for the implied arbitrary upward revision of the initial project estimate.
On hearing that the new Ministerial ones finding had placed the former strongman in a tight spot, several politicos close to the latter had called him to make solicitous inquiries. The former strongman had a ready answer to these callers: I hope to give this fellow an earful when I meet him next time. Some people dont know that when they point one finger at another person, three fingers would invariably point at themselves!
Two or three days later, both the former strongman and the new Ministerial one holding the Transport portfolio attended a function held to felicitate the old boys of two leading Colombo schools on their being elected to Diyawanna, some of them raised to Ministerial rank.
On seeing the former strongman arriving for the function, the Ministerial one quietly slipped out, they say.

The fact that Mangi has been given a Ministry under which there are  no corporations or statutory bodies to serve as agencies generating jobs for his constituents too has influenced his decision not to face the hustings again. Earlier, he had under his charge the Telecom, a good job provider, but it has been assigned to another Ministerial one now.

HNB takes top 100 Singithi depositors on exciting tour
	
Hatton National Bank (HNB) recently rewarded the children who emerged as the top 100 depositors in Singithi Savings Month 2014 with an exciting educational tour to popular attractions in and around Colombo.
The first stop on the tour was Water World Kelaniya, the only public aquarium in Sri Lanka and home to the first-ever Underwater Tunnel Aquarium in South Asia. Located on a scenic five-acre property on the banks of the Kelani River, Water World houses over 150 display tanks and ponds, a Shark Dome and over 10,000 living aquatic organisms.
Thereafter, the tour moved to the Liquid Plant Centre and Powder Plant of Fonterra Brands Lanka in Biyagama, the local office of the worlds largest exporter of dairy products. The children had the opportunity of visiting the Fonterra Liquid Plant Centre for milk powder blending and packing, which produces almost half a million packs of milk powder every day and the Fonterra Powder Plant, the largest and most sophisticated yoghurt processing facility in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, the winners of the art competition conducted during Savings Month 2014 were rewarded with a guided tour of the historic Ratmalana Airport, which has a rich heritage of 80 years as one of the oldest airports in South Asia. During the Second World War, it was used as a Royal Air Force base and civilianised planes flew into Ratmalana from Perth, Western Australia, on what was at the time the worlds longest non-stop air route. For decades Ratmalana served as Colombos sole international airport before the construction of Bandaranaike International Airport in the 1960s.
The art competition winners were then taken around Colombo to witness and experience popular landmarks of the city such as the Parliament Complex, Old Parliament, Diyatha Uyana, Dutch Hospital, Independence Square and Galle Face Green. The children were mostly from outstation areas and cherished the opportunity to visit these attractions.
HNB Singithi Savings Month is held throughout the month of October each year to commemorate the World Childrens Day and World Thrift Day, which fall on October 1 and 31, respectively. The HNB Singithi brand consists of Singithi Kirikatiyo, Singithi Lama and HNB Teen, which are specialized accounts offered as soon as a child is born, is enrolled in school, becomes a teenager and becomes a youth, respectively.
The 2015 Singithi Savings Month will be carried out in October and many fantastic tours and other rewards have been planned by HNB to incentivise children to save for their future.

Mahela to join NZ domestic T20
	
	Sri Lankan batting colossus Mahela Jayawardene will become one of the biggest names to grace New Zealand's Twenty20 cricket competition after he was signed by the Central Stags on Tuesday.
	Stags general manager Lance Hamilton confirmed Jayawardene had put pen to paper and will join them for the final six games of the Super Smash, and finals weekend in New Plymouth in December if they make it.
	The 38-year-old veteran of 149 tests and 448 one-day internationals is comfortably the highest profile Stags recruit and sits up with Muttiah Muralitharan and Brett Lee (both Wellington Firebirds) as one of the biggest names to feature in the 10-year history of the New Zealand T20 competition.
	"He's one of the greats of the game - certainly the biggest signing we've had," Hamilton said.
	Originally he was pencilled in for the entire 10 rounds but there was a slight hitch in the form of the Shane Warne-Sachin Tendulkar T20 all-stars league at US baseball stadiums, which Jayawardene signed up for. It means he won't arrive until Central's round five clashes with Wellington at Nelson's Saxton Oval on November 19.
	It gives the Stags the most imposing top order in the competition, with Jayawardene joining new Black Cap George Worker and the destructive Jesse Ryder who returns to the team where he made his name after stints with Wellington and Otago.
	Jayawardene called time on his glittering 18-year international career after the World Cup in March. In 149 tests he topped 11,000 runs and averaged 49.84, and his influence continued in retirement as he was hired by England as a batting consultant for next month's series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.
	He had mixed success in T20 leagues in England and West Indies in recent months. In eight games for Sussex, Jayawardene averaged 34 at a strike rate of 141, while in the Caribbean Premier League he struggled in scoring just 33 runs from seven innings at 4.71.
	In 187 career T20 matches Jayawardene averages 28 at a strike rate of 130, including 28 half-centuries and two centuries.
	"He's a world class player and a quality person and we're not too concerned about his stats at the moment. We informed the squad and everyone is pretty excited about having him on board. We're sure he'll contribute in many ways as well as runs," Hamilton said.
	The deal was six weeks in the making and was assisted by the Stags' sponsorship from the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology. Jayawardene will also undertake promotional work for the NMIT which has links with a Sri Lankan university.
	"If we were going to go for an overseas player it needed to be someone who was going to add value to the team and the culture, and a big enough name to help us attract some commercial interest," Hamilton said.
	New Zealand Cricket will also be relieved the Super Smash has a genuine star name, in the absence of Black Caps test players who take on Australia throughout November, then return home for the first test against Sri Lanka during finals weekend from December 11-13.
	The Super Smash already had some gloss removed with the scrapping of the lucrative Champions League which was a huge incentive for the six teams. It also made it tougher for major associations to attract imports without that lure, and made them weigh up whether it was worth the expense of a big name signing without the potential financial rewards.(Stuff)

	Several Opposition MPs today urged the government to hold a referendum to implement the UNHRC recommendations including a Hybrid Court to investigate war crimes allegations in Sri Lanka.
	United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Wimal Weerawansa said if the UNHRC approves the resolution, Sri Lankans should have the liberty to decide if they want any foreign involvement in solving internal issues.
	If the people feel they are fine with the UNHRC recommendations and a court with foreign judges and investigators to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, then the government can go ahead with the proposals. We also request the people to urge their MPs to vote against an Act to be tabled in parliament asking for the approval of the UN recomendations, he told a news conference.
	Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila said they were considering seeking legal advice on challenging the UN report in the Supreme Court.
	MP Dinesh Gunawardane urged the government to pull back from co-sponsoring the US backed resolution on Sri Lanka and said if not the sovereignty and integrity of the country would be severely damaged.
	Co-sponsoring a resolution is similar to writing ones own death certificate and is a bad precedent to other countries. This move has also put our allies in a difficult situation, he said.
	MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the government decision to back the US-led resolution was a betrayal similar to the 1815 agreement signed with the British. We all know the nature of the US. They just want to get closer to their prey, he said.(Lahiru Pothmulla)WATCH

There are four well-known siblings, all products of a leading school in the city. They all shone in the gentlemans game before taking to the game where even gentlemen eventually turn ungentlemanly.
The foursome took four separate ways to politics. They entered the fray at the last general poll and two of them made it to Diyawanna. Of them one is a Ministerial one and the other one a back-bencher, a comedown for him from a high office.
A ceremony was held the other day at the school where the foursome studied to felicitate an illustrious coach of the gentlemans game and the mother of the four siblings, a former teacher of the same school too attended this ceremony.
The four siblings seated next to each other in the same row in the audience were the cynosure of all eyes at this ceremony. O! Not for the reason you may have immediately guessed!
The four siblings were looking straight even without making a casual glance sideways. Right from the start of the function up to its conclusion not a word or a smile passed between them either!

There were two powerful secretarial ones during the previous regime, who often came in for flak from opposition political quarters, for their alleged involvement in sleaze.
One of these secretarial ones returned to the country recently ending his self-exile. He is said to be the proud owner of several valuable properties in Down Under including three mansions. When he was in office under the previous regime, he had wielded such power and energy that even his Ministerial one had to seriously consider leaving the government.
This white collar one is said to be now planning to find his way into a powerful position in the yahapalanaya. He is, of course, encouraged by his one-time pals now ensconced in the regime thanks to the national unity formula. However, there is a big obstacle in his way; the Ministerial one whom he disdained once, has now become a power to be reckoned with!
The other white collar one looking for a place on the gravy train in yahapalanya is a former Secretarial one who was involved in sleaze in the road sector. The prospects of this one are very bright for his patron saint is none other than a businessman-sibling from a family that has now attained royal status, they say.

This new Ministerial one held a similar post in the previous regime as well. The very day he assumed duties, he had ordered the head of his private staff to arrange his lunch at the Ministry itself.
He had also given the aides the menu for his lunch and ordered that in addition to the other delicacies, there should be a Tebu-leaf sambol as a must. The Ministerial one, a diabetic, had decided to take Tebu-leaf, which is said to be an effective herbal medicine for the disease as part of his mid-day meal, they say.
One day it was raining cats and dogs and the aides were not able to find Tebu leaves for the routine sambol for their boss.
The Ministerial one who sat down to lunch that day quickly noticed that the Tebu-leaf sambol dish was missing from the table laid out for him. And that got his goat. Disdaining the excuse his aides gave him, the Ministerial one raved at them for neglecting their duty, they say. The personal aides knew that incurring the wrath of the Ministerial one could lead to even loss of their jobs and they hit upon a plan to ensure an uninterrupted supply of Tebu leaves -- to raise a Tebu crop in the Ministry premises!

According to the Ministry employees the vehicle he took away was the one reserved for the Deputy Ministerial one and the young man had been very rude to the security men when they protested against the brash act.
The Ministerial brat had later used choicy words on the Deputy when the latter faulted him for forcibly removing the vehicle.
Angered by the brats rude response, the Deputy too had resorted to a  tit-for-tat action: he had taken away about a dozen of the vehicles from the Ministry vehicle park.
When the authorities concerned had inquired from the Deputy why he took away vehicles from the Ministry fleet for no apparent reason, the latter had in a sharp rejoinder asked why they did not question the Ministerial one when about one and a half dozen of vehicles were taken away from the fleet on his instructions.
By the way, the other brat of the Ministerial one, now a Diyawanna member also has already made a name for his bellicosity, they say.
