Technology allows cows' weights to be monitored from space

AUSTRALIA: Australian farmers managing cattle stations as large as some European nations will soon be able to monitor their cows and pastures from space as part of "groundbreaking" technology, scientists say.
The technology, developed with government and private funding, taps into a satellite passing overhead to record the weights of herds daily while monitoring pasture conditions -- a task traditionally impossible due to the stations' vast sizes and harsh, remote locations. Some stations, such as Newcastle Waters in the Northern Territory, span 10,000 square kilometres (3,861 square miles) -- an area larger than Cyprus -- and home to 55,000 cattle.
Australia is one of the world's largest beef exporters.
"There's just a huge labour component and time that goes into collecting that data (of weight and pastoral conditions), which is essentially why producers don't do it on a more regular basis," Sally Leigo from the Northern Territory's primary industry department, the project's research leader, told AFP Thursday.
On average, cattle are only weighed 1.5 times a year and only two percent of pasture is regularly viewed, the Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation, the private-public funded organisation that developed the tool, estimates. - AFP
