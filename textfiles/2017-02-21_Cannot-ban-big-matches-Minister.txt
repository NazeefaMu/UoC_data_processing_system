Cannot ban big matches: Minister


	

In response to the call made by a group of Buddhist monks to ban school big matches, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam today said they cannot do so.

The Minister said the call was not new and there had been requests in the past as well to ban big matches.

“We can’t ban school big matches. It is not a practical move to tackle students’ undisciplined actions,” he told the Daily Mirror.

However, the minister said they have had a discussion with school Principals recently to take preventive measures to tackle possible violent incidents among students during the impending school sports season.

Minister Kariyawasam said they have given instructions to law enforcement authorities including the Police Chief to take action to minimize incidents which cause public nuisance during the big matches. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
