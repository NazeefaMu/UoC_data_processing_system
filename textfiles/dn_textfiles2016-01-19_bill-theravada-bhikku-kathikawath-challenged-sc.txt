Bill of Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath challenged in SC

A Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015 was filed before Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
This Special Determination petition was filed by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) Shasanika Secretary Biyagama Suseela Thero of the Sri Bodhi Vihara Pirivena in Udahamulla, Nugegoda.
The petitioner stated that a Bill titled Theravada Bhikku Kathikawath (Registration) Act No. 2015 was published by way of a Gazette Notification on December 14, 2015, on the orders of the Buddha Sasana Minister.He stated that on January 12, 2016, the said Bill was placed on the order paper of Parliament.
The petitioner stated that clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16 are in violation of Articles 3, 4 (c) and (d), 9, 10, 11, 12 (1), 12 (2), 14(1)(b), 14(1)(c), 14(1)(e), 27 and 28 of the Constitution.
The petitioner said the Bill applies only to Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition and thereby draws a distinction between Bhikkus of the Mahayana tradition and the Theravada tradition.
He further maintained that the Bill seeks to restrict the rights and freedoms of Bhikkus of the Theravada tradition in the exercise of their freedom of religion and their freedom of association whilst no such restriction is placed on any Bhikku of the Mahayana tradition or the clergy of the Christian or Catholic communities in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner is of the view that the Bill was seeking to restrict the rights of Bhikkus who do not belong to the Shyamopali, Ramagna and Amarapura Maha Nikayas or chapters established under any of the said Nikayas.
Accordingly, the rights of a Bhikku belonging to a chapter or a Nikaya which is not recognised by or not part of any of the said Maha Nikayas are affected by the provisions of the said Bill.
The petitioner maintained that the distinction is drawn in violation of the Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners enshrined in Articles 12 (1) and 12 (2),
(1). Stipulating matters mandatorily need to be included in a kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Thought and Religion.
(2). Appointment of a panel to examine and decide the legality of a kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
(3). Powers vested in the said panel is an exercise of Judicial Power.
(4). Compelling a Nikaya or Chapter to conduct an inquiry for every violation of the provisions of a registered kathikawatha is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
(5). Converting every violation of a decision of the Karaka Sanga Sabava of a chapter or religion to a criminal offence, is a violation of Equality before Law and Freedom of Religion.
(6). Empowering the Minister to frame registration with regard to matters hitherto exercised by the Sangha, is a violation of the Freedom of Religion.
