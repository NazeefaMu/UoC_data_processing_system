Bribery Commission officials today told the Magistrate they were awaiting the Commission's advice on arresting the Narahenpita Police OIC when the Crimes OIC's lawyer told Court that the OIC should also be arrested.
Narahenpita Police Crimes Branch OIC Don Tissa Siri Suagathapala was earlier arrested by Bribery officers on charges of having accepted a bribe of Rs.2.5 million from a suspect, to avoid taking legal action against him in a forgery case, was re-remanded by Colombo Additional Magistrate Nirosha Fernando.
Counsel Gunaratne Wanninayake who appeared for OIC Sugathapala said his client was not involved in this incident and was only following the Narahenpita Police OIC's instruction to collect the money from the suspect, Shantha Loku Bandara.
Counsel said the Narahenpita Police OIC’s name was mentioned in the first complaint made to the Bribery Commission with regard to the soliciting of a bribe of Rs.8 million from Mr. Bandara.
According to the complaint the Police OIC had instructed the Crimes Branch OIC to collect the first installment of Rs.2.5 million by contacting the suspect and as such the Bribery Commission should arrest the Narahenpita OIC as well.
The Bribery Commission officers said they were continuing with the investigations and awaiting the BC advice on arresting the OIC. The case was postponed for December 7. (Shehan Chamika Silva)
