The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in association with the Colombo Stock Brokers’ Association (CSBA) recently launched a series of events presenting investment research on companies featured on the S&P SL 20 Index, to an exclusive audience of local 
institutional investors. 


The first event of the series featured presentations and discussions on John Keells Holdings PLC (JKH), Sampath Bank PLC and Teejay Lanka PLC. Each company’s investment case was presented through a research presentation by a CSE member firm, a presentation on financials and the future growth outlook by a representative of the listed company and a panel discussion. 


Executive Directors Krishan Balendra and Gihan Cooray spoke on behalf of JKH at the event while Sampath Bank was represented by Managing Director Nanda Fernando and Group Finance Director Ranjith Samaranayake. The company presentation and discussion for Teejay Lanka featured Managing Director Sriyan De Silva Wijeyeratne and CFO Salman Nishtar. 


Commenting on the initiative, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike stated, “The CSE is pleased to support the CSBA in reaching out to what is a key segment in our investor base, as part of an initiative to bring together local institutional investors and senior representatives of S&P SL20 companies for an exclusive, investment 
case-focused discussion.” 


CSBA President Ravi Abeysuriya said, “We are delighted with the excellent feedback we have received from the investor community that the presentations by the companies and member firms, similar to a foreign roadshow, were very useful to them and the CSBA hopes to continue this series in the future as well with the auspices of the CSE to showcase other fundamentally sound counters to investors.”


LOLC Securities Chief Manager Research Shehan Bartholomeuz, Bartleet Religare Securities Head of Research Nikita Tissera and Acuity Stockbrokers Research Director Chethana Ellepola presented investment research for JKH, Sampath Bank and Teejay Lanka, respectively.
