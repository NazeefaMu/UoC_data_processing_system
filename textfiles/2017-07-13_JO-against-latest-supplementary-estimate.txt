The joint opposition said it was completely against the supplementary estimate presented to Parliament seeking approval to allocate Rs. 148.8 million to purchase vehicles for several ministers.

The Government presented the supplementary estimate on July 7 seeking funds for the purchase of vehicles for the Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister, Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister, Foreign Affairs Ministry, Law and Order Ministry and a Provincial Governor.

Funds were also sought to renovate official residences of Women and Child Affairs Minister and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister.

Addressing a news briefing on Wednesday, JO Leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardane said they would take measures to prevent the government’s latest move to purchase new vehicles.

“This is not the need of the hour. The government should focus on eradicating the dengue menace across the country and to upgrade the facilities at hospitals. It is time for the government to do away with luxurious lifestyle. We are strongly against this supplementary estimate,” he said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)
