Elections only under a legal Govt: Mano


	

An election may be a way out of the current political deadlock only if a legal government is appointed and the President's authority to dissolve Parliament is clarified, UNF member and Tamil Progressive Front (TPF) Leader Mano Ganesan said yesterday.

He said there was no way that an election could be held under an SLPP-led government.

“An election may be a way out only if these two conditions are met,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
