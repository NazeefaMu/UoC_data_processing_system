Government has decided to introduce a budget pack concept under which packs containing eight essential items will be sold to people at a subsidized price.

This decision was made at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attended by Ministers Risath Bathiudeen and Mangala Samaraweera, with the participation of representatives of several government and private sector institutions.

Budget packs will be sold by Sathosa outlets islandwide. A decision was also made to introduce the concept of ‘Fair Price Shops’ to sell essential items during the festive season. A statement from the Prime Minister’s office announced that the private sector has been asked to play an active role with the setting up of these fair price shops. It was also announced that as an incentive to the private sector concessions on the payment of electricity bills will be offered to them for being part of the fair price concept which aims to make essential items affordable to the public.
