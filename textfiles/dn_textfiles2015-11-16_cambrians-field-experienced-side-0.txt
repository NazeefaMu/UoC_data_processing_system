Cambrians field an experienced side

Prince of Wales' College, Moratuwa with a long history in school cricket for 119 years has produced several cricketers who have excelled in various forms of Cricket.
This year their team is captained by Thilan Nimesh a fifth year Coloursmen and a Sri Lanka Schools under 19 cricketer. His deputy is a third year player Vihanga Weerakkody. This year their team consists of eight players who have played in last year's big match against St. Sebastian's College. Except for Nimesh and Weerakkody six other players are playing for the second year.
Their batting is opened by Sandun Soysa and Sanoj Dharshika while the new ball will be shared by Avindu Fernando and Danushka Kumara. The wicket keeper of the side is Vishva Chaturanga.
So far they have played six inter-school matches and recorded an outright victory against Dharmapala Vidyalaya and they have registered a first innings win over Thurstan College. They lost on first innings to Maris Stella, S. Thomas. Mount Lavinia, Mahanama College and the game with Mahinda College ended in a no derision.
None of their batsman could enter three figures and only three half centuries were recorded by Avindu Fernando unbeaten on 63 versus Maris Stella, Sandun Soysa 68 against Mahinda College and Sanoj Danushka missed a well deserved century by three runs against Mahanama College.
In the bowling department Skipper Thilan Nimash claimed 5 for 85 versus St. Thomas and Savindu Peiris 7 for 106 with Mahanama and a match bag of 10 for 117 runs.
Cambrians are down to play sixteen matches this season excluding the big match versus Sebs. This year too they are coached by former Cambrian Kushan Jayawickrama and his assistant is another Cambrian Kalpa Fernando. Nadith Jayaweera and Kasun Wckramathilleke are the Prefect of Games and Master in Charge respectively. The principal J.W.S. Siriwardena is extending his fullest cooperation to keep this noble game alive in the school.
