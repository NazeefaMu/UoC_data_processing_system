Janashakthi Insurance PLC announced that the Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) qualifiers from its life insurance sales team attended the prestigious MDRT Conference that was held in Florida, USA, recently. 
Surpassing the record numbers it had set in 2016, the insurer had recorded its largest ever contingent of MDRT qualifiers in 2017.
The MDRT membership is recognized internationally as the standard of excellence in the life insurance and financial services business. The MDRT members, therefore, are perceived as individuals who demonstrate exceptional professional knowledge, strict ethical conduct and outstanding client service. 
Founded in 1927, the MDRT, The Premier Association of Financial Professionals, is a global, independent association of more than 43,000 of the world’s leading life insurance and financial services professionals from more than 500 companies in 67 countries. 
The 18 MDRT qualifiers from Janashakthi were selected based on their performance in 2016 as well as their overall adherence to the association’s strict ethical standards. Significantly, Ruwan Kumara from Janashakthi’s Hatton branch was awarded the MDRT Life Membership for having qualified for MDRT membership 13 years in a row whilst Sadun Jayawardhane from the Havelock branch was accorded the MDRT’s Court of the Table membership.
“At Janashakthi, we strongly believe that our team of world-class insurance professionals is the primary drivers of our steady growth over the years. We have been conscious of this right from our inception and, hence, have always focused on nurturing their talent through continued investments in their learning and development,” said Janashakthi Insurance PLC Chief Executive Officer/Director Stuart Chapman.
“Therefore, we are delighted to see even more members of our team qualify for the coveted Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) membership this year. This is yet another testament of their commitment towards helping us realize our vision of lighting the lamp of insurance in every home and workplace.”
The team from Janashakthi had the opportunity to be inspired by some of the world’s best minds in the insurance sector at the MDRT Conference. They also showcased Janashakthi’s best practices and innovations to the insurance sector’s star performers from around the world and learnt about the dynamics of the diverse markets being represented at the forum.
Janashakthi Insurance PLC, founded in 1994, made its mark in the industry as an innovator and household name over a span of two decades. As an organisation that thrives to deliver excellence in customer service by addressing the insurance needs of its customer base, Janashakthi has an islandwide branch network of 113 branches, a 24-hour call centre and around the clock assessor service.
