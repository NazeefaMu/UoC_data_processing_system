There is a senior politico who is quite outspoken about his hope and ambition to be the next Number Two when the yahapalanaya falls which he says is a cinch. 

 


The politico is said to be often telling his intimates these days, “Be patient for a little while. I’ll be in a position soon to look after you all much better!”


The aides close to the politico say that their boss is going about his work in an unusual buoyant spirit these days like one just about to achieve his goal in life. 


The politico would often tell those around him that he had closely moved with a number of leaders in the country and given his seniority and experience he is the most qualified person to be the country’s Number Two.
