The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) has created a sense of anticipation by announcing the National Sales Congress (NASCO) 2018. As the premier event dedicated to recognize the efforts and performance of sales personnel, NASCO is eagerly awaited by Sri Lanka’s corporate community as it is the only national level event to recognize and reward the performances of the sales force in the country. 

NASCO has repeated success year after year, with 110 companies from 22 industries taking part in the previous year’s edition of NASCO, counting 550 entries in total.

Although the official entry kits for NASCO 2018 are yet to be released, SLIM has revealed that participants can look forward to some exciting changes to the format. A new category has been added above the Territory Manager category while the judging process has been changed according to the current context. A reclassification has also been done of Industry and Business categories. 

As the National Body for Marketing, SLIM has been at the forefront of fostering marketing knowledge and best practices in the country. Organized for the 18th consecutive year, NASCO awards are being presented in 15 diverse business sectors under the Senior Manager, territory manager, sales executive/ sales supervisor and front-liner categories. In addition to Gold, Silver and Bronze awards, best female sales personnel are also recognised under each category.

SLIM NASCO committed to instil the importance and recognition in the sales profession. A national level competition with participation from different industries has continuously improved the standard of the individuals. Hence, this competition has made a positive impact on the corporate sector. The sectors for nominations are: Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), Financial Services & Banking, Industrial, Media, Consumer Durables, Telecommunication, Fashion & Clothing, Healthcare, Modern Retail, Travel & Leisure, Insurance, Alcohol & Tobacco, and Corporate Selling.
