Court orders arrest of Nethicumara if attempts to leave country


	

The Fort Magistrate's Court today ordered the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to prevent Shanil Nethicumara - who had allegedly threatened Anika Wijesuriya, a witness in the Treasury bond investigations - from leaving the country .

The Fort Magistrate made this direction considering a motion filed by the CID seeking an order to prevent the suspect Shanil Nethicumara from leaving the country in an illegal manner.

They told the Magistrate that they had asked Shanil to appear before the CID to record his statement for allegedly threatening witness Anika of the Treasury bond investigation.

However, the suspect is reportedly absconding the CID and attempting to go overseas. They said the Court had already restrained the suspect from leaving the country.

Hence the Magistrate made the order on the Controller of Immigration and Emigration. The Supreme Court earlier dismissed the Fundamental Rights Petition filed by Shanil Nethicumara seeking an order preventing an imminent arrest for threatening Anika Wijesuriya, who had rented out a penthouse at Monarch Residencies to former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his family.
