MasterCard partnered with Singapore Airlines to provide exciting offers to Business Class travellers. 
As part of the collaboration, the cardholders will receive up to 10 percent savings when booking Business Class return air tickets to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok and Hong Kong on their MasterCard World, Platinum and Titanium cards. The four Asian cities are amongst the top 10 international travel destinations in the annual MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index released recently. Tickets must be purchased by June 15, 2015 and are valid for travel from now until August 31, 2015.
“We are delighted to partner with MasterCard on this exciting promotion that brings great value to our passengers. We believe that this will give them yet another reason to experience our award-winning services,” said Singapore Airlines General Manager Sri Lanka Richard Kwee.
“As more Sri Lankans travel abroad for both business and leisure, we are excited to partner with Singapore Airlines and offer these savings on their MasterCard World, Platinum and Titanium cards. We hope that our cardholders will take advantage of this offer and enjoy the privileges that come along by using their MasterCard cards,” said MasterCard Country Manager Sri Lanka and Maldives R.B. Santosh Kumar.
