Waiting for the green light


	



 

A group of front-liners of a main political party recently paid a courtesy call on a onetime party stalwart whose miscalculated somersault saw him in hot water first and in political wilderness soon afterwards..

 


Diyawanna members from the Central, Wayamba and Western provinces who comprised the group had apprised the former colleague of the issues currently troubling the party and invited him to re-join the party letting bygones be bygone. 


The former stalwart had readily accepted the invitation, but the Green light from the party leadership is yet to come, they say.
