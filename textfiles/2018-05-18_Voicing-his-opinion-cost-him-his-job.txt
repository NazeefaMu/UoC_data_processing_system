Voicing his opinion cost him his job


	



 

A leading political authority sacked a white-collar high-up handling development projects for expressing his opinion that a monetary allocation made for funding certain projects in a backward district is unreasonably excessive, they say.

 


The high political authority had set apart only Rs.7 billion to develop a main city with many shortcomings while allocating more than twice that amount for the development projects in the backward district. The white-collar high-up had pointed out that it was not advisable to put up in the backward district the type of massive infrastructures suited for an urban population as the overhead costs for their maintenance alone would become an unwieldly expenditure.


Affronted by the opinion expressed by the white-collar high-up, the high political authority had angrily retorted: “Follow orders or get out”.
