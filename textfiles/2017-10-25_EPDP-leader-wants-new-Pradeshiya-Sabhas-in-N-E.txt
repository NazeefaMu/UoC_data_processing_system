EPDP leader wants new Pradeshiya Sabhas in N-E


	

Amid calls for early local government elections, EPDP leader and MP, Douglas Devananda requested Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday to set up new pradeshiya sabhas and upgrade the status of many other existing local authorities in the North.

He said he was making this request in the context of the government deciding to set up new local authorities in the Nuwara-Eliya district.

In his letter to the Prime Minister and copied to Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha, Mr. Devananda said the absence of pradeshiya sabhas in the four divisional secretariats of Maruthankeni (Jaffna District), Kandawalai (Kilinochchi District), Oddichuddan (Mullaitivu District) and Madhu (Mannar District) had hampered the day to day work connected to public markets, solid waste collection and disposal and the provision of other facilities to the people

“I request to give urban council status to the towns such as Killinochchi, Mullaitivu, Manipay, Chunnakam, Chankanai and Nelliady. You are aware that the Killinochchi town is a big urban area stretching nearly four kilometres from Paranthan to Murukandi on A9 and it is administered by the Karachchi Pradesiya Sabha which does not have the necessary capacity to attend to the Kilinochchi urban requirements. Karachchi Pradesha Sabha is also administering Kandawala DS area. It is a matter of fact that the Killinochchi town had enjoyed town council status prior to 1991,” his letter to the Premier said.

Mullaitivu town is also the main administrative centre for the whole district and had enjoyed town council status prior to 1991. The absence of urban council status is greatly affecting the development and service provisions of the people.

Besides, he asked for upgrading of the Vavuniya Urban Council to the status of Municipal Council.

He asked the Prime Minister to consider upgrading Trincomalee to a Municipal Council and Chenkalady, Kaluwanchikudi, Kinniya and Mutur to urban councils in the Eastern Province.

“Koralaipattu Central and Koralaipattu (Valaichchenai) divisional secretariats in the Batticoloa districts are without separate Pradeshiya Sabhas. The absence of separate pradeshiya sabhas has been affecting the day to day local government functions of the two divisions. Please create Pradeshiya Shabas for the above two divisions,” Mr. Devananda said. (Kelum Bandara)
