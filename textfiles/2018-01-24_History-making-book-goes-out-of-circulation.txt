History-making book goes out of circulation


	



 

The JO stalwarts are said to be combing the book shops and libraries in the country in search of a certain book. They are keen on laying their hands on the book at least a minute before the start of the debate on the bond affair in Diyawanna council. 

 


The author of this book is a young gabby politico – a state purohita to boot. He has already gone into the country’s political history as the one who wrote a book to whitewash the biggest ever politically-associated fraud in the country’s recent history – the Treasury bond scam. 


By the way, he also figures among the infamous ‘footnote’ clique that made a ludicrous attempt to push the sordid affair under the carpet. 


The JO search team has so far failed to unearth even a single copy of this book which has suddenly disappeared from all bookshops.
