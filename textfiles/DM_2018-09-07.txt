A glimpse into the life of Ven. Fr. Francis
	

After his priestly ordination on July 21, 1878, he was sent to Rome by his bishop where he studied Syrian, Armenian, Coptic, Arabic,Hebrew and Greek
	
	Fr. Francis Mary managed to gather around himself many spiritual sons and daughters

The history and spiritual heritage of the Sisters of the Divine Saviour is closely linked to that of the Society of the Divine Saviour Founded by Venerable Fr. Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan (John Baptist Jordan) in 1888, in Tivoli, Italy. Together with him Blessed Mary of the Apostles (Maria Theresa von Wullenweber) founded the Sisters Congregation seven years after the establishment of the Society of the Divine Saviour (Salvatorian Fathers). 
Birth of Cross Jordan
The Servant of God, Francis Mary of the Cross Jordan, was born on June 16, 1848, into a poor family in the village of Gurtweil near Walds hut in Baden, Germany. The son of Lorenz and Nothburga, he was the second of three brothers. The next day he was baptised and given the name John Baptist. Around the age of 13 he received his First Holy Communion. The loss of his father at the age of 15 reinforced even more his spiritual life. 
After his priestly ordination on July 21, 1878, he was sent to Rome by his bishop where he studied Syrian, Armenian, Coptic, Arabic,Hebrew and Greek. He also visited the Holy Land and Lebanon, during which, he was deeply moved by the words of the Gospel, This is eternal life, to know You the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent(John 17:3), he grew increasingly certain that he was being called to found an apostolic movement. 
Fr. Francis Mary managed to gather around himself many spiritual sons and daughters. He wanted his motherhouse in Rome to be a School for Apostles-who would later form many new apostles. In 1893, he gave his religious communities the names Society of the Divine Savior and Congregation of the Sisters of the Divine Savior. In 1915 the First World War forced the Generalate to relocate to neutral Switzerland, and in accord with the decision of the third General Chapter, Fr. Jordan transferred the administration of the Society to his future successor, Fr. Pancratius Pfeiffer. After a serious illness Fr. Jordan died on September 8, 1918, in a humble hospice for the aged in Tafers near Freiburg in Switzerland. 
Role model
He is the model of an apostle and a missionary, filled with the zeal to lead all to Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. In his universal vision of the apostolate he wanted not only to promote a renewal of the faith of those who believe, but also at the same time to promote the first and new evangelization. In all areas of life and culture he wanted to proclaim Christ and to give witness using all ways and means the love of Christ inspires. 
His adult character begins to emerge: diligent, focused, and single-minded. We have also caught glimpses of his future spirituality: hunger for personal holiness, zeal for souls, universality, and trust in Divine Providence. Slowly but surely a vision was forming in Jordans heart: to save soulsall soulseverywherein the zealous spirit of the apostles. The next steps, his relocation to Rome and his journey to the Middle East, would be decisive for the young Founder.

The purpose of this society
The purpose of this society is, with divine grace, to care not only for personal salvation, but by the same grace, all over the world, where the greater glory of God demands it, to follow the command of Our Lord Jesus Christ: Go forth and teach all nations. That demands, by teaching and education, by instruction in word and print, being engaged even to the point of exhaustion so every intelligent creature will increasingly know the true God and the one He has sent, Jesus Christ, and that he will live a holy life and save his soul. 
Jordan laid out for Lthen and Mother Mary a breathtaking vision of the apostolic work to be done: that all people everywhere come to know the one true God and Jesus Christ whom God had sent; that the one true church be strengthened, defended and spread throughout the world; that we achieve our own salvation and the salvation of many souls; and that we enlist the talents of all, clergy and laity, in this one great effort to the glory of God. This remains even today the common mission of all who call themselves Salvatorians. 

Salvatorian Sisters
Salvatorian Sisters with the zeal of their beloved founder arrived in Sri Lanka in 1954. Today fulfilling the vision of their beloved founder giving hope and life to the people in the periphery they are serving in seven dioceses. Salvatorian Sisters from Sri Lanka are serving in Pakistan, Jordan and Emmaus. Salvatorian Fathers arrived in Sri Lanka in 2005 and serving in two dioceses Chilaw and Jaffna. The Lay Salvatorian Committed members are widely spread especially where the Salvatorians are present and actively participate in the apostolic commitment according to their state of life. 
In conclusion, we must again review Jordans life and accomplishments, and examine more closely the relationship among the pillars of his apostolic spirituality: obedience, poverty, suffering, prayer, and reliance on Divine Providence.

Ayurvedic cure for premature grey hair
	

Having had a few grey strands of hair is a common experience for most of us, at some point in our lives. Ageing is a natural process for human beings, but seeing grey hair gives us the feeling that world would end. Grey strand of hair play hide and seek during adolescence. Grey is the dreaded sign of ageing. Researches have revealed that prematurely greying hair is becoming more common among the younger generation. Thousands of people are seeking medication for the untimely greying or falling off of hair. 
Traditional Ayurvedic Practitioner Ranjith Abeywardhana commented on this rapidly spreading condition. 
The colour of each hair strand depends on the pigment called melanin. The natural colour of hair depends on the distribution, type and the amount of melanin in the middle layer of the hair shaft.
Melanin production reduces with age and the whitening or greying occurs. In Ayurveda, the cause for a disease is treated and therefore most of the treatments are directed towards controlling the greying of hair. Not only the treatments, but avoiding certain food and following instructions on maintaining a suitable lifestyle are a must if the individual hopes to receive Ayurvedic treatment for a disease or a health condition. 
Such cases were rare during past generations, usually, their first grey hairs appeared during old age as a result of natural ageing which started when they were in their 60s. Nowadays the youngsters are frequent victims of grey hair and this condition is more common among school children. Some students soak their feet in water to avoid being sleepy while studying at night which in turn fuels the process of hair turning grey. Many male students use styling creams and hair gels daily. These products are made from byproducts of Petroleum. Using such products for an extended period of time could cause a threat to overall health. Applying water to the hair and expecting it to shine is a sure sign that the person is going to have grey hair sooner or later. 

Genetics
Genetics play a huge role in premature greying of hair, especially if parents have experienced it. Children of such parents are exposed to the possibility of having the same experience. Occasionally, the condition is inherited by the genes of a generation rather than from the parents. Premature greying of hair is known by the term Akala Palitha in Ayurveda, meaning an untimely maturity of hair. 

Diseases
Victims of Catarrh (Peenasa) could develop premature hair at any age. Excessive hair fall indicates an increased level of phlegm in the body. This is known as kapa in Ayurveda. A well  balanced level of kapa Dhaathu improves bodily functions while the decreased level becomes a weakness or a Dosha. Raktha waathaya or the Rath pith rogaya (Extreme dryness, eczema, and other skin conditions, cracked hands and feet, endless itching and unhealable wounds are a few symptoms of Rath pith rogaya) is yet another cause for premature greying of hair. Treating raktha waathaya without consulting a good Ayurvedic physician will result in unfavourable conditions such as premature greying, asthma and severe headaches. Continuous treatment is a must for Rath Pith Rogaya since stopping treatment halfway complicates the condition. 

Unhealthy lifestyle
The second most critical cause for premature greying is the unhealthy lifestyle. Avoid untimely showers including night showers as much as possible. Night showers are harmful to women than men due to their long and thick hair that takes time to dry. Night showers cool down the scalp which in turn weakens hair strands; resulting it to fall. The ones belonging to the young generations are consuming unhealthy and genetically treated or artificially flavoured food much more than their elders and this treats the tongue, but does not provide any nourishment. They are not worried about the nutritional value of the food they consume and become victims of many Shiro roga (diseases affecting head) he said. 
Other significant causes are: Excessive anger, starving for longer periods, working in dusty or highly temperate environments, sleeplessness, waking up unnecessarily early in the morning and using hair gels, styling creams excessively.
An ayurvedic physician will prescribe the treatment after a thorough examination of the condition. People have different conditions in their bodies, therefore the medications vary and there is no cure for all treatment. 
			          Tips to follow         
			
			Treat hair with these natural ingredients- 
			Crush Weralu (Ceylon Olive) leaves, Guava leaves together or separately, and apply 15 minutes before a bath. Massage the paste well into scalp. 
				Crush Godapara/Diyapara (Elephant Apple fruit) and apply on the wet scalp or boil the fruit in water for about 30 minutes, let it cool and then apply to scalp and massage well. 
				Boil Aralu (Terminalia chebula), Bulu or Myrobalan (Terminalia bellirica) and Nelli (Indian Gooseberry), the raw fruit together (this is called Thriphala in Ayurveda) wash hair and scalp with this mixture and massage. 
				Boil a few limes and a handful of Uluhaal (Fenugreek) seeds, let them cool and apply to scalp and massage. 
				Apply Thala oil (Gingelly oil) or Olive oil an hour before the bath and massage well. 
				Avoid heaty food like Balaya (Skipjack Tuna), Cuttlefish, prawns, pineapples and tomatoes. 
				Avoid eggs and fresh milk (for excessive phlegm) 
				Avoid every type of meat (especially during treatment) 
				Consume Calcium rich food to strengthen hair strands  Green leaves (green leaves that are not fertilized or grown without pesticides), Red rice, Chickpea, Black Eyed Pea and Mung beans (Green Gram) and Kurakkan (Finger Millet) frequently. Add local rice varieties such as Madathavalu, Kurulu Thuda and Pachcha Perumal to the daily diet - those provide nutrition to the body and hair. 
			
		Oiling hair the right way
These Ayurvedic oils are good for healthy individuals to avoid having grey hair. Oiling the hair at night is inadvisable for the patients who are frequently suffering from excessive phlegm. Limit applying oil to three days per week. Asthma patients are thoroughly advised not to apply oil (due to cooling effects). 
Frequent oiling early in the morning or later at night, on cold and rainy days are unadvisable even for healthy individuals because the extra coolness may provoke other illnesses. Some individuals apply oil during unfavourable times after adding Lime juice or camphor to remove Waatha doshaya in oil, but that is regarded as an unsuccessful attempt. Anyway, avoid oiling hair or the scalp at night. An ayurvedic practitioner will decide whether some oils are good to apply after heating because heated oil can spread other diseases. Do not apply oil before sleeping because it might trigger other diseases which are dormant. 
Ayruvedic Hair Oils:Bhringamalaka Oil Maha peenas raja Oil Akalapalitha Oil Neelyadi Oil

Individuals with prematurely grey hair are advised to have shower in the morning, but after sunrise. Do not have showers after 5.30 PM. Follow the instructions of a qualified Ayurvedic physician and get rid of premature grey hair he concluded.

Ayurvedic spas mushrooming  in Ja-Ela
	

The leaders of all religions have failed to educate the islands children about these evils
Under the pretext of providing Ayurveda Panchakarma or the five-fold treatment, a new concept is now developing in the society in which the age-old traditional Ayurveda treatment is abhorred and the so called spas are mushrooming all over the country. 
According to reports the majority of these spas are widespread in the Ja-Ela Divisional Secretary area in the Gampaha District. This fast growing social evil was the subject of discussion at the Jaela coordinating committee meeting, during which its co-chairmen Joseph Michael Perera and Felix Perera both made comments. They opined that before the youth of the area fall victim to this social evil stern steps should be taken against these institutions. 
During our investigations we found that in the Ja-Ela area a very large number of these spas operate 24-hours a day. Some spas however are kept open only during the day. A massage lasting 45 minutes and costs between Rs1000-1200. At the entrance to these spas an assortment of herbal oils, roots of trees and ointments in various forms are displayed. These products come with the certification of an Ayurvedic doctor who is never present at the site. At some places a person posing as an Ayurvedic doctor can be seen reading a book or glancing over the pages of a newspaper. He doesnt care to raise his head and look at the customer who seeks treatment at the massage parlour. Sometime he can be seen speaking with some touts. These parlours are patronised by men only and their ages range from 15 to 70 years. 
It is usual for a patient seeking treatment at a medical clinic to be examined by an Ayurvedic doctor after which a diagnosis card is prepared with the type of treatment recommended. Afterwards the patient is given a date to return to the doctor. Such practices are unheard of here. Instead the person, pretending to be the doctor-in-charge, after speaking to the touts, would ring the bell, lying on the table, and summon the women therapists. A group of women in the age group of 18 to 50 years then would present themselves before the customer. The selection follows with the exchange of notes and the customer is led to a room. What happens next is left to the imagination of the reader. In reality no ayurvedic treatment is administered on the customer. What happens inside these rooms is something that goes beyond the imagination of a person who upholds cultural values. 
Some officials fear that in the event of them taking actions against these spas, they would have to face Human Rights issues. 
There is also a group who closely coordinates the affairs at these places. The main job of the members of this group is to find women who are prepared to work at these places. Some of them are drivers of three wheeled vehicles who transport customers to them. There are others who boast of their political affiliations and obtain ransom from the owners. 
The Prelate of the Ekala Sri Dharmodaya Buddhist Centre, Ven Balagalle Dammaseeha Thera, who opined that the Ja-Ela area being a complex city is visited by youth from various parts of the country.
The monk said that there are foreigners too who are boarded in Ja_Ela. These factors have contributed towards the city becoming an area with so many social evils. The leaders of all religions have failed to educate the islands children about these evils. Children of grades 10 and 11 are getting drifted away from religious education. Avoiding Sunday School sessions, they are now eager to attend private tuition classes. The private tuition teachers should be held fully responsible for this situation. We are finding difficulty in communicating with the children. Even at the Ja-Ela Coordinating Committee there had been diverse views. No one can shun responsibility saying that the laws are inadequate. If it is so they can bring in new legislation to arrest this situation. 

Sinful acts
Similar sentiments were expressed by Rev. Priya Jayamanne the Parish Priest of the Ja-Ela Church of the Mother of Sorrows, who referred to these places as semi brothel houses. He said that it is a fact that the women serving at these places are committing sinful acts. Physiotherapy is good and it should be done by a competent person, but what happens here is a complete different type of action.
The children should be motivated not to fall prey to these evils; they should be educated on the destruction that could be caused to their personality. The officials are solely responsible. The police should be more vigilant. The laws should not be bent or twisted in order to save the culprits. Running of brothels is against the laws of our country. We have reason to believe that some of these officials too patronise these places and because of that they are unable to cancel their licences. 
Ja-Ela Urban Council Member Namal Suranga speaking to the Daily Mirror said that these institutions had obtained trade licenses. The authorities who are responsible for issuing these licenses should have been more careful.

Some officials fear that in the event of them taking actions against these spas, they would have to face Human Rights issues

The women who serve in these Spas do not receive any salary but depend on the tips given to them by patrons. These women come from faraway places having told their families that they are well-employed. Some of them have left their husbands and have sought employment here. With the earnings they are supporting their families and some even have to provide for the needs of their husbands who are drug addicts. They are not willing to leave this lucrative job as their daily earnings are in the region of Rs 5000-10,000.There are certain people, who have political clout, and earn by the way taking ransoms from these spas. Some obtain sponsorships for various sports activities like cycle races, new year festivals and other cultural activities from these joints. In the recent past there was an instance where a PC member of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna had invited those employed at spas to his home and given instructions on how these joints should function. 

Students visit in the night
A senior school principal Rukman Pinto had this to say about these Spas which are rapidly growing in the Ja-Ela area. There is a remarkable trend in youth and students in the area who are getting lured by these spas, located at every 50 meters from each other. They have been located in close proximity to schools, temples and churches. I have observed students visiting these places in the night. It is a tragedy. It is my opinion that to commence this type of activity they have to obtain the approval of the District Medical Officer, Public Health Inspector, Police, Grama Niladhari of the division and also of the Local Government body. Without the recommendation of these individuals they cannot obtain the license from the Commissioner of Ayurveda. The Ayurveda Medical officers, who issue these licenses, appears to be unmindful of conducting any investigation or being observant of them. It is suspected that a portion of the huge income these Spas earn fill the pockets of these authorities who allow them to operate without restrictions. They appear to be more eager to conduct raids on small hotels, mini shops and hold conferences for the media. Their silence regarding the operations of these spas leads to much suspicions about what is happening behind the scene. 
The Divisional Secretary of Ja-Ela, S.B. Jayasundera, who expressed his views on spas, blamed the Ministry of Indigenous Medicinefor issuing licenses to these institutes without adhering to the requirements. This has led to all these issues. Complaints have been lodged with the police to raid these places and to check on all unauthorised spas and also take those who operate them into custody. He also asserted that as far as he knew there was only one Spa in the Ja-Ela town that has come forward to register itself. 
It is well-known that the police conducts raids now and then and produces suspects in courts, but they are able to obtain bail on the same day and they are back in business the next day as usual.

Back to usual: Tamil nationalism say no to development
	

Earlier the chief minister demanded that the TNA boycott the Presidential Task force for Northern development
	
	Tamil nationalism defined itself along the line of a distinctive nation, a Tamil homeland and right to selfdetermination
	
	The country should not let a repetition of its violent past, irrespective all good intentions of political correctness

Last week, protesters in Mullaitivu demanded the termination of a Mahaweli project, that was officially intended to facilitate the economic development in the war ravaged region.
Their main demand as explained in a petition handed over to the government agent was: considering the benefits, dis-benefits, challenges and the complication of the Mahaweli project in the North, we are compelled to request you to immediately stop the Mahaweli project in Mullaitivu district and proposed plans in the Northern province.
The protesters alleged the Mahaweli L zone, an offshoot of Sri Lankas largest development project, of Sinhala colonization of the area, and the Archaeological Department of manipulating the history and violating Tamils cultural heritage.
It has always been a rather tricky task to weed out fiction from facts in Tamil political grievances. Though any community may harbour a good deal of imaginary grievances, Tamils have a unique problem: Tamil political psyche is rooted in Tamil exceptionalism, identified as unique cultural, linguistic, historical legacy and in part the perceived superiority of Dravidian civilization. Rather than being absorbed into a larger amalgam of identities, which may often operate under one dominant state identity, Tamil political leadership on both sides of the Palk Straits preferred to play alone. India through its quasi federal constitution and assortment of other measures, managed to appease Tamil exceptionalism to some extent, but Sri Lanka could not, partly because, the very existence of Tamil Nadu with 90 million Tamils next door, both generated anxiety in the Sinhalese political circles to share power, and also emboldened Tamil leadership not to compromise. This status quo gradually weakened as Tamils gradually lost, first, pre-eminence, then the parity in economic and professional life in the country, and finally were herded to a sliver of land off Mullativu lagoon as cannon fodders by a nihilistic terrorist group that the traditional Tamil elites nurtured and identified as the sole representatives of the community.
Few communities, if ever has said no to development, especially when its members are living lives of depravity. When Tamil politicians and instigated local folksdemand that the government shut the shop, and leave the North, one should view those demands in association with their historical record. The role of Tamil political class in the countrys economic development from the early days of independence is negligible- though individual Tamil members contributed immensely to professional and economic life, and rose to its height. That is a poor show viewed in the context of political elites of other communities, say, Muslims or Tamils of Indian origin.
Tamil political leadership has always sacrificed economic interests of the country, and their own community to advance political interests born out from primordial impulses of Tamil exceptionalism.
In Sri Lanka, Tamil nationalism defined itself along the line of a distinctive nation, a Tamil homeland and right to self-determination. That gamble proved to be a disaster. However, Tamil political class seems to be keep repeating the old mistake.
Earlier the chief minister C.V. Vigneswaran demanded that the Tamil National Alliance boycott the Presidential Task force for Northern development, because as he feels a political solution is far more important than economic development. TNA snubbed him. However, for quite sometime, Mr Vigneswaran has ganged up with Tamil nationalist parties such as Gajendra Kumar Ponnambalams Tamil National Peoples Front and founded Tamil Peoples Council, which he may use to contest the provincial council election in the likely case of rejection of nomination by the TNA.

"Tamil political psyche is rooted in Tamil exceptionalism, identified as unique cultural, linguistic, historical legacy and in part the perceived superiority of Dravidian civilization."

As the TNA has taken a moderate posture in its dealing with the central government, Mr. Vigneswaran and his buddies are trying to fill the vacuum in the political discourse of the radical Tamil nationalism. In the recent history of Tamil politics, it was this intense electoral competition that drew all Tamil parties to the fringes, and inspired the Vadukkodai resolution. There is no guarantee that the history would not be repeated.

In Sri Lanka, Tamil nationalism defined itself along the line of a distinctive nation, a Tamil homeland and right to selfdetermination.
	
	Tamils do, of course, have special grievances. However, being rather unique political grievances, they are by products of a protracted war and they are primarily economic.
	
	This is also a catch 22 situation. Keep away from the North, and let Mr Vigneswaran and the Northern Provincial Council to run the show
	
	The majority of Jaffna youth who listen to rabid nationalist orations of their leaders, will go home, eat a rottie and sleep

Tamils do, of course, have special grievances. However, being rather unique political grievances, they are by products of a protracted war and they are primarily economic. The North and the East lag way behind the rest of the country in all economic indicators. Those disparities need to be addressed, along with a decent degree of power sharing to the provinces.
However, even the most well intentioned efforts to address economic grievances could also cause a sense of psychological, and physical displacement. When primordial instincts of Tamil exceptionalism come to play, it complicates this entire exercise.
The recent Tamil protests over Sinhala colonization has a lot to do with those primordial impulses.Tamil exceptionalism is tribal and territorial. How far the government is willing to go to appease these concerns is also a delicate matter. In the normal context, a Sinhalese fisherman putting up a fishing hut in the Mullaitivu beach should not be any different from a Tamil man buying land in Wellawatta.
This is also a catch 22 situation. Keep away from the North, and let Mr Vigneswaran and the Northern Provincial Council to run the show, you are more likely to end up with useless and self- pontificating resolutions; As M.S.M Ayub pointed out last week, NPC has passed 415 odd such resolutions. Those resolutions may not ease the plight of Tamil, but, they could in the long run radicalize Tamils. In addition, a poorer North where the governments presence is limited, is more likely to relapse into suicide terrorism than where the government plays an active role, though some circles of Tamils may like it to stay away.
On the other hand, the government involvement itself generates opposition and can be exploited to rally the youth and the affected communities to fringe nationalism. That could again lead to the repetition of the gory history.
At the end, security of the rest of the country should prevail over other concerns. What is permissible in Mullaitivu or Jaffna should be subject to that equation. That requires the government to strike a delicate balance of accommodation and force. Genuine grievances need to be addressed, and exploitation of fictitious ones needs to be watched. Individuals and front runners of fringe nationalism should be monitored. Work of Intelligence apparatus should not be curtailed. The government should not let another generation to be taken up by surprise by another militancy.
Perhaps, nothing untoward will happen. The majority of Jaffna youth who listen to rabid nationalist orations of their leaders, will go home, eat a rottie and sleep . So did their previous generations in the 60, and 70s. However, a few were so inspired by those talks that they decided to blow up an army convoy in July 1983. Sri Lanka went through three decades of mayhem for that simple security lapse of not keeping an eye on its trouble makers ( no different than an earlier blunder that materialized into a full blown insurgency in 1971)
The country should not let a repetition of its violent past. Irrespective all good intentions of political correctness by the government,any symptoms of potential runaway chaos should be nipped in the bud.

Big waste talking reconciliation
	

Why NGO projects and Janakaraliya etc failed to engage this Dominant Sinhala Buddhist Narrative

It was an interesting experience to sit in the audience at the Western Province National Institute for Drama & Art, watching two playlets on Reconciliation performed by school children on Friday 24 August (2018) afternoon.
It was a funded project named You(th) Create undertaken by the Colombo Centred NGO, the Chrysalis Sri Lanka supported by other State and non-State agencies and organisations like ONUR and Janakaraliya mobile theatre group.
It involved 42 Sinhala and Tamil children selected from seven schools in the districts of Kilinochchi and Anuradhapura.
The two playlets performed by these Sinhala and Tamil children were praiseworthy no doubt. In the discussion after the plays, the experience of these children and their teachers were spoken of as replicable examples for promoting Reconciliation.
If I may round off their experiences, during the first few days together, the Sinhala and Tamil children did not interact with each other nor did the Sinhala and Tamil teachers who came with the children.
They had some undefined suspicion that couldnt be explained. With Janakaraliya mobile theatre group creating an atmosphere and logistical arrangements that made them live and work together, barriers started coming down.It was the inability to speak the language of the other that kept them with minimum communication.
Yet, with time, they became best of friends as one Sinhala child told the audience. They wished they could continue with their new found associations. Teachers agreed to say they wish they could visit others in those families, visit them in their villages, making it a larger community of Sinhala and Tamil people.
The discussion helped spark some hope for the future. It seemed like the end of the dark tunnel. But, have we not travelled this path many times before, without any positive results
Sixteen years ago in February 2002 when the Cease Fire Agreement (CFA) was signed, the first two years at least gave us as much hope or more in creating a society of peaceful co-existence.
Whole Sinhala villages travelled as busloads to Jaffna to worship Nagadeepa. Busloads went to Trincomalee and enjoyed bathing in the hot springs. They met Tamil people and made friends too. There were also Tamil youths in Vanni who never dreamt of coming to Colombo or Kandy but did come and left with new acquaintances and new experience.
On the funded and organised side, Colombo based NGOs had projects that took children and teachers to Jaffna on exchange programmes to experience and learn cultural diversity.
Youth from Vanni were brought down South for similar exchanges.
In a workshop for provincial Sinhala journalists held in Colombo early 2003, I was told that a Sinhala youth in Galle had received letters from a Tamil girl in the Vanni, after an exchange programme.
Her letters written in Tamil made this Sinhala youth seek help from his Muslim friend in the neighbourhood. We wondered how the girl had replies in Sinhala read for her. Perhaps the youth from Galle had his Muslim friend write replies in Tamil.
That workshop discussed everything from Conflict Management and Federalism to the history of the National Question.
Such workshops for numerous social groups, journalists, L.G. and Provincial council members and for district-level public officers would have burnt out many millions of US dollars during the 25 plus years of the armed conflict.
But with all those efforts, ethnic polarisation could not even be managed. The media, in general, could not be sanitized to play an independent, socially responsible role.
The war escalated and continued to be fought to a brutal end in May 2009. Thereafter anti-Muslim campaigns and conflicts erupted violently.
As Parakrama Niriella told the audience, continuous degradation of the Sri Lankan society was everyones experience.
Ethno-religious polarisation, the 1958 attack on Tamil people, the 1968 January protests led by the SLFP with LSSP and CP against the Special Provision bill for Reasonable use of Tamil resulting in the death of novice Buddhist monk Dambarawe Rathanasara, setting fire to the famous Jaffna library prior to DDC elections in June 1981 and Black July of 1983 backed by UNP hooliganism were all disturbing and devastating experiences.
They left democratic mainstream Tamil politics helpless and frustrated and gave way for armed Tamil politics that brutalised society on either side of the barricades.
Yet again, the conclusion of the war has left us discussing transitional justice, reconciliation and co-existence for over nine years, still counting.
Looking back, my school life and my neighbourhood gave me more diversity than what Niriella had in his primary school in Divulapitiya.
In Dehiwala we lived in a neighbourhood that had not only Christian and Hindu Tamils, but two or three Tamil Buddhist families too. There were Sinhala Buddhists and Catholics and many Burgher families, whose first language was English.
In school too, we had all that diversity and few Bohra kids too. We cut school together to go for matinee film shows. Ate buns and had tea together. Played after school, bathed in the Bambalapitiya sea and fought each other still living as one single bunch of children.
As Niriella pointed out, we had no notion, we were different from each other. Our parents, our teachers and our neighbourhood did not make us feel different.We had no gaps to bridge in understanding the other to make friends, as two of the leading Janakaraliya artistes Sumudu and Jonathan explained with their experiences.Almost 15 years ago when Sumudu and others joined Janakaraliya they had difficulty, a reluctance in breaking fences to understand Tamil youth like Loha, and Tamil youth had an undefined suspicion in getting to know Sumudu and others.
We never had those issues. The differences in language, religion and culture were diversity we enjoyed. Tamil friends picked up Sinhala quite fast. Burger children went about with their limping Sinhala.
So did we, in Tamil and English. We too joined them at St. Marys church for midnight mass on the Christmas day.We sat with bamboo strips, coloured paper and gum to make the largest and the longest snake kite in the area that was our common property. So was it, when Vesak approached.
It was always a team effort that had Vesak lanterns up and proud in front of our house. We walked all the way to Bambalapitiya to watch the Vel-chariot leave the Hindu Kovil with a long and colourful procession of Hindu devotees.
Walking back, we pooled bus fares saved, bought one long sugar cane and shared it equally. Our surroundings, our experience was to that extent diverse, rich, benefitting and fun too.
Meanwhile, there were other things around us taking a different shape we were not aware of.
Greenlands College where I was admitted to the Lower Kindergarten suddenly became Isipathana Maha Vidyalaya in 1957. Greenlands Road turned Isipathana Mawatha.

"They have an immense ability to continually work towards sustaining the Dominant Sinhala Buddhist Narrative, Community work ignoring them, cannot refashion that dominant social psyche, all of them together keep fattening."
Havelock Park where we played, fought and then made friends again, turned into Henry Pedris Park. But Dickmans Road along Milagiriya St. Pauls Church, never became St. Pauls Road. Nor did Fife Road become E.R.S.R Kumaraswamy Road, in the name of the last Commissioner of Assize who resided there.
All such Sinhala Buddhist deviations and deformities our parents and neighbours had much to criticise, went without our notice and concern.
That breakaway from morals and ethics, from values and decency, turned diversity into divisions in society.
That degradation left later generations, that of Sumudu and Loha, Arosha and Leela to learn anew about the other, to accept the other as equal.
They learnt it the hard way over time, creating an inclusive subculture with new morals, ethics and values they nurture and live with, within Janakaraliya and not found outside it.
The irony is, 15 years later, they had to go about teaching that same lesson to 42 children from the next generation. That for me says, while NGOs carried our awareness work over decades, while Janakaraliya created a new process of dialogue travelling to all distant places with their Sinhala and Tamil mobile ensemble, using theatre in its applied form, winning a large applauding audience for their efforts, they have not been able to take their inclusive subculture into mainstream Sinhala society.
To quote Ven. Dr Galkande Dhammananda Thera, who was the guest speaker at this event, the majority in this society do not know there are other human beings amongst them.
Others who have to be accepted with their differences. This continues unabated as Niriella very aptly surmised, with education, media and political leaderships patronising and developing the Dominant Sinhala Buddhist Narrative.
Heavily funded NGO projects during the past three decades and Janakaraliya, with their travelling ensemble, have failed to engage with this Dominant Sinhala Buddhist Narrative.
They thus leave these 42 children to get back to the same degrading society. In school, they would be taught the same lesson about Dutugemunu that Niriella said they were taught in class by their Somawathie teacher.
So will it be for those teachers who would have to get back to their old classrooms to teach the same old textbooks and live that same life in this demeaning society
This brings up a major question on education, media and Southern politics that decides policy.
Can social psyche be defined and fashioned ignoring their grip on society
Together, they have an immense ability to continually work towards sustaining the Dominant Sinhala Buddhist Narrative, Community work ignoring them, cannot refashion that dominant social psyche, all of them together keep fattening.
It is thus about a change of approach in lobbying and demanding a change in government policy to rewrite school textbooks.
About demanding media to be socially responsible. Changes that can provide space for reconciliation to have its meaning proper.

Forced to do the night job to keep the day job!
	

These employees in the State sector, according to the duty list given to them, are required to supervise construction work undertaken under a countrywide programme. It is, of course, a daytime job. But you might be surprised to hear that a nighttime job too has been assigned to them unofficially: pasting posters on parapet walls or wherever there is some space for the purpose at a public location.

These employees have to do this night job whether they like it or not for it matters to the extent whether they should keep their official job or lose it. Because it is an order they have got from their supreme boss, a high political authority.
Whenever there is a ceremonial opening in a village in some distant corner of the country, these employees no matter in which part they are working, are required to put on walls in their respective areas posters announcing the opening.
These employees receive bundles of this kind of posters through official channels almost daily.
A white-collar high-up required to involve himself in this night work project at district level had declined to comply and he had been served with a transfer order by return of post, they say.
The employees affected by this compulsory unofficial night duty had reportedly made representations in writing to the high political authority from time to time for the last three years, but had failed to receive even an acknowledgement, they say.

UNP MP Mujibur Rahaman who responded said no such thing had happened. He said the JO supporters had started purging after consuming expired packets of milk distributed by JO members themselves. "There is no reason why we should distribute such packets, the MP said.
The argument continued when joint opposition MP Indika Anurdha pointed out that were an inufficient number of MPs in the House for the sessions to continue.

India redoubles efforts for Buddhist tourism promotion
	
The delegation

Englishman Army John Smith was in a hunting expedition in 1819 in the verdant forest of the Deccan plateau in Maharashtra, India. He was tracking a tiger when he made a sudden discovery- Ajanta rock-cut temples covered under foliage in the district called Aurangabad ofMaharashtra State in India.
It appeared that there was just one cave hewn into the huge rock, but it turned out to be 29 caves cut into the boulder finally. Upon discovery, according to historians, Smith entered the cave where he stumbled upon flaming a grass torch to find paintings and the Buddha statues faded by tome. Accidental discovery finally opened the door to enter Indias glorious history of Buddhism. Born in Lumbini of the present day Nepal as Prince Siddhartha, the Buddha attained enlightenment in India. His main religious and spiritual work concentrated particularly in northern and central India, particularly covering the states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra. Enough and more archaeological evidence have been found to confirm the Buddhas activities in this terrain. 
The marvelous rock-cut temples or caves speak volumes about the ancient Buddhist heritage of India related to the Buddhas activities. Found on the walls of these vaulted and colonnaded rock-cut chambers are ancient paintings, sculptures and murals depicting Buddhist literature with a particular emphasis on the Jataka tales.These rockcut chambers had been abandoned for more than 1000 years. 
In 1983, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to historians, these caves were abandoned in the fifth century AD. What is hewn from the solid rock are a line of caves that serve as Chaitya Grihas and Vihares. Historians believe that the Buddhist monks had used them during their months of retreat. 
The walls of the rock temples are adorned with the images of the Buddha, the princes and princesses, of animals, palaces, silks, and jewellery with richness in art. 
The Indian government has now embarked on an ambitious mission to showcase its Buddhist heritage to the world both for spiritual purposes and tourism promotion targeting well over 500 million Buddhists living in countries such as Sri Lanka, Japan, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and so on.
It conducted its sixth edition of the International Buddhist Conclave between August 23 and 26 covering New Delhi, Aurangabad, Bodhgaya and Varanasi. India invited delegates from 30 different countries in the world for this mega event that displayed Indian hospitality in its greatest form. Aircraft with delegates on board were given symbolic water salute. They disembarked from their aircraft to the petal strewn aerobridge that is to promote tourism to the Buddhist sites spread across India. In this exercise, India projects itself as the land of enlightenment and sees Buddhism as the greatest gift of that country to the Buddhist world. Indian President Ram Nath Kovind inaugurated the conclave and gave a speech outlining how Buddhism asserted its peaceful expansion across the sub-continent through the ancient Silk Road. In his view, it is the early basis of globalization. Today five Indian states are involved in the development of Buddhist circuit: Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh.
Ajanta Caves are well featured along the circuit. In fact, it is established that ancient artists who worked on Sigiriya paintings in Sri Lanka and Mogoa Grottoes in Dunhuang, China have drawn on from Ajanta paintings. 
In India, there are more than 1500 such cave temples. Amazingly, around 900 of them are Buddhist. Our travel guide Ram Pitambare who is a history scholar, said these paintings in Ajanta bear resemblance to Greek art, a phenomena of Greko-Indian culture that spread from the 4th century BC in India through the expeditions of Alexander the Great. 
India leaves no stone unturned in its pursuit of attracting tourists to these Buddhist sites including Bodhgaya, Nalanda and Kushinagar and so on. To make it even more attractive to tourists, the airports in the areas with Buddhist sites are echoed with the music and even Pali stanzas are played at the airports in places like Aurangabad and Gaya, considered the gateways to heritage sites. 
Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and State Minister of Tourism Promotion Ranjith Aluvihare attended the event representing Sri Lanka. Minister Aluvihare said he was inspired by the event, and would organize a similar conclave in Sri Lanka next year. 
Sri Lanka has great potential to do it, he said.

Sri Lankan culture and Indian culture have a lot of similarities: Ram Pitambare

Ram Pitambare, a history scholar turned travel guide, spoke to Daily Mirror about Ajanta caves and Buddhist heritage in Maharashtra. He has obtained two MA degrees in history.
Excerpts:

Q How do you describe the Buddhist heritage in Maharashtra in India
As far as the entire Indian subcontinent is concerned, there are 1700 rock cave temples in India. Out of them, including the ancient caravan route, we have 1241 in Maharashtra. Actually, 80 percent of them are Buddhist, 16 percent Hindu and the remaining four percent Jain. The major or pivotal role was played by Buddhism in the life of Maharashtra. From second century BC till eighth century AD, mostly under the dynasties such as Satavahanas dynasty, Vakataka, Chalukyas, Kalachuri, Rasthzakuta Dynasties, they have managed hewing out all these rock temples or monolithic temples along the ancient caravan route. For example, from the capital of Satavahan rulers to the ancient seaport near Nalasopora, Mumbai, we can see some of these cave temples in Paithan, Aurangabad. Ahead of that, we find them in, Daulatabad, Ellora, and Blazon Lens. Also, in Daulatabad, we have a group of rock temples in Nasik. In Junnar, we have got Asias largest rock temples in four groups. 
In Ellora, if anybody takes a right turn and travels on the caravan route towards Ujjani, they will find a whole lot of cave temples like Ajanta. If the entire evolution of rock cut architecture of temples is to be studied, Maharashtra offered the best example. 

QThis is a unique form of architecture associated with Buddhism. What is the reason for it to be associated with Buddhism in main from a historians point of view
That is a very unique thing they have done. Compared with the structural buildings, the rock temples have ten times more life. If you construct a building, it may last 500 years to the maximum. But, the rock temples have lasted for more than 3000 years. Scholars say they may last another 200 years. There is no need to carry materials from other places. When you hew out the rock, you can scoop out building materials that can be recycled for building statues. Ecologically, these rock temples are warm in the winter and cold in the summer. So, they offer a comfortable stay for monks. 

QThough the Buddhas activities and movements were concentrated mostly in the territory presently coming under India, it is no longer the major religion of India. What is the reasonyou see
The emergence of Vajrayana and sub pantheons of it such as Tantrayana and Sabrayana is one reason. When monks got involved more and more into the material world and physical pleasure, the dissipation of growth of Buddhism started. In addition to that, at the end of the ninth century, Islam arrived in this part of the world. They tried to massacre the monks. People who got scared ran out of this area to the Himalayan states. Buddhism went up for Bhutan and entered China in the fifth century. 
QNow, we see the resurgence of Buddhism in the state. What is the reason for it
It is due to B.R. Ambedkar. He was born in India, took his education in England and became the Law Minister of India. He was the one who made the revival of Buddhism. Dr. Ambedkar was a Hindu by birth. Being an untouchable, he was thrashed a lot. He asked people to accept Buddhism which never gives shelter to the caste system. The caste system is all that discrimination giving you a humiliating life. You should rather be Buddhist, educate yourself and unite yourself. Dr. Ambedkars thought is considered as a neo-Buddhism. This neo- Buddhism is nicely explained by the state government of Maharashtra. Buddha and Dhamma, the book written by V.R. Ambedkar is there. Because of Buddhism, the down-trodden got attracted to education. They went to the next position taking the best education because of Dr. Ambedkar.
After the demise or Mahaparinibbana of the Buddha, the main patronage of Buddhism lapsed. Rather, the strong Hindu revivalists like Sankaracharya played a different trick. They knew that they could not defeat the revival of Buddhism by force or by intellectual power. They tried to overpower Buddhism by describing the Buddha as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu. The International Mahabodhi Society is fighting against the Hindu fundamentalists to get back the original Buddha sites for Buddhism, like the Mahapada Temple of Bodhgaya. The Hindus worship it as Vishnupada Temple. Likewise, hundreds of cave temples were taken over by the Hindus and converted to Hindu Shiva or Vishnu temples. 
QWhat is the kind of patronage given by the state government of Maharashtra to promote Buddhism
Besides the efforts of Dr. Ambedkar, there are other stalwarts. Even madiaeval kings curbed the practice of the caste system. Otherwise, Brahmans were saying that Sudras and women had no right to education. If you are born into a poor family or the lower caste, you have no right to rise above that level. That was why, as a king, the Sahumastra took a lot of effort in educating those poor communities. Even his wife worked shoulder to shoulder with him. She gave that nectar to women.
rahmanic literature taught that your husband was your god. I have my personal experience in my childhood. I was barely four years old. In stalwarts houses, there were special glasses and cups, sometimes the empty shells of coconut, to give water to low caste people. Copper or brass utensils were not given to them. They were treated as untouchables. Untouchables were supposed to fasten the broom behind and drum on their tummy. They have to beat the drum when walking along the streets, to inform that they were travelling and that the sanctity of the higher caste groups should not be disturbed.
QWhen you talk about Ajanta rock-cut temples, the paintings and artistic works bear resemblance to those in Sigiriya in Sri Lanka and the Mogao caves in Dunhuang, China. How do you describe that historical connection
Right from Asokas period in the third century BC, Asoka established official relations with Han Dynasty of China. Celebrated Chinese monks visited India. They went with texts written on palm leaf manuscripts. Before Christ, it was Theravada in those parts. Through China, it went into other parts of the Far East.It was the post Nirvana period of the Buddha. From here to the Shiyang valley of South China, certainly, taking inspirations from Ajanta, the Chinese people converted them into cave temples in Dunhuang. They have copied the thousand Buddha paintings there, taking a lesson from Ajanta.
Asokas son and daughter were personally sent to Sri Lanka. Along with them, stalwarts were sent for the spread of Buddhism in the south of India. Arahat Mahinda and Sangamitta were sent to Sri Lanka. . People from Sri Lanka were coming on pilgrimages. Amaravati is the place where Satvahana architecture got flourished.
Sri Lankan culture and Indian culture have a lot of similarities. People of Sri Lanka, be they Sinhalese or Tamil, are similar to those in southern Indian states. That cultural affiliation made our way easy for the cultural assimilation. That is my opinion.

Janabalaya Colombata and a forgotten past - EDITORIAL
	

Janabalaya Colombata organised by the Joint Opposition sent thoughts of the Government, which were to silence voices of dissent, into oblivion when the opposition and their supporters poured into Colombo on Wednesday resembling a high tide.
Riding on the back of a successful campaign at the last LG Polls, the opposition forces- spearheaded by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa- once again showed that they can gather the numbers needed to stand up and be counted.
The key player again in another promising move by the opposition was the former president. Rajapaksa was quick to state during his speech that the countrys President and Premier could visit the north and critisise him because he gave them this right.
Rajapaksa has a sharp mind and the skill of wit and this comment simply lifts the opposition forces battling the Government on to a higher pedestal.
This Sathyakgraha or peaceful protest rally was just what the opposition needed to steal the limelight from the Government, which till yesterday was in the news for carrying out development work in the country. 
But the truth is that this regime could do nothing as tens of thousand of supports backing the Joint Opposition poured into Colombos central most location, Fort, and demanded that the Government should step down.
When considering the fact that the courts turned down requests by three police stations to obtain restraining orders to control the protesters, it suggests that the Government tried to sabotage efforts by the public to gather in large numbers, but failed.
Mahinda Rajapaksa has a warrior mentality and we all know that. It is because of this nature that he was able to lead the fight against terrorism and see a successful end to the Tiger rebels. There were claims that a bus carrying protesters from Hali-ela for the rally was attacked. But Rajapaksa saw that the campaign led by him didnt face major hiccups.
A close scrutiny of the crowds also reveals that some of them were brought there on the promise of being looked after. We saw some protesters knocked out after taking a tad too much liquor and some under the influence of alcohol trying to scale utility posts. There were also sing-songs and an angampora (the ancient art of fighting practised by Sinhalese ancestral families) demonstration; items which dont showcase the frustration within the people, but certainly dents the seriousness of this protest march.
Rajapaksa affirmed that this was the first step in a move to send home this Government. He went on to add that the citizenry represented by the poor man to the businessman was hurt by the actions of the Government.
Following Sri Lanka Podujana Peramunas landslide win at the LG Polls, this is Rajapaksas second show of strength in the field of politics after he was defeated at the Presidential Elections in 2015.
Before his defeat and after he won the war against separatist Tiger rebels there marked a period of Government-sponsored violence during which most who opposed the Rajapkasa clan were physically abused, killed or forced out of the country. If peace was experienced after 2009, the happiness that prevailed as a result was damped because the Mahinda-Rajapaksa Government gave little value to democracy. But this Rajapaksa seems to have forgotten the past and said during his speech on Wednesday that democracy was disappearing under the present Yahapalana regime.
Whats sad about a sizeable section of the countrys citizenry is that they have short memories and are held spellbound by this man sporting a mustache.

Judging character by Sun Sign - Sagittarius
	
Natal Solar month and Sun Sign  Part 09                  

The Sun moves in the Zodiac sign of Sagittarius from about November 16 to December 15 and those born during this period are greatly influenced by the characteristics of the Sagittarius sign even if their Lagna or the sign rising from the horizon at the time of birth is another sign.
The symbol assigned to this sign is a man riding a horse with a bow and arrow in his hands.
Possess a keen perception and a brilliant intellect
Sagittarius people possess a keen perception and a brilliant intellect. They are outspoken, honest and even-tempered.
Sagittarius people are decent and refined and they are disciplined. Therefore, their conduct is non-abrasive. Their instinct or the Extra-sensory perception (ESP) is very keen and strong. They are gallant, bold and flamboyant.

Easily make friends
Sagittarius people easily make friends because of their cordial nature. They are idealistic and do not allow their head to rule their heart in making decisions. They are very strict in choosing a partner and would even break up an engagement already made if the proposed spouse is found not up to expectations.

Limit water usage to enable steady supply: NWSDB
	
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) yesterday requested the public to limit water usage to only what was required for domestic activities and refrain from using the utility for activities such as washing cars, gardening and maintaining swimming pools etc.
The NWSDB explained that water supplies were diminishing rapidly due to the prevailing dry weather and the resulting increase in the consumption of water.
Water supply to some areas in Colombo, especially those living on high ground, would be sluggish due to the prevailing low water pressure, the board said.
The utility provider requested the publics corporation in limiting consumption in a bid to provide an equal water supply to households that are currently receiving little or no water. (Darshana Sanjeewa)

Message of the Janabalaya
	

Demonstration organized to maintain the momentum created by Feb. 10 LG polls
	Court cases against many leaders of the former regime question their moral right to point the finger at the Government

Not even the strongest supporter of the Joint opposition (JO) or the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) would have expected their protest march on Wednesday to bring down the Government, in spite of the Mahinda Rajapaksa loyalists having succeeded in creating the public opinion that present Government was extremely weak.
Leaders of the SLPP and the JO said that they were coming to Colombo not to return (Enne yanna novei), meaning that they would capture power at the end of their protest march.
But they returned empty-handed. They said that they would bring one million people to Colombo for their protest. However, the converging point of their four processions  the Lake House Roundabout in Colombo Fort- did not see any stampede, though it is too small a place to accommodate one-twentieth of the total population of the country, expected by the leaders of the protest.
In fact, the credit for the public opinion on the weakness of the Government should not go to the Rajapaksa loyalists alone.
It was this very Government that authored this reputation, by way of showing weakness in every sphere of Governance, especially in handling their adversaries.
Within weeks, after assuming office, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) headed by President Maithripala Sirisena visibly started to demonstrate its weakness, when the SLFP members joined anti-Government public meetings. Both, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera, said that disciplinary action would be taken against those SLFP members who participated at those meetings.
But the threat only made them a laughing stock. The weakness was also manifested by way of Governments failure or inability or unwillingness to put what they called the thieves of the former regime behind bars, despite it having become the theme during the last Presidential and Parliamentary elections.
And the Weak Government label was further asserted with the Governments failure to lay claim for any visible economic progress in the country.
When the President commissioned the Moragahakanda Reservoir this year, claiming that it was the largest project under the Mahaweli Scheme, it was too late and the marketing of such projects among the people by the Government had also been another case in point for its weakness.
Yet, the protesters did not have even a faintest dream of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe or one of them being forced to flee to another country or at least to resign their posts due to the Janabalaya Kolambata march on Wednesday- as what happened to Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines in 1986, Pahlavi Shah of Iran in 1979 and several leaders in the Middle East during the so-called Arab Spring in 2011.

"Muslims who supported Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2005 and 2010 Presidential polls voted en-masse to the then Oppositions common candidate Maithripala Sirisena following a three-year-long anti-Muslim campaign "
Long before the agitation the demonstrators very well knew that they would just have to go home after the demonstration.
The demonstration was organized to maintain the momentum that had been created by the results of the February 10 Local Government elections, where the SLPP swept the electorate by capturing more than 230 Local Councils out of the 340 councils for which elections were held.
The leaders of the JO and the SLPP knew that they need at least two or three more shows of strength before the next national level election - Parliamentary or Presidential - in order to keep the momentum high.
It is because they expect the provincial council elections to become an opportunity in this regard; those elections have been at the top of their priority list.
Though they would not accept it publicly, the leaders of the Janabalaya Kolambata campaign knew that the demonstration was a flop compared to their past agitations including the Rise with Mahinda rallies in 2015 and 2016 and the Pada Yathra from Peradeniya to Colombo in July 2016.
Nevertheless, the Government seemed to have prepared for a bigger show, with Police requesting three courts to issue Restraining Orders to curtail movements of the demonstrations in Colombo. However, their requests were denied by the courts. They informed the courts that the demonstrators were planning to lay siege at the official residences of the President and the Prime Minister.
Though the demonstration failed to cripple the State and private sector institutions, as some of the JO leaders threatened to, the fear they instilled in the public sector employees and the school children through their big fuss about the agitation had resulted in the low attendance of employees and students.
The slogans the demonstrators shouted and displayed on the placards they were carrying did not seem to be crowd pullers. Except for the allegations on the Central Bank bond scandal, almost all other allegations they levelled against the Government during the demonstration had a boomeranging effect on themselves.
For instance, they accused the Government of selling national assets such as land to foreigners, while they too were being accused of the same.
While the demonstrators charged that the Government had given land in Hambantota to Chinese Rajapaksa regime is being accused of selling outright a huge land plot in the Galle Face to a foreign Hotel Company and the Port City to a Chinese company, among others.

"It was the frustration over the failure of the current regime to keep its promises on economic development and action against corruption that pushed the masses back towards Rajapaksas."
One could also justify their branding of the leaders of the Governments thieves, as many leaders of the United National Party (UNP) had openly defended the culprits of multi-billion rupee bond scam after attempting to cover up that national crime. Yet, court cases against many leaders of the former regime including the members of the Rajapaksa family, question their moral right to point the finger at the incumbent Government leaders.
Interestingly, the posters put up by the JO/SLPP leaders during the run-up to the Janabalaya Kolambata rally accused the Government of disturbing the communal harmony, while the main reason for the fall of the Rajapaksa administration in 2015 had been the dissociation of Muslims from Rajapaksas.
One cannot deny that it was due to the Governments inaction against the lawbreakers that the riots against Muslims spread in the Kandy District in last March.
Nonetheless, Muslims who supported Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2005 and 2010 Presidential polls voted en-masse to the then Oppositions common candidate Maithripala Sirisena following a three-year-long anti-Muslim campaign during Rajapaksa regime by certain groups, that Muslims believed had the blessings of the Rajapaksas.
However, now the political trend has turned towards the Rajapaksas, as indicated by the February Local Government elections. But that does not mean that they had won over the people by assuring them of economic progress or an administration free of corruption and waste.
It was the frustration over the failure of the current regime to keep its promises on economic development and action against corruption that pushed the masses back towards Rajapaksas.
And Rajapaksas too do not have any tangible plans for economic development or a corruption-free system of governance or communal harmony.
Yes, the pendulum seems to continue to swing for an unknown number of decades to come.

Muslim groups call for female circumcision to be medicalised
	
A number of Sri Lankan Muslim groups have called on the government to medicalise female circumcision.
In representations made to the Parliamentary Committee on Women and Gender, members of the All Ceylon Jamiyathul Ulama, All Ceylon YMMA Conference, Centre for Islamic Studies and United Religions Initiative urged the Health Ministry to withdraw a recent circular prohibiting medical professionals from carrying out female circumcision.
In their submission, the joint Muslim groups stated that the Muslim community is very concerned about moves to ban this obligatory Islamic duty on the grounds that it is Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).
We wish to categorically state that the practice of female circumcision is an obligatory Islamic duty, that it confers numerous benefits and is not Female Genital Mutilation. As such we condemn all moves to ban the practice of female circumcision by legislation and/ or by government bodies and urge that no moves be taken in this direction which we will regard as an unwarranted intrusion on and infringement of our religious duties guaranteed by the law and constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, the Muslim representatives said in their submission. We also request the Ministry of Health to withdraw a recent circular it issued prohibiting medical practitioners from performing the procedure and to issue a fresh circular excluding Islamic female circumcision a.k.a hoodectomy from the definition of FGM
Joint Spokesperson Noor Hazeema Haris said that although Muslims wholeheartedly support the abolition of traditional practices harmful to women and children such as FGM, in case it is shown to exist in Sri Lanka, the Islamic practice of female circumcision is vastly different. She pointed out that this religious obligation practiced by the Muslims of the country for centuries in keeping with the requirements of the Islamic faith is not FGM. This was evident from the Joint Ministry of Health (MOH) and WHO report on Violence and Health in Sri Lanka in 2008, which states categorically that FGM does not exist in Sri Lanka.
She pointed out that while countless Sri Lankan Muslim Women have undergone childbirth deliveries in Governmental and Private Hospitals over the past decades, not a single case has arisen where Muslim women have been shown to have undergone FGM. It is therefore very clear that Sri Lankan Muslim women have never experienced FGM.
She further pointed out that female circumcision practiced by Muslims is a very minor procedure similar to male circumcision where the prepuce of the clitoris is removed. This is the same as hoodectomy which is a legal cosmetic procedure chosen by women to improve genital hygiene and enhance their sex lives. 
It is something that is arranged and done by women. Those who say this is male oppression against women are mistaken. It is we who do it just like our mothers and grandmothers and countless generations of our women have done. We continue to practice it because we know it benefits us. Even educated Muslim women support it wholeheartedly, she added.
The submission concluded that female circumcision like male circumcision is a religious obligation for Muslims and that their religious rights as Sri Lankan citizens are safeguarded by the Constitution of Sri Lanka. Since this is a religious obligation, almost all Muslim Women and girls would have to undergo the procedure by hiring the services of traditional female circumcisors known as Ostha Mamis in case doctors refuse to perform this procedure citing the above mentioned circular. This could lead to serious medical complications which would amount to FGM.
If as medical complications have arisen among some women circumcised by Osthamaamis as alleged by Womens Rights groups, it is all the more reason to medicalise the procedure instead of prohibiting it, which will only drive the procedure underground and put girls and women at unnecessary risk.
We therefore urge the Parliament of Sri Lanka to reject any legislation drafted with a view to prohibit the practice of female circumcision as it will be infringing on the rights of Muslims to the free practice of their faith.We also urge that the Ministry of Health immediately withdraw the said circular and if needs be, issue a fresh circular prohibiting FGM, but exempting the Islamic procedure of female circumcision from the definition as done in other Muslim countries like Indonesia concluded the submission.
The Muslim Representatives included M.N.M.Naphiel, President of the All Ceylon YMMA Conference, Asiff Hussein, Vice-President Outreach, Centre for Islamic Studies, Noor Hazeema Haris, Co-ordinator of United Religions Initiative, Sheikh M.F.M Farhan, Manager, All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama and Sheikh M.A. Haris, Co-Ordinator of the Fatwa Committee of All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama.
The committee agreed to give them a hearing and requested that medical evidence be submitted to prove that female circumcision of the type prescribed in Islam causes no harm and benefits women as stated by the joint representatives.

NFTH, Mulleriyawa hospital to be teaching hospitals: Rajitha
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today a Cabinet Paper would be submitted soon to develop the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) and Mulleriyawa Base Hospital as the Colombo East Teaching Hospitals.
He told parliament that there were some issues in providing full staff to the NFTH as the final agreement had not been signed to take over the Hospital.
"When the agreement is finalised, the NTFH will be assigned the required staff," the minister said. He said this in response to a question asked by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa regarding the current status of the SAITM Hospital.
The MP asked whether the SAITM Hospital was fully owned by the government and whether a Cabinet subcommittee was appointed to hand it over to the Air Force.
The minister said the SAITM Hospital was fully owned by the government and functions under a board of directors appointed by the government just as in the case of Sri Jayawardenepura Hospital.
"I was not in the country when the Cabinet paper was presented to hand it over to the Air Force. I spoke to the Prime Minister about it. I will present a Cabinet paper at the next meeting to develop the NFTH under the government. We hope to develop NFTH and the Mulleriyawa Base Hospital as Colombo East Teaching Hospital so that students of Kotalawala Defence University(KDU) can be provided clinical facilities," he said.

Of blood groups, pregnancy and mothers
	
What You Need to Know about Pregnancy in Blood Group Rh Negative Mothers

Im sure that most of our readers, who are up-to-date about health issues, are aware that in addition to grouping blood as A, B, AB and O, they are further categorized into Rh groups, as Rh positive or Rh negative. But did you know that Rh negative mothers who have Rh positive babies experience a phenomenon that is called Rh incompatibility during their pregnancy 
This condition, while being uncommon, can give rise to potentially serious complications. Are you or someone you know Rh negative and is expecting to become pregnant in the near future Stay Positive because weve got you covered. Health capsule decided to consult Dr. U.D.P. Ratnasiri, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Castle Street Hospital for Women, Colombo, to obtain more information on the subject.

Blood groups and Rh factor
Everyone has a blood group which differs from person to person. In addition to the ABO group there is another group by the name of Rhesus. In this, the presence of a molecule called Rhesus factor in the blood cell gives Rh positivity and the absence of it is considered as Rh negative. 

Pregnancy in Rh negative mothers
A babys blood group is determined by both the mother and the fathers. So, even if the mother is Rh negative, the foetus has a chance of having Rh positive blood if the father is having Rh positive blood.
In certain events called sensitizing events, the mother can get Rh positive blood cells from the foetus who is Rh positive. This will cause the Rh negative mothers blood to identify the Rhesus factor as an enemy, developing antibodies to fight against and to destroy the Rhesus factor in the babys red cells. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause destruction of Rh positive red cells in the baby, leading to anemia and other serious adverse effects to the foetus, sometimes even leading to miscarriage. These series of events are known as sensitization response. 

Risks associated with Sensitization response
As we discussed earlier, antibodies produced after a sensitizing event cross the placenta and destroy the foetal red cells in an Rh positive foetus. This in turn can lead to foetal anaemia which can cause serious consequences like miscarriage, stillbirth, foetal jaundice and brain damage. This is rare in a first time mother following the first sensitizing event. This usually happens in subsequent pregnancies with further sensitization.

Sensitizing events
Do all Rh negative women who are having Rh positive babies develop these complications Fortunately, this is not the case, as Dr. Rathnasiri explains.
Red blood cells of the baby cannot directly enter the mothers circulation due to the placenta which acts as a barrier. Sensitization occur when this barrier is breached due to some reason, causing Rh positive foetal blood gets in to the Rh negative mothers blood. This can happen in the antenatal period or at delivery.
Some events which might cause entering of foetal blood into mothers circulation are trauma to the pregnant uterus, separation of the placenta with pregnancy and bleeding in early or late pregnancy. In addition, some of the intervention procedures like inserting a needle to the gravid womb to obtain fluid for investigations as well as placental separation at the time of delivery also can cause mixing of foetal blood with mothers blood.

Prevention
So is there any way of identifying and preventing these risks to the baby Indeed there are, according to Dr. Ratnasiri.
All rhesus negative mothers are identified at their first clinic visit itself and their blood is tested for antibodies at different periods of pregnancy. Testing is usually done during early pregnancy as well as at 28 and 34 weeks of gestation. If the mother was found to have antibodies then further tests are carried out to identify the severity of the sensitization. The foetus is checked for the evidence of foetal anaemia with ultrasound examinations.
An injection of a substance called anti D is given routinely as well as following a sensitizing event, in a Rh negative mother. This substance destroys the foetal red cells in mothers blood, preventing the mothers body from producing antibodies and damaging the foetus in the future. This injection is routinely given at 28 and 34 weeks of pregnancy and at delivery if the baby is rhesus positive.
Some events where additional anti D are given are if there is an episode of vaginal bleeding during the pregnancy, and when invasive tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling are performed. Women who have a miscarriage, an ectopic pregnancy or a termination of pregnancy will also need anti D, even if it is the first pregnancy, to protect future pregnancies.
Treatments
Sometimes a womans Rh antibody levels need to be measured periodically during her pregnancy to anticipate whether the baby might have problems. If her antibody levels are too high, then she might need further tests to check the health of the unborn baby. Sometimes the unborn baby needs a blood transfusion, or it might need one soon after birth.
In developed countries, foetal blood testing is done with advanced facilities to identify the severity of foetal anaemia and consequences. Foetal blood transfusion is done while the baby is still in the womb itself. This is done to correct foetal anaemia and save the baby from further dangers which can come as a result of brain damage due to hypoxia.
In the local setup, the foetus is delivered when the problem is detected with the level of severity and foetal blood transfusion is given to correct anemia and to prevent deposition of bilirubin in the foetal brain leading to long term brain damage.
Giving birth to a new life is anyway a challenging task which will be made even trickier by the added potential complications. But as with many health issues, being informed beforehand, which enables us to seek medical care at the correct time, can lead to a successful pregnancy with minimal stresses and ensuring the effective delivery of a healthy baby in the end.

OMP wants officers accused of enforced disappearances suspended
	
In its first interim report, the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) recommended the government to suspend state officials including members of the armed forces and police who were named as suspects or accused in criminal actions relating to abductions and enforced disappearances, pending the final determination of such cases.
The OMP report said the government should ensure that suspected officials are not transferred, promoted or offered any other office in the armed forces, police or the public service while cases against them are pending.
Some individuals suspected of having committed enforced disappearances and related offences are being permitted to remain in positions of power, especially within the armed forces and the police, where they can influence the progress of investigations. There have been instances where members of the armed forces, who were willing to provide information on disappearances, were subjected to harassment, it said.
The OMP said that in at least one case, an officer of the armed forces who is a suspect in an on-going court case relating to abductions and enforced disappearances has neither been suspended nor removed from exercising the duties and functions of his office.
There are reports that in at least one case, an officer has been granted a promotion within the armed forces, while the case against him is still pending. The OMP notes that under relevant regulations as well as the rules and established practices, it is reasonably expected for such suspected officers to be suspended from exercising the duties and functions of their office, it said.
OMP Recommendations under Investigation and Prosecution also included expediting and giving highest priority to prosecutions and other ongoing cases involving enforced disappearances.
It said all incidents of arbitrary arrest, torture and deaths in custody should be investigated.
While urging the government to recognize the continuing nature of enforced disappearances, the OMP recommended the government to immediately formulate policies to provide interim relief to the family members of the missing persons.
These interim relief included financial aid programmes, debt relief programmes, housing development programmes, educational support programmes and also an employment quota of 1% within the state sector for the family members of the victims.
It is duly noted that interim relief in the form of welfare or other measures does not amount to reparations. Victims retain their right to reparations even if they accept interim relief from the State, the report said.
A National Day for the Disappeared, preserving mass grave sites as memorial spaces and restoring Ahinsakaramaya  Memorial for the Innocents - in Battaramulla in a manner that reflects the views of the public as well as the families of the missing and the disappeared were also recommended.
In terms of the Office for Reparations, the OMP said the proposed Office will play a pivotal role in providing redress to victims of the missing and the disappeared as well as others affected by the conflict.
An independent Office for Reparations with a robust mandate and strong implementation powers is urgently required. The OMP urges the Parliament to strengthen the Office for Reparations Bill and ensure its prompt enactment and formulate operations, the report said. (By Lahiru Pothmulla)

Pence, Pompeo deny they  authored resistance NY Times Op-Ed
	

The hunt is on for the senior official behind the anonymous New York Times op-ed that labelled Donald Trump amoral as the president demanded the paper name the author for national security reasons. 
If the gutless anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once! 
U.S. President Donald Trumps vice president and secretary of state on Thursday both said they did not write an anonymous column in the New York Times that asserted that many senior officials are part of a quiet resistance within the administration. 
The opinion column, published on Wednesday, prompted the Republican president to blast the anonymous writer and the news outlet, and further fuelled accusations by critics that Trump was unstable and unfit for the presidency. 
Many senior officials in the administration have been working from within to frustrate parts of his agenda to protect the country from his worst impulses, the anonymous Trump official wrote. 
The Op-Ed sparked a guessing game in Washington about whether the author worked within the White House or a government agency, and raised questions of whether other officials may come forward, step down or be fired. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who previously served as Trumps CIA director, said he was not the author.  Its not mine, Pompeo told reporters during a trip to New Delhi, India. 
A spokesman for U.S. Vice President Mike Pences office also criticized the Times and said Pence does not write anonymous opinion columns. 
The Vice President puts his name on his Op-Eds.

Politics of Cowardice The first-World Church trying to depose our Third-World Pope
	
Current Context
The American Hierarchy has been caught with its pants down. Like the proverbial cat that has defecated on a rock, they are unable to cover up their caca (shit) ----to use the very word Pope Francis employed to describe the repulsive effect of a child-abuse scandal. But quite unlike the Chilean bishops who had the courage and the humility to resign from their episcopal office as an act of repentance and reparation, the American hierarchy has shown cowardice and arrogance in the face of its scandalous failure; and they have demonstrated this in two ways:
One Cardinal (a decent one, I admit) has begged the Pope to cancel the next synodal meeting on Youth because the credibility of the bishops among the teenagers has sunk to an all-time low.The Pope is trying to salvage the youth (the next generation of Christians) from a crisis of faith caused by the culpable negligence of their pastors; now these very pastors, in their pusillanimity, want to avoid being embarrassed before the youth who are now fully informed about how their young colleagues have been preyed upon by these same unscrupulous shepherds. The bishops would evade the unpleasant truth chicken-heartedly rather than face it with repentant hearts; cowardice, not courage.
The other solution is crass treacherous. The devastating revelations of clerical paedophilia in just one State of that country has shocked the American laity so much that many bishops fear a lay uprising. Their spineless strategy is to put the blame on the Pope -- who assumed office only five years ago -- and wash their hands of a crime they have been perpetrating decades before this pontiff was elected! So it is the innocent Pope who has to resign, not the degenerate hierarchs! See what living in the lap of economic comfort has done to these pastors! They cannot even think straight.

The Culprit
The culprit behind the proposed coup against the Pope is Mgr. Carlo Maria Vigano, the Vatican Nuncio to USA. He cannot forget his humiliating departure from the Vatican and his grouse against the pontiff for not decorating him with a Cardinals hat. He has mendaciously accused Pope Francis of covering up the sex-scandals of the ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, despite the well recorded fact that it was Pope Francis, and Pope Francis alone, who severely censured this predator - prelate and even deprived him of his Cardinal status --- a first time event in the whole history of the Church!
But the stakes have now turned against Vigano in a way he had never expected. According to the revelations made by eminent theologians like Massimo Faggioli (Villanuova University) and highly respected investigative journalists such as Andrea Tornielli (La Stampa), it is Vigano who had shamelessly covered up the ignominious sex-scandals perpetrated by the Archbishop of Minneapolis!!! Viganos duplicity is now a public secret!
The next bombshell came from someone whom the conservative US bishops always admired and even favoured as the alleged opponent of Pope Francis, namely Benedict XVI. This retired Pope has dismissed Viganos accusation asfake news and a lie! Hence let me stress that this nuncio is a liar according to the very Pope whom the conservative Vigano-fans hold as the authentic leader of the church!!!
The Popes Strategy
No wonder that Pope Francis refused to respond to Viganos accusation and asked the journalists to do their job properly and find out the truth for themselves, promising that he would add a few words after they had accomplished their duty. He has nothing to fear.We admire his silence, which of course some crafty US bishops have interpreted as an admission of guilt!
It is true that the scrupulous adherence to justice and mercy had made the Cardinal Archbishop Bergoglio of Buenos Aires reluctant to condemn even paedophiles until they were proved guilty beyond doubt; for the vilification of innocent people, who were later found innocent, has taught a bitter lesson to many ecclesiastical superiors. That policy of prudence is a far cry from covering up abuse, which is precisely what the Popes accusers have been caught doing! In fact recently at his mass at Santa Martha he explained (based on the days scriptural reading and the praxis of Jesus) that prayerful silence is the answer to those showing you hatred. Silence was also the Popes response to the despicable poster-campaign organized against him in the city of Rome by a notorious Curial cardinal from USA, covert supporter of Vigano! Hence our suspicion: is there also a political motive for many first-world Catholic leaders to bring disrepute on this Third World Pope

Third World Pope
The first Pope who annoyed the First Worlds right-wing Catholic Churchmen by criticizing the First Worlds economic exploitation of the Third World, was certainly not Pope Francis. It was blessed (very soon St) Paul VI. This Italian pontiffs Populorum Progressio was dismissed by the First World Press as a Philo-Marxist critique of their allegedly successful economic system. PopePaul VI reiterated his uncompromising critique on several other occasions. Church historians have observed that Pope Francis was only continuing the Conciliar Renewal which ceased with Pope Pauls demise. Pope Paul has come alive in Pope Francis. Pope Francis, of course, has been even more blunt and insistent than Pope Paul when hurling this same criticism against economic exploitation by rich countries. For he comes from the Third World and had experienced the effects of such exploitation on his people.
Hence we are amused to hear him being accused of Marxism, a label tagged on to anyone who struggles for economic justice! But Pope Francis seemed even more amused; for his humorous repartee was that whatever good Marx had taught about exploitation of workers was copied from the Bible! It is solely the Word of God in the Bible that guides this Pope whenever he sees, judges and acts. Hence the following observation.

The culprit behind the proposed coup against the Pope is Mgr. Carlo Maria Vigano
	
	Pope Francis was only continuing the Conciliar Renewal which ceased with Pope Pauls demise

Back to the Bible
Back to the origins (reditus ad fontes) was the slogan with which Vatican II was launched. For the church felt it had deviated from its sources. The Wests right-wing Catholic lobby including bishops had forgotten that the biblical narrative does not begin with the Creation Story (which was an important after-thought) but with a Workers Revolt in Egypt and the revelation of a merciful God who took the Workers side in their struggle for justice. According to the New Testament, it was this Gods divine Son who, at the appointed time, was born into a workers family and inaugurated the reign of mercy and justice with a small group of disciples many of whom also came from a worker-background. It is about this God that Pope Francis speaks to the dismay of those Catholic leaders whose Mammon-worship had led them not only to abandon the God of the Oppressed but also oppress Gods little ones.
Furthermore, history has demonstrated that wherever the Church has failed to witness to the revolutionary origin of Judeo-Christianity, it has sinned against Gods poor and has violated the dignity of the most vulnerable humans, i.e., children. We, Asian Christians, must learn a lesson from this crisis in the first world, and renew ourselves, our families, our parishes, our religious congregations and our dioceses as demanded by Vatican II lest we too succumb to the same temptation. There are signs that we are not far away from that pitfall. The Philippine Bishops have already pledged to the Pope that they would take every precaution to avoid it. Other Asian churches must wake up and follow the lead given by Asias most Catholic nation!

Conclusion
There is also another area in which our Third World Pope has antagonized the church leaders and theologians of the de-churched West, namely by severely reprimanding them for failing to feed their flock with Gods Word.From the fruits, you shall know said Lord Jesus. The crisis of faith in those countries is the visible fruit of the self-seeking clericalism of their pastors as well as their bookish theology which is evangelically ineffective and spiritually sterile. Ironically, it is this Argentinian Pope from the Third World who is re-gathering Europes de-Christianized youth while the Wests self-styled theologians, who look for heresies in this Pope, have lost their credibility among the believers entrusted to them. The Third World Pope is, therefore, a thorn in the flesh of failed pastors, who should now examine their own personal histories instead of harassing our lion-hearted pontiff for restoring the original charisma of Christianity in accordance with the renewal programme of Vatican II.

Porcupines in the pangolins niche!
	

A certain Government Department spinning money for the exchequer had been maintaining a holiday bungalow at the periphery for the exclusive use of its employees and their family members.

In fact, the bungalow had been constructed on the initiative of the departments welfare division.
However, security men of a very high political authority who had encroached the bungalow about one and half years ago are said to be still using it with no sign of releasing it for the use of the employees for whom it had been put up.
The departments head finding himself helpless has now virtually written off the bungalow, they say. The dues on water and electricity bills run by this bungalow have now gone into arrears amounting to about Rs. 1 million, nevertheless, the supply of both water and electricity to it continues uninterrupted, informed sources say.

Preventing premature heart attacks
	
                 Patients with diabetes             

It is not uncommon to observe heart attacks in relatively young diabetic patients in our country. By young the author implies those who are less than 60 years of age. Some of them are company executives while the others are professionals and include even doctors. These patients are in the prime of their lives and are supporting young families. What should be noted is that they have reached the top in their professions.The intention of this article is to discuss some preventive aspects of diabetic heart disease (DHD) which hopefully may prevent at least some of these deaths. There is a common saying which goes, Within every patient having diabetes the enemy of heart disease is hiding. 

This problem may worsen in the future in countries such as Sri Lanka where the incidence of diabetes is rising rapidly. In contrast in more developed countries such as the USA, despite a rise in incidence of diabetes, the death rate is decreasing. This could be attributed to several factors such as the availability of modern treatment techniques as well as the knowledge patents possess about DHD. Even in Sri Lanka these facilities are available to those living in major cities such as Colombo (both in the state and private sectors) and in the state sector in Kandy, Jaffna and Kurunegala. 

What is a heart attack
A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked by the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel (coronary arteries) consisting of cholesterol deposits.The clot is formed by platelets, clotting factors present in the blood as well as white blood cells.There are three large coronary arteries supplying the heart muscle with the left coronary being the most important. The next is the anterior descending artery and last is the right coronary artery (please refer to the diagram). A large clot in the left coronary artery would severely affect the area of heart muscle (sometime even death unless unattended) which supplies the chamber (left ventricle) which pushes out almost all the blood to other vital organs such as the brain and the kidneys. 

It has been stated that for every patient with diabetes there is another one who remains undiagnosed and therefore could be subjected to heart attacks without even knowing that they ever had diabetes
The deposition of cholesterol does not occur suddenly, but is a life-long process. In fact such cholesterol deposits are found during post-mortems (Sometimes the deceased are very young children) of individuals who pass away due to some other cause. As with diabetes this occurs even in young adults and affects more than one coronary artery (multi vessel disease). Asians, for example Sri Lankans, are known to have such extensive disease regardless whether they live in their motherland or elsewhere. 

Why do premature deaths occur
When patients are young, unless these individuals are treated properly, they succumb to the first attack. This is largely because the additional coronary vessesl given to us by nature, called collaterals, has not opened up. When these vessel are open and even if there is a clot, the blood could be diverted to these vessels there by preventing the death of heart muscle. In contrast it is quite rarely that an elderly person dies of the first attack. This is because given such a patients age there has been sufficient time for these collaterals to open up. 
What are the factors contributing to the formation of cholesterol deposits in diabetes
Contrary to popular belief it is not the raised blood sugar alone which contributes to this process. In fact there are other important causes indicated below in the order of importance that contributes to this condition.They are high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, high blood sugar, presence of protein in the urine, smoking and family history of DHD. 
This may explain why some patients, who have very high blood sugar levels, dont suffer heart attacks since their blood pressure and cholesterol are well under control and the opposite occurs in those who control their sugar level, but do not attend to the two other contributory factors. 
Recently it has been shown that certain infections too, such as those of the gums (periodontitis) too could be a contributing factor to this condition. 

What really precipitates a heart attack
What was discussed above was only the causes of deposition of cholesterol in the coronary blood vessels, but the factors that really precipitate the attack is largely unknown.What is known, at least little, is the time of the day. Nearly 70% of the attacks occur in the early hours of the morning, say between 2 am and 7 am. The reason for this is a sudden surge in some hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Adrenaline levels could also rise during the other times of the day when there is mental and physical stress (exercise induced heart attacks). 

Could low blood sugar (Hypoglycaemia) precipitate a heart attack
The answer is certainly yes and the author has documented several such cases. When the blood sugar drops for whatever the reason, like due to prolonged starvation, the excessive use of anti diabetic drugs and physical exercise, the same hormones come into play. Sometimes such patients die at night during sleep since there is a tendency for the blood sugar to drop since we dont consume any food during such periods. Some of these heart attacks are silent and the patient does not feel any pain. Thus it is mandatory for us to enquire from the patient whether there were symptoms of low blood sugar such as excessive hunger, sweating, dizziness and palpitations before the onset of the attack. It is therefore advisable for diabetic patients to routinely consume a night time snack to prevent low blood sugar at night. 

What are the symptoms and signs of a heart attack
The commonest symptom is of course chest pain which is felt behind the chest bone, throat and even the back. They also could come with sudden loss of consciousness, difficulty in breathing and palpitations. Experienced physicians could even diagnose a heart attack by the way the patient shows where the chest pain is.This is called the Body language.
The signs (those detected by the Medical officer) include Shock where the blood pressure is very low and the pulse impalpable, low or high pulse rate and signs of acute heart failure. 

Atypical presentations of a diabetic heart attack
1. A fainting attack which may even go unnoticed both by the patient and the doctor 
2. Gastritis- The label that carries a certain kind of danger. So many lives have been lost due to the low attention paid to this symptom. These patients too complain of chest pain over the front of the chest just like during a heart attack which is named as the so called attribution error. During such a condition the patient (and some times the doctor) attribute it to the consumption of a hot meal or another type of spicy food. 
3. A silent heart attack as discussed above is one where there is no pain at all. It has been estimated that nearly 30% of all diabetic patients would manifest such silent heart attacks.This raises the importance of identifying such patients by proper screening methods which would be discussed later. 
It should be also stated that sometimes a heart attack could develop gradually where the symptoms discussed above may come on slowly; say for example chest pain which comes on exertion called angina. 

Emergency treatment for a suspected heart attack
1. Emergency treatment should be carried out at home itself no sooner the patient develops the chest pain. A single dose of aspirin (300 mg) should be immediately administered. Studies have shown that early treatment using aspirin would be as effective as administering clot busting medication such as streptokinase. Another type of emergency treatment that could be administered at home is a cocktail of the following drugs. 
a.Aspirin 300 mg as indicated above 
b.A drug called Clopidogrel =300mg 
c. Atorvastain (a cholesterol lowering drug in a dose of 40 mg) 
d.Pantaprazole- an acid lowering drug which could prevent the occurrence of gastritis caused by such a high dose of aspirin. 
In certain countries this is available as a Heart Pack which could be certainly introduced to Sri Lankan homes too. 

Tests for a suspected heart attack
1.ECG would be very useful, but in some cases the changes would surface after a few hours only.
2. A blood test called Troponin I which too could be positive in a few hours only. Thus the clinical suspicion and all risks associated with suffering a heart attack should be thought of. 
3. If the patient is lucky enough to reach a well-equipped hospital a test called angiography will be carried out and a piece of hollow metal, called a stent, is introduced immediately. This would by pass the block and restore the blood supply. There are some sophisticated ones called drug eluding stents which continue to release drugs given for heart attacks. It is strongly advised that the patient should be transfered to a hospital as soon as possible since timing is very important. Earlier the clot buster medication is given because this would dissolve the clot and prevent further damage to heart muscle. 
Then what about the other easily available tests such as ECHO cardiography and an exercise ECG Among these two the former is used in the acute stage since it is risky to subject a patient with a heart attack to an exercise test. 

Prevention of a heart attack in a patient with diabetes
Identification of those patients, who are at high risk, are of crucial importance. In a developing country such as Sri Lanka it would be very cost effective in meeting the challenge of a later heart attack, for which the treatment could be expensive. Sometimes such conditions are fatal. In this respect it should be remembered that the risk factors for heart attacks enumerated above such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and the presence of protein in the urine too should be corrected. 
Other tests that are done to decide on high risk patients consist of imaging techniques such as CT Angiography and Conventional Angiography. The latter however is considered to be the Gold Standard in identifying high risk patients. 

Prevention of diabetes
Of course prevention of DHD consists first of all preventing diabetes at any level. There are four strategies for prevention. 
1.Primary prevention-That is the prevention of diabetes in the first place by adopting certain lifestyle measures such as diet, exercise and stress relief methods such as meditation. 
2.Secondary prevention- Is the prevention of organ complications in those who have already developed diabetes.This again consists of adopting proper lifestyle factors mentioned above as well as attending to other risk factors such as high blood pressure and blood sugar. 
3.Tertiary prevention- Is lessening of further organ damage in those who already have organs that are affected. 
4.Primordial prevention-There is new evidence that certain people are programmed to survive in an adverse environment such as scarcity of food in environment when they are born underweight. If they are over fed in later life to bring them upto their normal weight called catch up growth. This would later lead to diabetes in this baby when it is older. 

Screening of undiagnosed diabetes
It has been stated that for every patient with diabetes there is another one who remains undiagnosed and therefore could be subjected to heart attacks without even knowing that they ever had diabetes. That is why it is very important to identify these apparently unaffected patients.This is called screening and there are three types: 
1.Universal screening-This involves screening of the whole population for diabetes which is obviously impracticable even in more developed countries. 
2.Opportunistic screening- Screening that is carried out when the opportunity arises such as when they present to a medical officer for another illness. 
3.High risk screening- This is the most important of the screening methods where those who are at a high risk of developing diabetes are identified by a simple blood test. These high risk patients consist of the following; those with a family history of diabetes, those with high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels and those indulging in sedentary occupations.

Screening for prediabetes
This is a recently identified concept and is diagnosed when the fasting blood sugar is between 100mg/dl and 125 mg/dl. Diabetes is of course diagnosed when the blood sugar is more than 126mg/dl.The importance of identifying this entity arises from the fact that it not only leads to overt diabetes later if not properly handled and equally important is that these patients too could sustain complications such as a heart attack or stroke.

Ravi K to get ministerial portfolio
	
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake, who resigned from his ministerial post after coming under scrutiny with regard to the role he allegedly played in the bond scam that came into the open last year, may get a ministerial portfolio once again.
It was reported that the party hierarchy had decided to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on the matter.
A decision was taken by the UNP hierarchy to seek the Attorney Generals opinion on whether a case could be filed against Mr. Karunanayake following a request made by him to the UNP Politburo requesting that justice is done if no court case is to be filed against him.
A member of the UNP Politburo told Daily Mirror that Mr. Karunanayake had also informed them that President Maithripala Sirisena had already told him that he has no objection to him being appointed a minister again.
The party had decided to see whether there is a possibility of re-appointing Mr. Ravi Karunanayake as a minister following a request made to us by him. We have decided to seek the opinion of the Attorney General on this matter, a UNP politburo member said. (Yohan Perera and Anjula Maheeka Weeraratne)

Supreme Court rules gay sex no longer a crime in India
	

New Delhi, (Hindustan Times),6 September 2018 - Gay sex among consenting adults is not an offence, the Supreme Court ordered on Thursday, reading down a British-era section 377 of the penal code that penalises people for their sexual orientation.
Any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation violates fundamental rights, said Chief Justice Dipak Misra, reading out the operative portion of the top courts verdict that struck down Section 377 to the extent that it penalised consensual sexual relationship between two adults. Social morality cannot be used to violate the fundamental rights of even a single individual... Constitutional morality cannot be martyred at the altar of social morality, he added.
In four separate but concurring verdicts, the five judges of the top court ruled that the section failed to make a distinction between consensual and non-consensual acts. Bestiality will also continue to be an offence under section 377.
It had become a weapon for the harassment for LGBT and subject them to discrimination, Chief Justice Misra said.

## Title: The Pohottuwa: Where it is and where it should be

The Pohottuwa: Where it is and where it should be
	

If we conflate the fringe movements of the West with the rise and empowerment of what is now the Pohottuwa, were as mistaken as those pundits who contend that the Rajapaksas should be ignored and cast aside
	
	The Pohottuwa is not the product of this global trend (which is now waning). It is the product of discontent on the cultural plane Not the economic plane
	
	The truth is that the leaders of this government are seen to be flirting with political movements which were displaced by Trump, Farage, and Le Pen, among others:

Back in 2015 when Syriza won more than 70 seats in the Greek Parliament and with it the mandate to govern (with its leader Alexis Tsipras as the president), socialists the world over celebrated the coming of the Global Left. But as Stathis Kouvelakis notes in Syrizas Rise and Fall (in the New Left Review), Syriza erred by moving from a militant party of the left (with a strong culture of internal debate, heterogeneity, involvement in social movements and mobilizations) to a party containing a passive membership and a more active and aggressive leadership.
The result was a mess of a vanguard party system, with the membership playing a pathetic second fiddle to the leadership. The consequences of this were seen soon enough, with no less a figure than Tsipras kowtowing to popular pressure from the European Union and caving into its demands. So much for the Fringe Left.
Gomin Dayasiri, at the launch of Manohara de Silvas Bedumwaadin ge upayamarga saha vivastha sanshodana held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, began his speech by comparing the movement for a more nationalist political party (back then the concept of a third party was only palely being tossed here and there) to the rise of rightwing movements throughout the West: Donald Trump, Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Marine Le Pen. Implicit in his contention was that if the West was seeing a return to traditional values (which was what the rightwing fringe leaders were harping about), there was nothing wrong in aiming at a restoration of the old order in Sri Lanka. Dayasiri made this speech more than a year ago, well before Le Pen and Farage went down and Trumps popularity began to wane.
My point is this: if we conflate the fringe movements of the West with the rise and empowerment of what is now the Pohottuwa, were as mistaken as those pundits who contend that the Rajapaksas should be ignored and cast aside. Where is Trump now Where is Le Pen Where is Farage and where is Johnson More importantly, what was it that led them to clinch power and then quickly lose it
The rise of the extreme right (and even left) in Europe and the United States was the consequence of a cosmopolitan and lotus-eating world order that eschewednational concerns for a mad rush and drive towards globalisation. Centuries ago, Diogenes, the madman who slept in a bathtub on the roads of Greece, proclaimed that he was a citizen of the world. From mercantilism to free trade and to complete globalisation, the madman eventually became a prophet.

"The shift from fringe to centre is a hard shift to make, but if the Pohottuwa is to make a proper, cohesive, comprehensive comeback, it must let go of both those myths: globalism and rabid anti-globalism."
But this prophet, though a darling of world leaders and CEOs of global companies (or, as the Avocado Collective so aptly puts it, sellers of overpriced industrial goods), wasnt taken kindly to by the people, many of whom vented out their fury and feelings of inadequacy by voting for people who not only rebelled against the liberalism of their opponents, but also against the rabid conservatism of their own party. The late John McCain is reported to have criticised Trump for straying away from the old and dear principles of bipartisan compromise which made up American Conservatism. It is this rift, between what is perceived to be good sense in mainstream politics and the populist thrust of the fringe movements, which brought to power, and then displaced, the likes of Trump and Le Pen. They were the inevitable consequence of an electorate that was getting tired of globalisation and multinational finance.
The Pohottuwa is not the product of this global trend (which is now waning). It is the product of discontent on the cultural plane. Not the economic plane. And the reason for that is simple enough: in Sri Lanka, the economic has almost always been taken over by the cultural.

The truth is that the leaders of this government are seen to be flirting with political movements which were displaced by Trump, Farage, and Le Pen, among others: the Democrats in the United States and the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in Britain. Those images of our finance and foreign ministers shaking hands of the likes of Nisha Biswal soon turned sour, and the racist epithets which supporters of the present administration hurled against China soon soured, and (a) we had to go back to China, and ( b) America began undergoing a radial trans-valuation of its economic and cultural landscape after Trumps election.
Still, it is hard to resist the urge to compare the Rajapaksas and their imminent return to power, whether at the fringe or the centre, with whats happening out there in the West. And yet, the imperatives governing both these political trends are different and vastly so. Mahinda Rajapaksa is not Donald Trump and Gotabaya Rajapaksa, despite what commentators like Tisaranee Gunasekara might suggest, is not Adolf Hitler. Added to this is another reason, more subtle and consequently easier to miss.
Political writers and columnists, particularly in the English press, are not a little obsessed with seeing a political context through the lens of Western history. Why else are the Rajapaksas being compared to Caligula and Hitler and, by implicit suggestion, the president and prime minister being compared to Obama and self-righteous liberal world leaders The problem here, however, is that it is not just the supporters of the present administration who are making such grandiloquent claims by comparing the one with the other; it is also the supporters of the Pohottuwa, who have seen the rise of Trump and other extreme right movements in the West as a sign of the second coming of the Rajapaksas. Unfortunately for them, tragically, all they see is the rise of those movements, and not their subsequent fall.
If the Pohottuwa, or the Podu Jana Peramuna, is to forge ahead, it will therefore have to change its propaganda substantially. I am not suggesting that, as per Dr Dayan Jayatillekas suggestion, it moves on and embraces his version of internationalism (Smart Patriotism). In a country with a numerical and ethnic majority that is clearly opposed to such internationalism, not even Fidel Castros anti-Americanism can spur the people and their leaders to affirm globalism from a leftist standpoint. This is not my opinion; whatever my feelings on the matter, the truth is that the people are tired of globalists, whether from the left or right, and that they want a strong leader to make up for the weak government we have at present. You can argue that it is racist, anti-feminist, and anti-everything that liberals hold dear. Whatever argument you make, however, the truth will remain: the people are tired, of concepts and promises.
But then the people are making a mistake. Having repudiated globalism, they eagerly seize on the (perceived) rise of the Global Right as a sign of their return. This is a dangerous myth to indulge in, not least because fringe movements are exactly that: fringe, and therefore doomed perpetually to be in the sidelines. The shift from fringe to centre is a hard shift to make, but if the Pohottuwa is to make a proper, cohesive, comprehensive comeback, it must let go of both those myths: globalism and rabid anti-globalism. The reason is easy enough to guess: we are not the West. We are Sri Lanka. And in being Sri Lanka, we have our own economic, social, and cultural imperatives that defines what the political moment is, or at least should be. The more the Pohottuwa subscribes to this fallacious worldview, the more doomed it will be to remain as a fringe party.

Undertaker had to foot the bill himself!
	

When the head of a small local body died recently, the head of a bigger local body, vowing to give the party colleague a fitting farewell, had handed over the mortal remains to a funeral director to do the needful.

The funeral director had conducted the obsequies putting his resources to the best possible use. And he had later sent the bill to the politico heading the bigger council.
As there was an inordinate delay in paying the bill, the funeral director had tried to contact the politico over the phone without success.
Disgusted, he has now resigned himself to the loss he has to suffer, they say.

US, India announce military drills, tout partnership
	

NEW DELHI AFP Sept 6, 2018 - Top Indian and US officials on Thursday touted deepening ties that will see greater cooperation between the two countries militaries -- and will likely result in India buying more American arms. 
The US has gone to great lengths to forge a closer bond with India as Washington seeks partners to push back against Chinas economic and military rise across the region. 
Indian Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced plans for the US and India to hold major military drills next year. Joining Sitharaman for the talks was Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis.

Despite the friendly tone of the summit, there are plenty of issues India and the US do not see eye-to-eye on. 
India is finalising a deal with Moscow to buy new systems including its S-400 long-range, surface-to-air missiles, but none of the four officials mentioned whether the S-400 issue had come up. 
Under current US rules, third countries could face sanctions if they transact with Russian defence or intelligence sectors.

USAID partners with private banks to boost financing to enterprises
	
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) and two private banks-Hatton National Bank and Sampath Bank-announced a new partnership programme of up to USD 9 million for local financing available to private, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) throughout Sri Lanka.
The USAID Development Credit Authority (DCA) is also a partner of the new programme. The signing of the agreement took place on September 5 in Colombo.
In a statement, the US Embassy said this seven year program will help to address the current lack of financing to these key borrower groups.
This partnership will complement and be further supported by USAID's YouLead program that strengthens employability and self-employment opportunities for youth in Sri Lanka, it said.
Reed Aeschliman, Mission Director for USAID Sri Lanka said the USAID is proud to encourage private sector lending in key sectors that are vital to the economic development of Sri Lanka.
"Increasing access to credit enables youth entrepreneurs to improve their own lives, and helps small and medium enterprises to spur further economic growth in their respective regions," he said.
The program represents a crucial step toward enabling Sri Lanka's private sector and youth entrepreneurs to access capital, expand businesses, and, ultimately, to create more jobs.
Jude Fernando, HNB Deputy General Manager (SME and Mid-Market) said the new partnership between HNB, USAID, and Sampath Bank represents a vital step forward in the collective mission in enhancing economic opportunities for young Sri Lankans.
Meanwhile, Tharaka Ranwala, Senior Deputy Managing Director of Sampath Bank said they welcome this scheme which will provide better access to much required capital for the new entrepreneurs and it aligns well with their entrepreneurship development initiative.
