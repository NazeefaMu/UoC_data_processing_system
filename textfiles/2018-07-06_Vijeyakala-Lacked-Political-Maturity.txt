Vijeyakala Lacked Political Maturity


	



State Minister of Child Affairs Vijeyakala Maheswaran, who stirred controversy by making a statement about the need for an organisation like the LTTE, has not denied the fact that the Tamil people were free when the terrorist outfit operated in the north.   


Her statement made in Jaffna recently affirms that a rebel group like the LTTE is needed if children in the north are to attend school and later return home safely. She has not denied this part of her statement.   


We must not forget that Vijeyakala is now a politician and represents the Unity Government. It seems what she rattled away in a speech is now turning adversely against her. She has said that there was a slip of the tongue during her comments attributed to the LTTE. She said that people were not willing to discard the rebel group from their hearts.   


Since details of the controversial speech went viral in mainstream media the Unity Government has been forced to take action against the minister from Jaffna. Speaker Karu Jaysuriya has already informed the Attorney General to check whether the statements made by Vijeyakala have violated the Constitution or any other law of the country.   


UNP back benchers have demanded the minister be stripped of her portfolio. There was an uproar in Parliament on Tuesday when the joint opposition protested against the statements made by Vijeyakala. The Prime Minister has said that the Government has decided on a course of action to be taken against the controversial minister.   
When taking a close look at the issue it seems that the female Tamil minister lacks maturity. It seems she got carried away when making the speech and forgot for a moment that she was a representative of the Government. 

 
The Tamil community in the north got a second lease of life after the Unity Government assumed power in 2015. Much of their lands have been handed back and Vijeyakala herself has acknowledged this as a positive sign in the Government’s efforts towards solving the issues of the Tamil minority.   


Parts of Vijeyakala’s statement which attribute to the need to create an environment for school children to walk freely are not unsupported. We heard of violent incidents in the north this year where armed groups caused violence in the community. The Sri Lanka Army has shown displeasure over certain elements wanting to pin the LTTE label on these incidents. Even the Defence Minister has ruled out there being threats to national security as far as the north is concerned.   


But concerned citizens can not deny the fact that Jaffna is the heart of the Tamil community and still remains a sensitive spot with regard to the national issue. Recently we heard of the Tamil community wanting to commemorate civilians who died during the the armed conflict. The Government quite rightly allowed that right, but denied anybody to commemorate slain tiger rebels.   


When the Tiger rebels were militarily crushed in 2009 it had an effect of a flat tyre on the Tamil community. This is a country where people of any community have to stage protests, sometimes aggressive ones, to win their rights. Most Sri Lankan Governments have learned through experiences in solving issues of the minorities and have never been known to be proactive. The Tamil community now lacks a powerful leader despite having their very own R.Sampanthan as the Leader of the Opposition.   


Vijeyakala’s role in Tamil politics is important at this stage because she is working alongside the Government in the reconciliation process. The need of the Tamil people now is a political solution and economic development in the north. Vijeyakala must grow with maturity and envisage a future for the Tamils without harbouring thoughts of armed groups coming into operation once again. That past where the LTTE existed is done and dusted. The majority of right thinking Tamils would never wish for an armed struggle even in their dreams!
