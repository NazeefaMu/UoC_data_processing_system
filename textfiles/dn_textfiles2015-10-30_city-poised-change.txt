A City poised for change

Fifty years ago, when Singapore obtained independence, it was barely more than an Asian backwater and founder Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had gone on record saying he wanted Singapore to be like Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in terms of development. But in those intervening 50 years, Singapore has become a global economic powerhouse, while Sri Lanka witnessed a couple of insurgencies and a devastating war that hampered its economic prospects and growth. Now that the war is no more and peace has returned, Sri Lanka could potentially become another Singapore, given its strategic location, investment opportunities, skilled workforce and adequate infrastructure facilities.
It is therefore no surprise that the Sri Lankan Government has looked to Singapore for inspiration and expertise as it seeks to create a Megapolis in the Western Province, on much the same lines as Singapore. It will be a celebration of the City - the City of Colombo - which will be transformed in a massive way along with many other hub towns in the Western Province.
Today, (October 31), the UN-designated World Cities Day, the focus will very much be on the future of the city under the theme "better life, better city - designed to live together".
The challenges of rapid urbanization figure prominently in the UN's newly adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development where Goal 11 embodies a commitment to "make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable".

Megapolis programme
This will thus be an ideal day to reflect on the future of Colombo, our biggest city which is poised for a great change under the proposed Megapolis programme initiated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Singapore urban planning consultants Surbana will help design a plan to turn the capital Colombo's metropolitan region into a modern 'megapolis'. With the help of local experts and agencies, they will complete the design for the Western Region Megapolis Plan covering the entire Western Province from Negombo in the north to Kalutara in the south. Collection of data, preparation of basic designs and legislation have already been completed.
Thus it will have a range of inputs and insights from experts in many fields.
As the World Cities Day theme exemplifies, better cities help people to lead better lives. We hope that the Megapolis project will be able to tackle some of Colombo's biggest problems. The biggest problem is traffic congestion, which has literally choked life in the city. At current rates of vehicle registration in the Western Province, we will soon be crawling along at around 3 km/h on Colombo's congested roads. Since it is virtually impossible to discourage private vehicle ownership in the absence of a good public transport system, that should be a priority for megapolis planners.
Again, we do not have look much further than Singapore for inspiration. It now has a world-class public transport system with a Metro Rapid Transit train system, a very good bus network and a fleet of proper car-based taxis that are all coordinated. In fact, The Land Transport Authority of Singapore expects the number of daily public-transport trips to hit 10 million by 2020. Singapore does have various restrictions on car ownership due to extremely limited space (which may not necessarily apply to Sri Lanka which around 100 times bigger), but there are other measures such as encouraging car pooling which may work well here. The recent entry of Uber, the shared ride service, to Sri Lanka is good omen because it will encourage lone drivers to take a few other passengers along for a fee. Moreover, if the three wheelers in at least the Colombo City limits are taken out of circulation, the traffic flow will be much better and in the alternative, we should have a proper taxi service. The Megapolis plan calls for new railway lines in the Western Province, which is a commendable idea.
Singapore's success story
The other biggest problem is human settlements. Colombo still does have a large number of shanties despite the efforts of all successive governments to build more housing complexes. Singapore's success story in terms of housing is remarkable with more than 80% house ownership. Housing should be a priority area for the Megapolis initiative. While these two aspects of the Megapolis proposal have received wide attention, there should be a bigger focus on energy generation for the Western Province, which consumes much of the country's power output at present. Renewable energy is the wave of the future and the authorities should encourage more such projects, including solar net metering systems for households.
Transport, habitats and energy - all these are ultimately for the benefit of the city dwellers, who should rightly be at the heart of any urban renewal effort. It is thus essential to seek the maximum public participation in the Megapolis project, which has the potential to become a path-breaking project in the whole of Asia.
