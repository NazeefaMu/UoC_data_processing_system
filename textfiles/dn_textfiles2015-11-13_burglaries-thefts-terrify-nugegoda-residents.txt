Burglaries, thefts terrify Nugegoda residents

A spate of burglaries and thefts in Nugegoda area since the beginning of this year has left residents insecure while Police are struggling to get a grip over the situation. Police's inability to arrest the situation has come under fire by residents.
They accuse that the law enforcement authorities are idling. The most recent robbery took place two weeks ago when a house in the 6th lane of Jambugasmulla Mawatha was broken into. But culprits remain at large to date. Theft has become a common occurrence in the Jambugasmulla Mawatha, residents claimed.
Those living in nine by-lanes of Jambugasmulla Mawatha fear that their movements are being watched before thieves make a bid to rob the house.
"They enter houses strategically, in a way that they will not be caught. They rob the same house again after a period of time when they determine it's safe for them. They are one step ahead of every precaution we take," said R. Wickramasinghe, a resident of Jambugasmulla Mawatha, Nugegoda.
He claimed that the people in the area are in danger as robberies continued over the last six to seven months without any attempt to apprehend the escalating trend.
"Robbers take away money and jewellery. More than eight houses had been burgled in our area. Higher authorities should be made aware of the situation. Action should be taken to increase security measures to prevent more residents falling victim to the robbers," Wickramsasinghe said.
Residents claim that in some cases, the same house has been robbed multiple times. They highlight that thieves carefully select which house to break in.
"Most of the houses targeted were without CCTV facilities," said Indragith Udayanga, another resident of the area.
"Not all the houses have CCTV camera facilities. As all the lanes in the area are interconnected, it is easy for robbers to find their way to main roads from these lanes" he said.
The residents claim although Police respond to reports of theft, they hardly carry out further investigations. "There is no progress after", claimed a resident who wished to be anonymous. People complain to Police, but no person connected to the robbery has been arrested. I have accompanied people to the Police station several times, but there is no progress, Chanaka Sanjay, a three wheel driver said.
However, he claims that there is a lull period after a Police visit following complaints.

"But there is no end of burglaries in the area. Police should take steps to reduce it" Sanjay said.
Denying the allegations of Police inaction, OIC, Kohuwala Police I.P Mallavarachchi said a special police team has been assigned to investigate into the incidents occurring in the area.
"Complaints are made by the people, but the problem cannot be solved in one night," he said.
OIC Mallavarachchi said extra measures are being taken to reduce crime rates. The station has sought the assistance of the Police Crime Division as well, he said.
"Investigations are in progress pertaining to many robberies. Suspects with regard to the incidents will bearrested soon," he said. Mallavarachchi said police are taking measures to prevent similar incidents happening in the future. Police officers have been assigned to patrol in the areas where many incidents of crime have been reported. He said precautions will be taken parallel to the investigations.
Police Commission Chairman Profesor Siri Hettige speaking to the Daily News said that many reasons contribute to increasing incidents of crime such as theft and robbery.
However, when dealing with immerging trends unique to an area, demographic and socio-economic factors have to be considered in analysing and solving crimes, he said. The prevention and control should begin from a local level, Prof. Hettige said.
The relationship between local problems and the crimes has to be identified to find a sustainable solution. Different localities, social groups and other social problems in the locality may contribute in different ways to increase trends in crime. Therefore, crime prevention and control may differ from one area to another, he said.
"Addiction to drugs and alcohol appear to be the main causes tempting the people to commit burglaries although they are not the only causes", he said.
He explained that the process and reasons driving the people to commit robbery are many and varied. The economic situation of the people may also influence in increasing robbery, Prof. Hettige said.
