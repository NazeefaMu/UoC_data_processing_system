Leaving them roofless in a ruthless way!


	



 

A female white-collar high-up in the Mahaweli ‘C’ Zone known to be close to a very high political authority has gone on a spree of pulling down some houses in a certain ‘unit’ which have been identified as unauthorized structures.  

 


The female high-up who goes around with a single star-sporting cop in tow would deploy cranes and bulldozers to tear down the houses in the presence of the wailing and weeping displaced occupants even ignoring the legal requirement of obtaining a court order, they say.


Meanwhile, the star-sporting cop would threaten the protesting occupants saying: “I can send you all to jail by a stroke of my pen!”


There is an AL student among the occupants who have now been deprived of a roof over their heads, they say.
