Alumni in unison with Alma Mater Silver jubilee of 1992 batch


	



We, the alumni of President’s College Kotte wish to recall with gratitude on the completion of its 39th anniversary, how it became a great source of inspiration to lead our lives as disciplined and patriotic citizens of mother Lanka. Unreservedly, the entire credit for guiding us to walk on the right path as righteous adults, should be attributed to our whole tutorial staff since its inception, particularly the principals who went the whole hog to bring the school to its present glory. If not for their dedication and commitment, it is needless to mention that we would not have been able to witness its present pinnacle of success.   


It is the first Presidents College in Sri Lanka and was inaugurated by the late executive President  J.R.Jayawardena as his first official task on the independence day of 1978, located at Independence Square as a mixed gender school. It was on June 21st 1983, that the school was moved to the present premises at Sri Jayawardenapura, Kotte. In the year 1990, it was elevated to the rank of a National School. The foundation has been laid for a swimming pool on  21st December 2016.   


Many who have stepped out of the gates of our alma mater have been able to serve their motherland in various capacities and are holding lucrative positions in different fields. We take pride to call ourselves as “Past pupils” of this highly acclaimed school. We were taught to live with humility, simplicity and piety. We are pleased to say that President’s College in Kotte is steadfastly reaching its goal of excellence.   


We, the students of the 1992 batch, having completed 25 years since leaving school, as an offering of gratitude and to mark the occasion,  have decided to provide financial aid to 25 students on February 3rd 2017. This ceremony will coincide with a religious ceremony of  “Chanting Pirith” with the staff and the students of the school in celebration of the 39th anniversary of our school, invoking blessings for the continued success of our school.We have also arranged to reinstate the monumental plaque which was installed at the inaugural ceremony held at Torrington Square on February 4th 1978. The plaque will be unveiled on  4th February, 2017. All the past and present pupils and their parents are kindly requested to grace this occasion and extend their co-operation and assistance as a mark of gratitude. Fortunately for our school, all the principals in succession served with unswerving determination to do their best while continuing all the activities related to upgrading of the school carried out by their predecessors.   


The two institutions of paramount importance directly involved with the moulding of characters of persons are their homes and learning centres. The latter in which we spent the best of our times fulfilled their obligatory role very satisfactorily, and let its memory remain evergreen in us.
