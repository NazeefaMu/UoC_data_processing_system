No cash grant for 3rd child of police personnel


	

The Police Department has informed police personnel not to request the cash grant for their third child anymore because the funding for such a cash grant has not been allocated by the 2016 Budget.
The previous Mahinda Rajapaksa government had in its 2012 Budget proposed the payment of a one-off cash grant of Rs.100,000 to the third child of police personnel.
This facility was enjoyed by armed forces through the previous year’s budget.
Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said police personnel had been informed of the new development following a circular issued by the National Budget Department to the Law and Order Ministry Secretary.
“The circular stated that no funds had been allocated for the cash grant from the budget,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
