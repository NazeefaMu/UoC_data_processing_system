The Highways Ministry today predicted of possible traffic congestion at the exit points on the Southern Expressway during the New Year season between April 08 and 13 and April 15 and 18 and advised the motorists to use alternate exit points to avoid traffic congestion.

The Ministry asked motorists using the Expressway between April 08 and 13 to reach the Godagama exit point avoiding peak hours (from 5.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m.) and to use alternate exit points if it was informed of a traffic congestion at Godagama exit point via Video Message Services (VMS) or other media to avoid possible traffic congestion.

Considerable traffic congestion is expected to occur at the Godagama exit point if many vehicles arrived here in a short period as there are only three exits there.

The Ministry requested motorists to retain the entrance ticket when arriving at the exit point and bring change cash to avoid delays.

Motorists were advised to exit from Pinnaduwa and drive up to Dewata or exit from the Imaduwa exit point and reach Weligama through Kananke, or exit from Kokmaduwa exit point and reach Ahangama and enter Galle road to travel towards Matara.

Heavy traffic congestion is likely to occur at the Kottawa Interchange between April 15 and 18, as vehicles arriving towards Colombo may increase and the Ministry has advised to use alternate exit points avoiding the Kottawa Interchange if notified via VMS of traffic congestion.

Motorists could exit from Kahathuduwa exit point and reach Colombo through Horana road or exit from Athurugiriya exit point and use Malabe-Athurugiriya road or exit from Kothalawala exit point and enter Malabe-Kaduwela road or exit from Kaduwela exit point and enter Colombo-Hanwella road to reach Colombo.

The ministry also advised the motorists to adhere to security procedures when using the expressway specially avoiding driving under the influence of liquor, and exceeding the speed limit of 100 kmph.

The speed limit is requested to be reduced to 60 kmph in rainy conditions. Motorists are advised to stick to the left lane and enter the right lane only when overtaking and return to the left lane after travelling a distance of about 50 metres.

Motorists could obtain information regarding traffic congestion and other matters from the Galanigama Traffic Control Centre by dialling 1969 round the clock. (Ajith Siriwardana)
