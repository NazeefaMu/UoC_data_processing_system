The Government has decided to bring the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital which is affiliated to the South Asia Institute of Technology and Management (SAITM) under the purview of the Health Ministry, the Higher Education Ministry said today.

The Government has also decided to conduct a mandatory examination under the joint supervision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and the University Grants Commission to provide provisional registration for medical graduates who have passed out of SAITM.

The decision was taken in the wake of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) undertaking a token strike demanding the closure or nationalization of SAITM.

The Higher Education Ministry announced that SAITM graduates would be given a further period of clinical training in Surgery, Medicine, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Psychiatry, Paediatrics for one month each in Homagama and Avissawella Hospitals.

The Health Ministry will also gazette the minimum standards required for medical education in Sri Lanka.
