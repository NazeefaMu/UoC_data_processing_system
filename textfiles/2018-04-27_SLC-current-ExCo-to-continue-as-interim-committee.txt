SLC current ExCo to continue as interim committee


	

Acting Sports Minister Faizer Mustapha today said he has decided to name the current Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Executive Committee as the interim committee of the SLC to continue the administrative activities of the board.

He said the decision was taken to set a good precedent because appointing a new interim committee by-passing a democratically appointed committee of office bearers would set a bad precedent. (TK)
