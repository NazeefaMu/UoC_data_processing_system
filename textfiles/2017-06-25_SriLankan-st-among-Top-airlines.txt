SriLankan Airlines, the national carrier of the country, ranked 81st among the Top 100 airlines of the world in 2017.

The Top 100 airlines of this year were selected by the Skytrax based on the votes of airline customers around the world and the list was announced at the World Airline Awards held at Paris Air Show on June 20.

The awards, described as "the Oscars of the aviation industry", are most popular quality accolades for the world airline industry, and a global benchmark of airline excellence, Skytrax said.  

However, SriLankan Airlines ranked 67th among the Top 100 airlines in 2016 and this year it had dropped to the 81st place of the list.

Qatar Airways topped the list as the Best Airline of this year. Singapore Airlines ranked at the second place followed by ANA All Nippon Airways, Emirates and Cathay Pacific respectively.

The Skytrax said the survey covered more than 320 airlines, but it only publishes the Top 100 Airlines.
