Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gamunu Wijeratna today said a huge loss had incurred in the private transport industry due to the recent fuel price reduction.
Mr. Wijeratna said after the minimum bus fare was reduced to Rs. 8, the balance was returned to the passengers whereas the Rs. 1 was not returned when the minimum fare was at Rs. 9.  
“The truth is conductors won’t give the balance to the passengers and they do not return that to the bus operators. Instead of that, now the balance is returned to the passengers and bus conductors and drivers reduce this from the daily collection. As a result it is a burden for the bus owners to continue the industry,” Mr. Wijerathne said.
By reducing the fuel price, mainly Petrol prices; most of the people travel in their own motor cars and motorcycles. That reduces the daily income from the buses, he further said.(Chaturanga Pradeep)
