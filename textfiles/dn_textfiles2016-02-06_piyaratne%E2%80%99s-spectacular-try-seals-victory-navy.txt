Piyaratne’s spectacular try seals victory for Navy

A spectacular try by ex D.S. Senanayake schoolboy and Sri Lanka under 20 wing three quarter Buddima Piyaratne gave Navy SC a close 17 points (2 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) to 15 (2 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) win against a fighting Air Force SC in their Dialog ‘A’ Division Inter-Club League Rugby second round match played at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana yesterday. The winners led 10-8 at half time.
Air Force dished out a superb second half rally where they came from behind 10-17 down to hold Navy to a close 17-15 , but four missed penalties by centre Charith Seneviratne cost them the match.
The match got off to a fabulous start with both teams engaged in a battle for supremacy with Navy drawing first blood when their full back ex Dharmaraja College player Thilina Weerasinghe fired across a 40-metre penalty. Navy went in to a 3-nil lead.
Within a short period of play Air Force outside centre Surya Krishan touched down for a try off a beautiful three quarter move. The conversion was missed by centre Seneviratne. Score 5-3 in favour of Air Force.
Just when the half time was nearing former Josephian prop forward Stefan Gregory barged over for a try off a typical Navy rolling maul. Weerasinghe made a fine conversion and Navy went into a 10-5 lead.
Air Force immediately reduced the lead to 10-8 when centre Seneviratne put over a 35 metre penalty to make it 10-8 at half time.
Soon after the break winger Piyaratne scored a fabulous try off a superb three quarter move brushing aside several oncoming Air Force defenders. Wijesinghe once again made the conversion and Navy led 17-8.
In the dying stages of the game Air Force winger Kaushal Manupriya scored a try off a beautiful three quarter move. Centre Seneviratne put over the conversion to cut down the deficit to 15-17. Air Force carried out several counter attacks against the Navy side to score the match winning try, but the gallant sailors held onto their defence firmly till the final whistle to seal the match in style.
