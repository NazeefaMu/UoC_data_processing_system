I come from a village and act based on good behaviour and ethics. I can’t allow anyone to walk naked on the road. I would not allow anyone who embrace and regard the foreign cultures with esteem to degrade the greatness of the nation and proud culture of the country,” he said.

	He also said everyone should unite and work together to elevate the country in the global sphere by introducing our innovations and skills based on our traditional heritage.
	At the function, a large number of skilled handicraft artisans were presented awards in appreciation of their skills.
