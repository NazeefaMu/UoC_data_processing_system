REUTERS, 07th MAY, 2017- British Prime Minister Theresa May maintained her strong lead in opinion polls ahead of next month’s national election, with one analyst saying she was on course for the kind of huge success Margaret Thatcher enjoyed over 30 years ago.


May is asking voters to strengthen her hand as she seeks a mandate for her plan to implement the result of last year’s Brexit referendum by quitting the European Union’s single market.
