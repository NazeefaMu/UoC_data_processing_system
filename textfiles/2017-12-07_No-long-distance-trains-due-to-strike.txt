Long distance trains would not be operating from the Colombo Fort Railway station today, due to a 48-hour strike launched by the Locomotive Engineering Operators’ Union (LEOU), the Railway Control Room said.

Only office trains were operated this morning, they said.

“Several trains were operated this morning to facilitate people who came to office in Colombo and suburb. Not a single long distance train was in operation from Colombo Fort,” the Control Room said.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, spokesman of the LEOU said the strike was launched midnight yesterday demanding the government abolish the act that used to recruit Assistant Engine Drivers at a higher salary scales as it went against the existing Railway recruitment procedure.
