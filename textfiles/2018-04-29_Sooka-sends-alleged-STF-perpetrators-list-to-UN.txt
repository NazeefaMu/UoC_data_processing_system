The International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP) headed by Yasmin Sooka has prepared a list of names of 56 Sri Lankan Special Task Force (STF) personnel whom it said should be barred from serving in UN peacekeeping missions.

Sooka was one of the three-members of the panel of experts appointed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to advise him on the alleged human rights violations during the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka. The report compiled by the panel is known as the Darusman Report.

In a statement, the ITJP said the individuals named in the list are either alleged perpetrators or were involved in frontline combat in the final stages of the war when the UN says systemic crimes were committed by security force units, including the STF. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
