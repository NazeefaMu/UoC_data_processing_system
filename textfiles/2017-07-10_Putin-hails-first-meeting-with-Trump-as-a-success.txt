Hamburg, (Daily Mail), 8 July 2017 -  Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed his first face-to-face meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, saying Saturday he thinks Trump accepted his assurances that Russia didn’t meddle in the U.S. presidential election and that their conversation could be a model for improving ties between the two countries.  


Speaking to reporters after the two-day Group of 20 summit in Germany ended, Putin said he and Trump had a long discussion about the allegations of Russian interference in last year’s election that have dogged Trump’s presidency.  


The Russian leader said he reiterated his ‘well-known’ position that ‘there are no grounds’ for the allegations.’He asked many questions, I tried to answer them all,’ Putin said. ‘It seems to me that he has taken note of that and agreed, but it’s better to ask him about his attitude.’
