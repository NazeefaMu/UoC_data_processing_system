Celebrity make-up artist Jake Bailey dead at 37

Selena Gomez and Katy Perry's make-up artist Jake Bailey has died in an apparent suicide.
Bailey's body was discovered by his assistant at his Los Angeles home on Friday (23Oct15). Emergency services were called to the scene, but the 37 year old could not be revived.
According to TMZ.com, officials suspect he succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning.
No further details about the tragedy have been released, but an autopsy is expected to be conducted by the LA County Coroner. Bailey, who also worked as a photographer, was best known for his work with Gomez and Perry, and helped take care of the Firework singer's look for the 2015 Super Bowl Halftime Show in February (15). He also styled the likes of Mariah Carey, Katie Holmes, Kyra Sedgwick and Jenna Dewan Tatum, while his clients have also included Nina Dobrev, Paris Hilton and Lea Michele.
A rep for Bailey with Starworks Artists issued a statement to ET on Friday following the tragedy.

"He was an undeniable talent, a great friend, a loving son and brother, and our grief is shared with all those whose lives he's touched.

Jake was a mentor to many, and his work will continue to inspire. He will be truly missed by those who knew him."
Shameless star Emmy Rossum led the tributes to her friend on Twitter. "I am gutted to hear of my friend Jake's passing," she wrote. "I saw him on Sunday, we flew together on a plane. He made me laugh as always.
