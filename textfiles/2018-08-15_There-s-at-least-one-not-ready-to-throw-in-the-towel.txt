There’s at least one not ready to throw in the towel!


	



 

Verbal battles have been breaking out one after another within the JO for some time.  The battle that raged more furiously than the others was that between the Master Brain of Pohottuwa and the big-mouthed Panchaudha. 

 


The former strongman finding that the exchange of fire was going too far, called all protagonists for a peace powwow. 


The former strongman told both parties that their battle had taken an ugly turn and it was high time that they put an end to it. He also mentioned the name of a party stalwart from the upcountry as one pushing Panchaudha from behind. 


The former strongman was telling them in a harsh tone that that their job was to fight it out with the government and not fight among themselves when Panchaudha interposed: “You are quite right, Sir. Here I am holding aloft a white flag!”


The Pohottuwa’s Master Brain too declared that he too was for making peace and that marked the end of their verbal battle. 


However, the JO members say in hushed tones that not even their boss would succeed in forcing their Kalutara colleague raising a battle cry these days to throw in the towel!
