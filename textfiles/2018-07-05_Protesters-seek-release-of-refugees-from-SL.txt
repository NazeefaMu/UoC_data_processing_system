Activists have vowed to continue staging protests to seek the release of 11 Sri Lankan refugees awaiting deportation in Johor, Malaysia Nan­ban reported.

They are part of a group of 131 people held on June 24 off the coast of Kota Tinggi while trying to reach New Zealand by boat from Sri Lanka.

After being brought to a court in Kota Tinggi, 120 of the refugees were freed but the other 11 were sent to a detention camp in Pekan Nanas and ordered to be deported.

A 15-month-old boy in Karna­taka, India, died after he accidentally swallowed a pressure whistle, Malaysia Nanban reported.

The boy was at home with his grandmother, who was cooking dinner. She left the pressure cooker open and he crawled near the lid, pulled off the whistle and swallowed it.

After failing to pull it out, the grandmother took the boy to a clinic where the whistle was removed, but he developed breathing difficulties.

The family then rushed him to a hospital, but he died on the way. (The Star Online)
