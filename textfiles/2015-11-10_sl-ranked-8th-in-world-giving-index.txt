Sri Lanka has moved up a notch and ranked at eighth place in the 2015 World Giving Index (WGI), the UK based Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) reports.
The index which looks at charitable behaviours of 145 countries including the tendency of helping strangers, donating money and volunteering was compiled by the CAF. Sri Lanka was ranked ninth last year.
Myanmar has been ranked first in the index followed by the US, New Zealand, Canada, Australia and the UK. According to WGI, Burundi is the least charitable country followed by China, Yemen and Lithuania.
Sri Lanka has scored 60 percent in the sub category of helping a stranger and 48 per cent at volunteering time.
India has ranked 106th, Pakistan at 94th, Afghanistan at 84th, Nepal at 76th, Bhutan at 17th and Bangladesh at 95th places at the index.
Several notable findings of this year’s index include a rising trend in donating money and helping a stranger while volunteering has recorded a minor downturn. For the first time in six years, the World Giving Index has revealed that men are more likely to donate money than women.
“Behaviour in a few very large countries has significantly impacted the numbers of people giving worldwide. Cultural and religious practices as well as disruptive events, are at the root of a number of big changes seen this year. Despite their highly developed economies, only five G20 countries are in this year’s Top 20, reminding us that economic prosperity does not automatically lead to a rise in generosity,” the index report said.
