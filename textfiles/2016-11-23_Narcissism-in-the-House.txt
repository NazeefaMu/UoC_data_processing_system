Narcissism in the House


	



 

There are occasions when the proceedings in the august assembly are televised live and it invariably happens whenever a VIP either from the government or the opposition takes the floor. Whenever such a key figure rises to his feet to address the council, there are three young members who have made it a habit to scramble for the vacant seats behind the speaker expecting to get into the focus of video cameras to be turned on him.

 


This mad scramble by the young narcissistic members though frowned upon by some, provides much amusement to the senior members of the council.


Leading the narcissistic trio is a fresher from Gampaha. The other two hail from Kurunegala and Uva respectively, they say.
