Come out on top!

Life is full of possibilities. When one door closes, another door opens. If you see a door that is half closed, remember that it is also half open. That is an opportunity not to be missed.
If you have done really well at the G.C.E. A/L, you will most probably enter a State university. I wrote "most probably", because you could miss out on university by a whisker, even if you have good marks due to the quirks in the selection process. On the other hand, if you have not done all that well, the university route will be closed to you. But that is not the end, because there are so many other opportunities that open up from vocational education to job placements, if you look keenly.
However, there is one factor that will help you regardless of whether you enter university or not - a good knowledge of the English language. It is essential in today's fast moving, commercialized world. If you scan any vacancy advertisement, it invariably calls for an excellent command of the English language. While not everyone will be able to achieve such lofty heights, at least a good working knowledge of English, known in common parlance as "Kaduwa", is an essential requirement.
It will therefore help you later in life if you make an effort to improve your knowledge of the English language. From reading books and newspapers to speaking in English with people known to you (who will not laugh at you for any mistakes), it is relatively easy to do so. There are many resources on the Internet which helps you to learn English at your own pace. Having a good command of English will definitely help you in a job interview and for following a higher education course. And if you already do have a very good command of English, why not move on to another language, such as French, Japanese or German ? Knowing any other foreign language is an advantage in today's society from a personal and professional point of view.
Did you know that some companies (and educational institutions) also value general knowledge ? For example, if you know the name of the man who had to stay in orbit (Michael Collins) while his two colleagues (Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin) explored the surface of the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969, it shows that you have read about the wider world. Do you know the capital city of Madagascar (Antananarivo) ? Do you know when the Magna Carta was signed ? (1215) These are just a few examples. In fact, many companies now request prospective job seekers to face a test which contains several general knowledge questions in addition to the usual aptitude questions.
This way, companies are making a statement - that they want to recruit individuals who have not only 'book knowledge' but also real life knowledge. Again, the Internet is the best resource for getting a dose of general knowledge, but do not dismiss conventional printed books, newspapers and magazines.
If you have done your A/Ls, you have to proactively seek job and career fairs and higher educational opportunities. There are a number of well known career fairs which can point you in the right direction. The experts at these fairs are usually able to guide you in the proper direction, depending on your educational background and requirements/expectations. Moreover, foreign and local educational institutions regularly hold exhibitions and seminars here, so it does not hurt to attend them. Do not always worry about money - foreign education is certainly expensive, but if you are lucky, you may be able to receive a full or partial scholarship.
In the meantime, it also helps if you can follow another course, perhaps totally opposite to what you were planning to enroll for at university or another educational institution. For example, why not follow an accountancy course if you are intending to study law ? It is a difficult proposition, of course, but this will one day give you an unbeatable combination. Today, companies look for multifaceted individuals - those with a 360 degree view - to helm certain positions and having multiple qualifications will give you a good head start.
All of us have heard the old saying that urges us to "take life as it comes". Sometimes that may be the best thing to do, because certain things happen for a reason. Ultimately, it may lead to good prospects for you. There are many people here and abroad who either totally missed out on university or dropped out halfway, only to become leading figures in a variety of fields. Life throws many challenges at us, but if you know how to face them with confidence, you can come out on top, victorious. You can gain the upper hand if you have poise and confidence.
