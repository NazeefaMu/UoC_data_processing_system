A powerful purohita the other day openly vented his spleen on a colleague for the being the ‘villain’ responsible for the loss of his much cherished portfolio. He also said that this colleague who undercut him would never be able to win at an election. He vowed, “I am going to expose all misdeeds the man has committed since entering the council through the charity list.”

 


What is significant is that both these purohitas belong to the Green party. 


By the way, a group of purohitas were engaged in small talk following a recent weekly meeting of the top team, when a colleague asked the so called ‘charity list’ purohita why was it being repeatedly told that he would never be able to win a seat by a popular vote.


The ‘charity list’ purohita immediately replied: “Don’t take what he says seriously Machang! I can win a seat from any district in the country. By the way, what was his showing at the last polls? He lost to both Harsha and Sujeewa. Let him cover his nudity before finding fault with my dress!”


The group greeted this angry comment with laughter.
