One of the six doctors suspected of being involved in the kidney transplant scandal is a member of the GMOA, Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said yesterday.
“This particular doctor, who is practicing in a Colombo hospital, is alleged to have been involved in the international kidney-selling scam. But, the allegations have not been proved nor have they been made by official or reliable sources,” he said.
Dr. Aluthge said that in the wake of social media reports, the GMOA had checked with the Health Ministry whether the name of this doctor was in the suspected doctors' list and on receipt of ministry confirmation, the GMOA had found that he was one of its members.
“He is one of the 20,000 members countrywide and does not hold any positions in the organisation, neither is he a GMOA Central Committee member nor a member in any of the Branch Unions. We have decided to take disciplinary action against him if he is found guilty of the kidney racket,” Dr. Aluthge said.
“At the previous news conference a journalist asked whether it was this particular doctor who is alleged to be involved in this racket. We were unable to confirm the name or give any details because nothing has been proved yet and the allegations have only been made via social media websites,” he said
The GMOA in turn accused India of attempting to tarnish the image of the Sri Lankan doctors, especially the GMOA because it opposed the proposed CEPA agreement between Sri Lanka and India. (Piyumi Fonseka)
