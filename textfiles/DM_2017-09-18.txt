Are you a sleep procrastinator
	
Sleep experts say our devices are keeping us awake for longer, which affects our sleep and health. So why on earth do we do it
What was the last thing you did before drifting off last night You were probably on a device: reading emails, surfing the web or checking social media.
Youre not alone. A study by the National Sleep Foundation estimates 48% of American adults use gadgets such as tablets or laptops in bed and studies in other countries show this is even more prevalent among younger adults.
But snuggling up with electronic devices is ruining your sleep: keeping you up later and waking you more frequently during the night. More research has shown that night time use of technology can have a detrimental effect on ability to cope with stress, self-esteem and general mental health. Without sufficient sleep, youre less productive at work and long term health can suffer but few seem able to resist. So why do we do it

Sleep, interrupted
Unlike reading and TV, modern gadgets are interactive rather than passive. Their connectivity to the outside world intrudes into the bedroom, a place that has historically been somewhere private to unwind and forget about a hectic day.
These devices are causing sleep procrastination, says Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.
Experts say we need between 30 minutes and an hour of preparation before going to sleep to give our minds a chance to unwind from the stresses of the day. Things like reading a book, having a hot drink or doing a repetitive task like counting sheep all help.
 When we pick up our phones, we are undoing that preparation our brains need by extending the day into the night-time hours
But, says Walker, when we pick up our phones, we are undoing that preparation our brains need by extending the day  together with all the stress and worry from it - into our night-time hours.
We might feel perfectly sleepy and could drop off easily if the power went out and our phones didnt work, he says. But when we pick up these devices it allows us to put off sleep. Often people will get into bed, someone will ping them on Facebook or send an email, and before they know it 20 to 30 minutes has gone.
Sending a text message, posting something on Facebook or checking your email means you are waiting for a response and revs up your emotional nervous system. Then once you put it down by your bedside, if you leave the phone on, there are all the pings, dings and other sounds that can wake you up during the night.
It appears there is a marked difference between staying up late with a good book or watching television in bed and using smartphones, tablets and laptops. The way we interact with electronic devices allows them to eat into far more of the time we should be asleep, according to researchers.

For example, the blue light given off by many electronic screens can alter the release of a hormone called melatonin, which helps regulate sleep, and can throw the bodys internal biological clock out of sync.
Cant put it down
Ben Carter, a biostatistician at the Institute of Psychiatry at Kings College London, has spent the past few years studying the impact of technology on sleep and has uncovered strong associations between the use of portable electronic devices in the bedroom and poor sleep.
Carter says we have allowed ourselves to sleepwalk into a situation where we are in bed with our technology and it is controlling us, he says. There is no question that can have long-term impacts on the quality of our sleep.
So, given the harm this can do, whats going on Carter likens the device behaviour to smoking.
If it is something you do last thing at night and first thing in the morning, then you are probably addicted, he says. According to Carter, being able to access information and engage with others around the clock is so pervasive to our knowledge-hungry, social brains that it can even affect those who should know better.
Much like smoking, chronic phone use can be an addiction (Credit: Getty Images)
I talked recently with a professor of addiction who told me he wakes up in the night to check the American newspapers on his phone, says Carter. I also know I shouldnt check my phone before bed, I don't want to do it, but it is actually very hard to detox.
Sleep experts believe that, like quitting cigarettes, we must learn to wean ourselves off our gadgets at night so we feel comfortable leaving them in another room.
 Just the presence of the device in their bedrooms was affecting their sleep
The National Sleep Foundation in the US found a fifth of people it surveyed were woken up by their devices in the night and half of those then picked them up to use them.
Carter conducted a review of 20 studies into the impact of technology on childrens sleep patterns, finding even those who did not use phones or other devices before bed but had them in their bedrooms, slept less deeply than those who left their devices in another room.
Just the presence of the device in their bedrooms was affecting their sleep, says Carter. These children were still cognitively engaged with their devices.
Just having an object that creates a sense of anxiety in your bedroom will actually change the quality of your sleep, says Walker. Worrying about something happening the next day, such as giving an important presentation at work, has been shown to not only keep people awake at night but also decrease the amount of deep sleep they get when they do drift off.
Deficiency and addiction
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US says that 35% of American adults are not sleeping enough, an increase from 29% ten years ago. To put this in perspective, the CDC now estimates 70 million US adults are sleeping less than six hours a night. This, it says, is leading to an epidemic of people struggling to concentrate or remember things at work. Insufficient sleep is also implicated in an increased risk of car crashes and industrial accidents.
Further sleep deficiency has been linked to a wide range of health problems, from heart disease and obesity to diabetes and depression.
 It is perhaps the biggest unaddressed public health issue of our time - Colin Espie
It is perhaps the biggest unaddressed public health issue of our time, says Colin Espie, professor of sleep medicine at the University of Oxford. Sleep is essential for a wide range of functions that serve our health and well being.
Yet surprisingly, Walker says technology itself may hold the answer to regulate our night time slumbers. There are already many gadgets on the market that claim to monitor and aid sleep. And Walker hopes to use machine-learning technology to produce new ways of intervening if someone is not sleeping properly.

It should be possible to produce a precise sleep prescription for each person to improve their sleep, he says. It could look at your calendar for the next day and suggest that because you have an early morning call in the morning, it might be worth getting ready for bed now so you can get enough sleep.
Similarly, he suggests that algorithms could also gradually adjust our bedtime over several weeks to help us prepare for trips abroad and combat jet lag.
There is no doubt that sleep has been desperately disrupted by our gadgets, says Walker. But I also think technology could be our salvation by helping to correct our sleep too.

The convocation also witnessed 62 existing associate members being conferred the FCA, thus elevating them to the highest stratum in their professional careers as chartered accountants.
Addressing the new ACAs and FCAs, CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said chartered accountants are known as contemporary professionals, who have to remain relevant at all times and be conscious of the local and global trends, standards and as well as challenges.
So whether you are an ACA or FCA, your thirst for knowledge must continue and you must continue to develop yourself professionally with the assistance of the continuous professional development programmes the institute organises for the benefit of all members, he said.
Wickremasinghe said that being a professional is a privilege and it will bring both challenges and rewards. However, above all, being a professional is a responsibility and one must execute ones responsibilities diligently and ethically, at all times, no matter how challenging the situation is. 
The success of our profession ultimately depends on the respect that we, as chartered accountants, gain and continue to gain. We are in demand because we are good at what we do and because we discharge our duties ethically and respectfully. So, as guardians of the accounting profession, dont ever compromise on your values, Wickremasinghe urged.
Bathiudeen in his congratulatory message commended the institute for propagating the importance of this qualification to every part of Sri Lanka, thereby affording the opportunity to the youth in the country to realise their professional dreams.
Weerakkody said that as associate members, the new chartered accountants are now well geared to enter the corporate world and conquer it.
Forge ahead and contribute positively towards developing the economy of our country. Be an innovative thinker and enhance your contribution to achieve economic development and sustainability of the organisation you are associated with, he said.
Lanka Tiles PLC Managing Director Mahendra Jayasekera said that the CA qualification opens doors to new vistas and would give the necessary confidence to the new members to embrace their professional journey with the opportunities and challenges thrown at them.

## Title: Is it the footprint of God Natha

Is it the footprint of God Natha
	
The first Kumbal at Pasgama.The Perahera, where the Kapu Mahatmaya carries the emblem of God in his right hand throughout the Perahera.
The Pitisaraa or Provincial Devale Peraheras have commenced in the Hills. These processions or Peraheras have been the forerunners of the Peraheras in the country.
People in the villages flock for these Peraheras in order to visit the Devale area itself before the Perahera begins for the day.
A footprint depicted to be of God Natha has been retrieved in the premises of Pasgama Natha Devale in the Hewaheta District. At the moment it is surrounded with a yellow covering and a suitable environment is to be built around this find according to the Basnayake Nilame D Udurawana
This stone which was near a mango tree had been there for centuries, but no one seems to have taken any notice of this stone or the imprint on it, yet with the developing Natha Cult , this has come to the fore. God Natha also has no-form , no-shape and is generally associated with the future Buddha. The coming of God Natha to this country and his worship is an unknown entity, as there is no specific period that he had visited or has come to the country or to Kandy. There is an up and coming attitude towards God Natha. The Pitisara Devale Peraheras in the Kandy District commenced on the 31st night with the Kumbal Perahera and are scheduled to end by the eleventh, and some on the twenty second with Day Peraheras.
The first Devale to be built with the founding of Senkadagalapura.
God Natha has neither form nor shape, but his fame is to help people and avoid any conflict with anyone as he is to be the next Buddha as Maithree Buddha or sometimes called the Avalokesvaa Buddha.
God Natha does not belong to any provincial cult of Gods nor to any Hindu pantheon. His arrival is a mystery, but his first place of abode is attributed to be in Dorawaka in the Warakapola District of the Province of Sabaragamuwa. While he was residing in the area God Pitiye requested God Natha that he too, must reside in the same place. God Natha refused and with this God Pitiye found that the only way to send him off was to kill cattle, eat their flesh and also to see to it that the bones of these animals were thrown at him to get rid of God Natha from the area.
God Natha, whose mission was to be Maithree Buddha developed a strategy of moving away from the area that offended him. So God Natha moved on to the Central Hills and to Vehgiriya at Embekke. God Pitiye went after God Natha and wanted him to accommodate him at Vehgiriya. God Natha refused and he acted in the same manner as at Dorawaka. God Natha moved out from the area and went to Dodamwela in the present Yatinuwara electorate. Here too God Pitiye began to develop the same attitude towards God Natha. God Pitiye who was notorious for bringing disaster more than favours used these systems to drive God Natha out of any area that he lives.
God Natha complained to the mighty God Sakra and he is believed to have advised God Pitiye to leave God Natha alone and find a suitable place as his abode. But, that did not deter him and God Pitiye continued to enjoy in his tactics to drive God Natha from place to place as a beggar.. God Natha, was not afraid of the attitude of God Pitiye, yet his mission and vision were to be Maithree Buddha. He then moved to Gonawatte in Haragama. This area is full of deer. Now taking this opportunity God Pitiye came to God Natha and demanded that he moved out of Gonawatte. But, God Natha refused. There upon, he adopted the same methods at Dorawaka, instead of cattle, he killed deer, ate their flesh and threw the bones at God Natha.
Being a God with mannerisms of purity and to become Buddha, God Natha moved away to find a far-off place at Pasgama. On his route near the present Kande Junction, the intersection between Hanguranketha and Talatuoya, he came upon an old man clearing up a plot of land.
He changed into the form of a human and asked him to show the closest way to Pasgama. The old man went with God Natha thinking he was a human. At Pasgama, God Natha took his own form-that of no shape or form-and called upon the old man to inform all and sundry in the village that God Natha has come to reside in the village. Further he took the stick that was in the hand of the old man and stuck it on the ground and said that they should construct an abode for him. This information was passed on to Bhuvenka Bahu IV and he directed that a Devale be constructed in the place he planted the stick. But, where he first stood is considered to be the stone on which there seems to be some print of a heel.
But God Natha through his powers knew that his task had to be accomplished at Senkadagalapura and set up an abode on Dharmaraja Hill. From there he set foot to the present abode at the Natha Devale premises in Kandy. So God Natha got himself established in this sacred ground, where the oil anointing ceremony is held every year and which John DOyly records. The Natha Devale also plays a specific ritual in the naming of a new King. 
There is no crowning in the Kandyan Kingdom. The new King selects his name at Natha Devale and from there he shouts his name looking towards the Sri Dalada Maligawa standing on a stone (Which is now used as a flower stand). According to Professor Dhammaloka Thera who lived at the Natha Devale Temple, he was of opinion that the Cheitiya close to the Sri Dalada Maligawa was built over the Begging Bowl of the Buddha. It is a known fact that the Begging Bowl always was with the Sacred Tooth Relic. Professor Dhammaloka Thera time and again pointed out that the begging bowl of the Buddha should be in one of the two Chasitys on the grounds of Natha Devale.

No contradicts in report, GMOA can disscuss with me anytime: Harsha
	
While rejecting the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) claims, Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha De Silva who was also the Chairman of the Presidential committee on SAITM said there were no contradicts in the report recommendations and the GMOA can discuss the matter with the minister at any time.
He said that the GMOA claimed the committee has no intension of repeating the decision to stop student enrollment as it already there was not mentioned in the report but in a annex which includes replies of the Higher Education Ministry for proposal made by the deans of the medical faculties.
What the GMOA says contradictory is not mentioned in the report but in an annex of it which the Higher Education Ministry has sent. Therefore I cannot make any comment of that but I can assure the committee has done its fullest justice to resolve this matter, he said.
He also said the committee does not has a legal authority to stop student enrollment directly but following the report was handed over on Monday (11) as a result on Friday (15) the higher education ministry secretary had officially informed to halt the SAITM student enrollment.
Replying to statement rose by GMOA how a non profitable structure would become a Private Public Partnership the minister replied that the top 10 medical institutes in the world including Harvard university and Princeton University are private universities but also none profitable ones.
Let the financial experts to make the structure suits for SAITM, he said.
Also minister said that GMOA had doubted on legality of the presidential committee as a representative of Attorney General Department had represent on behalf of the Attorney General.
Minister said that there is no legal boundary for participate a representative as the President appointed person finally bears the responsibility. AG is a very busy person. I dont see it as an issue. But finally it is AGs responsibility, minister added.
Further he said the GMOA claimed that the SAITM transactions should be audited by the Auditor General for find any financial misappropriation took part and he has no issue on such move.
I too agree with it. This should be done in a 100 percent transparent manner. We are not against to involving the Auditor General for this matter, minister said.
Also the minister said the committee had made impartial recommendations for the issue and if the GMOA has any doubt they can contact the minister and discussed over the matter.(Thilanka Kanakarathna)

SAITM: GMOA says not too optimistic about committee report
	
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) said today it was not too optimistic about the Presidential Committee Report on SAITM on the basis that the report contradicted the committees recommendations.
It said the committee report contained grave errors and the GMOA had appointed its own committee to study the entire report of the presidential committee before arriving at a final decision.
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference the committee had concluded that SAITM had stopped student enrollment and therefore there is no reason why it repeats that recommendation.
Even though the committee says SAITM has stopped student enrollment, Dr Neville Fernando told a newspaper that he has accepted 300 more applications. GMOA had earlier requested the authorities to issue a legal order banning student enrolment until this matter is resolved, he said. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Where are the dark skins
	
Contributions of colonial soldiers of the British and their allies have been largely neglected by fiction writers, film makers and even documentaries. 
Writing about Christopher Nolans film Dunkirk, British writer Sunny Singh has made a very pertinent comment. Its an all-white British army (BEA or the British Expeditionary Force) against an all-white German army. Theres no trace of the Royal Indian Army Services Corp companies, who were responsible for transporting supplies over areas where the BEAs wheeled transport could not go. In other words, they did the coolie work, but you dont see any of them in the film. 
The French army too, had large numbers of soldiers from its colonies. Moroccans, Algerians, Tunisians and others were present at Dunkirk. They were among the last to be evacuated, facing greater danger of death or capture as the Nazis were more likely to deal with them summarily. But, apart from a few non-white faces seen in the crowd scenes, the narrative leaves them out altogether. 
While Nolan may have had no intention of deliberately omitting the colonial part of this story, it is true that WW II histories give the impression that it was entirely a white mans war (except in Asia and the Pacific). 
Even documentaries and written histories of the conflict have omitted the contribution made by Indian and other colonial soldiers on the Allied side. There are German propaganda photos of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel inspecting Indian soldiers of the Free India army in France, but their role seems to have been forgotten entirely. 
The British India Army, formed in 1895, existed till 1947 and served in 16 wars and campaigns including both World Wars. These include the Second Opium War (China), the British Expedition to Abyssinia (Ethiopia), and the Boxer Rebellion (China). 
The BEA numbered 1,750,000 during World War I and 2,500,000 in World War II. It was the largest volunteer army in history. Considering that the total German forces for the invasion of Russia numbered only 3.8 million personnel (including Romanian, Spanish and Italian allies), this is a considerable number. 
Sri Lankans too, served in British armies in Egypt and Italy, as Wimal Weerasinghes excellent and forgotten account of his time with the British Eighth Army reveals. While he served in a second-line company, his account suggests that some Sri Lankan soldiers actually experienced combat in Italy. 
It was recently discovered by this writer that several batches of Sri Lankans served as fighter pilots for the Royal Air Force (RAF) starting from the Battle of Britain. But the only foreign pilots mentioned in all British histories of WWII of air warfare this writer has come across are the Poles. 
As for the BEA, it saw considerable action during WWI. Indian soldiers carried out the wars first trench raid during Nov. 9-10, 1914. They fought in the first battle of Ypres and one Indian soldier won the Victoria Cross, the British armys highest award for bravery. The BEA took part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the bitter Gallipoli campaign, the failed Allied bid to invade Turkey. They fought in the Sinai and Palestine, and took part in the siege of Kut in Mesopotamia (Iraq). Altogether, the BIA lost 47,746 soldiers (dead, or missing in action) and suffered 65,126 wounded. Indian soldiers were awarded 13,000 medals including 12 Victoria Crosses. 
During WWII, the BEA included two armoured and one airborne division. It saw considerable action in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and took part in both battles of El Alamein, the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, and the Italian campaign, including the bitter battle for the German stronghold of Monte Cassino. 
Against the Japanese, Indian soldiers fought in Singapore, Malaya and Burma, including the Battle of Imphal. 
About 87,000 Indian soldiers were killed in WWII and 30 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Indians. The Germans and the Japanese too, managed to convince many captured Indians to join their forces. These Indian units were known as the Tiger Legion and Indian National Army. Led by Subhas Chandra Bose, the latter had 40,000 soldiers. 
But the contributions of these and other colonial soldiers of the British and their allies have been largely neglected by fiction writers, film makers and even documentaries. Its a glaring omission. But the fault can be traced to the Indian side, too, as neither Indian fiction nor Indian cinema have tackled this significant history with the care it deserves.

Withdraw bill on enforced disappearances: JO
	
Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena today said the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances (ICPAPED) Bill should be withdrawn from Parliament order paper following the assurance given by the President.
Addressing a news conference, he said a group of JO MPs met President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday and the President assured that the Bill would not be taken up on Thursday.
The Bill had still not been withdrawn from Parliament order paper. We will ask the Speaker to remove it. If the Bill was passed, we may have to handover all soldiers including General (retired) Jagath Jayasuriya, former president and defence minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa to other countries, he said.
Meanwhile, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the Prime Ministers assurance that the ICPAPED Bill would not have retrospective effect was not acceptable.
We informed the President of this danger. Our MPs briefed the President that governments allies such as the US, UK, Norway, Australia or Canada had not ratified this convention. Some of them have signed it but had not ratified. We told him how unethical it is to make laws retrospective through this convention, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
