The adorable footage eventually shows the calf accepting its fate as it topples sideways into the water and scrambles with its trunk to get out.

The sighting occurred on Chitwa Chitwa Private Game Lodge, Sabi Sand, at seven in the morning in Central Africa Time.

This particular group of elephants is unknown to Muiden but they were captured travelling to the area for a drink of water.

When the head of the herd signalled it was time to leave the water's edge, the fun really began - as all the young elephants struggled to make it up and over the bank of the dam wall. (Daily Mail)
