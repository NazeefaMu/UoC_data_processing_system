		UNP Ratnapura district MP Dunesh Harsha Gankanda took oaths as Deputy Minister of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Board, the government information department said.
	
	Even though his appointment took place the same day as the others, its announcement was delayed due to MP Gankanda’s late arrival at the venue where the oath taking ceremony was to take place. He took oaths after the conclusion of the ceremony.
