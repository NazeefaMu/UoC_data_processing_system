A Breakfast Burst

Be smart and start the day with a Barnesbury boost as the warm and friendly staff invite all to a hearty breakfast daily. Those who are used to a typical Sri Lankan meal have an incredible choice to indulge in. This neighbourly restaurant is probably just a step away from one's home or office and its one that comes with a difference!
From Stringhoppers to Pol Roti, the ever popular Kiribath, Kade Paan or even a spicy rice and curry or string hopper pilau is ones to enjoy! An a-la-carte menu await with a delicious range of proteins prepared curry style and the lip smacking sambols.
The International Breakfast is up for grabs as well be it a seasonal fresh fruit platter, Pancakes, Eggs made to order - any style, Cereals, the typical English Breakfast or an American Breakfast, the choices are many.
A pot of steaming freshly brewed Tea or Coffee and fresh Juices - the latter from the market's choice can be enjoyed while your breakfast is being prepared.
For those who prefer the outdoor, they can sit in the garden under a shady spot or indoors in the comfortable surrounds of the luxurious Café and be spoilt for choice.
Guests can even take their laptop with them and check their emails and get started on the right note.
Wi-Fi access, air conditioning, sofas, bar stools, comfy chairs, bean bags - need one ask for more? Guests may want to convene a breakfast meeting, indeed a pleasant way to start the day! A surprise for the team initiate a think tank or just have that lone moment one has been craving for and put everything that's in the mind in perspective.
Grab the moment, the fact that leaving home in a hurry to beat the traffic with the responsibility of dropping of the children at school and not having the time to eat; one can now swing by what's at close proximity to those living in the Colombo 7 or 8 zone and enjoy the breakfast they missed having at home!
Don't just leave it for the week, come on over with the family on a Saturday or Sunday and relax over the best meal in a day! Start right - and live in the moment at Barnesbury.
