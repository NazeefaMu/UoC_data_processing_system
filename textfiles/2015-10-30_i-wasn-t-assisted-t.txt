When asked by Daily Mirror about Senior DIG Champika Siriwardene’s claim that the HNDA student was not beaten by the Police but was only being removed from the location, the student Sasini Sandeepani said she was not assisted by the policemen to remove but was only repeatedly beaten on the head.
A first-year HNDA student the 21-year-old Sasini Sandeepani was clearly seen in the photographs being beaten by a policeman during the HNDA protest at Ward Place.
She said this was the first time that she had participated in a protest.
Colombo National Hospital doctors had recommended her to undergo a CT scan, also called an X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) due to her constant head pains, she said.
After the photographs were published, the attack on the students came in for severe criticism by the people. (Piyumi Fonseka)Pix by Lahiru Harshana
