As part of their efforts to engage with the Heads of Diplomatic Missions in Colombo, the joint opposition met the Russian Ambassador yesterday and briefed him about what it called ‘the lack of democratic space for dissent and the use of government machinery to suppress political opponents, a former minister said.
The joint opposition, combining a section of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its allies loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, had also sought appointments with other missions in Colombo.
Former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris, speaking to Daily Mirror, said that the opposition had been denied the opportunity to raise its voice in Parliament in the proper sense. Prof. Peiris said his team wanted to brief the foreign missions on the use of the Financial Crimes Investigation Unit (FCID) to victimize those with apposing political views.
Earlier, he said he was noticed to appear before FCID, within 24 hours after he made critical remarks on the government's plans to release several LTTE suspects and the plan to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
Meanwhile, the joint opposition was also seeking an appointment with the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU), head-quartered in Geneva, to raise these matters with it as well. (KB)
