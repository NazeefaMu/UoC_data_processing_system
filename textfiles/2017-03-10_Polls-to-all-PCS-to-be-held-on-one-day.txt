Polls to all PCS to be held on one day?


	

The government is mulling over the possibility of conducting polls to all provincial councils on a single day rather than having staggered elections, it is learnt.

The terms of three provincial councils- North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provincial Councils- will end this year. The terms of other councils are due to end next year. However, the government is now contemplating whether the elections to the North Central, Sabaragamuwa and Eastern provincial Councils could be withheld this year so that all could be held later next year on a single day.

According to sources close to the government, the move is aimed as a cost cutting exercise.

The staggered elections were conducted during the previous rule and barring the Northern Provincial Council Elections, all others were won by the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA). ( Kelum Bandara)
