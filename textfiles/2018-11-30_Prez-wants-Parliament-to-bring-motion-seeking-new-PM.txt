President Maithripala Sirisena informed the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) that Parliament should adopt a motion requesting him to appoint a new Prime Minister in the light of the fact that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa does not currently seem to have a majority in Parliament.

TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran told the Daily Mirror that the President informed him this when they met him last evening.

“The President told us that he would like to see Parliament bringing in and approving a motion calling him to appoint a new Prime Minister on December 5 when it meets again,” Mr. Sumanthiran said.

“ President also told us that it has become clear that former President Mahinda Rajsapaka who functions as Prime Minister currently does not have a majority in Parliament especially after motions that have been approved by Parliament during the past few days,” he added.
