The office of the DIG Nalaka Silva, who is in charge of Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) in Colombo, was sealed as a result of the ongoing probe against him, police sources said.

A senior officer at the Police Headquarters said yesterday that two laptop computers had also been taken into custody from his office for the investigations.

The DIG has been sent on compulsory leave after investigating into a complaint that had been made by the Operations Director of Anti-Corruption Movement Namal Kumara.

According to the complaint, DIG had allegedly conspired to assassinate the President Maithripala Sirisena and former Secretary of Defense Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.

The voice recordings and a mobile phone relevant to this conspiracy had been handed over to the CID and the Government Analyst by Namal Kumara for investigations according to a court order.

According to CID sources, a statement is scheduled to be recorded from the DIG Nalaka Silva after summoning him to CID regarding this assassination plot.

The court had already ordered the Department of Government Analyst to present a data investigation report to the court. (Srinath Prasanna Jayasuriya)
