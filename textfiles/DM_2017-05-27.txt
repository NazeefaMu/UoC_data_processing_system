Brace for floods, Again
	

As the Meteorology Department forecasts more rains in the coming days, experts point out the flaws in city that cause flooding
With the onset of South-West Monsoon, heavy rains are pouring over the Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces.
Humans cannot change nature and its behaviour, yet they can adapt to the changes in nature, thus minimizing harm from natural disasters. The country is now under red-alert and people are advised to remain safe from hazards and floods.
The Ratnapura and the Kalutara Districts reported the highest number of deaths of the total 91 deaths reported last afternoon. 
More than 16,759 families and 61,315 individuals had been affected by the floods and 110 persons had gone missing by yesterday evening, the Disaster Management Centre said.
The Meteorology Department yesterday warned an increase in rain during nights and said that rains would lessen by Sunday.
Meanwhile, it warned the fishing community that very strong winds and rough seas would prevail in the shallow and deep sea areas off the coast from Kankesanthurai to Batticaloa via Trincomalee.
South - West monsoon conditions are establishing all over the country, hence showery and windy condition are expected to continue over the south-western part of the country. Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western provinces. Heavy falls (More than 150 mm) can be expected at some places. Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places elsewhere in the afternoon (Especially in the Eastern and Uva Provinces).
Fairly strong winds at times (up to 50kmph) can be expected over the island. There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity, the Meteorological Department said in its forecast yesterday.

FLOOD Warning
The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) recorded that the water levels of the Kelani River had been rising and reached the flood alert around 5 a.m. yesterday.
A minor flood situation was expected yesterdays morning hours in the Kelani River due to the heavy rains pouring over the upper stream. The lowland areas adjacent to the Kelani River in Kolonnawa, Biyagama, Kelaniya, Kaduwela, Dompe, Hanwella, Padukka and Avissawellla Divisional Secretaries are warned of flooding.
The Gin Ganga has already reached the flood warning levels and the public close to the banks of Kelani, Kalu and Nilwala Rivers are advised to be prepared to take safety measures in case of flooding.

Possible threat of Landslides
According to the National Building Research and Organization (NBRO) report yesterday, the Kegalle, Ratnapura, Galle and Kalutara Districts had been identified as possible areas for landslides, rock falls and cut slope failures as the rains are continuing.
People residing in mountain areas, man-made cut slopes and all the roads in the Ratnapura District were warned over possible landslides. This included Ratnapura, Elapatha, Pelmadulla, Kuruwita, Ehaliyagoda, Kiriella, Imbulpe, Ayagama, Kahawatta, Kalawana, Kolonna and Nivithigala Divisional Secretariat.

Colombos flood fears
Drainages are filled with waste, while rainwater runs wild on the road in Colombo city. The slightest rains can flood the main roads, cause heavy traffic jams and damage public and private property; the busiest junctions in Colombo and suburbs are under heavy traffic caused by rainwater accumulating on roads.
Armour Street, Maligawatte, Panchikawatte, Dematagoda, Punchi Borella and many other critical places in the heart of the city are blocked after every downpour.

An anonymous and experienced driver
The drainage system is blocked and many shabby little shops have been built on drainage cover, these areas flood because the drainages are filled with litter and blocked. When it rains, the road is the only place, where adequate space is available and then the water spreads all over the road creating unnecessary traffic that is pretty much avoidable if the drainage systems functioned properly, a driver in a reputed company travelling on a daily basis around Colombo summarized the issue on his viewpoint.

Retention pits in drainage will reduce floods
- Lalitharaja Muthukumarana (Former Architect, Urban Planner)
Flash floods and all happening due to the wrong drainage system. Ninety percent or more of Colombo is covered with concrete, interlocking tiles, concrete pavings, buildings or something artificial and as a result millions of gallons of rainwater goes to the sea without being absorbed by the earth, flowing straight from the road to the concrete drains.
Concrete drainages have blocked water absorption to earth. In those drainages, retention pits are a must where the water collects. If the drainage lines are opened from the bottom, the soil absorbs all water and if retention pits are added to drainages we will be reducing the risk of runoff accumulation and flash floods in cities. Saturating soil with water can be started by locating retention pits at domestic level.
The Municipality is watering roadside trees with bowsers instead of using rain water. If this system is going to continue, in 20 years time this country will be a desert because ground water supply will run out, he said.
Without water, the ground gets parched and dried. The existing groundwater table is also drying up without regular renewal of surface water adding to it.

Three factors are responsible for the runoff accumulation in Colombo.
- Jagath Gunawardena - Environment Lawyer
Three interconnected factors are responsible for the floods and run- off accumulation in Colombo city.
Key factors which cause flash floods:
1 Destroying wetlands in and around the city - Usually the run -off accumulates in those wetlands and albeit the wetlands are filled and blocked, the lower points of high grounds get filled and water accumulates, with nowhere to run off. And if that point is refilled, a totally new place could be flooded as the excess water will find a new place - the unfortunate effects of landfills.
2 Drainage - Lack of a well-planned drainage systems is yet another cause of floods. The bottoms of many canals are lower than the sea level; therefore the water doesnt flow downwards at the high tide and those drainages cannot reduce the water level as quickly as expected. If heavy rains fall, as drainage doesnt carry the water, it accumulates.
3 Weak absorption - No one has ever paid significant attention to this. The runoff results in rainwater flowing on the soil. Another portion gets absorbed into the soil. Another portion is held by trees. In cities like Colombo, there is no chance for this third kind of water retention, as there are buildings instead of trees. Buildings cannot hold water. On the building-free spaces, the land is covered with concrete and tar, therefore, the absorption is immensely weak. The bulk of rainwater doesnt get absorbed into the earth. The construction of too many buildings in a limited area is another crucial fact behind run off accumulation.
Explaining how the other countries minimise harm from excess water, he said:
People are advised to collect rainwater for later use in dry weather in many countries. The purposes are to halt wasting water and decrease runoff. We are able to adopt the method in our country, too. Usually, the runoff accumulates in areas heavily crowded with buildings and roads, and are covered with concrete or tar.
In my point of view, the total of above three factors is responsible for the runoff accumulation in Colombo. Rainwater filled streets are resulted by polythene stuck, disturbed and unmaintained drainage systems. Even the slightest rain produces a large volume to roads and existing drainages. These factors should be taken into serious consideration in planning and building new cities in future, he said.
Colombo and suburban areas are loaded with wetlands, and filling those produces unnecessary floods. The bottoms of drainage system in Colombo and suburbs (Kirullapone and Nugegoda) are lower than sea level and salt-water intrudes through these canals during high tides, like at Heen Ela.
Even the Parliament Complex area is prone to this. Lately, some small ponds were made to lower the risk, yet salt-water seeped to the bottom. We objected to this digging at the earliest stages. Inability to foresee the situation worsens it. We warned related authorities some 20 years ago, and thats exactly before the floods of 1992 which occurred due to land fillings. The President then decided to prohibit filling of lands and paddies.
The floods in Sedawatte, Angoda, Mulleriyawa and Kotikawatte are caused by the filling of wetlands. Even Diyawanna Oya is located in a flood plain.
Improper constructions and waste management issues are also contributing factors.
- Bharatha Perera - Former Director of Property Management and Revenue Division - RDA
The public is not warned about how to respond to water-related hazards as floods and run  off accumulation. In the colonial era, there were 15 feet broad but shallow and spacious drainage systems in Colombo that could successfully handle huge capacities of water, especially in places like Wijerama Mawatha. Present land use has made it impractical to build drainages of this size. Building spacious grounds is a useful method to control floods. Improper constructions, human habitations on canal banks and the waste management issues are also contributing factors.
The solutions for runoff management could work for transport problems too. Recently I studied with the rain water collecting program in Australia. They have an automated mechanism for collecting rainwater and storing them in houses. The water is stored and purified after flushing the first volumes of washed up dirt and waste of roofs. The surplus is released to drainage after storing the full volumes for domestic use.
They even economise the rainwater yet we use well-purified water for washing clothes and watering plants. Using the existing plumbing system has constricted us for adopting new water management methods. Some middle-class people and villagers consume rainwater and collect in domestic tanks and pots, but city dwellers are not doing it. Wetlands are priceless and wetlands are the reason why we have fresh water even in coastal areas.

British Airways cancels Heathrow, Gatwick flights
	
British Airways has canceled all flights from London's two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick for several hours after experiencing a major IT system failure, the CNN reported on Saturday quoting the airline.
Airline officials had said that there's no evidence to determine that the incident was a cyberattack.
However, flights before 1 p.m. ET (6 p.m. British ST) are canceled.
"The terminals at Heathrow and Gatwick have become extremely congested and we have cancelled all flights from Heathrow and Gatwick before 6pm UK time today, so please do not come to the airports," British Airways said in a statement.
"We will provide more information on ba.com, Twitter and through airport communication channels as soon as we can for flights due to depart after that time."
The airline has not said how many flights will be delayed or canceled, nor how many people are likely to be affected.
In response to tweets from travelers, it said that it was experiencing a "global system outage" which was affecting its website, online check-in and contact centers.
"Working on this as a matter of priority, but if your flight is departing tomorrow you may have to complete check in at the airport," it tweeted to one customer.
The airline said it was "extremely sorry" for passengers' inconvenience and was working to resolve the problem as soon as possible.
Airline officials had given no indication of what may have caused the problem.

Indian ship with relief materials arrives in flood hit SL
	
An Indian ship filled with relief supplies for those affected by the devastating floods and landslides arrived at the Colombo Port on Saturday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake visited the Port to receive the Indian Naval Ship INS Kirch and take charge of the supplies from the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.
As before India has been the first to respond when Sri Lanka is ravaged by national disasters. When tsunami struck the island in December 2004, India was the first to respond and it even set up a hospital at Galle which was particularly badly hit by the giant waves.
The Foreign Ministry said that another ship filled with relief supplies from India will arrive in Colombo on Sunday.
The death toll from the devastating floods and landslides reached 100 on Saturday while 200,000 people have been displaced and 99 are still missing, the Disaster Management Center said.
Rescue and search operations are still ongoing in several areas and fresh flood alerts have been issued as rains continue in certain areas.
The Sri Lankan government on Friday made an appeal to the UN, the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) and neighboring countries to provide assistance for the affected people, especially in the areas where search and rescue operations were ongoing.(newsin.asia)

Johnstan's five non-assets declaration cases: Trial started
	
The trial of five cases filed against former Minister Johnston Fernando over non-declaration of his assets and liabilities from 2010 to 2014, was yesterday initiated before the Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara.
Testifying before court, prosecution witness, Senior Assistant Presidents Secretary, Chandima Wickramasinghe ascertained that there was no relevant document available at the Presidential Secretariat to prove any assets and liabilities declaration of the former Minister, according to her knowledge.
However, when cross examined by Kalinga Indatissa PC, the witness also said that she was unaware of any submissions regarding assets declaration directly to the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, as there was a legal provision to do so.
Meanwhile, Bribery Official Pallegedara Jayasundara, who conducted the initial inquiry over the allegation, also confirmed that according to the Presidential Secretariat there was no legal document of any assets declaration during the period of 2010 to 2014.
A further trial would resume on July 21, 2017.
Earlier, the Commission had filed five separate cases for four years under the Non-Declaration of Assets Act. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Letter bomb injures former Greek Premier Lucas Papademos
	

DPA, 26th MAY, 2017- Former Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos was injured on Thursday when a letter bomb exploded in his car in central Athens, according to state radio. 
He is not severely injured. His driver was injured, too, a spokesman for the emergency medical service told the broadcaster. 
Papademos, 69, was apparently injured in the hands and abdomen when an envelope or a small package exploded as he opened it during a drive. 
He underwent emergency surgery, Greek media reported. 
Greek police sources speculated that the method of the crime pointed to an underground leftist terrorist organization called the Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei. 
In March the group claimed responsibility for a packet bomb sent to the German Finance Ministry. The device was stopped by the German postal service. 
Papademos was a European Central Bank vice president before being tasked to lead a technocratic government from November 2011 to May 2012, as Greeces debt crisis roiled. 
Greece went into a financial meltdown in 2010 and was kept afloat with a massive international bailout. 
In return, Athens committed to a series of austerity reforms, most recently last week, when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras cabinet pushed through pension cuts and tax hikes.

Operation Re-shuffle Key objective was removing Ravi Karunanayake as Finance Minister
	

The situation was therefore volatile and quite dicey. It was obvious that Ravi Karunanayake was going to be the primary target of Operation Reshuffle.
	Karunanayake was in the eye of a raging political storm. What was Ravi going to do  Was the multi-crore rupee question.


By D.B.S.Jeyaraj
The Oxford English dictionary defines the word compromise as being an agreement or settlement of a dispute that is reached by each side making concessions. Sri Lanka witnessed a political compromise of sorts between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, when the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and United National Party (UNP) leaders displayed a show of unity in bringing about a mini re-shuffle of portfolios among members of
their Cabinet.
Officially it was a bi -lateral exercise between the President and Prime Minister, who despite differences, acted together in conformity with the constitution in effecting changes to the Cabinet of Ministers. Unofficially it was a tri-lateral exercise as former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga also played a constructive role in evolving a consensus and compromise, in bringing about a Cabinet re-shuffle.
Due to the political compromise reached between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe with the endorsement of Ex-president Chandrika Kumaratunga, a minor re-shuffle of Ministerial portfolios took place on Monday May 22nd.
Nine Cabinet Ministers and one State Minister were re-allocated fresh Ministerial portfolios on the morning of Monday May 22nd in what turned out to be the first major re-shuffle since the formation of the current coalition Government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
President Sirisena himself was the first to make the announcement that nine Cabinet Ministers and a State Minister had taken oaths before him after accepting their new portfolios. President Sirisena like the US President Donald Trump took to Twitter and tweeted Nine Cabinet Ministers and a State Minister took oaths in their new portfolios a while ago.

Another of his exemplary characteristics is his loyalty towards friends and colleagues, who stood by him. Unfortunately some of Ranils friends and loyalists do not have Clean hands. So, when Wickremesinghe stands by them he is vulnerable to charges of cronyism.


The new re-shuffled and re-appointed nine Cabinet Ministers and one State Minister are 
1. Mangala Samaraweera  Minister of Finance and Mass Media.
2. S.B. Dissanayake  Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan heritage.
3. W.D.J Seneviratne  Minister of Labour, Trade Union relations and Sabaragamuwa Development.
4. Ravi Karunanayake  Minister of Foreign Affairs
5. Mahinda Samarasinghe  Minister of Ports and Shipping.
6. Gayantha Karunathilaka  Minister of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms.
7. Arjuna Ranatunga  Minister of Petroleum Resources Development.
8. Chandima Weerakkody  Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training.
9. Tilak Marapana  Minister of Development Assignments.
10. Mahinda Amaraweera  State Minister of Mahaweli Development.
The ten Ministers accepted their letters of appointment from President Sirisena and took their oaths before him.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was associated with the President at the event. After the ceremony was over the Ministers posed for group photographs with the President and Prime Minister.
This demonstration of intra-Govt unity for the benefit of the public was deemed imperative against the backdrop of reports in sections of the media that the envisaged Cabinet re-shuffle, was going to be a solo effort by President Sirisena and that Premier Wickremesinghe was totally opposed to it.
An oft recurring headline in reports was that the proposed Cabinet re-shuffle could make or break the Govt.
Fortunately for all those desiring a stable, pluralistic, peaceful, egalitarian, well-governed and prosperous Sri Lanka, the re-shuffle ended on the positive note of making (or remaking) Sri Lanka.
Speculative reports in the media had earlier suggested that President Sirisena was acting on his own without consulting Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in re-shuffling the Cabinet. Subsequent events proved them wrong. The important decision to bring about changes in the allocation of certain portfolios as well as re- designation of some departments coming under the purview of particular ministries was not taken by the President alone. Instead of being a unilateral decision of the President, the mini Cabinet re-shuffle decision was a tri-lateral one taken together by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in conjunction with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.

President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe
According to well-informed sources President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe arrived at a joint decision after much discussion on re-allocating ministerial portfolios and departments, which was endorsed by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga.
There was no question of President Sirisena going ahead with the reshuffle against the wishes of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe or taking a decision without consulting him reiterated the sources.
Though Premier Ranil was earlier reluctant to agree to a re-shuffle of portfolios held by United National Party (UNP) members, he had later been amenable to changes it is learnt.
Informed sources said that all provisions of the 19th Constitutional amendment regarding the President consulting and acting on the advice of the Prime Minister were adhered to. After in depth discussions the Constitutional requirement of the President officially consulting the Prime Minister and seeking his advice was met with. All the Ministerial changes announced by President Sirisena were formally recommended by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe it is reliably learnt.
Great care was taken to maintain a balance between the UNP and SLFP in the re-shuffle. Thus the swearing in ceremony saw a fifty - fifty ratios being kept between both parties.
Five among the ten, who took oaths belonged to or had contested on the UNP ticket. They were Mangala Samaraweera, Ravi Karunanayake, Gayantha Karunathilaka, Tilak Marapana and Arjuna Ranatunga.
Former Sri Lankan cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga belongs to a traditional SLFP political family in the Gampaha district. Having crossed over, when Maithripala Sirisena split from the party, Ranatunga contested on the UNP ticket.
Mangala Samaraweera is also from a traditional SLFP political family in the Matara District.
He was expelled from the SLFP by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mangala then formed the SLFP (Mahajana) Party and functioned independently. Later He joined the UNP.
Five of the ten who took their oaths belong to the SLFP or contested on the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket.
They are S.B. Dissanayake, W.D.J. Seneviratne, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Chandima Weerakkody and Mahinda Amaraweera.
Of these Mahinda Samarasinghe was a die -hard UNPer from the Kalutara District, who crossed over to the SLFP in 2006. Samarasinghe, a former diplomat served as Cabinet Minister in the UNP Govt. of 2001 -2004.
After crossing over he became a Cabinet Minister in different SLFP -UPFA Governments. Senior politician S.B. Dissanayake also has had a chequered political career. He started out as a Communist and then became a SLFPer. Later he crossed over to the UNP and then crossed back to the SLFP. After Sirisena became President, SB changed political stripes again. He was appointed a National List MP and Cabinet Minister by President Sirisena.

Finance and Foreign Affairs Ministry Portfolios
The most important and far- reaching decision in the re-shuffle was the key exchange of portfolios between former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and ex- Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
Karunanayake is now the new Foreign Affairs Minister while Samaraweera has become the new Finance Minister. In addition to Finance, Mangala Samaraweera will also handle the Media Ministry.
The former Mass Media and Parliamentary Reforms minister Gayantha Karunathilaka has lost his Media Ministry but will continue to retain Parliamentary Reforms. Gayantha has also been allocated the Lands Ministry and will continue to be the chief Govt. whip.

Another anticipated change that did not materialise was in the sphere of Law and Order. President Sirisena had wanted to replace the present minister Sagala Ratnayake with former army commander Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka.


There are also reports that Ravi Karunanayake will be given additional responsibilities in various other spheres like Lotteries, Plantations and Aviation. These reports however need to be taken with pinches of salt until the relevant Gazettes are out.
While nine of the ten who took their oaths were Cabinet Ministers. One was a State Minister.
He was none other than Hambantota District MP and Cabinet Minister of Fisheries, Mahinda Amaraweera, who became the State Minister for Mahaweli Development. The Mahaweli Development Minister is President Sirisena himself.
Mahinda Amaraweera will continue to retain the Fisheries Ministry while having a greater role to play as Mahaweli Development State Minister. President Sirisena relies to a great extent on Amaraweera, who is also the General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). Hailing from Hambantota District, Mahinda Amaraweera is the countervailing political force to Rajapaksa power in the region.
The only comparatively new face in the Cabinet is former Attorney - General and Ex -Solicitor - General Tilak Marapana.
He was sworn in as Development Assignments Minister. Marapane, who served as Cabinet Minister in charge of Defence in the UNP led Government of 2001 to 2004 was also Minister of Law and Order in the current Govt.
He resigned in November 2015 following the Avant Garde controversy. Thereafter Sagala Ratnayake was appointed Minister of Law and Order. It was tipped earlier that Tilak Marapana would take over as Justice Minister in this re-shuffle. This has not happened and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe continues to remain the Minister of Justice as well as Buddha Sasana.
Another anticipated change that did not materialise was in the sphere of Law and Order. President Sirisena had wanted to replace the present minister Sagala Ratnayake with former army commander Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka.
President Sirisena has been toying with the idea of elevating Sarath Fonseka to a higher position in the Defence or Law and Order sector with a lot of powers.
When Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne publicised this idea there were howls of protest.
Subsequently it was explained away as a joke taken seriously. However the President did not give up the thought and had wanted to replace Sagala with Sarath.
The expectation was that Fonseka would come down hard on politically motivated protests and also expedite the pursuit of justice regarding alleged abuse and misuse of power by the Rajapaksas. That change too has not been effected and Sagala Ratnayake remains Law and Order minister to date.
The run up to the Cabinet re-shuffle had been both exciting and hectic. The patently visible differences of opinion between the President/SLFP leader and Prime Minister/UNP Leader on this crucial issue was seemingly paving the way for an explosive confrontation and rupture of Government.
In order to comprehend the political tensions more clearly a brief re-run of recent events is necessary. What had been happening was this.

Exacerbation Of Tensions Between UNP and SLFP
The President as de-jure head of Government has wanted to re-furbish the image of the Govt. and galvanise it into positive action by making significant changes to the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Prime Minister though agreeable in principle to a re-shuffle had not been amenable to some of the proposed changes. As a result the Premier resisted the proposed changes and was not very co-operative.
This was particularly so in the case of certain controversial Cabinet Ministers belonging to the UNP. This in turn led to an exacerbation of tensions between the SLFP and UNP factions of the Govt. and by extension to the respective party leaders. A pro-Mahinda Rajapaksa cabal attempted to exploit these differences and engineer a permanent rupture between Maithripala and Ranil in this respect.
The present Constitution introduced by the Junius Richard Jayewardene Govt. in 1978 empowers the Executive President to appoint and dismiss Ministers as well as amend or transfer portfolios held by the Ministers without consulting the Prime Minister. However the 19th Amendment to the Constitution brought about by the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt. envisaged a greater role for the Prime Minister in this.
Section 43 (3) of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution states:
(1) The President shall, in consultation with the Prime Minister, where he considers such consultation to be necessary, determine the number of Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers and the assignment of subjects and functions to such Ministers.

The powers... were neither curtailed in full nor transferred to the Prime Minister. The Govt. hopes now to address these questions effectively if and when a new Constitution is promulgated.


(2) The President shall, on the advice of the Prime Minister, appoint from among Members of Parliament, Ministers, to be in charge of the Ministries so determined.
(3) The President may at any time change the assignment of subjects and functions and the composition of the Cabinet of Ministers and the continuity of its responsibility to Parliament.
It was the avowed objective of the new Yahapalanaya or Good Governance Govt. to abolish the Executive Presidency and enhance the powers of the Prime Minister.
The 19th Amendment was introduced primarily for that purpose. However, a Supreme Court ruling as well as certain conditions imposed by the SLFP component of the Govt. acted as constraints.
As a result the powers of the Executive Presidency were neither curtailed in full nor transferred to the Prime Minister. The Govt. hopes now to address these questions effectively if and when a new Constitution is promulgated.
Though the 19th Amendment constricted the scope of the Executive Presidency, there was very little reduction of Presidential powers in actual terms.
However, in practice President Sirisena evolved certain rules of political co-habitation with his Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
This was necessitated by four factors. Firstly Sirisena was elected President through overwhelming support provided by the UNP and minority community political parties.
He was therefore a President who was dependent on the UNP. Secondly Sirisena had become the nominal SLFP leader but in terms of realpolitik he was not in control of the party.
The bulk of the SLFP rank and file remained loyal to Mahinda Rajapaksa. Thirdly Sirisena was trying to build up a political base of his own by enticing SLFP Parliamentarians with the lure of Ministerial portfolios and perks.
Still those MPs were smaller in numbers compared to the UNP. Fourthly and perhaps most importantly the UNP-led front won the most number of seats in Parliament at the August 2015 polls.
The UNP is the single largest party and main component of this Govt. The UNP leader is therefore the legitimate head of govt.


Prime Minister as De-facto Head of Government
Consequent to these factors, President Sirisena commenced his duties by restricting his role and duties in exercising his powers. While continuing with all the ceremonial duties of the Presidency Sirisena took a backseat in the actual day to day running of the Government.
Though the President was the de jure head of the Govt , it was the Prime Minister who functioned as de facto head of the Govt.
The Memorandum of Understanding between the UNP and SLFP laid down the groundwork of rules under which the coalition Govt was to be constituted and administered. Thus the President in his official capacity appointed Ministers , allocated Ministries and assigned duties.
However, he did so after consulting the Prime Minister and acted upon his advice. The President and the Prime Minister were in practice exercising concurrent powers or dual control over the Govt.
This mode of political co-existence though laudable was not without its strains. The peaks and pitfalls faced by the Sirisena- Wickremesinghe Govt. and the manner in which they were being surmounted or by-passed are by themselves an interesting and somewhat intriguing tale worthy of recounting on another occasion.
This weeks column and the next one will be focusing on one important aspect, which dominated the political discourse relating to the Govt. in contemporary times - Cabinet changes!
It was a crucial challenge which sorely tested the uneasy co-habitation between Maithripala and Ranil and threatened the fragile nature of the coalition Government. How this intra-Govt. crisis of a Cabinet re-shuffle was resolved temporarily through a political compromise would be the substance of this and a forthcoming article.
As stated earlier President Sirisena wanted to re-furbish the image of his Govt. through a reshuffle of Cabinet portfolios for certain reasons which need not be elaborated upon in detail at this juncture.
In the process of a re-shuffle the President wanted to promote, demote, include and exclude several Ministers and/or ministerial aspirants. There were some Ministers who were not in the good books of the President for a variety of reasons. A few of these were from the UNP. Sirisena therefore required the consent and cooperation of Wickremesinghe to change some Ministers and Ministries from both the UNP and SLFP in an extensive Cabinet re-shuffle undertaken jointly by the President/SLFP leader and Prime Minister/UNP leader.
But Ranil Wickremesinghe was not willing to play ball with Maithripala Sirisena on this issue. The chief reason for this concerned Colombo district MP and Cabinet Minister Ravi Karunanayake. Arguably the primary target of President Sirisena in Operation Re-shuffle was the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
President Sirisena wanted to remove Ravi Karunanayake from the Finance Minister post and assign a different Ministry or Ministries to him.
There was no objection to Karunanayake remaining in the Government but the President did not want him to present the next budget in Parliament as Finance Minister.
Ranil Wickremesinghe however disagreed strongly with Maithripala Sirisena on this. The Prime Minister was unwilling to let go of his Finance Minister.
There were political and personal reasons for this stance. Ranil Wickremesinghe is a clean and incorruptible political leader. Such leaders are a rarity in South Asia.
Another of his exemplary characteristics is his loyalty towards friends and colleagues, who stood by him. Unfortunately some of Ranils friends and loyalists do not have Clean hands. So, when Wickremesinghe stands by them he is vulnerable to charges of cronyism.

Ravi Karunanayake a Staunch Political Deputy
Fifty-four year old Ravindra Sandresh Karunanayake known as Ravi Karunanayake has been a staunch political deputy to Ranil Wickremesinghe in recent times. He has loyally stood by the UNP leader through thick and thin on many occasions.
Upon knowing that President Sirisena wanted to oust him, the combatively ebullient Karunanayake refused to give in. He was confident that Ranil Wickremesinghe would stand by him. Karunanayake also threatened to resign as Minister and revert to being a backbencher if his portfolio was touched. He also led an anti- SLFP campaign within the coalition Govt.
The complicated situation was further compounded by the group of MPs loyal to Mahinda Rajapaksa known as the Joint Opposition. The very same Opposition which brought a no - confidence motion in Parliament against Ravi Karunanayake now began to sing his praises as Finance Minister.
They cited the Banker magazine selecting Karunanayake as Asia pacifics Finance Minister of the year. Ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa telephoned Ravi to express his sympathies at what was going to be Karunanayakes impending fall from grace.
Unconfirmed reports stated Yoshita Rajapaksa had paid a courtesy call.
The situation was therefore volatile and quite dicey. It was obvious that Ravi Karunanayake was going to be the primary target of Operation Reshuffle.
Karunanayake was in the eye of a raging political storm. What was Ravi going to do  Was the multi-crore rupee question.

Rainfall as high as 553 mm recorded in the country
	
Rainfall as high as 500mm was reported in several parts of the country yesterday, the Department of Meteorology said.
The highest rainfall of 553mm was recorded from Kukuleganga in the Kalutara District while nearly 500mm of rain had fallen in Weeraketiya. The other rainfall figures included 395mm in Batuwagala, 387.2mm in Padukka and 348.5mm in Ratnapura.
All in all the rainfalls exceeded 100mm in both the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces.
However, the 553 mm of rain that had fallen in Kukuleganga was not the highest rainfall recorded in Sri Lankas history as there have been instances where it had exceeded 700mm in some areas in the past.
Meanwhile, the department had forecast more showers in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-Western Provinces in the coming days as well. (Yohan Perera)

Trump condemns leaks
	

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that deeply troubling leaks to U.S. media about the Manchester suicide bombing would be investigated, after irate British police briefly stopped sharing information with U.S. agencies. 
Prime Minister Theresa May raised British concerns with Trump at a NATO summit in Brussels, telling him intelligence shared between their two countries had to remain secure, in a rare public show of dissatisfaction with Britains closest security ally. 
After a suspension that lasted about a day, Britains most senior counter terrorism officer said late on Thursday that the police had resumed sharing information with the United States after receiving fresh assurances. 
Trump had called the leaks deeply troubling. 
I am asking the Department of Justice and other relevant agencies to launch a complete review of this matter, and if appropriate, the culprit should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, he said in a statement released after his arrival in Brussels. 
The row comes as British police stepped up their investigation into a suspected network behind Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old British-born man with Libyan parents who blew himself up on Monday night at the Manchester Arena indoor venue after a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande 
The singers fans are mostly children and teenagers and the explosion killed 22 people, ranging from an eight-year-old schoolgirl to parents who had come to pick up their children.

UK security minister says no specific threat to public this weekend
	

British emergency services are prepared for possible attacks on public events over an upcoming holiday weekend but have no information on specific threats after Mondays bomb attack in Manchester which killed 22, a governmentminister said.
Monday is a public holiday in Britain, and the weekend sees a number of high-profile events such as the soccer FA Cup final in London on Saturday.
Security minister Ben Wallace said reports that hospitals had been told to be prepared for the weekend were part of a general heightened sense of security and not a response to specific intelligence.
That is predominantly precautionary... There is no specific threat against an individual event, Ben Wallace said on BBC radio.
He also said police were confident of rolling up a network of people involved in Mondays attacks, and said the government needed tools to force companies such as Facebook to remove dangerous online material more quickly.

Issuing a statement, it said the UNICEF will donate water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC).
The WHO will be supporting the Ministry of Health to deploy medical teams to the affected districts.

US warship drill meant to defy Chinas claim over artificial island
	

REUTERS, 26th MAY, 2017- A U.S. warship carried out a maneuvering drill when it sailed within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built up by China in the South China Sea, to show Beijing it was not entitled to a territorial sea around it, U.S. officials saidon Thursday.
The operation near Mischief Reef on Thursday, Pacific time, among a string of islets, reefs and shoals over which China has disputes with its neighbours, was the boldest U.S. challenge yet to Chinese island-building in the strategic waterway.
It drew an angry response from China, which President Donald Trump has tried to court in recent weeks to persuade it to take a tougher line on North Koreas nuclear and missile programs. Analysts say previous U.S. freedom-of-navigation operations in the Spratly archipelago involved innocent passage, in which a warship effectively recognized a territorial sea by crossing it speedily,
without stopping.
On Thursday, the destroyer USS Dewey conducted a man overboard exercise, specifically to show that its passage within 12 nautical miles was not innocent passage,U.S. officials said.
USS Dewey engaged in normal operations by conducting a maneuvering drill inside 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef, one official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The ships actions demonstrated that Mischief Reef is not entitled to its own territorial sea regardless of whether an artificial island has been built on top of it.

'Weather patterns change resulted in floods, landslides, dengue'
	
The changing weather conditions the world over have not only resulted in floods and landslides but also in a global outbreak of the dengue epidemic, Parliament was informed yesterday.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the US Centre for Disease Control had so far sent out 900 dengue alerts globally with 400 alerts had sent out to countries in the Asian region.
"Sri Lanka is also affected by the global epidemic while South Asia is the most affected," he said in response to a question asked by the joint opposition parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardene in the House last morning.
The minister said Dengue Virus 1 and 3 was present in Sri Lanka at the moment. He said 48 people in Sri Lanka had died last year which is 0.2 per cent of those affected and added that in Sri Lanka it was the young adults and the elderly among the worst affected.
The minister said several precautionary had been taken to prevent the spread of the disease in Sri Lanka such as the carrying out constant checks on places such as schools. He said a special ward has been set up at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Mulleriyawa to care for the dengue patients.
Earlier, Mr. Gunawardene had said there were 45,000 dengue patients in Sri Lanka up to now.
"The statement by the health authorities that they alone cannot handle the situation is a clear indication on how grave the situation had become," he said. (Yohan Perera)
