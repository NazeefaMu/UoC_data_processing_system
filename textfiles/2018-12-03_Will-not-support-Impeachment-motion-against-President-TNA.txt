The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which pledged its support to the United National Party (UNP) to form a government has, however, assured President Maithripala Sirisena that it will not support any motion to impeach him, it is learnt.

TNA Leader R. Sampanthan gave this assurance to the President when he met him last Friday. However, the TNA stressed that only UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had a mandate to become the Prime Minister.

Mr. Sampanthan is reported to have said his party cannot be party to any exercise that strengthens the hands of Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa over his wartime activities.

The President reiterated his position that it would be difficult for him to work with Mr. Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister again.(By Kelum Bandara)
