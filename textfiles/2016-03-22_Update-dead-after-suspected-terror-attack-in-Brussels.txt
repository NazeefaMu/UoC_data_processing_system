At least eleven people have died and several injured after two explosions rocked Brussels Airport in a suspected terror attack.

Witnesses described seeing 'dismembered bodies everywhere' after the blasts which are believed to have centred on the American Airlines check-in desk at around 8am (7am GMT).

There were reports that shouts in Arabic were heard in the building before the two explosion and shots were fired in the aftermath.

Photographs from inside the arrivals hall showed the floor was covered in fallen roof tiles and dust as bloodied people hobbled out of the airport. Others injured were photographed lying on the floor.

The explosions come just a day after the Belgium Interior Minister warned of possible revenge attacks after the arrest of Paris terror attack suspect Salah Abdeslam in the city last week. (Daily Mail - UK)
