Ban cattle slaughter: Mervyn urges Govt.


	

Former Minister Dr. Mervyn Silva, who claimed that he is following the non-violence path adopted by Anagarika Dharmapala, today urged the government to bring in laws to ban cattle slaughter.
Taking part in a signature campaign organised by a youth organization in Matara against cattle slaughter, he requested new parliamentarians to create policies that prevent animal slaughter.
The signature campaign was commenced near the Anagarika Dharmapala statue opposite the Matara Bodhiya this morning.    
Mervyn Silva was in the spotlight sometime ago when he seized the animals that had been brought for the annual sacrifice ritual of the Bhadra Kali Amman Kovil in Munneswaram premises in Chilaw. (Krishan Jeewaka Jayaruk)
