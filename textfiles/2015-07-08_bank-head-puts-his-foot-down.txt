This politico from the Kalutara district is an original Green. Later he turned Blue to escape from a winter of despair. He held portfolios at Cabinet rank from both parties. He threw in his lot with the new regime rather late in the day and had to be content with a deputy office.
This politico recently called a head of a leading bank in the country. “I say,” he barked at the bank head. “I find that you are giving jobs to only those on the Minister’s lists. I, as a Deputy also have to look after my constituents. You have to give jobs to those on the lists I am sending!” 
The bank head, a highly qualified and respected banker was not prepared to take the Deputy’s accusation lying down.
“What did you say?  Repeat what you said now!” the bank head told the Deputy. “I said that you are giving jobs only to the Minister’s people. You have to give jobs to my people as well.” The bank head: “Don’t make false allegations. First please withdraw your false allegation!”
“What is the false allegation I made?” “You said that I give jobs to the Minister’s people. I have not given a single job on anybody’ request. We recruit candidates selected through competitive exams. You first withdraw your allegation. I can give you a hearing after that,” the bank head said. 
“Okay. I am withdrawing the allegation,” a subdued Deputy said.
“That’s good. In future, I can look into the possibility of helping your constituents. Remember please that intimidatory tactics will not work with me!” said the bank head.
