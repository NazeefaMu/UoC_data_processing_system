 By Anna Fifield (c) 2018, The Washington Post, Sep 27, 2018 - BEIJING - China is flatly denying President Donald Trump’s accusation that it is interfering in November’s midterm elections, implying that it is the United States that has a track record of meddling in other countries’ business.   


With an acrimonious trade dispute rumbling on and amid an increasingly fractious security environment, the latest tit-for-tat could worsen the relationship between the world’s two largest economies.   


“I believe the international community knows very well who is most used to meddling in the internal affairs of others,” Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told reporters Thursday. He did not name the United States directly but was responding to a question about Trump’s assertion Wednesday at the United Nations that Beijing was attempting to influence the midterms.
