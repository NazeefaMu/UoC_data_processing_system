Two people have been murdered and 16 have been wounded in a mass shooting at a Florida night club.

The gunman entered the club and opened fire hitting people as young as 13 in Club Blu, in Fort Myers in Florida.

It is understood there have been reports of shootings at two other locations. Police are treating the three incidents as being linked.

The gunman is believed to have shot at a car and a house.

Witnesses reported hearing at least 30 rounds being fired during the incident.

Three people had been detained for questioning, the police said, and the area was 'deemed safe' although roads in the vicinity were closed as the investigation continues.

Local television reported that the club was hosting a 'teen night'.

However, the shooting comes six weeks after a massacre at a nightclub in the Florida city of Orlando, in which a lone gunman killed 49 people in the deadliest mass shooting in US history. (Daily Mail - UK)
