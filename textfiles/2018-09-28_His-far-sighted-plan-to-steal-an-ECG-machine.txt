His far-sighted plan to steal an ECG machine!


	



 

When the main city council had procured three ECG recorder-machines for the three medical centres being run by it, they had also received an extra-recorder-machine free as part of the bargain.

 


The three machines installed in the three medical centres are said to lying idle gathering dust as ECG recordists have not been assigned to these centres.


The worst part of this affair is that the extra-ECG machine received by the council has gone missing now.


It has come to light that the politico, who took the initiative to purchase the ECG machines with an eye on the extra-machine, had quietly taken it away. But he has failed to take any interest in appointing an ECG recordist for any of the three centres, they say.
