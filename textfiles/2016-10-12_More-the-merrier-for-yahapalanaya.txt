More the merrier for yahapalanaya


	



 

Lady Luck is about to smile on four Diyawanna members currently occupying the backbenches in the opposition, they say.

 


Two members of the foursome are stalwarts of the Cockerel party.  In fact, cockerels had been in the queue at the door-step of yahapalanaya for some time and the powers that be appear to have decided now that time is opportune to accommodate them as it would help the government to face the brewing crisis in the upcountry plantation sector from a position of enhanced strength. 


The other lucky duo is Dougie from the North and …malli from Nivitigala, informed ones say. There is also a move to release the blocked budgetary allocations due to them for development work as part of the plan to win their support for the Big Boss.
