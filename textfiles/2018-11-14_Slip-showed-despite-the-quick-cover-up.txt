Slip showed despite the quick cover-up!


	

This story comes from a source that overheard a discussion of a group of Green Party backbenchers camping at Temple Trees determined to carry on the battle to re-take the lost power.  


These politicos were Diyawanna members hailing from areas like Sabaragamuwa and Wayamba and Colombo.  


One Diyawanna member was heard telling others:  


“How much have we told our Lokka to take head-on our rivals in this game? He is playing hide-and-seek without taking the initiative! We have become helpless as a result!”  


Then another member had put in his own worth:  


“Just see, Machang! When our Lokka is silent, it is either people from other parties or newcomers to our party who do a littlesabre-rattlingg! If our Lokka does not care about what is happening, why should we stick out our necks?”  


Yet another member who had been keeping quiet all this while had opened up:  


“Machang, apith yamuda? (May we also go!”) This question had had instantly sent up the eye brows of other members.

  
Finding that his suggestion had produced an effect just the opposite of what he expected, the member tried to cover up what he really meant.  


“Machang, what I meant, let us go home to refresh ourselves with a good bath and a brief rest!”  


However, the others looked at their colleague with suspicion as they believed what this colleague from Sabaragamuwa really suggested was that they quit the party to do a crossover, says the informed source.
