The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would be re-organised after the 66th Anniversary celebration, Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake said today.

While addressing the media at the Campbell Park, Colombo where the 66th SLFP anniversary is scheduled to be held, he said that the re-organising of the party would be done according to the party constitution.

“If there are any incidents or personnel, who had violated the party constitution, we will pay attention to rectify them during the re-organising processes and we hope to re- organize the party from the grassroots,” he said.

He said that the SLFP Central Committee had informed them to act according to the decision during the party’s re-organising. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
