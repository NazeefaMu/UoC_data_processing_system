Sinhala and Tamil New Year is an event that brings Sri Lankans from all walks of life together where they look forward to the auspicious times to spruce up their homes and give gifts to their loved ones.  
To share the spirit of this festive season, Pan Asia Bank has come up with a promotion where a range of valuable gifts are to be given away to its customers when they make a qualifying deposit with the bank. 
This Avurudu promotion, which is based on ganu denu, one of our most cherished local traditions, is valid from March 23 to April 30.
Under this promotion, customers will be offered valuable gifts such as electric coconut scrapers, gas cookers and handy lunch bags when they open a qualifying fixed deposit or make a qualifying deposit to any savings account including children’s savings accounts. 
The fixed deposits also include Suwasavi fixed deposits, which offer a free family medical insurance and special senior citizen’s fixed deposits. (Conditions apply). 
In order to honour this rich tradition of conducting ganu denu, all Pan Asia Bank branches, except the World Trade Centre (WTC) branch, will be kept opened even on April 14 from 9:00 a.m. to 
12 noon. 
The uniqueness about this promotion is that in addition to these valuable gifts, the customers will also receive an attractive interest rate on their deposits. Going the extra mile, the bank has added another reason for its customers to enjoy the season by offering gifts for every Western Union transaction made at any of its branches islandwide. This is a special promotion for all Western Union money transfers performed at all Pan Asia Bank branches islandwide throughout the month of April or until the stocks last.  
Pan Asia Bank hopes that this will encourage savings among customers to ensure a prosperous New Year while simultaneously allowing them to enjoy the rewards of their savings.
Pan Asia Bank, the fastest growing commercial bank in Sri Lanka, has been in operation for over two decades and possesses a network of 82 branches and offers a full range of retail, SME and corporate banking products and services.
