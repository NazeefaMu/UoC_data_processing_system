Embark opens store at Dickman’s Road

Twenty five years after she launched her first retail store, entrepreneur and brand builder Otara Gunewardene has returned to that location to open an independent store to celebrate Christmas with Embark fans in Colombo.
The opening of the new store at 38, Dickman’s Road (now Lester James Peiris Mawatha) is part of the planned expansion of Embark’s retail presence after Ms Gunewardene exited from Odel to refocus her energies on the building the community animal welfare programme and the fashion label that supports it.
The Dickman’s Road store accommodates the full range of Embark products including the brand’s signature slogan T shirt range for Ladies, Gents and Kids, the famous Embark wrist bands, fashion accessories, bags, gifts and canine products as well as the full range of 2015 Christmas Specials that the company says is sure to make excellent gifts during the season.
 The building, which many Colombo residents still recall as the first Odel store, has been given a colourful exterior and bold branding that makes it stand out visually and easy to find.
Ample customer parking has been made available opposite the store.
Embark ventured into independent retail in August this year with the opening of its Galle store and has since opened stores at the departure lounge of the Bandaranaike International Airport and at Kandy City Centre. The brand is also available at Odel Alexandra Place and Odel K Zone, Ja-Ela.
