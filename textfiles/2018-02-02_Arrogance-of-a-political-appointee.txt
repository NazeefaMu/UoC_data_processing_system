Arrogance of a political appointee


	



 

This fair one ensconced by a powerful political hand in the main chair of a department collecting revenue for the government recently tongue-lashed a clerk in such abusive language unbecoming of a high-up of her position, employees say.

 


This white collar high-up had got furious when she found a Rs.250 allowance which she thought was due to her but had not been added to her monthly salary. Concerned, she had immediately sent for the pay clerk and demanded why he failed to add the allowance to her monthly pay.

 
“Have you no brain? Don’t work like a donkey! Do you know that my husband is a Ministry secretary?” she had asked. 


The pay clerk had explained that according to the relevant Treasury circular, only Ministry secretaries were entitled to this allowance. 


“What the hell do you know about Treasury circulars?” the high-up had barked at the clerk. “I’ll chase you out like a dog. Now get out!”
