The endorsement of the Bill to set up the Office of the Missing Persons (OMP) sans submitted amendments was a grave error, which could lead to negative repercussions, the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) charged today.

JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said it had been reported that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had placed his signature to the OMP Bill without including the amendments.

“Both President Maithripala Sirisena and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) submitted amendments to the OMP Bill. If the amendments are not included, the OMP Bill would lead to grave repercussions. Therefore, the Government should make sure that the amendments are included in the Bill,” he told a news conference.

The JVP submitted several proposals to the Bill including a proposal which suggests that the OMP should inform the Inspector General of Police within 48 hours after it conducted a search. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
