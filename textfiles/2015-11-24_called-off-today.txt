	The railway strike launched by the locomotive engine drivers against an alleged assault on an engine driver was called off this morning, the Railway Trade Unions Alliance (RTUA) said.
	RTUA Co-Convener S. P. Vithanage said the trade union action was called off after the General Manager of the Railways had assured that action would be taken against those who had assaulted the engine driver.
	More than 20 trains were cancelled because of the strike launched against the assault on an engine driver at the Ragama Railway Station yesterday.
