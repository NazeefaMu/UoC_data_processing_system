He rejects low cost power to keep the price level high


	

A private power generating project planned to be launched in Chunnakam with a view to feeding electricity to the national grid at a relatively low cost has been abandoned following a strong objection made by a powerful political authority in yahapalanaya. 

 


Those behind the proposed project had assured the authorities that they would be able to supply electricity at the rate of Rs.10 per unit once their plant is in operation. Meanwhile, CEB engineers say that the Board is now buying power from the private sector at the rate of Rs.20 to Rs.23 per unit and electricity for Rs.10 per unit from the proposed power plant project would be a great boon. 


However, the political authority has put his foot down saying that the CEB should not buy electricity cheap from the proposed project for it would deal a blow to the private sector suppliers of electricity generated from wind power.
