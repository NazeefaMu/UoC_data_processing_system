Security forces have been put on alert to face any situation in the wake of occurrences in Kandy, Prime Minister and Minister of Law and Order Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

The Prime Minister said this in a special statement made last evening.

He said Area Commander Central Province Major General Rukman Dias has been put in charge to coordinate defence activities in the province. “Reinforcements have also been sent to these areas,” he said.

The Prime Minister stressed that the government was compelled to block social media platforms temporarily as hate speeches were continuously being posted on them.

“Let me stress that the rest of the country is relatively calm and I request the people not to get mislead by false information, I appeal to people of all ethnic groups to cooperate with the forces to ensure law and order in the country,” he added.

The Prime Minister assured that the government would be able to control the situation and to bring in normalcy.

He added that curfew needed to be reinforced in Kandy following a grenade explosion last evening. Summarising what had occurred in Kandy, he said the violence had begun after a driver was assaulted and killed in Theldeniya.
