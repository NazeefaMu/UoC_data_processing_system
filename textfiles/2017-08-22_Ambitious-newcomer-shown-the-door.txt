A well-known actor-turned politico at provincial level made news when he defected to another political party recently.

 


After singing the praises of his new party leader for a short while, he had approached the latter to seek the post of an electorate level party organizer. He had mentioned two electorates he was interested in and appealed that he be appointed as the organizer to one of them. 


Angered by the ambitious politico’s unreasonable request, the party leader had shown him the door.
The provincial politico had sought to be the organizer of one of the two electorates he mentioned knowing well that two party veterans were already functioning as the organizers of these electorates, they say.
