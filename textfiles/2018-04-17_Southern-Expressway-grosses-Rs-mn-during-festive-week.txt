Accordingly, Rs.23 million has been generated from over 79, 700 vehicles that travelled on Sunday (15) while Rs.14 million was generated from over 50, 000 vehicles that travelled on Saturday (14).

Also, 23 vehicle accidents were reported on Saturday (14) on the Southern Expressway.

More vehicle breakdowns were reported on the Southern Expressway during the same time period due to adverse weather conditions.
