The Railway Operations Supervisory Union (ROSU) and the Ceylon Railway Guards Union (CRGU) yesterday threatened to launch an indefinite strike from Friday, if their demand for a salary increase was not met.

Speaking to Daily Mirror, ROSU Convener Lal Ariyaratne said the National Salaries and Cadre Commission had not followed the instructions given by Saman Ekanayaka, Secretary to the Prime Minister, on increasing their salaries.

He said Mr. Ekanayaka had instructed the commission to grant a pay hike under the circular 6/2006.

“During the previous strike, we demanded the Railways Department to increase the salary scale of Engine Drivers, Guards, Station Masters and Controllers to MP1 and MP2 categories,” he said.

Mr. Ekanayaka has told the commission to assign a pay hike within one month starting from September 20. He said this decision was given during the previous 48-hour train strike.

“The one month duration will come to an end on Friday. The only decision taken by the commission is assigning employees to a category which has a salary lower than the specified basic salary,” Mr. Ariyaratne said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)
