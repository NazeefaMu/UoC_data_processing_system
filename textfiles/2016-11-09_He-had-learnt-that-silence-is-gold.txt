He had learnt that silence is gold!


	



 

A group of Diyawanna members and Deputies from the Green party were engaged in an animated discussion in the council lobby the other day. The subject under discussion was the latest COPE report.

 


“Our people will soon forget this affair as usual,” a party member from the Colombo district remarked lightly. 


However, a young member from the Gampaha district was not prepared to shrug off the affair as a passing cloud. He said: “The end-result of this Bond affair is that we have to think twice before calling others rogues in future.”


The attention of the Green members at this stage turned to a Deputy who happens to be a member of the COPE. They expected this Deputy to defend their role in regard to the Bond affair. But the Deputy was grinning without making any response. Intrigued by his silence, two or three young members told the Deputy: “Aiya, why don’t you say something?  You were in it and you ought to know what really transpired.” 


Pressed by all present to speak up, the Deputy said: “I expressed my candid opinion about this affair at the very outset. And then I was moved out of the Ministry where I was happily working and was parked where I am today. If I take the liberty to express my genuine opinion about it again, I might be shifted out of the present Ministry as well. That’s why I keep my mouth shut.” The Deputy walked away soon after giving this answer to his inquisitive colleagues.
