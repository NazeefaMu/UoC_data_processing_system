Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today he would take suitable action on the remarks made by MP Wimal Weerawansa to ‘bomb’ Parliament.

Issuing a statement, the Speaker's media unit said the matter would be discussed in Parliament as soon as it was convened.

It said National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and MP Weerawansa was alleged to have said that there was a necessity to bomb Parliament.

The media unit said the members of the government, opposition and other factions had drawn Speaker Jayasuriya’s attention to Mr. Weerawansa’s remarks as it posed a threat to the security and well being of all parliamentarians, officials and other employees of Parliament.

“All these factions requested the Speaker to take the threatening remarks made by MP Weerawansa seriously,” it said. (Sandun A. Jayasekera)
