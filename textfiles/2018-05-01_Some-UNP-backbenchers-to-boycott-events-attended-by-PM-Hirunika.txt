UNP MP Hirunika Premachandra said today some UNP backbenchers had decided not to attend any event which Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe attends because they were disappointed with the party reforms.

She said the Prime Minister had assured them he would give a decision on the party reforms based on the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee report but it never happened.

“More than 20 UNP backbenchers are disappointed as the Premier did not keep his word and that they had not got an opportunity to express their disappointment,” Ms. Premachandra said and added that this situation might lead to a rift within the party. (Ajith Siriwardana)
