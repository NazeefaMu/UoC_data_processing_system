The Joint Opposition yesterday said Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy has assured that former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa had no involvement in the controversial gazette which is said to have resulted in the Bond Sale Scam.

The Governor had conveyed this to the group of JO MPs who visited the Central Bank yesterday. The MPs visited the Central Bank and met the Governor as it had been two years since the controversial Bond Sale Scam had taken place at the Central Bank.

MP Bandula Gunawardane said the Finance Minister and the government were attempting to put the blame of the issue on Mr. Rajapaksa and to sweep the issue under the carpet.

“We inquired from the Governor as to why no action being taken against the Perpetual Treasuries, which is involved in the Bond Sale scam. Meanwhile, the government attempts to drag Mr. Rajapaksa into the blunder. However, the governor said Mr. Rajapaksa was not responsible for the gazette and he was not involved in the bond sale scam,” the MP told journalists outside the Central Bank.

He said the JO was hoping to submit evidence with regard to the misappropriation to the special presidential commission appointed by the President to look into the issue.

Speaking to the media, MP Namal Rajapaksa said they had requested the governor to expedite the internal probe into the bond scam. “It had been two years without any action. The alleged company still engages in bond sale. Why the CB couldn’t at least halt their license temporarily,” he questioned. In a surprising move, he said, the Perpetual Treasuries had filed a case against the Central Bank. “This is absurd,” he said.

The MP said they had requested Governor Coomaraswamy to clear the air over the gazette and Mr. Rajapaksa. “We will seek legal action against unscrupulous allegations. The Governor also said allegations are false. We requested him to clarify the issue,” he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)
