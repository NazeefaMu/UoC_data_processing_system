The Joint Opposition said it had decided to hold a discussion with the Governor of the Central Bank on matters related to finance of the country.

JO Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said this decision was taken mainly in connection with two matters revealed in the Parliament last week.

“Hidden debts of the Government and repayment of loans and foreign investment in Treasury Bonds will be discussed as revealed in Parliament,” he said.

“The impending economic crisis during next year will also be highlighted in our discussion,” he said.

“The JO also expects to meet International Monetary Fund (IMF) Representative responsible for arranging loan facilities for Sri Lanka,” he said. (Dayaseeli Liyanage)
