 At a meeting held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena today, a decision had been taken to expedite a forensic audit into the Central Bank bond scam, the President’s Media Division (PMD) said.

The meeting was held at the Presidential Secretariat to discuss the progress of the investigations launched into the bond scam.

In a statement, the PMD said a number of causes which had delayed the bond scam investigations were revealed at the meeting.

“No charge sheet had been submitted against the suspects who had been remanded over the scam. When relevant Acts were being reformed to finalise legal action within a fixed time frame, the sectoral committee in parliament had obstructed the move. Though the bond commission had recommended to conduct a forensic audit, it has not been conducted. Accordingly, it was decided to file court cases within a fixed time frame, to conduct a forensic audit immediately and to discuss the progress of the investigations on a monthly basis,” the statement said.

Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, Bribery Commission Director General Sarath Jayamanna, Senior DIG Ravi Senaviratne of the CID, acting Governor of Central Bank Nandalal Weerasinghe and other officials also attended the meeting.
