Turkish video ‘shows Khashoggi plotters’


	



 

A Turkish newspaper has released CCTV images of a group of men police are investigating in connection with the disappearance of a Saudi journalist.   


The Sabah newspaper identified fifteen men who flew into Istanbul on the day journalist and critic Jamal Khashoggi went missing last Tuesday after walking into the Saudi consulate.   


They were pictured arriving at Ataturk airport’s border control on Tuesday last week having allegedly flown into Turkey in two private jets from the Saudi capital Riyadh.   


Turkish officials believe Khashoggi may have been murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and then taken out of the country by private jet.   The group of men identified by Sabah reportedly included Salah Muhammad A Tubaigy, 47, the head of the Saudi Forensic Medicine Institute.   


An expert on forensic evidence, he is known to have trained a large number of police officers in crime scene investigation.   


Mugshots of the middle-aged men, who flew into the country by private jet, were released alongside details of their ages and travel itineraries.   
Turkish television also revealed CCTV footage of them arriving at Istanbul airport and making their way through the streets of the city around the embassy.   


The men arrived at the embassy half-an-hour before Khashoggi turned up for his appointment.
