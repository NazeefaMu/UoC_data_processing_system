A certain yahapalanaya purohita who plays a lead role at every election has gone into the mute mode these days, they say.

 


The man who would not dream of going abroad on the eve of an election is surprisingly overseas now. 


The unusual behavior of this Blue-turned Green purohita has baffled the Green backbenchers too.
This purohita is known to have taken highly contentious decisions at various times in his political career and some of these decisions had backfired on the government. 


Meanwhile, some say the purohita is about to make yet another political somersault. 


Even his supporters in the South say that the man’s silence is deafening.
