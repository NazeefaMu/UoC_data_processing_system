The award was accepted on behalf of the bank by its Assistant Vice President Marketing Sanjaya Senarath. Commenting on the receipt of this Award Senarath said, “We are honoured and humbled to be recognized by CEF. The bank worked hard to introduce one of the most customer-friendly mobile apps delivering convenience to the user.
As a late entrant in this space we needed to create awareness to highlight the value and unique aspects of the app. Hence, the shake and bank campaign that aimed to break the clutter and gain attention. While the marketing communication campaign is still ongoing with many stages to follow we are thrilled to be recognized at this forum.”
NDB’s mobile banking app is the bank’s flagship IT-led initiative. Customers can bank with convenience; access their account to carry out various secured transactions from any mobile devices running iOS, Android or Windows.
