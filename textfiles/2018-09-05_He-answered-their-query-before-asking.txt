He answered their query before asking!


	



 

Number One in yahapalanaya had summoned the party organizers at the periphery for an important discussion the other day.

 


The organizers who had attended from various parts of the country had been seen talking hush-hush in small knots about the future direction of the party.  The rumour that Number One was going to team up with the former strongman for a new political journey had been the main subject of their hush-hush.  Some had sounded unhappy and highly upset about the rumour, but some others had welcomed it as happy tidings. Anyway, they all had decided to get the factual position from the horse’s mouth itself.


Presently the proceedings had begun and Number One himself was the first to take the floor.
It had been obvious from his address that he had no intention to have any truck with the former strongman and the rumour that set many a tongue wagging was baseless.


In fact, Number One had lambasted the JO for their plans to stage ‘a massive protest’ against the government.


Number One, in conclusion, had appealed for their unstinted support to restore the party to its pristine glory.


Finally, they had dispersed without asking any of the questions they had planned to put to Number One!
