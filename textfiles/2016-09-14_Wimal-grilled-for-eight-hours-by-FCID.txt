National Freedom Front Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa was grilled for over eight hours today by the Police Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) for his alleged involvement in misusing a fleet of vehicles belonging to Presidential Secretariat during election campaigns.

The former Minster of Construction arrived at the FCID office in Fort around 9.10 a.m. and a statement was recorded in length before he was permitted to leave around 5.00 p.m.

According to FCID sources, Mr. Weerawansa had been summoned to question about his involvement in a large scam of misusing a fleet of vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat and the Engineering Services Department in the run up to the Presidential Poll in January 2015.

The FCID commenced an investigation earlier to probe into the allegations that a fleet of private vehicles hired by the Presidential Secretariat for its routine duties had been handed over to the Ministry of Construction for its routine operations.

The inquiries revealed that the vehicles received by the Engineering Services Department on rent had been given out to number of third parties on a subcontract to be used in the canvassing work for the Presidential Elections campaign.

According to investigations 12 vehicles belonging to the Presidential Secretariat and 40 vehicles belonging to the Ministry of Construction and Engineering Services had been misused in election campaigns, the FCID said.(Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)
