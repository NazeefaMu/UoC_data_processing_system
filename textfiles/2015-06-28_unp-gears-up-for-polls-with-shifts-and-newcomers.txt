These include Joseph Michael Perera from the Gampaha District, Eran Wickramaratne and Dr. Harsha de Silva from the Colombo District and R. Yogarajan from the Nuwara Eliya District.

One of those major shifts is Ranjan Ramanayake who confirmed that he will contest from the Gampaha District where contested the 2010 general election from the same District as well.
