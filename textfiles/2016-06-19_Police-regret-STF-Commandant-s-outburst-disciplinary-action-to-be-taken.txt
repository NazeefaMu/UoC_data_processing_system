While expressing regrets to the media over the threats made by the Special Task Force (STF) Commandant, DIG Ranjith Perera, SSP Ajith Rohana yesterday said disciplinary action would be taken against DIG Perera.

In a special news conference last Friday (17) at STF headquarters DIG Perera said that STF that overcame the underworld, knew how to punish journalists, whom he claims, had fallen into the hands of underworld gangsters and mafia members, while slinging mud at the STF.

DIG Perera blasted out at the media for not commending and acknowledging the STF's contribution in the last week's largest cocaine bust.

However, SSP Ajitha Rohana said the Sri Lanka Police or the STF had no intention to punish the media or threaten them, and the DIG Perera’s statement should not be considered as a common statement representing the STF.

He said under Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara’s directions, necessary disciplinary actions would be taken against DIG Perera soon. (Indika Ramanayake)
