Kiriella tells plantation companies
Increase wages or hand over estate management to Govt.

Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday told plantation companies to either increase the wages of their workers as proposed or hand over the management of the estates, back to the government.
Speaking at the District Development Committee meeting in Kandy, the minister said if the companies cannot develop the plantations under them, earn profits and increase the wages of workers, it was feasible for them to hand over the relevant functions back to the government.
The minister said some companies were managing estates with 20,000 plus hectares in extent.
“Even when plantations were managed by the British, it was only about 5,000 hectares in extent each. Now, it is 20,000 hectares,” he added.
“These companies should hand the plantations over if they cannot increase the wages in line with the government policy,” he said.The government through the recent budget proposed to increase the daily wages of the plantation workers.
