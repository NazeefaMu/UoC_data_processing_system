Never get carried away with NCM victory - Sajith


	

One should not get carried away with the defeat of the No-Confidence Motion but should co-concentrate on the Presidential and General Elections in 2020, Minister of Housing Sajith Premadasa said over the weekend.

Mr. Premasada made this sentiment at the opening of Siyanethugama village for the blind on Saturday.

“We were able to win the No-Confidence Motion. However, we should all remember that we have only managed to win the confidence of the majority from 225 members in Parliament. We should be able to win the confidence of 20 million people of this country.

One must not think that the Opposition is finished for good. We will be digging our own grave (Illang Kanawa) if we think that way,” Mr. Premadasa said.

He said the Opposition learnt its lesson when the No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister was passed. However, we have won a great battle by defeating it.

The minister pledged to create 2,500 reawakened villages by 2020.

“The village reawakening programme that had been started by this government would have died if the no faith motion against the Prime Minister was passed on April 4, 2018,” he added. (Yohan Perera)
