Stern trade union action would be taken if President Maithripala Sirisena failed to reveal the government’s stance on SAITM within Monday as promised, the GMOA warned a short while ago.

Addressing a press conference, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said a discussion was held with the President last Friday over the SAITM issue.

During the discussion, he said the President pledged to reveal the stance on Monday. He said the day had almost ended and the President’s words had become lies.  (By Thilanka Kanakarathna)
