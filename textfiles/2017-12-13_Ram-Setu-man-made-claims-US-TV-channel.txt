'Ram Setu' man-made, claims US TV channel


	

The spotlight is back on the mythological 'Ram Setu' between India and Sri Lanka, after a show on the Science Channel in the US hinted that such a structure may actually exist outside of mythology.

A promo released by the channel suggests that the bridge - also called Adam's Bridge - may not be a natural formation and may have been built by humans.

"Are the ancient Hindu myths of a land bridge connecting India and Sri Lanka true? Scientific analysis suggests they are," says text accompanying the promo.

Citing images from a Nasa satellite, the show claims that investigators have found a line of rocks 30 miles long between Sri Lanka and India.

The stones in the image are sitting on a 'sandbar', which occurs in areas with shallow water. As geologist Erin Argyilan explains, sand could accumulate between the land masses.

An analysis of the rocks found on the sea bed shows that they predate the sand, Rose adds.

Specifically, the 7,000-year-old rocks are sitting on sand that is 4,000-years-old.

In fact, geologist Dr Alan Lester believes that the stones were brought from afar and set atop the sandbar island chain. (Times of India)
