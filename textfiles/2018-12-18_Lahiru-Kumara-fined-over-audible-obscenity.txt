Sri Lankan cricketer Lahiru Kumara has been fined 15% of his match fee and has also received one demerit point after being found guilty of using an audible obscenity during the third day’s play in the first Test against New Zealand in Wellington on Monday, the ICC said.

In a statement, the ICC said the bowler was found to have violated Article 2.3 of the code, which relates to “use of an audible obscenity during an international match”.

“Kumara used an audible obscenity after an outside edge off Tom Latham’s bat in the 96th over went for a boundary. These comments were heard by the on-field umpires and also picked up by the stump mic. After the day’s play, Kumara admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Richie Richardson of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing,” it said.

The charge had been levelled by on-field umpires Rod Tucker and Michael Gough, third umpire Richard Illingworth, all from the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Umpires, as well as fourth umpire Tim Brown.
