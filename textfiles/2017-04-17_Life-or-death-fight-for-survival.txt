Life-or-death fight for survival


	



A drink at a watering hole turned into a life or death struggle for this young elephant after a crocodile clamped onto its trunk.

The jumbo was drinking at a lake in Liwonde National Park in Malawi when the beast leapt out of the water. At first the rest of the herd backed off as the elephant shook its trunk back and forth in an attempt to dislodge the reptile.

But then another member of the herd came to their companion's aid, charging down the crocodile and knocking it back onto the ground. (Daily Mail)
