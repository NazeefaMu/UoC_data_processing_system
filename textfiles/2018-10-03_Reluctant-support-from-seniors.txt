Reluctant support from seniors!


	



 

The JO group is set to embark on a new political venture: to expose the doings of the khaki top brass and the legal wing of the State. The young one of the leading political dynasty who gave leadership to the recent Janabalaya has been invited to lead the proposed new venture as well, they say.

 


The young one has accepted the challenging job and the young Diyawanna colleagues have pledged their support to him.


However, some JO seniors are said to have reacted to the idea with sour faces. However, they make it a point to tell the young one to his face, “Malli, we all are backing you to the hilt.”
