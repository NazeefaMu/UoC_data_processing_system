Sustainable development and Wildlife Minister Sarath Fonseka said yesterday steps were being taken to grow grasslands on 15 acres of land to feed wild elephants.

He told parliament that forest lands suitable for this purpose were being identified at the moment.

"We are engaged in the process of identifying the areas suitable to grow grass. The project is funded by the United Nations Organisations," the minister said.

In a response to a question asked by UNP MP Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, the minister said these grasslands would help feed about 1,500 wild elephants which strayed into villages looking for food.

He said the move would be an effective solution to the human-elephant conflict. (Ajith Siriwardana and Yohan Perera)
