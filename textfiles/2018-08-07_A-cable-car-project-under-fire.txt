A cable car project under fire!


	



 

A business tycoon with close ties to a main political party is set to launch a cable car service project with the sacred city in the upcountry as the pivotal point, they say.

 


However, a certain section has raised objections to this project saying that it goes against the general acceptance that has become almost a tradition that no structure that rises above the golden canopy of the Sacred Palace should come up in the area. 


Reports say that the cable line is routed over a forest reserve and plans are underway to fell priceless trees in this reserve for the purpose.
