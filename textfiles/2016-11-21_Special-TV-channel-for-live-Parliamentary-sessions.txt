A special TV channel, which will only telecast parliamentary proceedings live, will be launched in three months time, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informed Parliament today.

The Speaker said the proceedings were aired live on Eye Channel from today.

“The Eye Channel will telecast parliamentary proceedings live except on the days where the West Indies, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe one day international tournament matches are on. Eye Chanel had got into an agreement to broadcast cricket matches live and therefore it is not possible to telecast parliamentary proceedings live on those days. Rupawahini will telecast parliamentary proceedings live on the days on which cricket matches are on," the speaker said.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe suggested that the proceedings of constitutional assembly should also be shown live. (Yohan Perera)
