Green-turned-Blue’s appointment draws flak


	



 

There is a buzz in political circles that a Green-turned–Blue from Uva has been appointed the leader of the Diyawanna Blue group. 

 


Some Blue party stalwarts had openly told the Big Boss at the Executive Committee meeting held the other day that they could not subscribe to this appointment.  Even the former Madam who was present had asked the Boss why he made such a controversial appointment. 


Amid the ongoing ho-ha about the appointment, the man from the Uva had begun praising the Big Boss for his achievements not forgetting to hurl an occasional acid remark at the Green party.


However, neither the praise heaped on the Big Boss nor the critical remarks made about his previous party softened the Blue members who had persisted with their opposition to the Uva turncoat being appointed as their group leader. 


The Big Boss had finally agreed to reconsider the appointment and dismissed the subject saying: “Now let us proceed with the next item on the agenda.”
