Body From Chennai Washed Ashore in Sri Lanka?

An unidentified body of a man, probably belonging to flooded Chennai, has been washed ashore in Neelaveli near Trincomalee in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka on Sunday, sources in Trincomalee told Express.
 
A local Tamil TV station said that the body had a Chennai driving license. Other sources said that three bodies had been washed ashore.
 
But the Lankan navy spokesman Capt.Akram Alavi said that no body had been recovered though two naval boats had gone into sea at 6 pm after the Trincomalee harbor police told the naval station that six bodies were seen floating 20 nautical miles from the shore.
 
“The naval boats have not reported back till now,” Capt.Alavi said.
 
Asked if it was possible for bodies of Chennai flood victims to be washed thus far, the naval spokesman said that they could be, depending on the sea currents. (Indian Express)
