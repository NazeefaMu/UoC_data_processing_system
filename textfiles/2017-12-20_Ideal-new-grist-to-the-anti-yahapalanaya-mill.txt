Ideal new grist to the anti-yahapalanaya mill


	



 

The JO made much political capital out of the CB bond affair fiasco. And now that the issue was spent and stale, they were looking for something good enough to use against the government when Long Jay from Wattala did them a great favour. And it was the ideal stuff for any opposition in the run-up to an election in particular.

 


Long Jay bragged that they knew how to hold elections, or run the Police service or the government for that matter – a statement that could be interpreted in thousand and one ways to slam the government. 


The JO bigwigs have now started raking Long Jay and his party government over red hot coals at all public forums. Meanwhile, they have planned to inundate the Police Commission and the Elections Commission with a heap of complaints against the yahapalanaya.
