SL and India to play T20 series in February

India and Sri Lanka are set to play a three-match T20 series, prior to the Asia Cup, as both teams look ahead to the World T20.
The tour begins in Pune on February 9, then the teams head to Delhi to play the second match on February 12 and the final T20 will take place in Visakhapatnam on February 14.
These matches will be the first time the two sides face each other in the shortest format since the final of the 2014 World Twenty20, which Sri Lanka won in April in 2014.
