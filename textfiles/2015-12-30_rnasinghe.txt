JHU Spokesman and former Western Province Health Minister Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said today he was removed from his ministerial portfolios in an act of political revenge because he had lodged complaints with the Bribery Commission and other law enforcements agencies against corrupt politicians in the previous government.
He told a media conference that according to the Constitution, a provincial minister could not be removed on the basis of a financial statement being defeated.
“I was not officially informed of the move to take over my ministerial portfolios and came to know about it through media that my ministerial portfolios were taken over by Chief Minister Isura Devapriya. If I was to be removed he should have informed me in advance. This is an act of political revenge,” he said.
Mr. Warnasinghe said since he worked hard in lodging complaints with the Bribery Commission and other law enforcements agencies against offences committed by several politicians, who represented previous government, he had to become a victim in their well planned act revenge.
Meanwhile, he said he would never stop his political journey over some people’s cheap and futile attempts to discourage him. He added that he would serve as a provincial councilor within the council and give his best towards the betterment of the people.
Mr. Warnasinghe who served as a provincial minister for three months said he never considered his ministerial portfolio as an adornment and was not disappointed over the loss because he knew how he stood against the injustice by other councilors.
During the media briefing he said the Governor had called for a special vote on the expenditure head of the Health Ministry tomorrow. (Piyumi Fonseka)
