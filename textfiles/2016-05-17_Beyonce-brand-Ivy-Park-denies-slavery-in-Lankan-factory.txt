Beyonce brand Ivy Park denies ‘slavery’ in Lankan factory


	

Beyonce’s workout clothing line, Ivy Park, has denied claims by The Sun newspaper of running a sweatshop in its Sri Lanka factory, the Irish Examiner reported today.

It has been alleged that Beyonce’s sportswear brand is made by workers who earn 44 pence an hour in squalid conditions.

The range was created to “support and inspire women”, but its Sri Lankan workers earn just 4.30 sterling pounds a day, the Sun tabloid had claimed.

The Sun reported that Anti-Slavery International campaigner Jakub Sobik has attacked Beyonce’s brand, saying: “With what is being described here, this is a form of sweat-shop slavery…

“Companies like Topshop have a duty to find out if these things are happening, and it has long been shown that ethical inspections by these companies are failing.”

The company is not breaking any laws, as the legal minimum wage in Sri Lanka is 13,500 rupees a month — or £140 — but campaigners feel it should be 43,000 rupees, or £450.

A Topshop spokesperson defended Beyonce’s range: “Ivy Park has a rigorous ethical trading programme. We are proud of our sustained efforts, in terms of factory inspections and audits, and our teams work very closely with our suppliers and their factories to ensure compliance.”
