Phone going off inside Court is not contempt of court: HCLA


	

Commenting on a case filed against former solicitor general and President Counsel Rienzie Arsakularatne, whose mobile phone had reportedly rung inside the Galle High Court, the Hultsdorp High Court Lawyers’ Association (HCLA) today affirmed that when a phone rings inside a Court room it could not be considered a Contempt of Court as the occurrence was an involuntary act.
Secretary of the HCLA, Counsel Mohan Sellapperuma, explained that it was unreasonable to bring contempt of court charges against an individual for an involuntary act such as a person's phone going off since it is not an deliberate act.
If we don’t get a proper solution from other institutions, all High Court lawyers at Hultsdorp would be present in court for the case against PC Arsakularatne on January 22.
Meanwhile, the Colombo Magistrate’s Court Lawyers’ Association also expressed their solidarity with PC Arsakularatne saying if this matter is not settled amicably they would organize a peaceful protest against the Galle High Court Judge’s decision to bring charges against PC Arsakularatne.(Shehan Chamika Silva)
