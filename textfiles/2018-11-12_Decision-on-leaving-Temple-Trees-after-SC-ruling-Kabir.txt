Chairman of United National Party (UNP) former Minister Kabir Hashim said on Saturday his party would decide whether to vacate Temple Trees or not, only after the Supreme Court rules on the Constitutionality of the dissolution of Parliament.

He told a journalist who inquired as to how much longer the UNP would remain at Temple Trees that it was still too early to decide.

Former Minister of Finance, Mangala Samaraweera said that according to a statement put out by former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, who ruled that the status quo before the prorogation of Parliament should stand, Ranil Wickremesinghe was still the legitimate Prime Minister.
