He now runs the show


	



 

A highly privileged inmate of a state-run lodge has come to command such clout now that he has become the virtual authority deciding as to who should be admitted to the star class hospital ward he is currently occupying. 

 


A person hailing from the business elite, now an accused in a sensational case pending in courts was ordered into a temporary stay in the state-run lodge recently. And when the lodge authorities had admitted him to the particular star class ward on medical advice as usual, the privileged inmate already occupying it had immediately objected to the new admission and the authorities had meekly transferred the new mate to another ward in the hospital, they say. 


The privileged inmate, a onetime prominent politico, is directing his business operations from his ward and he is averse to sharing the ward with any other mate who could become an impediment to his operations, informed sources say.
