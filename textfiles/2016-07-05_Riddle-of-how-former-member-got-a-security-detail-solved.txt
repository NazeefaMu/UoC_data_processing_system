Riddle of how former member got a security detail solved


	



It has come to light that a Green heavyweight has abused his political clout to provide a security detail for a former Diyawanna member now facing a litany of charges including extortion and misuse of government vehicles.

 


A delegation from a political party in the main stream had met a very high political authority to complain about the favoured treatment given to the former Diyawanna member.


The political authority had explained that he had no hand in providing security to the former Diyawanna member at public expense adding that he could prove it. Thereafter, the high authority had called a Police high-up after turning the phone’s volume up. When the Police high-up came on the line, he had asked him on whose request he provided security to the former Diyawanna member. The Police high-up had replied: “Sir, I assigned a security detail on instructions given by ….”


The delegates from the political party had clearly heard the reply given by the Police high-up.
Presently the high political authority had turned to them and asked them: “Now do you accept that lots of things can happen without my knowledge?”
