President Maithripala Sirisena today requested all Railways Department employees including train drivers who are on strike to report to work considering the difficulties faced by the general public and the students who are sitting the GCE O/L exam.

In a statement last evening, he requested all parties to pay heed and to fulfil their humane responsibility by the students as they were already going through stressful periods during examinations.

He said an opportunity for a future discussion could be given if the issues of the railway employees who are on strike, had not been resolved.
