A high white-collar authority of the main state-run lodge said to be responsible for turning another lodge high-up into an inmate of the same lodge has been transferred out with immediate effect, they say.

 


The white-collar authority is holding a rank that qualifies him for promotion to the highest office in the department.


The lodge high-up now reduced to an inmate of the same lodge is receiving star class comforts in the lodge, they say.
