The Ford Mustang found by the FCID yesterday was brought with parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa’s vehicle permit and a bank loan, Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.

The car suspected to be owned by the parliamentarian, in 2010, was found by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division yesterday in Kaduwela.

Speaking to the media in Anuradhapura, the former President said Namal had purchased the car in the same manner other parliamentarians did and later sold the vehicle to another individual.

“Namal produced the documents to confirm the transaction. The buyer didn’t even know the vehicle was being taken by the FCID until the last moment,” Rajapakse said.
