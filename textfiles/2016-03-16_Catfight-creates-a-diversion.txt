Catfight creates a diversion


	



 

The main character of this story is a powerful purohita in yahapalanaya hailing from a district in Ruhuna. 

 


A certain lady, a businesswoman with close ties to the Western Province very often accompanies the purohita whenever he attends an outstation ceremony or a public function.  The other day the purohita attended a ceremony held on his home turf with this fair one in tow. 


When the ceremony was in progress, the purohita’s ex-wife had appeared from nowhere and picked a quarrel with his fair companion. The altercation was about to turn into a real catfight when the purohita’s security men had intervened. 


The highly disconcerted purohita later launched an operation to hush up the incident. The operation looked a great success until a female sworn into secrecy leaked the story to the media.
