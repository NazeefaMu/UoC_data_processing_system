Lakmal wins Toss, hosts to Bat


	



Sri Laka have won the toss and elected to bat first in the 2nd Test match held at the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC), Colombo.

After a disastrous first Test, the Proteas look to save the series in the 2nd Test against Sri Lanka at Colombo. The batting performance from the visitors left a lot to ask as they were bowled out for 126 and 73 in the two innings at Galle, with the Sri Lanka spinners doing all the damage. The hosts have a 1-0 lead in the series, and do not have anything to lose. Sri Lanka would be comfortable in pushing for a draw, and the onus to push for a win will be on South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis.

Teams:

Sri Lanka (Playing XI): Danushka Gunathilaka, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dhananjaya de Silva, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Roshen Silva, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya, Suranga Lakmal (c), Rangana Herath

South Africa (Playing XI): Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Faf du Plessis (c), Quinton de Kock (wk), Theunis de Bruyn, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Lungi Ngidi
