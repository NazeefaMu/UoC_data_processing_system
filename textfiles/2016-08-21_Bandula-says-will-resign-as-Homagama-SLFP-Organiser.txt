UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardane said today that he would resign from the post of SLFP Homagama electorate organiser.

He said the resignation letter would be sent to President Maithripala Sirisena tonight.

Last Friday, UPFA MP Dullas Allahapperuma said he would also resign from his post as SLFP Matara District leader because MPs Mahinda Yapa Abeywardane and Kanchana Wijesekara were removed from their post as organisers.
