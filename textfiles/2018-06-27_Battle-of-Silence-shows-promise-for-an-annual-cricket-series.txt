‘Battle of Silence’ shows promise for an annual cricket series


	



It was indeed a historic day for The School for the Deaf and Blind, Ratmalana and the Nuffield School for the Deaf & Blind, Kaithadi when they played their inaugural softball cricket match on June 15 at Kaithadi.   

This opportunity not only promoted the spirit of sportsmanship between the two Schools, but also friendship and camaraderie. There was great inter-racial, inter-religious and inter-cultural bonding among the students as well as the teachers. They were able to observe the different cultures and enjoy the delicious food they were served with. This was the main objective of the organisers of the match and it was fulfilled beyond measure because they interacted 
very closely.   

Two 10 over matches were played, with Nuffield School winning both. After the two matches were played, the organisers conducted another 10 over cricket match, with one team consisting of students from both Schools and the other team comprising teachers from both schools.   

The organisers of the match in a statement state that they wish to make this an annual event. The next encounter of this series will be played at Ratmalana.   

Everyone had a gala time and the team from Ratmalana left for Colombo on the 15th night.
