Inaugural over 50s World Cup on a grand scale

Cricket fans are in for a treat between Nov 20 and Dec 5 with Australia playing host to the inaugural over 50s World Cup tournament featuring teams from England, South Africa, New Zealand, Wales, and Canada and notably for local fans a team from Sri Lanka as well.
Under the auspice of Cricket Australia and with endorsements from Australian and NSW Over 50s Cricket Association and Veterans Cricket Australia, all matches will be played across noteworthy venues in Sydney.
The organising committee officially opened the games at a gala afternoon gathering on November 20 at a picturesque harbour view location overlooking the iconic Sydney harbour. All teams were welcomed and briefed on tournament protocols and procedures. It was an extremely colourful occasion with participants dressed in their unique national outfits.
The Sri Lankan team received much praise for their stand-out uniforms and “if this is any indication of things to come we hope to further prove how good we are on the field as well” quipped Richie De Silva (Chairmanonvener) instrumental in putting together the Sri Lankan contingent for these games.
Despite the festival feel of these games, all teams will be coveting and wanting their country name etched on the trophy as the first ever team to win this championship. Host nation Australia is ready for the challenge and have undergone a gruelling selection process where players were picked on merit at the completion of the recent over 50s national championship. Notwithstanding a small pool of players to choose from, the Sri Lankans are ready to rumble with predominantly cricketers of local repute and “former” glory.
“It is envisaged this tournament will encourage more countries to join in the years ahead” said Mr. Striling Hamman of Veterans Cricket Australia. Best Wishes to all players and may The Lion Roar and bring pride to both country and cricket.
