A day to remember for township boy from Cape Town Temba Bavuma

As a township boy growing up in Cape Town, Temba Bavuma never dreamed of becoming the first black African to score a Test century for South Africa, let alone a role model for aspiring young cricketers.
The 25-year-old, born a short distance from the Newlands ground, is just the fifth black African to follow trailblazer Makhaya Ntini, who won 101 caps.
Bavuma came under scrutiny before the game as South Africa's commitment to an ethnically balanced side resulted in some awkward questions about selection policy. But his answer at the crease was emphatic and he is fully aware of the significance.
He said: 'I understand what it means but I'm struggling to find the words. I'm quite relieved, full of emotion and very satisfied from a personal and team point of view.
'I've been wanting to cross off that first Test hundred and to do it at my favourite ground was extra special.'
He added: 'At first cricket was a passion, I just played for the love of it. When I made the SA Schools side, that's when I realised cricket could be more than a passion, something I can use to inspire other people.
'When I made my debut for South Africa I came to be a bit more aware and realise the significance behind it all. It was not about me making my debut, it was about being a role model, an inspiration for other kids, black African kids. Achieving this kind of milestone will strengthen that example.'
