Lumbini’s Gauthama Buddha Airport to be developed as an Int’l Airport

The Gauthama Buddha Airport in Lumbini, Nepal is to be developed as an International Airport with modern facilities to enable Sri Lankan Buddhist devotees to fly there directly on pilgrimage to places of workshop in Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha.
Nepal’s President Bidhya Devi Bhandari disclosed this during official discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena when he called on her at the Presidential Palace after attending the BIMSTEC Conference on Saturday afternoon.
