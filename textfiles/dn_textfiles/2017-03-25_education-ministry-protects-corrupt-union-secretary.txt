Education Ministry protects the corrupt: Union Secretary

The Education Ministry protects those who are involved in bribery, corruption and malpractices and keep mum on over 300 letters sent requesting to take action against them and prevent misusing public funds, Educational Non-Academic Employees' Union Secretary Ajithge Thilakaratne said.
Addressing the media at the Public Library in Colombo yesterday, he said the union received information before the incidents of corruption take place, but was not given an opportunity to submit the details confidentially.
Thilakaratne said some persons in the staff of the Education Minister are involved in corruption. They have taken Rs. 150,00 from each person by offering jobs at the education Ministry through fake 'appointment letters' and issuing fake circulars using fake signatures of the Education Ministry Secretary and the National School Director.
According to Thilakaratne, no action has been taken against the culprits even after the Education Ministry accepted the offences.
The fake circulars and appointments had been issued using the letter heads of the Education Ministry, he said.
Thilakaratne said the Education Ministry Secretary does not respect or obey any commission in the country. The country's law is not implemented in connection with the culprits who used fake signatures of Education Ministry officials and the letter head of the Ministry, he said.
