Envoy appointed official clothing  partner of Mr. England contest

Envoy London, the brand grown in Sri Lanka and which bears the trademark as being the undisputed leader in premium quality menswear was the appointed official clothing partner of the Mr. England 2017 contest for the second consecutive year.
“We’re proud that a brand from a small country like Sri Lanka has effectively entered the overseas market and are proud to be associated as the Official Clothing Partner of an event of international repute such as this. We’re equally thrilled at the idea of creating a broader perspective with Jack Eyers, who is the first-ever amputee to participate and win in such a highly competitive pageant,” said creator of the Envoy London brand Fouzul Hameed.
Jack Eyers, the 28-year-old personal trainer and model from Bournemouth, Dorset created history recently as the first-ever amputee to clinch the prestigious Mr. England 2017 title held in Birmingham last month, the preamble to the globally acclaimed Mr. World 2017 contest. The event, a celebration of brains and brawn between 22 finalists, was attended by the fashion moguls and crème de la crème of British society and watched by hundreds throughout the United Kingdom.
