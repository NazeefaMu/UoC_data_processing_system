Youths duped by previous regime: former MP

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Youth Front President and former Kandy District MP Dilum Amunugama said the SLPP was conducting district level campaigns to eductae youth on the failed projects and false promises made by the previous regime.
He said this at a media briefing held in Kandy yesterday. The Youth Front got large numbers of youth together and planned several programmes for them, said Amunugama.
In the past three years, it is the youth who were treated unfairly. Thus a large number of people are dissatisfied, said the former MP.
“From time to time, the youths were mostly affected by the actions of the UNP and the JVP and today, they have joined forces.” He added that the people were waiting for an election so that they could express the frustration they have been feeling over the government during the last regime.
“In the upcoming election, the team led by PM Mahinda Rajapaksa will be a force to be reckoned with and we will achieve one of the biggest electoral victories in the country’s history,” said the former MP.
He added that not just Sajith Premadasa but even if J.R. Jayawardena were to take up the leadership of the UNP today, they would not be able to resuscitate the party which has fallen into ruin.
