Cellscapes II at Barefoot Gallery

Mumbai based Sri Lankan born artist Shaanea Mendis D’Silva’s third solo exhibition titled ‘Cellscapes ll’ will be held at Barefoot Gallery from April 18 to 30. Her work is inspired by everyday textural observations and intricate patterns in nature that have fascinated the artist since childhood.
She recreates a meditative experience through her intricate pen & ink and watercolor renditions, and she also works with rust stains to bring in a different dimension to her work, where natural elements are allowed to take their own course on the mark making process, bringing it closer to nature’s way.
