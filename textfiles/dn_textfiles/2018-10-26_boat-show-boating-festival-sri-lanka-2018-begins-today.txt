BOAT SHOW & BOATING FESTIVAL  SRI LANKA 2018 begins today

Boat Show & Boating Festival Sri Lanka 2018 is organized by Boat Building Technology Improvement Institute (BTI) and Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), in association with Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, Ministry of Ports and Shipping and Sri Lanka Ports Authority at Galle Yacht Marina, Port of Galle from October 26 – 28, 2018.
Boat Building industry has identified as a leading industry and an emerging export sector and has also been identified as one of the key sectors in the National Export Strategy (NES) 2018 – 2022 for Sri Lanka.
Organizing of the Boat Show Sri Lanka which commenced in 2008 is one of the main activities which is also recommended in the National Export Strategy (NES), undertaken to promote the industry. The Show organized once in two years, provides a forum for the industry to display and promote their products to potential clients whilst creating investment opportunities in boat and ship building, training, marine infrastructure and marine tourism.
The 6th Edition of the Boat Show will be organized October 26 – 28, 2018 with a novel concept and named as “Boat Show and Boating Festival 2018”, which is the first ever boating festival in Sri Lanka organized to showcase the country’s capabilities in marine tourism, recreational boating, yachting and boat building which is mainly focused on exports.
Although Sri Lanka has a long history in boat building, the nation is currently not engaged in boating activities and therefore, it is necessary to create an interest amongst the local community in boating activities. Building a strong local market will benefit to the country’s export market as well. Considering the above this year’s boat show will focus on boating activities and nautical tourism.
This year the show will be organized in the Galle Port. The mini marina will be used to berth vessels to be displayed and for water activities and the land area surrounding the marina for exhibiting boating related products and services.
The inauguration ceremony of the Boat Show & Boating Festival will be held on October 26, 2018 at 3.00 pm. The First Vice President of the Republic of Burundi, Gaston Sindimwo and Jean Bosco Nutunzwenimana, Minister of Transport, Public Works, Equipment and Territory Management will visit the Boat Show 2018 on the invitation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and will grace the opening ceremony as the guests of honour.
Number of international buyers and visitors will be visiting the Boat Show from countries such as Maldives, Sweden, Italy, UAE, India, Poland, Belgium, Pakistan, Seashells and Mauritius.
Considering the importance of enhancing the International Profile of Sri Lanka as a Marine Tourism destination and a quality boat manufacturing hub and encouraging the boat manufacturing industry to adopt new technology and manufacturing techniques, EDB and BTI propose to organize an International Conference on Nautical Tourism on October 27, 2018at Jetwing Light House Hotel in Galle parallel to the Boat Show & Boating Festival 2018.
It is expected that 100 – 150 participants from the industry will participate at the conference including boat manufacturers, chartering companies, students of marine industry and journalists.
International eminent speakers are invited as the resource persons for the conference and the theme of the conference is “Sri Lanka – a hub for the marine industry, challenges and opportunities for marine tourism and manufacturing”.
The speakers are: Mike Derret , International Marina Expert, UK, Sandrine Devos, representative from European Boating Institute (EBI), Michal Bak, Secretary General, Polish Chamber of Marine Industry and Water Sports (POLBOAT).
The Boat Show & Boating Festival will certainly contribute towards creating the necessary international visibility for boat building industry in Sri Lanka.
