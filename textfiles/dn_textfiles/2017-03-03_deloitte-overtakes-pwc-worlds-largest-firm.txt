Deloitte overtakes PwC as  world's largest firm

Deloitte has overtaken PwC as world's largest firm and has wrestled back its crown as the biggest firm in the world by fee income following a strong year.
Deloitte powered ahead in 2016 as its global fee income grew by 5% to $36.8bn (£29.52bn), nudging it ahead of Big Four rival PwC.
Last year PwC seized back the top spot after two years of playing catch-up but in 2016 it recorded only 2% growth in fee income for a total of £28.79bn, according to the latest global network rankings from International Accounting Bulletin.
EY remained solidly in third place but still a long way from the top two with income of £21.35bn (3% growth year-on-year) and stayed slightly ahead of KPMG, which recorded growth of 4% to £20.39bn.
The Big Four’s dominance shows no sign of letting up as the gap haswidened. In fifth spot, BDO saw its fee income grow by 4% to £6.1bn while in sixth place RSM enjoyed growth of 5% to £3.9bn. Grant Thornton improved its fee income by 3% to £3.83bn.
Overall it was a strong year for the profession globally as every firm in the top 10 recorded growth. Deloitte is the number one employer with a total of 244,400 people working
for the firm, while KPMG is fourth largest with 188,983. BDO increased its global workforce by 5% to 67,731 while Grant Thornton boosted its numbers by 11% to 47,004.
