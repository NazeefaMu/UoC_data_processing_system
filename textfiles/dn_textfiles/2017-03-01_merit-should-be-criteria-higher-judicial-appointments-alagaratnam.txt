Merit should be criteria for higher judicial appointments - Alagaratnam

At the retirement of Chief Justice K. Sripavan, President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), Geoffrey Alagaratnam asked that positions to the higher echelons of the judiciary be made through emphasis on ‘undoubted merit’ and ‘competence rather than experience alone.
Delivering the ceremonial farewell to the Chief Justice yesterday, the BASL President recommended that ‘identified criteria’ be introduced to “accommodate competence and merit through judicial audit or other mechanisms”.“Reliance on mere seniority for entitlement or promotions though perhaps a relevant criterion cannot and should not be a compelling basis. My Lords, maturity and wisdom we hope does come with age but it is not always necessarily so. Sometimes years only confers old age”, said Alagaratnam.
With the recent clash between the BASL and the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) over the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court judge, based on the recommendation of the former, Alagaratnam took the opportunity to point out that the JSC needed to be more “broad based as an independent body to include several other stake holders such as the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, the President of the Bar Association and perhaps representatives of other responsible civil society organizations. Such is also towards greater transparency in the matter of handling of matters related to tenure, promotions and disciplinary control over the minor judiciary in acknowledgement of the fact that the Judiciary serves and should represent the interests of society and is not an exclusive secret enclave shrouded in mystery. The enactment of the recent Right to Information Act should buttress and emphasize the need for transparency and openness”, he said.
The BASL also praised Chief Justice Sripavan for having stepped forward in tumultuous times to try and instill integrity and confidence once again in the judiciary.
With new constitutional amendments set in place since CJ Sripavan took over, Alagaratnam observed that while these amendments helped secure the independence of the judiciary, “constitutional or legal safeguards mean little unless the people within the structures and who work them do so with dignity and responsibility”.
He also thanked the CJ for promoting a strong Bar and that the Bar itself needed to be seen as an “equal partner with the judiciary”.
As he wished for greater Judicial and professional independence, integrity and dignity in future, Alagaratnam said that he along with CJ Sripavan would soon step down from his post as President of BASL.
“After all is said and done My Lord, the Chief Justice, it must be said that you did exercise dignity, patience, transparency, humility and consistency together with the required authority when discharging your functions on the Bench, quite in contrast to the atmosphere that prevailed under a few dispensations before you assumed office as Chief Justice”, he added.
