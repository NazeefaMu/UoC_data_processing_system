Corals in Crisis

The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society Monthly Lecture January 2017 will be held under the title Corals in Crisis: Increasing Resilience to Climate Change on January 19 at 6pm at the Cinema Lounge, BMICH. The public lecture is open to all members and non-members free of charge. The lecture will be delivered by Nishan Perera, a marine biologist and underwater photographer with an interest in coral reef ecology, fisheries and marine protected area management.

Coral reefs are one of the most biologically diverse and environmentally sensitive ecosystems but have been severely degraded by human activities such as overfishing, destructive fishing methods, coastal development and pollution. Climate change and rising sea temperatures are now posing a significant threat to coral reefs, compounding existing pressures caused by anthropogenic influences. Recent coral bleaching events caused by elevated sea temperatures have resulted in unprecedented coral mortality across the world.
Managing such sensitive ecosystems requires a two pronged strategy that reduces direct human impacts while increasing resilience and recovery potential of coral reefs and associated species.
Identifying reef habitats and species that are more tolerant of such stresses is therefore important in conserving overall coral reef diversity and biomass. Similarly, recovery after mass mortality events has been patchy and resulted in phase shifts in species composition. Understanding such dynamics as well as environmental and physical variables affecting reef resilience and incorporating resilience parameters into adaptive management strategies is now considered an important aspect of Marine Protected Area management.
Coral reef and Marine Protected Area management in Sri Lanka continues to focus on traditional approaches. Management is often reactive and static rather than being predictive and adaptive. Key aspects of reef resilience, its importance in management strategies, and the use of a more science based management approach will be discussed in this presentation.
Nishan Perera perera is a co-founder of Blue Resources Trust and has previously worked with international conservation agencies in Sri Lanka, Maldives, Indonesia and Australia. His current research includes field studies on coral reef resilience, reef fish distribution and sustainable small-scale fisheries.
He is the author of several scientific papers and a coffee table book on the coral reefs of Sri Lanka. He has also contributed articles and images to the Serendib, Explore Sri Lanka, Life Times Magazine, African Diver, Sport Diving Australia and Magazyn Nurkowanie Poland.
