Saving the giant gentle creatures
The sad stories of elephant-man conflict appear in the print and electronic media almost daily. It is either an elephant killing a man or a man killing an elephant. The latest being the man killing the tuskers in search of Gaja Muthu.
The last census of the elephants has been carried out in 2011 according to the Wildlife Department and the Daily News. There are conflicting ideas in carrying out a survey on elephants in 2018. The most important and crucial factor is the damage caused to the people living in the border villages of the elephant-infested areas. These innocent people are killed on the road. Their houses and plantation are damaged and reduced them to a pauper level. Their lifelong savings are reduced to zero overnight.
The next pathetic stage is where these majestic animals become targets of a shotgun of a villager in retaliation and vengeance for the loss of his kith and kin and damage caused to their property. This action cannot be condoned by any standard of thinking. With all the agonies experienced, there are numerous incidents when the affected villagers themselves come to the rescue to salvage of the jumbos to lift them out from the pits and waterholes. It is an excellent sign of showing mercy even to your foe when in difficulty.
According to Wildlife Director, there have been 250-270 deaths of wild elephants in 2017 due to natural causes as well as elephant-man conflicts. While natural deaths cannot be averted, there may have been a certain number saved, had the authorities taken this problem seriously. Most of the elephant habitat is concentrated in the dry zone of the country. They could be confined to their sanctuaries preventing them trespassing to human habitat by erecting electric fences as done in some areas. An arrangement has to be made for a supply of water during dry seasons to prevent them from stepping from their sanctuaries.
This problem should be taken seriously by the authorities as some critics point out. A stepmotherly treatment is meted out as the victims are only hand to mouth poor villagers who have no political influence living in abject poverty. If these things are happening in a politico-infested area, elephants would have been spirited away in white vans!
