Bus strike called off: Fares increased by 12.5 percent

 
The Lanka Private Bus Owners Association called off the strike which was scheduled to be held midnight Wednesday after authorities resolved to increase bus fares by 12.5 percent this evening.
Accordingly the minimum bus fare will be Rs.12.
The Private Bus Owners Association warned to launch a strike yesterday, protesting government’s decision to only raise bus fares by 6.56 percent.
Earlier today the government cancelled leaves of all Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) conductors and drivers in view of the warned strike.
