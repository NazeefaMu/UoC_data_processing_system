Scratch that!

As a child, nothing could ever beat a colouring session with your favourite pencils right? Well one crazy new form of nail art has got us taking a trip down memory lane...
The experimental beauty Instagram account Nail Sunny has really outdone themselves with this new colouring pencil nail art.
Yes you read that correctly... you can now get a manicure which looks weirdly like your old trusty colouring tools.
Complete with actual coloured lead, this can only mean one thing: it’s time to rummage around for those old colouring books.
While we’re still hoping the Russian nail pro uploads a tutorial video, we can only imagine the intricacies of this design.
We’re talking epic nail extensions, serious glue skills, and somehow sticking actual lead into the works.
With their perfectly painted and weirdly realistic look, the “pencil” nails even have the appearance of ridges to mimic wooden design. No wonder the account has over 1.7 million followers.
Although we can’t help but admire the incredible design, we can only imagine just how impractical this manicure would be for everyday life... cup of tea accidentally dipped in lead, anyone?
