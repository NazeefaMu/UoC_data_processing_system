Due answers will be given on August 2: Ravi

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake says that he will give proper answers to the statements made against him when he appears before the Presidential Commission probing the Central Bank Bond Issue on August 2.
The minister points out that there is a secret scheme behind these activities to mar his character.
Minister Karunanayake was speaking to journalists at an event held to mark the National Youth Flag Day yesterday. The Colombo District Group of the National Youth Council pinned a commemorative flag on Minister Karunanayake during the event at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Minister Karunanayake further said: “Nothing has happened to those of the previous regime who destroyed this country. But, a minister of our Government goes before an Independent Commission. This is the transparency of the rule of the Good Governance. Didn’t they know that I am a Cabinet Minister to summon me before the Commission on July 25.
“I was summoned on the day where I had a commitment to attend the Cabinet Meeting. Therefore, I informed the Commission through my lawyers to allocate another day. These things were publicly talked about in Parliament seven or eight months ago. There is nothing to hide. Two or three media institutions are trying to tarnish my image for no reason. They have nothing else to show. Therefore, they are involved in these kind of things. I will answer before the Commission regarding these matters at the correct time. Then, the truth will be revealed to the entire county,” Minister Karunanayake said.
