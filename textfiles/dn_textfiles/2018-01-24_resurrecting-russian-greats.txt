RESURRECTING THE RUSSIAN GREATS

Recalling such experience is so fresh in my mind and no doubt fascinating when the London Philharmonic Orchestra turned eight at the South Bank Centre with Russian classics under the baton of Vladimir Jurowski.
The LPO and Russian music are inseparable and who but Jurowski can resurrect such composers from their graves like he did from the land fabled for its snow-covered winters and a history rich with drama and literature.
The variety of riches that Russian music offers the world from the Romantic passion of Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov along with the brilliance of Stravinsky and Prokofiev among the many greats that have come under the baton of Jurowski is simply marvellous. His passionate orchestral works extend not only to Russian spirit but rest of the other great composers. Jurowoski provides the Russian style in his own inimitable way on equal terms to the greats of Great Britain and all countries in the region but remain more identified as the great translator or the Russian classics.
Incidentally, he told us all that over a decade ago before the PLO reached seventy-five years of age how the Seventh Symphony of Shostakovich was premiered.
The kind of orchestration involved in this composer’s magnificent symphony gripped the music world as no other at that time and ten years later, Jurowaski stood on the same spot to wield the baton on the Seventh Symphony.
SEVENTH SYMPHONY A some-what confused composer especially traced in most of his symphonies other than in Symphony No. 10 in E minor, because he worked on a personal monogram that was compelled after Stalin’s death that reflected the passing of the dark ages in Russia. It was not meant that way though acclaimed as his finest achievement.
That cannot be said of the Seventh Symphony that Jurowski elected to play as a tribute to the Russian masters. During the 1941 siege of Leningrad by the Nazis he completed the Seventh Symphony. From the sublime to banal, he used dissonant harmonies. His worst music is full of cliches and however much he tried to conceal the hidden codes is a matter of conjecture.
Perhaps a Russian master like Jurowski can unravel the secret dissidents and probably did when he conducted the Seventh Symphony. I must admit those intricacies were beyond my musical knowledge and Shostakovich was never my favourite. I still cannot fathom his music except Symphony No. 13.
From Shostakovick, he took charge of Stravinsky, Prokofiev, Tchiakovsky among others after a run-up to ORANGO, an unfinished opera which was recently discovered scored by Shostakovich.
Jurowski is the life and soul of the London Philharmonic Orchestra as the Principal Conductor and Artistic Advisor at the South Bank, brings more intensely Romantic music from his country. But his genius is not only confined to Russia, he puts every representative country whose music comes under his direction, the same passion and loyalty. He adores classics of Great Brittain.
This night, I heard him play Benjamin Britten’s SINFONIA da REQUIEM and Vaughn Williams’ SYMPHONY No. 6 which I thought was better that Shostokavich’ Symphony No. 6. Today, it was also different because for the first time Jurowski combined The London Philharmonic Orchestra with the Russian National Orchestra. He also announced that the RNO to be the leading Russian Orchestra at the time.
What would the LPO have done without Jurowski to Russian music?
Not much I believe. His passion for his country ; the love for her classical music is his priority wherever he performs. By the time LPO reached eighty years, Jurowski was such an integrate part of it that the Telegraph remarked ‘Under Jurowski the LPO has become a fabulously refined instrument’
Very keen to bring to London one form or another in A FLORENTINE TRAGEDY, an operatic master piece by Alexander Zemlinsky which he did on a later date, revealed his extraordinary talent renowned for his thought provoking and beautifully crafted programmes. I also missed THE RITE OF SPRING by Stravinsky and some works of Richard Strauss. All the Strauss clan are my firm favorites among Vienese composers. I am an addict to Vienese waltz and they are brilliant at it and famously played in all ball-room floors.
In between Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony, PATHETIQUE was gloriously conducted to a highly appreciative audience. PATHETIQUE was scored in 1893 and Tchaikovsky was invited to Cambridge to receive an Honorary Doctorate of Music. Here, it must be elaborated that PATHETIQUE No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74 is still the greatest of this genre.
Exactly why the composer chose not to divulge the programme was in his own words ‘Let them puzzle their heads over it’ Later we were to learn the psychology behind it when Havelock Ellis, famous for his STUDIES IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX called the score a homosexual tragedy’ and became a lament for woe especially in the final Movement.
The pessimistic utterance in all music proves this. PATHETIQU is a proof that Tchaikovsky was happiest when sad. No doubt, the score lived up to its name.
And Jurowski brought out the essence of this tragedy, live to music lovers and enhanced their ardour towards Tchaikovsky.
Jurowski was also billed to perform the following day combing the LPO with the London Philharmonic choir because the extraordinary symphonic music of British tradition to be followed. WAR AND PEACE was on top of the series.
What does Jurowski do to be what he is today?
Plenty: study the creator’s works or the composers’ notes and attempts to become the voice of the creator. He tries to inspire and encourage the audience and create an environment for his musicians to be at their best. It is far more complex role than most of us see sitting and watching him move arms. He makes most instruments in his orchestra sing or sound like singing the score that is being played.
That is the genius of Vladimir Jurowski and tonight Russian music became the winner.
