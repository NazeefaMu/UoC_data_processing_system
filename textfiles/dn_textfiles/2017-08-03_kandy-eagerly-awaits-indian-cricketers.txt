Kandy eagerly awaits the Indian cricketers

Kandy is waiting eagerly for the test and the two one day games between Sri Lanka and India. The Kandy Test will be played from August 12 to 16 which will be the Third Test and the 2nd one day on August 24 and 3rd one day on August 27 all at the Pallekelle Stadium.
Eight-four years have passed since All Ceylon toured Indian on their first official visit to India in 1932/33. Since playing its first Test against India in 1982/83.
India’s last tour of Sri Lanka was two years ago in August 2015 when they played a Test series which they won 2-1. India won its last ODI series 4-1 in 2012.
In the same year, India also won a T20 series 1-0 against Sri Lanka. Since 1985, India have played 22 Test matches in Sri Lanka, winning seven (last was on 29 July 2017), losing seven and drawing eight. Turning the pages of time one can go back to the 1985 Test match where Sri Lanka under the captaincy of Duleep Mendis beat India led by Kapil Devi in the 2nd test to win their maiden test series. In 1985 it was the first visit of the Indians to Sri Lanka almost four years after the hosts obtained Test status.
Sri Lanka, had not registered a Test victory and not many gave them a chance. In this series the first test was played at SSC and was drawn. However in the second Test at the P Sara Oval Sri Lanka recorded their maiden and historic first Test win.
Rumesh Ratnayake was the match winner with nine wickets and Amal Silva scored a hundred and held nine victims as wicketkeeper.
The final Test was played at the Trinity College Cricket stadium Asgiriya Kandy. India trailing 0-1 needed to respond in Kandy but it was the same story like in Colombo, the batsmen failed yet again. This time round Saliya Ahangama took a five-wicket haul. India elected to bat first and it was only Dilip Vengsarkar who was able to score a half-century as India folded for 249. Sri Lanka were bowled for 198.
Left-arm spinner Maninder Singh gave India hope with four wickets. In the second innings. Mohinder Amarnath made an unbeaten 116 and Ravi Shastri 81 which meant India set Sri Lanka a big target of 377 runs.
The Lankans knew they had to bat out the rest of the match to draw the final Test and win their maiden series. The Sri Lankans were given an early scare by Kapil Dev and Chetan Sharma who reduced them to 34/3. That brought captain Duleep Mendis and Roy Dias to the middle and these two went on to score centuries and they shared a partnership in excess of 200 runs to put paid to India’s hopes of leveling the series.
Duleep Mendis made a classic 124 and Roy Dias 106 as the Sri Lankans managed to draw the test to register their maiden series win. In the Kandy test, BR Jurangpathy played his first test and the umpires were Nelson Gooneratne and Dooland Buultjens.
