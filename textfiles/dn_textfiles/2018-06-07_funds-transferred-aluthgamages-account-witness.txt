Funds transferred to Aluthgamage's account - Witness

A trade union treasurer said he took measures to transfer trade union funds amounting to Rs.3.9 million among three individuals including former Minister Mahindananda Aluthagamage.
Testifying before the Colombo High Court, witness Douglas Kahawage, the Treasurer of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress affirmed in court that he took measures to transfer the funds.
Kahawage gave evidence in a case filed against former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage for the alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs. 3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress.
However, he admitted in court that MP Aluthgamage had repaid the money owed to Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress through three cheques. Further trial into the matter was fixed for August 2 by High Court Judge Sampath Wijeyaratne.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs. 1,000,000, misappropriated Rs. 1,900,000, and misappropriated another Rs. 1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress between October, 2012 and April, 2013.
The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code, listed 13 persons as witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items.
President’s Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty with counsel Hafeel Farisz and Dinesh Liyanage appeared for Aluthgamage. Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
