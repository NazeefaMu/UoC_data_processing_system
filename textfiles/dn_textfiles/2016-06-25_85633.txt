“In the nineties decade at least 4-5 skilled players represented their school teams but at present they don’t produce like that,” observed Dalugoda who was in Sri Lanka with the Manchester University cricket team of which he is the coach.
Manchester University played several matches against NCC, Moors, Galle CC, Sri Lanka Army and Colts during the tour.
Dalugoda an old boy of Ananda College represented Colombo Cricket Club for ten years in the nineties. He was a talented all-rounder who bowled left-arm leg-spin. Since 2000 he represented many cricket clubs in England and in 2006 he gained permanent residence there.
“The selection committee at the time did not consider me because they saw only one side of the coin. At that time I was a forerunner as a left-arm leg- spinner, but I was not given a chance. That’s why I decided to leave for England to upgrade my talent and look for a job,” said Dalugoda. “In the past years I played cricket at professional level, after that I was appointed as coach of Bolton District. In 2006, Manchester University invited me to coach their team. There were only two teams at that time and today it has increased to seven. We are now playing in the third division of the Inter- University tournament,” he stated. “Our endeavour is to bring the team to Sri Lanka and give them the opportunity to experience playing under subcontinent conditions and pitches so that we can use it to gain promotion to the Inter-University second division,” he further said.
Amal is residing in England with his wife and five children.
