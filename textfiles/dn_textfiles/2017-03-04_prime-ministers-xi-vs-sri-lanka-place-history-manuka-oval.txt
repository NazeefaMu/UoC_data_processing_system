Prime Minister's XI vs Sri Lanka: A place in history at the Manuka Oval

 The event which took place on February 15 was unique for the following reasons:
1) Courtesy extended by the Australian Prime Minister to a national team visiting for a very short tour.
2) The Toss by the two Prime Ministers with the captains in attendance.
3) Group photograph of the teams with both Prime Ministers.
4) The presence at the match of the Governor General H.E Peter Cosgrove and Lady Cosgrove in addition to the two Prime Ministers and some members of both Parliaments. The event reflected the extent of goodwill between the two nations and the role our cricketing ties continue to play in it.
