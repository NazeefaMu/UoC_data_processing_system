SL upgraded in State Department watchlist

Sri Lanka has been upgraded to ‘ Tier 2’ from its previous ‘Tier 2 watchlist’ status by the United States, State Department in its most recent rankings on human trafficking.
Addressing a specially convened media conference at the Justice Ministry, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the upgrade ensured that the country would continue to receive aid and other benefits.
“We were on the watchlist for 4 years and faced the status of being downgraded. If that happened it would have directly impacted non humanitarian aid the country received from the United States, IMF allocations and other such benefits” he said.
He said that the Government has taken steps in conjuction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Order and other institutions to ensure that Sri Lanka has taken steps to deter human trafficking.
“In the year commencing April 1st 2016 to March 31st 2017 we have filed 35 cases and 7 persons were convicted for the offence,” he said.
Speaking at the briefing, SSP Ajith Rohana said that Human Smuggling and trafficking although distinct as offenses are interrelated.
“Even in cases where people volountarily seek to leave the country by illegal means, there is abuse, when they are not provided with what they signed up for” he said.
He said the Police department has taken all possible measures to educate the public against falling prey to illegal acts involving trafficking and smuggling. Justice Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanna said that the Australian Government had assured funds to be directed toward educating the public.
“As a result the Attorney General’s Department is in the process of educating public servants. A recent conference was held with the participation of 600 District Secretaries across the Island to educate the public on the issue” he said. Rajapakshe said that the effort was spearheaded through a task force with the participation of key departments and ministries, which ensured that the law has been upheld and deterrence was encouraged.
“This is modern day slavery and the government has taken all effort to combat it,” he said.
