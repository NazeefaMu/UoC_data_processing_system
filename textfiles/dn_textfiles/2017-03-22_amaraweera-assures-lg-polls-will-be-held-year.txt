Amaraweera assures LG polls will be held this year

Local Government elections, as well as elections to three provincial councils, will definitely be held this year since the government has no fear to face the hustings, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister gave this assurance addressing a conference of provincial fisheries ministers at the ministry auditorium on March 20. The minister, who dismissed allegations that the government was willfully postponing elections for fear of facing the public, said the delay in holding elections was due to certain shortcomings in the delimitation process. However, the government was prepared to hold all Local Government elections and Provincial Council elections within this year.
Questioned by the media about the so-called ‘Ava Group’ terrorizing people in several areas, he said the government would never leave room for any such group or terrorism to raise its head again.
Fisheries ministers attached to the Western, Wayamba, Southern, Central and Eastern Provincial Councils, and officials attended the conference.
