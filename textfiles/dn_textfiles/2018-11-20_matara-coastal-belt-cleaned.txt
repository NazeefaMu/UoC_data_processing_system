Matara coastal belt cleaned

A project to clean the coastal belt of the Matara district is underway at present.
Under the programme, garbage, waste and hard waste on the beach are to be collected and handed over to Local Authorities for recycling and converting them into compost.
According to project officials, cleaning the coastal belt part by part is to be entrusted with Samurdhi beneficiaries. A payment would be made to them.
The programme would be jointly implemented by the Marine Environment Authority, Central Environment Authority, Samurdhi Development Authority and local bodies in the Southern region.
Enhancing the beauty of the Matara beach and attracting more local and foreign tourists to the region are the primary objectives of this endeavour, project officials said.
