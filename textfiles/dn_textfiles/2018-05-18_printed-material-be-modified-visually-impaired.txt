Printed material to be modified for visually impaired

Amendments to Intellectual Property Act No 36 of 2003 to introduce exceptions related to copyright that would facilitate the reproduction and distribution of printed media for print disabled persons was approved by Cabinet this week.
In 2016, Cabinet had granted approval to amend the Intellectual Property Act No 36 of 2003, prior to the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty.
The treaty allows for copyright exceptions to facilitate the creation of accessible versions of books and other copyrighted works for visually impaired (print disabled) persons. Sri Lanka ratified the treaty in October 2016.
