State hospitals connected to e-Health program

Three hundred state hospitals will be connected to the e-Health program next year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after connecting the National Dental Teaching Hospital in Colombo to the program.
The Minister said 300 state hospitals were connected to the e-Health program this year. The program commenced in 2015 from the Horana Base hospital.
Minister Rajitha said 50 hospitals were connected in 2016. The program aims at computerizing details of patients, their illnesses and treatments to ease the burden of patients and doctors. The program cuts down paper work, save resources and enable patients and doctors to look at the relevant information from anywhere in the country.
All state hospitals will be connected to the network before long. The Health Ministry has set up a National e-Health Steering Committee supported by the WHO in this regard.
