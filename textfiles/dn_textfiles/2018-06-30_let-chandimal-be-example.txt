Let Chandimal be an example

We read with dismay the news that the captain of our cricket team was banned for ball tampering.
Cricket is a gentlemen’s game and when we were schoolboys, it was drilled into us to play the game fair and let the better side win. But of course the game has under gone drastic changes since then and today it is played to win and that too ruthlessly.
Over the years our team had skirmishes at play and they were not insurmountable. The most damaging was the bowling of Muralitharan, but he came through it unscathed. Muralitharan went through a torrid time due to his unusual action.
Now the ball tampering by the captain is unpardonable and has set a bad example. After the hearing of the appeal if he is found guilty he should be dropped from the team, not so much as a punishment but as a warning to young players for the future.
