Ussangoda valley needs facilities

The Ussangoda valley that attracts thousands of tourists has no facilities for them to witness its splendour in leisure. The valley sprawls over 460 acres and it was declared a national park in 2010. The valley lies close to the Kalametiya sanctuary reputed for endemic and migratory birds.
The visitors complain that the valley has no separate parking space for vehicles and residents pointed out that local visitors and foreign tourists engage in unnecessary activities that harm the environment of the area and the culture of the country.
Southern Region Wildlife Assistant Director Prasanna Wimaladasa said
the place will be developed under a plan initiated by the department.
He said a security post, vehicle park and other facilities will be provided under the plan.
