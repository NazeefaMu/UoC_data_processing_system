Songstress Priyani’s murder case postponed for August 6

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage postponed the hearing into the murder case of songstress Priyani Jayasinghe for August 6 and remanded the suspect, the husband of the deceased.
On June 23, the witness, Lochana Nimuth Peter, the son of the singer, testifying before the Panadura Chief Magistrate said, he found his mother lying in a pool of blood in a room of a rented house at Arulgoda in Panadura on July 7.
He had rushed to the house from a boutique on receipt of a telephone call from his wife saying that his father is assaulting his mother Priyani. He said he saw a blade of a scissor near the bed when he arrived.
The mother had died while being taken to the Panadura Base Hospital. The witness added that the father had a strong suspicion about his mother. He said his father once threatened to murder his mother and said he would commit suicide too.
He added that his father assaulted his mother on a previous occasion and injured her head. He said the father also assaulted the witness and his brother and injured them. Panadura South Police led the evidence. Attorney-at-law Piyadasa Hewalankara appeared for the defence.
