Youngest player at World Cup scores first goal

Daniel Arzani - the youngest player at this summer’s World Cup - scored his first goal for Australia as they beat Hungary 2-1 thanks to a late own goal.
The 19-year-old Melbourne City forward scored from 20 yards just one minute after coming on for his second cap.
Hungary equalised with a comical own goal as Trent Sainsbury headed past his wrong-footed keeper from 14 yards.
But Tamas Kadar deflected a cross into his own net in injury time to win it for the Socceroos in Budapest.
Australia’s next game is their Group C opener against France on Saturday, 16 June. They are also in the same group as Peru and Denmark.
