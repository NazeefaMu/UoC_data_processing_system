Certain groups trying to mislead country: President

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested the public to be mindful of certain groups who are trying to mislead the country with regards to the proposed Constitution which is not even drafted yet.
“Sri Lanka suffered a three decade war because timely and proper solutions were not found to issues facing the country,” President Sirisena pointed out.
The President also requested all citizens who truly love the country to initiate and contribute for peace and reconciliation among communities.
President Sirisena was speaking at a special Deepawali celebration held at President’s House, Colombo on Thursday evening.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also graced the occasion.
President Sirisena also pointed out that some extremists are trying to ruin the reconciliation process directed by the present government which is trying to strengthen unity and peaceful co-existence between the communities in the country.
The President also explained the importance of co-existence between the communities.
President Sirisena, while stating that the document produced before Parliament was only a report of the Steering Committee, pointed out that even a draft of the proposed Constitution has not been put together as yet.
While welcoming all ideas and proposals with regards to the new Constitution, President Sirisena said that appropriate measures will be taken only after much consideration.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Minister D.M. Swaminathan, State Minister V. Radhakrishnan, the Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy and the Secretary to the President Austin Fernando, also participated in the event.
