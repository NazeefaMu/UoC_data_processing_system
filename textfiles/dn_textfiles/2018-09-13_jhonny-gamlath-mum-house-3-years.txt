JHONNY, GAMLATH MUM IN HOUSE FOR 3 YEARS

Joint Opposition MPs Johnston Fernando and Siripala Gamlath had not spoken a word in Parliament for the last three years.
Statistical analysis by ‘Manthri.lk’ website had found that Kurunegala District UPFA MP Fernando and Polonnaruwa District UPFA MP Gamlath rank the last according to the ranking system of ‘Manthri.lk’. Both of them have not taken part in any Parliamentary debate since September 1, 2015. ‘Manthri.lk’ run by Verité Research came up with the above observation after evaluating the performance and attendance of MPs on all 283 sitting-days.
The Eighth Parliament completed three years on September 1 and there had been 283 sitting days during that period.
MP Fernando had attended Parliament on 101 days while MP Gamlath had attended Parliament on 70 days out of the 283 days Parliament conducted sittings.
