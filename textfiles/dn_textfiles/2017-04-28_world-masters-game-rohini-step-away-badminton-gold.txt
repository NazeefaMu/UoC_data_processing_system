World Masters Game: Rohini a step away from badminton gold

Rohini Jayawardene, a badminton star in her own right is a step away from winning a gold medal for Sri Lanka in badminton at the ongoing World Masters Games in Auckland, New Zealand.
Rohini has qualified to play in the Ladies over 70 singles final against Gay Bloxham of Netherlands today.
In the semi-finals played yesterday Rohini defeated another Dutch opponent Kathy Whittaker 19/21, 21/15, 21/8.
What is more creditable about Rohini’s achievement is that this is the first time she is participating at a World Masters Games and to reach the final is quite a creditable feat.
Rohini began playing the sport only in her twenties and for the past 30 years has been a regular participant at the Otters, SSC and Sri Lanka Badminton Association conducted tournaments where she has won many titles.
Participating with Rohini at the Masters Games are MacLarens Group chairman and motor racer Rohan de Silva in the over 65 category and businessman Cornel Perera.
