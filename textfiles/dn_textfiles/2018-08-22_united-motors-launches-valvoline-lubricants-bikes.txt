United Motors launches Valvoline Lubricants for bikes

United Motors Lanka PLC, the sole distributor for Valvoline Lubricants in Sri Lanka recently launched Sri Lanka’s first dedicated lubricant for high performance bikes. The range marketed and distributed under the “4TEC Ultimate” brand will be available at selected dealers islandwide and the Valvoline Showroom at Hyde Park Corner.
Speaking about the new product United Motors Lanka PLC General Manager Car Care and Lubricants Priyantha Ellepola said, “Sri Lanka has a large population of Indian bikes. Valvoline has been a trusted brand for 2-wheeler lubricants, over the years due to the performance and quality of the oils. In the last few years we have seen an increase of high end bikes in Sri Lanka which are more than 200cc and even going up to 400cc. The owners of these bikes spend a lot of time, effort and money on their bikes due to its higher maintenance requirements. 4TEC is therefore ideal for these bikes”.
4TEC is a fully synthetic lubricant that increases fuel efficiency and reduces friction in the engine. The lubricant also acts as a cleaning agent and does not leave any carbon residue behind. It also has the ability to absorb heat and cool the engine. Once used, bikes can travel 5,000-6,000km effortlessly. Although preferably used for the 200cc and above category, the product is also compatible with 150cc engines.
Since 1866 Valvoline USA has kept the world moving with its range of lubricants and today is a leading innovator, marketer and supplier of high-performing automotive lubricants and chemicals in over 140 countries.
United Motors Group (UML), one of the country’s most progressive automobile companies, is the sole distributor for Valvoline lubricants in Sri Lanka.
