Construction instead of college, and ways to live in the world

Start on a spring day, drowsy with pollen, watching the sun shine on the new leaves outside the window while a class of some description droned on. This was the eleventh grade. I hadn’t read the book. I was maybe stoned from lunch.
I don’t remember the exact class or the exact day but I do remember the longing inside. On the other side of the window was a wide and various world, full of possibility, and I just needed the nerve to seize it. I was an ocean of restlessness, a volcano. What did I want? Where did I want to go? Anywhere but here. Anything but this.
No dramatic moments: I just tapered off, quit doing any of the homework, quit showing up after lunch, or if I did show I had Mateus rosé and hashish on my breath. By the last of the school year, the ending was obvious. I spent a regular summer, drove to California, slept on the beach, and when everybody else went back to school in the fall I went to a construction site in the suburbs and tried to get hired on.
Why construction? I had heard the money was good, which turned out to be semi-true: for a skilled carpenter or bricklayer, yes, but for a pick-and-shovel guy, not so much. More than that, I wanted to prove myself. My father made his living with a typewriter; I had grown up among white soft privileged children. There were parts of the world I didn’t know, and I was curious about them. I was listening to Muddy Waters and The Band and Mississippi Fred MacDowell and I wanted to get down to something real, something I could touch. Something romantic about this quest, maybe even something ridiculous, I think I knew this at the time. But school had already started without me.
So I found myself one rainy fall day looking for Big Jim. I found him on the plywood floor of a half-finished house, drinking coffee out of thermos cup and eating a raw onion as if it were an apple in big crunching bites. What do you want? he asked.
I told him I wanted a job.
He looked me up and down and laughed. No mystery why: I had hair halfway down my back and a George Armstrong Custer mustache. I looked more like a member of the Byrds than a working man.
He laughed again and said, Go find Mr. Baker and tell him to get you some gloves.
I stood there trying to understand what he meant.
Well, go on, he said, and went back to his onion.
I went back out into the damp afternoon, asked about Mr. Baker.
I think they’re pouring a sidewalk today. Over there.
“The people I knew who were going to college were no smarter or funnier or better with language than these people.”
I wandered down through houses and building sites. They were putting in a whole new neighborhood, several houses at a time, a hundred or more in all. Some of the houses looked finished, others were just framed, others were simply holes in the ground. Down near the end of the subdivision, where most of the houses looked nearly complete, I found a group of black men leaning on their shovels, waiting for something.
Mr. Baker? I asked.
The oldest of the group stepped forward, looking at me.
Jim put you on? he asked.
I nodded.
Oh, well, he said, and sighed. Let’s get you some gloves.
I followed him over to a clapped-out Ford pickup truck. The company had about a dozen of these, all identical, and I would log many hours in them in the next year.
Are you even eighteen? he asked.
Yes, sir. Nineteen in January.
He seemed amused but I didn’t know why. His eyes were kind, though, and tired-looking.
Waiting on the cement truck, he said. All set to pour if it don’t rain.
This was as much of an introduction to the labor crew as I ever got.
Two days later, I wanted to quit. I had blisters on my hands, a tweaked shoulder, assorted cuts and bruises. I had wrecked my nice hiking boots working around wet concrete. Also, the site was not a particularly nice place to work. It was organized around strict racial and hierarchical lines: the stonemasons and bricklayers at the top, mostly Italian, mostly from Maryland; the carpenters in the next rung, Scots-Irish from Virginia and West Virginia; and at the bottom, the labor crew, all black except for me and one other hippy kid, mostly fresh up from the country of North Carolina and Tidewater Virginia. Nobody talked to anybody else except for occasional yelling. Big Jim would drive by in his pickup truck, wherever we were working, and roll the window down and yell “Assholes and elbows! I don’t want to see nothing but assholes and elbows!”
Sometimes he’d stop and get out and demonstrate what he meant with a 30-second burst of activity with the shovel, flinging dirt furiously all around. Then a glare as he drove away.
A pretty unpleasant place to do pretty unpleasant work. I stuck it out anyway. As I said, I started out trying to prove myself, which is a game with weird rules. Essentially it meant that I had to do the same dumb thing for as long as it took to get good at the dumb thing and for the dumb thing to stop killing me.
I did get good at it, more or less. I got to the point where I could do it with a pretty major hangover, which happened. My hands got harder, my back got stronger, I got some regular boots and some really good gloves. Also, I learned the art of just working enough. Mr. B—as Mr. Baker was universally known—was very good at calculating this. - Lit Hub
