UNP officials resign to allow reforms

Three committees of the United National Party, two of which are headed by Ruwan Wijewardene and Sajith Premadasa along with the back-benchers are to meet the Premier today and tomorrow for decisive decisions on UNP party reforms, Minister Eran Wickremaratne told the Daily News.
Speaking at Sirikotha, the Minister said that all party members have resigned from their respective positions within the party so that it would give the Premier a free-hand to restructure the party without any hindrance. Earlier, yesterday, it was widely reported that General Secretary Kabir Hashim had tendered his resignation.
“It was clear to us from this vote, who supports the government in going forward with its development work and who doesn’t.
The first reaction will start from the Cabinet itself where there will be drastic changes. Discussions for this are already underway,” he said. He also added that the UNP would meet today and tomorrow to finalise party reforms of which decisions would come to light by April 8.
