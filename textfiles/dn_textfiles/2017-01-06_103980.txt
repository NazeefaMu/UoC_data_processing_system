CTF focused on four mechanisms proposed by govt.: Dr. Paikiasothy

 
Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTF) Secretary Dr.Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said they cannot guarantee what the government’s decisions would be with regard to the recommendations presented in the CTF final report.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department,Dr.Saravanamuttu highlighted that CTF focused on the four mechanisms proposed by the government and they are the Truth,Justice, Reconciliation and Non–Recurrence Commission (TJRNRC), Office of Missing Persons (OMP), Office of Reparations and the Judicial Mechanism with a special counsel.
He added that the task force was also seeking suggestions on mechanisms, process and measures that would bring about justice, truth and reconciliation.
“Domestic enquiries will not safeguard trust and competency. As a result, we recommended the presence of international judges in every panel. The people we consulted, especially the victims lacked confidence yet they reiterated if they do not get justice under this government, it will never happen,” he said.
CTF Chairperson Manouri Muttetuwegama said the recommendations and observations presented by CTF are recommendations which are informed by the views received during the consultations.
“The consultation process highlighted the importance placed by the citizens on reconciliation and their hope that the government would heed their views and observations on how it should be advanced,” she added.
She further said the task force would take the responsibility for the recommendations that were made and added that this a quest for reality based reconciliation.
Muttetuwegama emphasised that the task force acted impartially and independently.
Gamini Viyangoda said by implementing the recommended mechanisms the government will be making a significant step towards a more democratic,just and equitable Sri Lanka.
He said the CTF expects the government to fulfill the promise made and implement the future reconciliation mechanisms, taking into consideration the views of the public, especially the victims of the conflicts.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the statement made by Minister Rajitha Senaratne that international judges will not be allowed to look into domestic issues, Dr.Saravanamuttu said the task force will continue to work as civil society organisations and take measures to implement the proposed reconciliation mechanisms.
“Many discussions on this topic are being organised.Civil Society organisations can come up with suggestions to conduct campaigns to establish the proposed mechanisms without delay,” he said.
