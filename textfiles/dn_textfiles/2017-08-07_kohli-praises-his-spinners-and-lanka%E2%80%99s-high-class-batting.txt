Kohli praises his spinners and Lanka’s high class batting

Indian captain Virat Kohli praised his spinners and the strategy employed by the Sri Lankan batsmen against them after his team had completed a comprehensive innings win in the second Test at the SSC grounds yesterday.
“The bowlers did an outstanding job today of pulling things back and keeping it simple. And that’s what happens in Test cricket, sessions go away from you and you have to pull it back to win a Test match. It was very good for us from a team’s point of view,” said Kohli.
“We were up against a challenge in the last four sessions that we played yesterday (Saturday) and today. We managed to turn things around. You always feel good as a team when you come back from a difficult situation and win the Test match.
“Then you have to give credit to the batsmen as well, to play like that on a pitch like that. It was high quality batting and you expect that to happen at Test level. We spoke as a team that we have to embrace this because all sessions that we play are not going to go our way.
“Against the pace of (Ravindra) Jadeja, especially for the right-hander (Kusal Mendis) I think it was a high quality innings; not even one sweep was mistimed or misconnected or in the air. We have to give credit to the batters there. As a captain you can do only so much. The field was spread as well and still they were finding gaps and that’s what momentum can do.
“You have to keep things realistic and accept that these situations will also come again and again and it’s how we react as a team. It’s all about improving ourselves as players in those situations and not getting too frustrated. We tried our best whatever we could but they were just too good yesterday for sure,” he said.
Kohli said that due to the pitch getting slower and slower bowlers were finding it hard to beat the bat and find the edges which fell short of the fielders.
“It was getting slower and that’s why we took the new ball straight away. We thought with the harder new ball one might keep straight because the older ball was soft and all balls were turning so it was very difficult to get edges and create chances. As soon as the new ball was taken then we thought the batsmen are going to look to score now.
The ball might come better on to the bat and then they might play more shots. The bowlers are in the game as well when there is more pace because of the harder ball,” said Kohli.
“The pitch was such that the chances had to come at some stage. But credit to them to have done that, it requires a lot of ability and mental strength. I mean we were actually watching in awe yesterday (Saturday), the sweeping was outstanding and we congratulated both the batters because it was proper Test cricket batting and high quality temperament from both.”
The Indian captain praised the all-round ability of man of the match Jadeja and said, “Guys who have both abilities are very rare to find. That’s where we think they’re very precious, especially in the longer format because they provide you with great balance. He can give you a very quick 60-70 anywhere at any stage of the game and it can really turn the game.” – ST
