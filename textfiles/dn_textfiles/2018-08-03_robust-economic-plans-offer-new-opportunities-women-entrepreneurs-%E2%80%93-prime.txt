Minister of Women and Child Affairs, ChandraniBandara, noted in her message that around 10% of the Small Medium Enterprises are owned by women.
“The Government is developing this sector by providing financial, marketing and other related facilities to nurture, foster and develop such enterprises. The Human Resources and Employment Policy of the Government includes promoting women’s entrepreneurship development for enhancing women’s employment.”
“Many women working in the formal sector leave their jobs due to household responsibilities and they tend to stay back at home. By engaging in entrepreneurship activities they can easily combine their familial as well as income earning roles.”

Chairperson of the WCIC commented Chathuri Ranasinghe, that this year 21 female entrepreneurs from across the country will be recognized. “Over the years, we have seen a steady growth in the number of females building their own businesses and becoming successful entrepreneurs.
