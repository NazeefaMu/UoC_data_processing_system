Sri Lanka-Vietnam Political Consultations Third Meeting concludes
Vow to strengthen political, economic cooperation

The Third Meeting of Sri Lanka - Vietnam Political Consultations was held on April 11 in Colombo at senior official level.
The Sri Lanka delegation was led by Foreign Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary Sumith Nakandala and the Vietnam delegation was headed by Vietnam Foreign Affairs Ministry Deputy Minister Ðang Ðình Quý.
Sri Lanka and Vietnam reaffirmed the commitment to further consolidate and advance bilateral political and economic cooperation.
A wide range of matters in the areas of mutual collaboration and ongoing programmes in the fields of agriculture, fisheries, education and training, trade and investment, culture and tourism were reviewed and discussed.
The two sides stressed the importance of continuing to work together at regional and multilateral fora for advancing shared interests and on mutually important issues.
Deputy Minister Ðang Ðình Quý also called on Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana on April 11 afternoon.
A MoU between the Foreign Ministries of Sri Lanka and Vietnam, signed in October 2011, paved the way for enhancing bilateral cooperation through political consultations.
The first and second meetings of political consultations between Sri Lanka and Vietnam were held in 2012 in Colombo and 2013 in Hanoi, respectively.
Senior officials of the two Foreign Ministries and other line agencies also participated in the meeting.
