Ex-PS Chairman  gets 5 years RI for accepting bribe

Former Rambewa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman was yesterday sentenced to 5-years-rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court after he was found guilty to soliciting and accepting a bribe of Rs.100,000 from a youth engaging in agriculture, who sought foreign employment in Korea in 2007.
High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga further ordered the accused Ranil Madawa Kamal Nilame (42) to pay a fine of Rs.40,000 on other counts. The accused was found guilty to three counts.
The Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations Against Bribery and Corruption had filed indictments against the former PS chairman for soliciting a bribe from a 24-year-old youth who was seeking employment in Korea.
The former Chairman had solicited a sum of Rs. 100,000 from the youth to issue an application form for foreign employment to Korea under the Government’s foreign employment scheme.
The former Chairman was arrested on or around June 21, 2007 while accepting money from the youth at the Rambewa Pradeshiya Sabha premises.
Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption’s Deputy Director General Ganga Heiyanthuduwa appeared for the prosecution.
