JO accuses Govt.  over protest venue

The Joint Opposition(JO) yesterday pointed the finger at the Government over cancelling reservations for four grounds that the JO had booked for their protest rally “Janabalaya Kolambata” slated to be held in Colombo today.
Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena addressing the media at the N.M.Perera Memorial Center at Borella, alleged that the government through various parties have taken steps to cancel the JO reservations for four grounds in Colombo.
He said the JO expected such obstacles when planning the event and had a contingency plan and added that the government will be able to witness this today.
Gunewardene identified the Campbell Park,Borella grounds, Viharamahadevi Park Open Air Theatre,Lalith Athulathmudali grounds,Kirulapone and A.E.Gunasinghe grounds in Pettah as the places which the JO had reserved for the meeting.
Gunewardene charged that the Colombo Municipal Council authorities were behind the cancellation of reservations for the grounds.
The Parliamentarian said that whatever obstacles the government places, it cannot stop people in their thousands marching into Colombo today.
When questioned about the details about the protest, Dullas Alahapperuma, MP declined to name any location and said these will be revealed today.
Alahapperuma however said the protest march will begin around 3.00 pm and hinted this might start from several locations within Colombo.
JO members Udaya Gammanpila, Tissa Vitarana, Raja Kollure and Prasanna Ranatunge too were present.
