Earthen pots to control dengue spread

The ‘earthen pot’ system introduced by Eheliyagoda Base Hospital Medical Superintendent J. A. S. P. Abeywickrama last year to reduce the spread of dengue has brought about successful results.
It was adopted by residents of Eheliyagoda town and several Grama Niladhari Divisions.
Dr. Abeywickrama said according to medical reports, dengue cases and the death rate has reduced in the areas where the method was applied.
Under this system, over 10,000 earthen pots were distributed among families by the Ehelamal Movement that consisted of Eheliyagoda Base Hospital, Pradeshiya Sabha, Divisional Secretariat and several volunteer organizations.
The residents were instructed to fill the earthen pots partially with pure water and keep around their home gardens. The water should be emptied on a heap of sand every four days to destroy the mosquito larvae systematically.
Dr. Abeywickrama said he hopes to re-introduce the system soon.
