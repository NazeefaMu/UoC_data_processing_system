Construction industry needs to be internationally competitive : Sajith

The government has taken measures to make the construction industry internationally competitive by enhancing professionalism, raising skills levels, improving industry practices and technologies, and by promoting a new construction culture with an integrated approach to construction, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
He made this observation participating at the opening ceremony of ‘Construct 2017’ held yesterday at the BMICH.
“Today, we are at certain cross-roads, a challenging point in the economic recovery and the modernization effort launched under the direction of the President and the Prime Minister, a mere two and half years ago,” he said.
The minister said the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA), has now been made fully operational as the apex agency of the state for the regulation and the management of the industry. A new ‘National Policy on Construction’, prepared after exhaustive consultations with the stake-holders, has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on his recommendation.
Skills training in the construction industry has been strengthened and expanded under the “Samata Saviya’ programme. But, the Government as well as the industry stake-holders have to do much more, he said.
The people as well as the Government expect much more from the construction industry than ever before. The industry has to help the national economy to recover and also has to contribute to the easing of the social problems in the country, he said.
He further said that the challenge for the industry today is to do well despite constraints in its working environment. Ways have to be found amongst us, between the government and the industry, to take advantage of the special features of construction which offer unique opportunities.
“The construction industry needs to effectively play its role in the economy by realizing its potential to create jobs in all parts of the country.
New strategies are necessary to make this possible. Construction activities need to lay the infrastructure for development,” he added.
