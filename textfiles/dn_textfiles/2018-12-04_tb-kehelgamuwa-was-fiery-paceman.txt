T.B. Kehelgamuwa was a fiery paceman

I went and knocked on his door at Pirivena gardens, Boralesgamuwa, he walked up to me lithely and there were no signs of arthritis which pace bowlers are prone to late in life. He was amiable from the word go.
OTTA PALU BALL
I do not wish to recycle what has been written about him by fellow scribes. However it would be interesting to note what he mentioned; Kehel was born at Kehelgamuwa a tiny village at Gampola, his late father was the principal of the village school. The scraggly eight year old was bursting with energy and got hold of an “otta palu” ball ( a golf size ball made with woven rubber strands),with this he was terrorising his batting friends, a master at Dharmaraja was walking by spotted the lad but not the improvised ball, it was whizzing by escaping the naked eye . The bewildered master highjacked him to Dharmaraja.
Kehelgamuwa-Yatawara pace duo who rocked the Englishmen.
He was put under another pace ace late Sonny Yatawara the barrel chested paceman.Kehel reminisced that both of them played for Sri Lanka and scared the hell out of the touring Englishmen, batsmen of the calibre of Boycott, Tom Graveney, Keith Fletcher etc this was the best pace combination Sri Lanka cricket ever had, Kehel of course was the faster of the two.
8 wickets for 8 runs all bowled
He recalled that when he toured with the Sri Lanka Schools (mind you he played for Ceylon when he was a school boy. “In the match against the Indian Zonal champions, South Zone, he took 8 wickets for 8 runs all bowled, he hit the stumps on 11 occasions but three of the deliveries were deemed no-balls by the umpire. The veteran scribe”Leo Wijesinghe” happened to watch this match and he mentioned to me that the South Zone no 3 bat Makhan Singhe’s middle stump was sent ‘cart wheeling’ all the way to the ropes.
No rocket science
At this point I interrupted Kehel to inquire whether he chucked some of the deliveries, he vehemently denied saying that his express run up and slinging action propelled the ball like a tracer bullet. He laughingly said “no rocket science” was involved. To me his run up was akin to Malcolm Marshall and his action was somewhat like Freddie Trueman’s, the blend was brilliant.
Kehel took to the Khaki uniform like a duck taking to water and rose up the ladder from Sub Inspector to Deputy Inspector General of Police. He was the Personal Assistant to three ex IGP’S. He never dabbled in politics unlike these days he respected the uniform to a tee.
Rewinding back Kehel was the Cricket Manager of the Test Team to new Zealand in 1995.There was a ceremonial Manager as well whose duties must have been very much less than the Cricket Manager.Kehel had to organise the practice schedule, see to the morale of the players in short fully in charge and he pointed out that at the Police Force he handled thousands of policemen and he was well versed in tackling tough situations and even with tough nuts like Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda De Silva, he had his way not by coersion but by playing the right card at the right time. Earlier Stanley Jayasinghe and later Bandula Warnapura had tiffs with both Arjuna and Aravinda. In 1996 he had to abide by the call of duty thereby missing the glory of the World Cup triumph.
Not the love of money
The love of the game and certainly not the love of big bucks got Kehel back to the fold as a selector and after 10 years he was made the chief selector, he was not parachuted to the position and those days match referees were never heard of.
Chief Selector/ Match Referee
The author wonders how the former Chief Selector was in the West Indies match refereeing whilst our Test team was getting a colonial roasting by the pale faced Englishmen. It’s not cricket mate it’s plain greed for money.At the time of writing the last nail in the coffin got hammered. We lost the third Test. There was no doubt our batters fought hard but the cancer still remains, the so called half fit all rounder who does not bowl, gets two half centuries and then gets out putting the side in “dire straits.” This is just to secure his place and let the team go to hell!”He was never involved in helping his team in the Third Test where I was a frustrated spectator.I have seen cricketers of many a hue in England, Australia and The West Indies but I have never seen such a lackadaisical cricketer.
One bright spark in the SLCset up is Jerome Jayaratne who works hard behind the scenes. High time you come out of your shackles mate.
Getting back to T.B.Kehlgamuwa the Chief Selector, in his day there was no” big brother” the Sports Minister looking over his shoulder to change the selected squad, once done it was etched in stone.
Now that the Chief Selector and his buddies have been” shown the door” alas” the horse has bolted.” The higher ups who appoint the selectors have surely “shuffled the pack,” this time as well.
The love of the game never deserted Kehel ,his house is like a mini gallery, photographs of ‘yore’ adorns his walls in the house, he lives with two of his three daughters all graduates and his wife an ex school teacher.The eldest is a deputy head of aleading International School in Colombo 7.
Kehel is simple and approachable the hallmark of all the ex Sri Lankan stalwarts that I have interviewed.
