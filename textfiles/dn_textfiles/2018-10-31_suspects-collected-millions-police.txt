Large-scale currency fraud unearthed
Suspects collected millions: Police

Panadura Walana Central Police unearthed a massive currency fraud running to millions of rupees through banks when they arrested four foreigners while conducting a raid at a house at Temple Road in Mount Lavinia on Saturday.
Police took into custody three laptops, four counterfeit currency notes of Rs. 5,000 denomination, five mobile phones, a bundle of receipts and suspicious documents.
Three Ugandan nationals and one Nigerian allegedly engaged in the fraud were taken into custody for questioning.
Police traced the fraud when they arrested the Nigerian possessing five Rs. 5,000 counterfeit currency notes, while he was in Batakettara in Peliyandala on Friday.
He came out with the information when he was questioned. Later, Walana Central Police raided the rented house at Temple Road and arrested the other suspects who allegedly misled businessmen and others to credit to the accounts of the suspects to the value of prizes offered to them regarding a draw under two foreign companies.
They had told businessmen that there was a draw conducted by two foreign companies and the prizes had reached the Katunayaka International Airport, and that to release the items, the prize winners had to deposit money to the bank accounts of the three suspects and receipts should be forwarded to the address given by them.
According to Walana Central Police, the four suspects had collected millions of rupees in this way and dispatched money to foreign banks under their names.
The Counterfeit Currency Investigations Branch is expected to take over investigations in this regard. The suspects had been in operation for the last three to four years in Sri Lanka, police said.
