Some drugs on 53 percent prescriptions may have potential harmful interaction. Incomplete, absence or incorrect route, dose, frequency and duration details were found in most of the prescriptions.
Unapproved and error prone abbreviations were seen in about 70 percent of prescriptions. The Department of Pharmacology, Colombo after studying over 500 prescription, found errors in drug dose (35 percent), drug name (28 percent) and frequency (19 percent) of administration, Galappatthy said.
