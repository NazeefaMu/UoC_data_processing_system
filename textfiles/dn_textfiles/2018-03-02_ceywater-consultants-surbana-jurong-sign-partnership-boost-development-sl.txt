Ceywater Consultants, Surbana Jurong sign  partnership to boost development in SL

Ceywater Consultants Private Limited has recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Surbana Jurong Private Limited to drive growth and development in Sri Lanka through sustainable infrastructure development and management solutions.
Surbana Jurong, one of the largest Asia-based urban, industrial and infrastructure consulting firms, will collaborate with Ceywater Consultants, a dominant water and waste water works consultancy company in Sri Lanka to provide consultancy and design services across transport, water and environment, ports and coastal sectors.
Dr Uma Maheswaran, Chief Operating Officer for South Asia and Middle East, Surbana Jurong said, “Our partnership with Ceywater Consultants will allow us to provide our clients with a full suite of water and waste works consultancy and design services across infrastructure projects and management solutions. Leveraging both of our expertise, we can augment our contribution towards the development and growth of Sri Lanka.”
“This significant strategic partnership is a great milestone for Ceywater Consultants and will enable the two companies to instill a massive global presence and create opportunities to form a strong alliance for consultancy assignments of infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka and the region by initiating collaborative projects and human resource exchange programmes,” said Niroshan Gunaratne, Chief Executive Officer of Ceywater Consultants.
The MoU will capitalise on the recent Sri Lanka - Singapore Free Trade Agreement which aims to strengthen economic ties between the two countries and increase access to each other’s markets across professional, environmental, construction, tourism and travel-related services.
The MoU was signed by Ajith Wanniarachchi, Country Manager Sri Lanka, Surbana Jurong and Niroshan Gunaratne, Chief Executive Officer of Ceywater Consultants.
Collaborating with Surbana Jurong, who has played an instrumental role in the development of Singapore’s urban, industrial and infrastructure landscape for more than five decades, this partnership will provide enhanced solutions to support nation building across Sri Lanka.
