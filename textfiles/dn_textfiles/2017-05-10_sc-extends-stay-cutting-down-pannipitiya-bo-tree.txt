SC extends stay on cutting down Pannipitiya Bo-Tree

The Supreme Court yesterday further extended its Interim Order suspending the Road Development Authority (RDA) Chairman from cutting down or removing a Bo-Tree close to the border of the Colombo-Avissavella Road in Pannipitiya until June 13.
Two-Judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Upaly Abeyratne made this order pursuant to a Fundamental Right petition filed by four petitioners, including Ven. Weraduwe Sirijothi Thera of Sri Punnyabiwardanaramaya in Kottawa. Meanwhile, the court was informed through the Attorney General that the authorities have made arrangements to provide a solution to the issue.
The petitioners had cited the Higher Education and Highways Minister, the Maharagama Divisional Secretary, the RDA Chairman, Attorney General and several others as respondents.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana with Counsel M. Thilakaratne appearing on behalf of the petitioners had informed Court that the history of the Pannipitiya Bo-Tree runs back to about 400 years.
The petitioners stated that in 2015, the RDA tried to cut down the Bo-Tree to develop the High-level Road. The move was defeated by public protest.
The petitioners said the Bo-Tree is bearing its own history and has become part of the tradition and culture of the Buddhists and practices relating to Buddhism.
The Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with the petition and fixed the matter for argument on June 13.
