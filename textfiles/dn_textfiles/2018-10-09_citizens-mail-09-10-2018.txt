Residents plead: Open the drain before heavy rains
The residents who are also taxpayers to the Ja-Ela Urban Council and whose elected Member represent them as the Member for the Ward No 1, Thudella, want authorities concerned to take steps to reopen the drain or waterway, before the next heavy rain, which is around the corner.
The residents who were seriously affected by heavy rains in the early months of this year, opined that the waterway or the drain in question, goes through the Gama Meda Paara and St. Anne’s Mawatha, crossing the Vijaya avenue, has been there for decades, letting the rainwater pass through without causing damage to lives and property and houses to remain safe, when heavy rains occur.
When the UPFA was in power, the former Social Service Minister Felix Perera, the Gampaha District Member who represented Ja-Ela in Parliament, issued a letter dated December 17, 2010, addressed to the then Ja-Ela UC Chairman requesting him to take appropriate action to keep the drain open as it was in the past. But the UC authorities seem to have ignored the Minister’s request and as a result, the situation has turned worst eight years after the said letter was issued due to the inaction of the authorities concerned.
The files relevant to the issue maintained by the JUC shows that the UC had issued a warning letter in the year 1991 to some of the residents of the area, whom the UC suspected culpable, for getting involved in this unwarranted action of closing the drain. The report states that the drain in question had been closed permanently, since November 2010, with gravel.
Responding to the constant reminders and representations made by the taxpayers, the pleading-public, it is on record that the authorities had conducted street surveys from January 1 to February 21, 2011, and had verified that there had been a natural drain/ or passage to let rainwater pass through without causing damage to houses or properties of the residents of the locality of Thudella.
At the UC meeting held on July 27, 2012, the Members present unanimously passed a proposal made by the then Chairman of the UC, to resolve the pestering problem, and on September 25, the same year via a letter, to the Ja-Ela Police, sought the police protection, when authorities take action to reopen the drain, on October 4 of the said year. But this never took place and high hopes of the taxpayers were dashed to the ground.
There was no people representation to the Ja-Ela Urban Council for some years.
The residents of the area heavily affected by floods for almost five long decades, met the present authorities, pleading for help. They had met the present leaders of the Urban Council, jointly run by the Podujana Peramuna and the UNP, and once more had put forward the same complaint. In addition to that, they also had made representation to the Ja-Ela Provincial Secretary, seeking his assistance as well, for immediate relief.
The authorities running the affairs of the Ja-Ela Urban Council at present and the Ja-Ela Provincial Secretary had promised to reopen the said drain, closed by unauthorized persons, before heavy rainfall. The signs of heavy rains are now visible and the residents fear that they would be affected severely once more, with heavy rain, as the drain still remains closed.
The authorities have promised to take appropriate action to open the drain and let the rainwater flow down without the families in the area having to suffer from flooding, as they did for decades.
The files maintained at the Urban Council also indicate that on a number of times in the past, the UC has informed the Department of Local Government (Western Province), that steps would be taken to resolve the pressing problem.
