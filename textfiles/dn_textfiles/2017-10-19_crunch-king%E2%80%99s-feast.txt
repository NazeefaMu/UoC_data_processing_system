Crunch into King’s feast

Walking into the Kings at the Kingsbury, one is immediately impressed by the blend of its ambience. It is calming, soothing, comforting and restful and at the same time electrifying and exciting. This is because of Kingsbury’s new promotion where you can have the best of the best any day of the week in the evening. Daily news visited the Kingsbury to sample this unique experience in Colombo.

It is all about making the bar a happening place in Colombo. You see a lot of bars and restaurants coming up in Colombo with their own type of entertainment. What is offered by Kingsbury is indeed rare - seven different bands playing all seven days of the week!
When we say bands we are talking about the crème de la crème of Sri Lankan entertainment, the legendary bands. A lot of people are familiar with these names. They are fantastic musicians who have played great music to Sri Lankan and foreign audiences. So the band members are very well known, creating that nostalgia.
We are looking at is the best entertainment line up in Sri Lanka right now and it is happening right here at the Kingsbury. Kingsbury wants to offer its loyal clientele much more with this new promotion. They have gone for a scrumptious new menu with bites and beverages.
There is a well stocked extensive bar with friendly staff ready to serve you. The Kingsbury welcomes its patrons to come and enjoy and absorb the atmosphere. It will be an experience that is different and will make you want to make it your destination every week. You will definitely make this your venue where you can just chill out!

So the promotion has kicked off and this will be the standard scene and fixed line up at the Kingsbury. A great bar and a superb atmosphere is the desired purpose. The lighting is just right for the mood and ambience, and it is cozy and anyone can have a chat with the music going on. You can even sit yourself down in a corner and do some work. It has a classy upmarket feel about it. It is classic with modern touches as well. Come and enjoy and experience it yourself! You can relax after a hard day at work and sip a cocktail.
Band Leader of Mintarka and member of the band Wildfire Chris Dhason, said the setup is something new for them and the whole concept is something new for Kingsbury.
“I don’t think Kingsbury has bands like this performing. We are feeling our way around but there is an awesome set up of bands here. All the bands are very professional and each band has its own character and identity, so there is a wide variety of music. So we are enjoying it. So far the crowd reaction has been very positive. They like the music and it is something the crowd is enjoying and they are getting used to it. We hope more people will start coming here when they get to know about this,” said Dhason.
Mintarka is predominantly a rhythm and blues, soul and funk band. They do a lot of soul classics and jazz. They have great vocalists that enable them to tackle quite a variety.
