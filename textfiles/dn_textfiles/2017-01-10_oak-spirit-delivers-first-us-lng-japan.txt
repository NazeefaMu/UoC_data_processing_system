Oak Spirit delivers first US LNG to Japan

Oak Spirit, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier, delivered the first cargo produced in the contiguous United States (US LNG) to Joetsu LNG Terminal of Chubu Electric Power Company in Japan on January 6, 2017.
Jera, a joint venture created by Japan-based electric companies Tepco and Chubu Electric power, and the Houston-based LNG provider Cheniere Marketing International have entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the cargo, which was loaded onto the ship at Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana, operated by Cheniere Energy Partners on December 7, 2016.
On its way to Japan, Oak Spirit traversed the Panama Canal.
The 173,000 cubic meter ship was handed over to its owner, Teekay LNG Partners, from South Korean shipbuilder Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) in August 2016.
Oak Spirit joined its sister vessel, the Creole Spirit, which was launched in June 2015.
Following its delivery, Oak Spirit started its five-year fee-based contract with Cheniere Energy, lifting volumes from Cheniere’s Sabine Pass LNG export facility alongside the Creole Spirit.
