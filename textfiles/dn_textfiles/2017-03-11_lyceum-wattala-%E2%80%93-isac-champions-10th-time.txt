Lyceum Wattala – ISAC  Champions for the 10th time!

ISAC 2017 concluded on February 27 at the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium with Lyceum Wattala winning the title for the 10th time. Lyceum junior Athletes Chrishelli Pinto and Isuri Perera the Under 09 Joint Champions, and Shanaka Perera the Under 20 boys Champion won all the overall championship keeping the record unbroken.
The school won the championship for the 1st time in 2007 and for nine years from 2009 to 2017. Lyceum Wattala has shown its grit and perseverance through the past years winning the championship continuously despite organisers introducing various changes to its set up.
In 2015 the points were scrapped and replaced by medals by the organisers. Lyceum Wattala took the challenge and tagged the highest number of medals including 43 Golds, whilst the second placed team obtained 17 Gold medals.
In 2016, the Under 20 category was brought into the points table and with hardly any time to prepare and many injuries, they clinched a nail biting win. Lyceum Wattala with its eight acre premises and 100m synthetic track provides many sporting facilities to sportsmen and women.
