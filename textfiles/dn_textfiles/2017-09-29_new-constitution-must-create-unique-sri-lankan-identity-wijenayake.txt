New Constitution must create unique Sri Lankan identity - Wijenayake

Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms Chairman, attorney-at-law Lal Wijenayake said the main aim of the new Constitution should be creating a Sri Lankan identity.
"The Constitution in India has been able to create an Indian identity after several decades.Today, the Indians do not think much about their religion and community, but they all regard themselves as Indians.We must create the same situation here as well,”he said.
He was addressing the gathering at the seminar held yesterday to make Sri Lanka Army personnel aware on constitutional reforms at the Narahenpita Military Hospital.
"Today, we need a Constitution which unites the country and take it forward. The rights of all citizens should be protected and all types of resources should be distributed equally among all communities.The Constitution reforms should be accepted by all communities.All citizens should be equal stakeholders in the power structure.Although the Constitutions were enacted in 1972 and 1978, there was no public consultation and this later led to a various problems.
But, on this occasion, We have acted in very transparent manner by obtaining the views of public on Constitutional reforms.This is very democratic.We heard public views and proposals on constitutional reforms from all parts of the country. The New Constitution was the request from the people at the previous Presidential election. It is why all the people from South to North voted for the government despite their religion, race and party.We must fulfill their aspirations,” he added.
