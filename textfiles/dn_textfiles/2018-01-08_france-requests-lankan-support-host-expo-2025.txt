France requests Lankan support to host Expo 2025

International delegate in charge of the preparation of the French Candidature for the 2025 World Expo, Pascal Lamy was in Colombo to obtain support from Sri Lanka towards their bid.
170 delegates representing the member countries of the International Exhibitions Bureau (BIE) will elect the host country of the 2025 World Expo on November 2018 and the four cities short listed are, Greater Paris (France), Osaka (Japan), Yekaterinburg (Russia), Baku (Azerbaijan). If the bid is successful, France will host the event for the first time in 125 years. Lamy who is also the former director general of the World Trade Organization, said France last hosted the exhibition in Paris in 1900.
“The World Expo is a chance for our country to contribute to a new universal ambition, build on our past to embrace the future, and harness globalisation, an aspiration shared by our citizens as well as by the peoples of other nations,” he said.
“Should our bid be successful countries including Sri Lanka may convert their pavilions and remain at Paris-Saclay to receive students or innovative businesses from their country to contribute to the area’s intellectual and entrepreneurial vibrancy,” he said.
Around 40 million people from 190 countries and organizations are expected to visit the 2025 Expo over a six-month period to the “Global Village” a 110-hectare site to be located on the Paris-Saclay campus.
The total cost for hosting the event would be over Euro 3.5 billion. (SS)
