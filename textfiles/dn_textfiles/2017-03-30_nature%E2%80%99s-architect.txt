Nature’s architect

Architects have to be able to handle pressure. Because a lot depends on the architect’s ability to handle logistics. An Architect needs to get the logistics exactly right otherwise you cannot execute a plant to satisfaction. In the 21st century with technology evolving, new solutions and problems have come up. ArchWorld speaks to Archt. Mahesha Liyanage on the burning issue which is getting your logistic right.
“We all are prisoners of the consumerist culture, and many of our deeper human needs have become the commodities of the consumerist culture. We have to strike a balance between the demands of the consumerist culture and deeper human needs,” said Liyanage
Generally architectural buildings are user oriented creations.
“We, architects try to read the emotions of clients and feature them to our designs. We try to incorporate the character of the user in a reflective manner in to our designs. Human feelings, emotions and habits are important to create user friendly designs. I believe spiritual wellbeing is a must for any individual in the society today. It’s an important social requirement. Spirituality can be considered as an element in architecture which can support the client to develop spiritually by creating spiritual spaces in to designs,” stated Liyanage
As it is a tropical climate, sunshine is generally plentiful. It is important control the sunshine effectively to create comfortable environment within available spaces.
“Generally we don’t keep doors and widows facing the direct sun path. If unavoidable, we should use protective elements to avoid over exposure. Sunshine provides opportunities to use our creativity - creating different shades and patterns within the same space with the help of changing sun rays. In a tropical climate, wind should be embedded in to our creations to ensure cross ventilation throughout the year. Doors and windows should be positioned in such a manner to facilitate the natural air flow. Skillful use of air flow can completely eliminate or considerably reduce the high energy cost for fans and air conditionings,” explained Liyanage
Architectural Logistic does not only entail the sun and wind. It also entails materials.
“Construction material can dictate a number of conditions into architectural designs. Especially walls can influence the interior temperature of a building up to a greater extent. Therefore, walls of tropical buildings should withstand against the exterior heat. Brick walls are an ideal option for tropical buildings over many other materials. Lines and colors are used to define the character of the building and to build the linkage with the environment,” pointed out Liyanage
Use of sound is a challenging task.
“Sound can bring the sweetness of the natural environment into our living rooms. Yet extensive sound might become an annoying hassle for anyone. Sound is a commodity which should be controlled in order to ensure optimum use of it. Over exposure to some means of artificial sound can cause health and behavioral issues human beings,” warned Liyanage.
In tropical architectural designs, natural commodities such as sun, wind, rain, flora and fauna are extensively used.
“The comfort of the environment should be preserved with created spaces while eliminating the negative effects of those. Yes, I love to preserve trees and foliages, and to make the best use of them for my designs,” added Liyanage.
Timelessness
Timelessness is an eternal concept, which is impossible to redefine.
“Pyramids in Egypt and the Sigiriya Fortress are timeless designs of our civilization. These great creations have become conceptually timeless from their purpose itself. Today purposes are different, commercial ventures or creations with economic purposes can never be timeless. Therefore, most of modern creations are profit driven ventures, where timelessness is no longer a requirement as it doesn’t make quick profits. I strongly believe no machine can be as creative as humans. Involvement of robots and artificial intelligence into the designing process is unavoidable. But if the creativity is in demand, humans have the leading role to play,” reasoned Liyanage.
Decaying is something we can’t avoid or stop at any cost. But we can manage it to a greater extent and achieve a degree of timelessness in our creations.
“There are many examples in the history of civilization where time has been managed and a degree of timelessness has been achieved. You don’t have to go to great Pyramids in Egypt or Taj Mahal in India; there are many examples in Sri Lanka such as Awukana Statue, Samadhi Statue and Sigiriya Fortress.
I think they are timeless creations. Achieving timelessness is purely depending on requirements of the client. I believe, timelessness can be more or less driven by the circumstances. It is always a degree of timelessness and it will never become absolute or zero,” informed Liyanage
Architects more or less have their own language! Liyanage has developed her own language in architecture over the years.
“This architectural language is a mix of many aspects such as local traditions, cultural and social values, local climatic condition, modernity and technology. It is not easy to explain the architectural language developed over the years. It should be identified through careful observation of my architectural creations for various clients,” shared Liyanage
There are many instances where we have seen the right mix of Sri Lanka-ness with modernity in modern architectural designs.
“We have to understand that all are not successful stories.
There can be creations with no characteristics of modernity or tradition too. But, many modern architects have got the ability to negotiate traditions with modernity and to achieve the right balance,” said Liyanage
“Built environments always act negatively on natural environment. As an architect, I try my best to preserve the natural environment and to come up with solutions with minimal environmental effects. Climatic issues, urban issues and financial issues remain as challenges to natural environment. Hence, I always consider environment as the most important factor,” summed up Liyanage.
