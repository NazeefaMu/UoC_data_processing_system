CPRFU says Kandy has a problem with rugby grounds
In the Kandy district there is a major problem with lack of rugby playing grounds and most schools are handicapped and are unable to play their scheduled rugby fixtures says CPRFU. A few weeks back the All Island U/16 tournament was held at Satneeshi - Digane New Sports Complex and at Trinity College Pallekele grounds with much difficulty.
At the last moment when the tournament was to begin, there was no rugby goal posts. The CPRFU Rugby Development Officer Abdul Rasheed came to the rescue and overnight fixed the goal posts for the tournament. These are practical difficulties faced by Kandy, the Kandy Sports Club who enjoys a fully fledged rugby grounds are never generous in sharing their grounds. Their charges for hire are so exorbitant that schools can least afford it. When the lease agreement with Kandy Municipality was drawn up many years ago, it very clearly stated that the grounds are released on lease provided the adjoining village is also granted access to the grounds. When the former president late Dr. S. Kapuwatte was in charge, he knew the clause and was very liberal and allowed all schools to use the grounds. It’s high time the club administrators change their attitude and be more agreeable to promote rugby in Kandy.
