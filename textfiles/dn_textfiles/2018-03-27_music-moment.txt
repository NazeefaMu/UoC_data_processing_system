Music of the moment

Kavichandran Alexander does what he does with complete sincerity and with no pretension. He does what he does out of pure love for the art. He takes very little credit and just does it because he sees something beautiful in the music he archives by recording with the utmost purity. Melodies features Kavichandran Alexander, the first Sri Lankan to engineer and produce of multiple Grammy award winning recordings.
Music produced and recorded by Alexander and released on his own record label - Water Lily Acoustics, have been featured in six Hollywood films including ‘Dead Man Walking’ (Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon), ‘Angel Eyes’ (Jennifer Lopez), ‘Meet the Fockers’ (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) and the Bon Jovi documentary ‘The Circle’.
Alexander has recorded with many virtuosos from both the East and the West, such as Padma Vibhushan Ustad Dr. Ali Akbar Khan (Son of the Guru of Pandit Ravi Shankar), Padma Vibhushan Pandit Jasraj, Padma Bhushan Pandit V.G. Jog (Guru of Pandit Amaradeva) and numerous others.
He is the first Asian, to both produce and record major symphony orchestras, such as the Philadelphia Orchestra, The Saint Petersburg Philharmonic, The Saint Petersburg Symphony and the Hungarian National Philharmonic.
“I started my company Water Lily Acoustics with the goal of recording and preserving the traditional music of both the East and the West, with a strong emphasis on the music of the Sub Continent. I like to listen to the classical music of Asia - the Hindustani and Carnatic music of India, Arab classical music, Iranian classical music, Chinese classical music and Japanese classical music.
Performing with other artistes
What I found, from listening to these great classical traditions of the East, was that, in most cases, the recordings I listened to, did not match the sonic quality of the recordings made of the Western virtuosos. I also felt that the Asian traditions were not being recorded properly. I wanted to change this situation, I felt that this would be my goal and calling in life. Thus was born Water Lily Acoustics, named in honor of my dear mother Lily, who was the very first musician that I heard” said Alexander.
In the beginning Alexander was recording primarily Indian classical music, both Hindustani and Carnatic, starting with a recording of the greatest Indian musician of our times – Padma Vibhushan Ustad Dr. Ali Akbar Khan. This initial recording of the great master lead to a life- long friendship with him.
“That first recording, was a gift given to me by the legendary Ustad. He allowed me to record him, because he wanted to help me. At that time Water Lily Acoustics did not even have a P.O. Box number! My musical tastes being quite wide, I began recording Western Classical musicians as well. I further, decided to record collaborations of musicians from different cultures. The first such recording I did, brought together two African American ladies, who were Gospel singers, whom, I paired with a Jali from West Africa by the name of Papa Susso, who sang and played the Kora. This recording was titled -“A Gathering of Elders”. Next, I recorded an Indian guitarist who played Hindustani music on a modified guitar with sympathetic strings, that he had developed. I recorded musician, Padma Bhushan V.M. Bhatt with the American guitarist Ry Cooder and the resulting recording, titled “A Meeting by the River” won a Grammy in 1994,” stated Alexander.
More recordings followed with Padma Bhushan V.M. Bhatt being paired with other American virtuoso, such Bela Fleck (Banjo), Jerry Douglas, (Dobro), Blues singer Taj Mahal, Chinese virtuoso on the Erhu Jiebing Chen and the Palestinian virtuoso of the Oud Simon Shaheen.
“I was the first to record Indian Classical musicians, both Hindustani and Carnatic, with other Asian musicians from China, Iran and the Arab world. Every recording that I produce is a labor of love,” said Alexander.
Alexander maintains that his success does not go to his head. In fact he says that nothing comes entirely of our own.
“Everything we know, come to us through the good will of others. A lot of people helped me in learning the art of recording. They were very willing and generous in sharing their knowledge with me freely. I cannot take full credit. My mother is the first person I should thank, since she prayed for me and set me on a spiritual path. She instilled the love of music in me,” pointed out Alexander.
Recording is of course his passion. But he does not record in the traditional way as it is done in a studio with multiple microphones.
“I use very simple microphone techniques that were developed in the 1930’s. The technique I use has many advantages. It is a technique that lends itself perfectly, to the kind of music I am interested in recording. You cannot really record rock bands the way I do. That is something I know nothing about. What I do is more like documentary film making. I am basically capturing the reality of the unfolding of the music, in a suitable acoustic venue, with the highest audio fidelity.
The music I record has a reference, the real event. Whereas, in the multi- miked studio recording, one creates the “reality” in the studio. All I try to do is capture that magical moment, the unfolding of music,” explained Alexander.
Alexander has learnt a lot by associating with the artistes.
“They have basically gone through the fire. From that comes a certain level of wisdom and compassion. Khan Sahib saw the passion in me and helped me. From this initial gesture of kindness was born a deep friendship and bond and a father/son relationship grew. Men such as Khan Sahib have a vast knowledge of complex musical forms, with deep spiritual roots. Associating with these great masters gives you tremendous insights into yourself. That is something that I treasure. You think to yourself –‘How can a human being possess this kind of skill and mastery, how can a human retain such vast amount of information, such as complex modes and rhythm cycles’? Humility is the first step to all learning,” said Alexander
