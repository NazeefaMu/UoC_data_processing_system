Green Business Accelerator programme to the fore

Lanka Social Ventures (LSV) in a bid to facilitate start-up businesses focusing on using recycled plastic, paper and polythene launched the ‘Green Business Accelerator’ programme on May 18 at the Centre for Housing Planning and Building, Pelawatta.
Social Enterprise Incubator and Accelerator (SEIA) is LSV's main business support service for start-ups, social enterprises in their ‘growth’ stage and SMEs. LSV and SEIA have facilitated over 30 early-stage social enterprises and SMEs to date.
SEIA admitted 12 green-oriented entrepreneurs who adhere to its criteria of diversifying to become sustainable through income-generating activities, having clear environmental objectives and having commitment and dedication.
The six-month accelerated programme facilitates committed individuals and groups with innovative ideas to transform these ideas into successful and financially sustainable social enterprises via personalized business coaching, mentoring and specialized training. Representatives from the Central Environmental Authority, National Enterprise Development Authority, National Cleaner Production Centre, private sector recycling companies, financial institutions such as banks, Lanka Impact Investors Network and academic institutions shared their experiences and provided expert insights to participating entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurs showcased their business ideas and products and services to the panel and audience.
SEIA while offering tangible and intangible benefits to participants facilitates fast track learning and organization development by enabling entrepreneurs to network, partner with peers and investors (banks) and support agencies.
Each participant is coached individually on identifying his or her special skills and expertise on finance and accounting, marketing, technology, leadership, management, and legal issues. During the programme period, participants will operate from their own locations except for residential training in Kandy and exposure visits in optional venues.
