Cinnamon needs a boost

State patronage is essential for the cinnamon industry to thrive, cinnamon cultivators in Hambantota district said .The industry should get a new lease of life to make it a money spinner.
The cinnamon cultivation is seen in abundance at Katuwana, Walasmulla, Kirama Middeniya and Weeraketiya areas. The elderly cinnamon cultivators say that the youth in these areas must be encouraged to involve themselves in the cinnamon cultivation. The acute shortage of cinnamon peelers in these areas has proved to be a stumbling block for the progress of the industry.
