Kodituwakku misses out on century as Thomians tie scores

S. Thomas’ College were 255 for 4 in their first innings reaching the identical total scored by Royal College in their first innings when bad light brought an abrupt end to the second day of the 3-day 138th ‘Battle of the Blues’ cricket encounter played at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Thomian Sithara Hapuhinna drives a ball from Royals Ganith Sandeepa during his innings of 54 not out on the second day of 138th Battle of the Blues at the SSC grounds yesterday.  
 
Play was called off around 3.45 pm by umpires Messrs. Linden Hannibal and Asanga Jayasuriya as the light kept on deteriorating. A total of 40 overs were still to be bowled. On the first day too 14 overs were lost due to bad light making the total number of 54 overs lost and with only one day left a winning result in the match looks very unlikely unless something dramatic happens today.
Aided by a dropped catch in the morning, S.Thomas’ went on relentlessly to frustrate the Royalists after resuming at 33 for no loss.
Ravindu Kodituwakku who was unbeaten on 23 overnight was given a life at the beginning of the second day when Pasindu Sooriyabandara failed to hold on to a straightforward catch in the slips off the bowling of Ganith Sandeepa. Kodituwakkau assisted by the other opener Dulip Gunaratne began to launch the Thomian innings. The Royal bowlers were unable to purchase anything from the placid pitch and the Thomians looked set for a big score.
Kodituwakku’s on drives were pleasing to watch while Gunaratne played second fiddle but rendered valuable support in pushing the score along. In the 28.3 overs bowled in the morning session S. Thomas’ scored 94 runs with Kodituwakku adding a further 64 runs to his overnight score. On the stroke of lunch Royal finally got the breakthrough they were looking for when Himesh Ramanayake found the edge of the bat of Gunaratne and Madarasinghe accepted the catch behind. By that time the openers had added 127 runs for the first wicket with Gunaratne striking 35 off 92 deliveries with two fours.
Ramanayake looked the pick of the Royal bowlers on an unresponsive wicket. He unsettled the batsmen with an occasional bouncer and created doubts in the minds of the batsmen. After lunch Ramanayake bowled a fiery spell and Kodituwakku approaching his century (98) succumbed to nerves rather than his ability going for an ambitious drive and edging one to the slips where Sandeepa took a neat catch. Kodituwakku faced 149 deliveries and stroked 14 fours.
Royal partially came back into the game with the dismissals of Kodituwakku, Dinura Gunawardene ( 16) and Dellon Peiris ( 6) with the score reading 174 for 4 still 81 runs behind.
But skipper Romesh Nallaperuma and wicket keeper Sithara Hapuhinna took control of the situation and took the Thomians closer to the Royal total with some sensible batting. The aggressive Hapuhinna with some lusty hits reached an unbeaten 54 and Nallaperuma remained unbeaten on 32 adding 81 unfinished runs for the fifth wicket.
Hapuhinna’s 54 not out had seven boundaries after facing 71 deliveries and Nallaperuma struck four boundaries facing 68 balls for his unbeaten 32.
