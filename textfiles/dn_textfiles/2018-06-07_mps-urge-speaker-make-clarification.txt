Alleged list of PTL beneficiaries:
MPs urge Speaker to make clarification

Many Parliamentarians from both the sides urged Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday to take swift measures to make a clarification on the alleged list of MPs who had obtained money from Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius.
A number of MPs who took the floor yesterday pointed out that the allegations of MPs receiving money from Aloysius have become a headache for them, and that they have been finding it difficult to move with the people due to this reason. JO MP Shehan Semasinghe requested Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikalanathan, who was in the Chair to take collaborative effort with the Speaker to make a clarification in this regard or order the MPs not to make claims on the matter to the media and general public without any proof.
“First the media reported that there are 118 MPs who have received money from Aloysius. But yesterday (5), several sections of the media reported that the actual number is 166. This is becoming a joke now. Now, all the 225 MPs in this Parliament are facing criticism and humiliation in society,” Semasinghe said.
“We do not know who recieved money from Aloysius and who did not. Now each and every one of us has become a suspect,” he noted. The Deputy Chairman of Committees said that he would bring the matter to the attention of the Speaker. UNP MP Nalin Bandara pointed out that this alleged list has become a headache to everyone. “The government MPs also want these alleged names to be revealed. So the Speaker should make a clarification on the matter to protect the goodwill of this Parliament,” he added.
