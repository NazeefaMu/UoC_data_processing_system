Death traps at Dambulla central bus stand

The Dambulla central bus stand maintained by the Dambulla Municipal Council is in a neglected state, posing danger to commuters visiting it and vehicles parking there.
The iron sheets covering the drains inside the bus stand premises have broken and the sharp protruding edges pose a veritable death trap to commuters visiting the bus stand in haste to board buses.
Bus crews also allege that tyres of their buses entering the bus stand often get punctured by getting caught in the broken edges of iron sheets covering drains. Although the Municipal Council charge a daily fee of Rs. 50 from each bus entering the bus stand, it had miserably failed to maintain the utility in a proper manner by promptly attending to repair work.
Moreover, the stench emanating from the clogged drains was unbearable, most commuters said. Municipal Commissioner Ruwan Ratnayake, when contacted, said urgent action would be taken to renovate the bus stand and resolve the problem for the convenience of commuters and bus crew.
