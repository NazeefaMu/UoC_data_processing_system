Sisters Shanaya and Nayantara Perera capture the fleeting moments in life for a worthy cause
Photographers are not born. Anyone with the flair to capture the versatility of the fleeting moments in life can create images which radiate freshness and the ageless capacity to enthrall. However not many have been able to link their passion with a worthy cause in such a grand scale.
Sisters Shanaya and Nayantara Perera started Photocause by clicking for a cause. Seven years, two exhibitions and a magazine later the two students of St Bridget’s Convent, Colombo, have now taken to more advanced means of reaching beyond borders through their cancer awareness campaign. Using digital technology, the girls have made four videos in which they spread messages for positive change.
The 17 year old and 15 year old had witnessed the cancer treatments and its brutal side effects on a loved one early in their life.
“One of our aunts who had even taken care of my mother when she was young died of breast cancer. That was a heartrending period for us but instead of suffering in silence we decided to do something about it,” Shanaya recalled in an emotional tone.
She says that another reason why the girls wanted to do the project was because taking pictures and selling them online to raise funds for Sri Lanka Cancer Society was a unique concept.
The girls had always had a passion for photography. They had been capturing images since the age of eight and six years. They completed the Applied Photographer Course at the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka (PSSL) held at the Lionel Wendt when they were 14 and 12 years.
Photocause took wings in 2011. The name springs from the idea of using photography for a cause. Their first exhibition was in 2015 at the National Art Gallery. The second one followed in 2017 at the J D A Perera Gallery. They showcased 80 of their work along with photographs taken by other school children who had been invited to take part. Altogether around 120 photos made up the exhibitions.
Their photographs evoke an infinite variety of perception and interpretation. Through the images they share vignettes of frozen moments of life.
Armed with Cannon cameras and lenses the duo has ventured to all parts of the island from the seashores of the Galle Fort to the ancient ruins in Polonnaruwa and the wilderness of Wilpattu National Park. They have even captured the beautiful landscaped of Kandy and Ratnapura.
How do the girls connect with their pictures?
“There is a meditative moment of silence for concentration when I start taking photographs. You begin on a clean slate when you engage in the process. Both of us are not good at drawing. So this is the art that we can engage in to express ourselves. Each picture embodies a different message,” Shanaya explained.
For Nayanatara photography is almost a form of therapy as it is relaxing in addition to being something she enjoys engaging in. She sees photography as a sensitive response to others.
“Different people can interpret the same image in two different ways,” she explained.
Shanaya stressed that event photography is not their thing. They are into art and wildlife photography.
“We do not focus on people all the time. We go for landscapes and flora and fauna. We are often short of time due to our studies. So we go on our photo clicking sprees whenever we can.
Shanaya explained that they initially wanted to do a project on behalf of animal welfare.
“Our aunt’s death left a deep rooted impact within us. We witnessed the suffering she went through. This changed our perspective and we wanted to do something on behalf of our dear one in trying to create awareness and cancer prevention,” she said adding that they also do volunteer work at the ABC School for Special Needs Children in Colombo. They are also national award-winning archers and gifted ballet dancers.
Queried if they have any favourites among their collection and the girls break into smiles. Nayathara says that she loves a picture of a dried up tree which has won her many awards and a picture of a leopard she shot some years back while Shanaya also chooses two: a big black bear climbing a tree and peeking through the branches which reminds her of Winnie the Pooh and a picture of a leopard captured in a striking pose.

‘Awake’, a slim bound magazine focusing on cancer awareness was also launched by the team as a part of the project last year. The magazine had been distributed among 20 schools.
They say that their father, Mangala Perera, and their mother, Gayana Perera, have been very supportive towards the initiative. They also have a four year old sister named Alisha who is already following them around with her own mini camera.
Their latest project, the videos relates the tales of cancer survivors. It spreads the message that cancer does not necessarily mean death.
“It is another way in life to overcome it. You need to take steps to detect it early. A video gets thousands of views. We encourage the viewers to go for a health check up early. So one view could mean one life saved,” Shanaya explained adding that there is a lot of fear towards cancer.
“We all have cancer cells in our body. However some have it more than others. It all depends on what stage you are in. Early detection saves lives,” she added.
Photocause bagged the Plaque of Appreciation in 2017. The Foundation for Civilian Bravery awarded the Gold Medal in the Student category in ‘Civilian Bravery-Social Activity’ to them this year.
“Do not wait until someone tells you to do something. Do what needs to be done. Pick a topic and start working on it. You do not necessarily have to focus on a disease. It can be another topic like animal welfare or gender equality. It does not matter how many people listen to you because the numbers will grow gradually,” they opined.
The sisters hope to take the Photocause exhibition to an international scale by inviting school children from other countries to send in their photographs in the future.
