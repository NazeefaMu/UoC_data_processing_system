One pint of blood required every two minutes in SL

One pint of blood is required every two minutes in Sri Lanka and one pint of blood donated by a donor saves three lives. Blood is given free of charge in Sri Lanka, Health Ministry Media Director Prasanna Adhikari said.
According to Adhikari, at present, there are 600,000 registered blood donors in Sri Lanka and 450,000 persons donate blood. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will felicitate Sri Lankan blood donors on June 14 on World Blood Donors' Day. There are blood banks attached to all main state hospitals in the country and at present, there are around 107 registered blood banks all over the island. A total of around 2,000 health staffers serve in the National Blood Transfusion Service which functions countrywide. People belonging to all religions and ethnicities donate blood to save lives, he said.
The National Blood Transfusion Service has won international awards for its quality service and the safety of blood. “There is no blood shortage in the country and when there is a requirement of blood, the National Blood Bank announces the requirement to the public through mass media,” he added.
