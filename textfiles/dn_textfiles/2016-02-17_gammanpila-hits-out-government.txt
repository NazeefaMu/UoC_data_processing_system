Gammanpila hits out at government

Pivituru Hela Urumaya leader and Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila asked what laws the Defence State Minister intended to use to sue people on social media.
He was referring to the statement made by the Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardena who said that steps would be taken against people making defamatory remarks against the President and the Prime Minister using Facebook and other social media networks.
Opposition member Gammanpila questioned under what laws these persons will be sued, as the laws pertaining to criminal defamation were abolished in 2002, under the UNP government. He added that only civil cases could be filed, claiming damages.
He made these observation yesterday at a press conference at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head office.
“I have filed a case, claiming damage against Hirunika Premachandra for making several defamatory remarks. At least she has a Defender, so I can get the same for my damages,” Gammanpila said.
“But what does some one do when a beggar is hired make defamatory remarks? These days a minister has assigned such a person to make defamatory remarks against me,” he claimed.
He also thanked Minister S. B. Dissanayake for revealing that arrests are made on the instruction of the President and the Prime Minister:
“Minister S. B. Dissanayake said that the President said that it was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who was to be arrested. Minister Dissanayake said the President said that it was the Prime Minister and himself who decided not to do so,” Gammanpila said.
“The statement reflects who it is that decides who will be arrested and who will not to be,” he charged.
Gammanpila further stated that S. B. Dissanayake had also said that President Maithripala Sirisena did not take the leadership of the SLFP by force.
He added that Minister Dissanayake had said that when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was told that Namal and Shiranthi were to be arrested, he had left the leadership. Gammnpila said that incident too, reflected reality.
