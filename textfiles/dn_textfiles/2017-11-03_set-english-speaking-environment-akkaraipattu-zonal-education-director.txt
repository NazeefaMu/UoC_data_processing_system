Set up an English speaking environment: Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director

Teaching is a noble profession. Some teachers are not aware about their responsibilities. It is the duty of teachers to build a good society and guide students in the current path so that they will become good citizens, the Akkaraipattu Zonal Education Director A. M. Ahamed Lebbe said.
The Zonal Education Director Ahamed Lebbe visited the Addalaichenai Al-Muneera Girl’s Higher School recently and discussed issues relating to educational development activities in the school. The Principal of the School M. H. Razmee, School Development Committee Secretary A. B. Abdul Gaffoor, Members of the SDC and staff were also present.
The Principal M. H. Razmee said the activities in the past and the proposed plans in the future were discussed in detail. The importance of proper education should be realized by the teaching staff. Some teachers waste their time and do not pay attention to students in classrooms. Such teachers will be looked down upon by society, he said.
“A majority of school children from rural areas have excelled in examinations. The government should provide basic facilities for rural schools as whatever hardship parents undergo, they somehow educate their children,” the Zonal Education Director said. The Zonal Education Director A. M. Ahamed Lebbe has requested all teachers to set up an English speaking environment at the school for the benefit of the children. The educational activities of the school and the achievements of students were commended by the Director.
