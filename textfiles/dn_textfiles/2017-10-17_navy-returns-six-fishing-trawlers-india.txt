Navy returns six fishing trawlers to India

On completion of repair work, the Sri Lanka Navy handed over six more Indian fishing trawlers back to India.
The six Indian fishing trawlers had been seized by the Sri Lanka Navy for poaching in Sri Lankan territorial waters.
A total of 26 Indian fishing trawlers which were in Sri Lankan custody have been handed over to the Indian Government since September 30, 2017.
The six Indian trawlers were escorted to the International Maritime Boundary Line ( IMBL) north of Kankesanthurai by the Sri Lanka Coast Guard Fast Attack Craft CG 406 and handed over to the Indian Coast Guard Ship Rani Gaidinliu, the Navy media unit said.
