Why move to pro-Myanmar crisis and condemnation?

Sri Lanka is not entirely free of international denunciations with regard to the situation that prevailed in the final stages of the war to defeat the terrorist and separatist LTTE, as well as concerns about the situation regarding missing persons in a wider period before and after the end of that war. The country has certainly made considerable progress in this regard, due to the reconciliation and peace building policies of the present government, especially in the early period of the present coalition of unity. There is much to be done to get over the allegations from abroad, but more importantly to show the affected sections of the population within this country itself that suitable and remedial action has been, and will be taken.
This is certainly not the time for Sri Lanka to be in the foreign headlines on issues relating to human rights in the negative and especially the non-humanitarian treatment of refugees, from any country or society; especially in the context of what has today become an issue of the widest international condemnation – the treatment of the Rohingyas by Myanmar. This is exactly what has happened with the attack on the Rohingya refugees occupying premises rented by the UNHCR at Mt. Lavinia earlier this week. The news of the attack was flashed on several foreign news outlets, raising issues about Sri Lanka’s commitment to the principles of international law relating to the treatment of refugees, and international conventions on treatment of refugees.
The Rohingya crisis is now part of the big news very day. Nearly a half-million Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh in the past year, most of them since Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces had reportedly prompted a military crackdown and reprisals by the majority Buddhists of Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine state in that country. What the world is seeing – through reports from many media organisations, UN refugee institutions and international human rights organisations, is the discrimination and persecution of Rohingya Muslims by a Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where the government denies them citizenship and considers them illegal immigrants. Extremist Buddhist monks are known to have led attacks on the Rohingyas, contributing much to the situation they are in today.
Colonial past
The crisis of the Rohingyas certainly goes back to the colonial period of British rule in the region. The close geographical links between Myanmar (then Burma) and the Indian sub-continent, and the demarcations drawn by the British when carving out Pakistan, do not appear to have given due consideration to the Rohingya Muslim population that was largely on the borderline between Myanmar and East Pakistan, which later became the independent Bangladesh. The Burmese, and later Myanmar, have denied them citizenship, with the related discriminations and persecutions. The Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who holds a very important position in the present Myanmar government, but not in command of its Armed Forces, appears to be giving in to the anti-Rohingya and pro-Buddhist majoritarian politics of the day.
Sri Lanka with its position of a vast Buddhist majority and a minority Muslim population, and in the context of the not so distant attacks on the Muslim population in the Alutgama – Beruwala areas led by sections of the yellow robes, is in danger of falling into a similar accusations by the international community, if the situation that took place earlier this week is allowed to continue in any way. The politics of this country can very easily be transformed into a ruthless swing or sweep against a minority, which may not be wholly supported by the majority Buddhists in the country. It is not the majority of people who are involved in such situations, but the organised manipulators of people and the crooked political strategists. This calls for the strongest action by government, especially through proper public education and timely action when necessary, to curb the rise of extremist feelings through majoritarian strategists.
The Record
To get the records straight, Rohingya refugees have come to Sri Lanka from March 2008, when a boat carrying Myanmar and Bangladeshi nationals that had left from Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh suffered engine failure off Mullaitivu, and were rescued by the Sri Lanka Navy. All 55 persons were recognized as refugees, and later arrangements were made for them to migrate for resettlement in the USA in 2012 by the UNHCR.
In 2013, the SL Navy rescued two boatloads of persons, again from Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, one carrying 138 persons from Bangladesh and Myanmar, and the other carrying 32 from Myanmar. The Government agreed that the UNHCR should arrange for a phased release of these Rohingya persons, which took place in November 2015 to the USA and Canada.
The latest is 30 Myanmar nationals – Rohingyas – rescued by the SL Navy on April 30, 2017, temporarily held at the Mirihana Immigration Detention Centre, and later on a Court order in Sri Lanka, dated August 8, 2017, released to the care of the UNHCR, and housed in the premises that came under attack this week at Mt. Lavinia. The number there is now 31, because one child was born here. Sixteen of these 31 persons are children. The question that arises is what serious threat there could be to Sri Lanka from 31 Rohingya refugees, of whom at least half are children. The Rohingya issue has been developing in Myanmar over the years, as we saw the arrival of similar refugees in larger numbers earlier, and resettled abroad by the UNHCR. What is the big danger that prevailed with this group of 31, including one infant born here, to lead to all the violent protests at Mt. Lavinia? Is it the genuine concern for the safety of Sri Lanka, and its Buddhist majority population and cultural values, or the politics of division and the majoritarian thrust which is seeking to strengthen its political impact? What is also of important concern, especially in Sri Lanka, is the role of those in yellow robes, who lead and organize such protests and attacks. This is certainly not the role of the Maha Sangha who bring the message of tolerance and compassion that is the core of Buddhist teaching. Should this compassion, not be extended to all humans who deserve it – even the Rohingyas? This is certainly the substance for an important and urgent debate in this country. The fact that Buddhists make up 70 per cent of Sri Lanka’s population, must show its larger commitment to genuine Buddhist values.
PC polls debate
The Government’s success in ramming through the Provincial Council Amendment provisions through Parliament last week, what many see as showing little concern for the very good Supreme Court order on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, is having its continuing reverberations in politics. There is the need for Government to make sure the delimitation proposal on PCs brought in at the last moment, will be in keeping with its assurance that the Sabaragamuwa, North Central and Eastern PC polls will be held by March next year. Any delay on delimitation of PCs, as was so common with the Local Government units, will certainly be a political disaster for the government, in its immediate dealings with the people.
The Joint Opposition is certainly having a good debating time on the PC issue, and its accusations of Government manipulating the parliamentary process, and its allegations of the government’s disrespect to the Constitution. JO members critical of the government on disrespect for the Constitution, have forgotten that all of them, and many in the government too, did vote for the 18th Amendment, that moved away from Constitutional thinking, by giving unlimited terms to the Executive President. It is a mockery for members of both the JO and SLFP in government to talk of respecting the Constitution, after having voted for the 18th Amendment for a permanent Rajapaksa Regime. That is the curlicue of politics. But the issue of the timing the PC polls, will certainly be a major issue for the government, if delimitation, as many suspect, would cause poll delays.
While on a broader issue, the JVP is certainly making an important case for the passage of the National Audit Bill, which has been delayed for years, and was a major promise of the Common Candidate for the Executive Presidency in January 2015. But the JVP, in its attempts to present itself as the next choice for the people, will have to be more effective in its policies and proposals, and a better look at its past, that make it more shaky in reality, than on the language of propaganda.
As the Budget approaches the Government will certainly have to face the rising protests of the people on the cost of living. The price of essential foodstuffs is showing all sign of a sky rocket with Rice, Coconut and Gas – already at the core of the rise, which affects every household. Cartoonists are having a good time with humour on the reality of ‘Haal, Pol and Gas'. The stuff of humour could soon be the clout of people’s protest.
