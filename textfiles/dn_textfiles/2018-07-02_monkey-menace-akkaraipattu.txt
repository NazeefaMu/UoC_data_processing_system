Monkey menace in Akkaraipattu

As monkey numbers in the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai, Oluvil, Palamunai, Thiraikeny, Ashraff Nagar, Meelath Nagar and Alamkulam areas have been on the rise, residents said they faced hardships on a daily basis.
Housewives said monkeys enter kitchens and steal food. Villagers use crackers to drive monkeys away.
Groups of monkeys often damage tiles and asbestos sheets, while jumping onto and running along roofs and also pose a threat to home gardens and farms.
Coconut trees are targetted the most, villagers added.
