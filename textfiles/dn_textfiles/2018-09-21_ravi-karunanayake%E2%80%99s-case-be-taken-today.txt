Ravi Karunanayake’s case to be taken up today

The case filed against MP Ravi Karunanayake for allegedly providing false evidence before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate into the Treasury bond issue on August 20, 2016, will be taken up today (21) in the Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court.
The hearing was fixed for today when it was taken up before the court yesterday.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appearing with State Counsel Nadee Suwadurugoda for the Attorney General asked that an order be delivered to obtain all the relevant documents between January 2015 and August 2017 from Global Transportation Logistics (GTL).
The documents include details of decisions taken by Global Transportation’s director board, details of director board meetings and notices, and details of transfers of all the directors and company secretaries, the SSC said.
SSC Girihagama said that Company Secretary C.R. Beregala, who worked at GTL resigned from the company on January 15, 2018. He also asked for an order for GTL to hand over the documents to CID Investigation Officer Thilak Bandara or his agent.
SSC Girihagama also informed the Chief Magistrate that most of the company secretaries who worked at GTL had worked at J.N.A. Secretarial Service Management Private Limited.
After considering the request made by the SSC Girihagama, the Chief Magistrate ordered GTL to provide all the details to the CID.
