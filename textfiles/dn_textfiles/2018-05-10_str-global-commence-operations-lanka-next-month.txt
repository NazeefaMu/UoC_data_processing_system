STR Global to commence  operations in Lanka next month

For the first time in Sri Lanka, STR Global a world leader in providing statistics and data will be opening their operation in Sri Lanka next month in association with Grow Sri Lanka Investment and Exports Development National Programme at WTC.
This is mainly to gather special economic data and other investment opportunities and present it to the global investors who are looking at investing in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Prabath Ukwatta founder Grow Sri Lanka Investment & Exports Development National Programme said that today most of the government enterprises only updates news but not data. “Even the web sites of top government institutions that are there to woo foreign investors to Sri Lanka are not updated in the few years.”
The Director from STR Global in USA, Jesper Palmqvis was in Sri Lanka for the Asia Hotel and Tourism Investment Conference (AHTIC) in November which was organized by Founder Grow Sri Lanka Investment and Exports Development National Programme and then I proposed him to open an office in Sri Lanka to fill this void.
He agreed also signed up with Lanka Property Club to be the local partner.
Founded in 1985, STR’s presence has expanded to 16 countries, with a corporate North American headquarters in Hendersonville, Tennessee, an international headquarters in London, England and an Asia Pacific headquarters in Singapore. STR is the source for premium global data bench marking, analytics and marketplace insights.
Any investor first takes a look at the country data and when does not find sufficient information he is disappointed and may even look at other options in other countries. “Today E information is a key area and sadly government institutions don’t think in that manner.”
He said what the public web sites have is news about their activities and not data. “It’s to bridge this gap that I negotiated with STR Global to open their operation in Sri Lanka and they will provide there service free of charge.”
He said that STR Global is already in India and Singapore and they have a lot of customers both local and foreign.
Dr. Ukwatta also said that he had also signed up with TARSCH CONSULTING in UK which is a concluding, adverting and promotions arm. “The prime objective of this is to promote FDI to Sri Lankan and also increase the brand image of Sri Lanka.”
They too would be opening in Colombo next month and both these initiatives were endorsed by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Dr Ukwatte said that President has also implied that more efforts are need to woo FDI to Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka brand image too has to be enhanced.
He also said that the first Grow Sri Lanka awards ceremony will be held on November 9 at Colombo Hilton honoring all Exporters both local and BOI companies.
This will be in association with the Export Development Board and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
