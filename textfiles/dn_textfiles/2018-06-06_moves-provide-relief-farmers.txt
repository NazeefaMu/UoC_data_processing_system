Crop damage due to weather
Moves to provide relief to farmers

The Agriculture Ministry is planning to grant relief to farmers who suffered crop damages in recent times due to incessant rains and other inclement weather conditions.
With this objective in view, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera on Monday, directed officials to submit an urgent report to him containing information about crop damages suffered by farmers, recently.
He said he hoped to submit a memorandum to the government to provide relief to affected farmers based on this report.
The minister said there were reports about vast damages caused to crops in several agricultural areas in the country, including the hill country, due to inclement weather conditions.
As a result, prices of upcountry vegetables had drastically increased in the market.
This was the result of destruction caused to crops cultivated by farmers due to heavy rains.
