Mouni signs three films even before ‘Gold’ hits the big screen

Although it was more or less anticipated, ‘Gold’ seems to have impressed critics thanks to notable performances by the lead pair - Akshay Kumar and Mouni Roy - along with a talented ensemble cast. In the days leading up to the release, Akshay and Mouni were on a promotional spree, travelling the length and breath of the country to greet media personnel as well as fans. At one such event, Akshay even revealed that such was the buzz around the film that Mouni had already signed three films after ‘Gold’. The actress, who is best known for her role in the television show ‘Naagin’, has made her Bollywood debut in ‘Gold’ and her performance has been appreciated.
Akshay is mighty impressed with Mouni and says that in a short span of time, the actress has got plum projects in her kitty and also has the talent to go a long way in the industry. He says that in the next decade, he assumes Mouni will easily do at least 42 films. The fact that she is already an established and known TV face will further help Mouni connect with the audiences. In ‘Gold’, she plays the role of Akshay Kumar’s Bengali wife.
