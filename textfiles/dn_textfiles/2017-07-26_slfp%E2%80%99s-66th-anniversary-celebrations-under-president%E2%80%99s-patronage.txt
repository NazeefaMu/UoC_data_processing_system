SLFP’s 66th anniversary celebrations under President’s patronage

The 66th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party will be held on a very grand scale under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at 1.30 pm on September 2 at Campbell Park, SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Bandara said that all arrangements have been made to make this anniversary celebration a remarkable one and party representatives from all electorates including Women’s organisations, youth organisations and trade unions in the country will attend the function.
He said the SLFP is progressing with reforms to face challenges under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. “Many people say that the unity government contains only the UNP policies. But, this is not true since many SLFP policies are also followed by the government. President Sirisena was instrumental in changing many decisions taken by the unity government as they are against the S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike policies. Even though, the previous government outright granted the Port City project to a Chinese company,President Sirisena converted this into a 99 year lease. The President rectified the mistake made during the previous government which was totally against the SLFP policies,”Bandara said.
“Minister Mahinda Amaraweera is the first SLFP member who had made a complaint to the Commission to Inquire the Allegations of Bribery or Corruption over the Central Bank bond issue,” he said.
“We formed this government with an objective of arresting corruption and fraud as it is one of the pledges in our manifesto,” the SLFP Youth Front Chairman said.
“The President as a clean politician appointed special Presidential Commission to investigate into this scam.This goes to show that the SLFP is not a cat’s-paw of any party,” he said.
“The former President granted lots of privileges and high positions to the UNP members when they crossedover. This allegedly weakened the SLFP and rendered the party members helpless. This was one of the main reasons for the SLFP’s defeat during the previous Presidential election.Since,the party had no majority, we had to form a unity government with the UNP in 2015 which has been approved by the SLFP Central Committee. Therefore, all must join hands with the President to further strengthen the party. The SLFP members must unite to strengthen the party in order to from a SLFP led government by 2020,” Bandara said.
