Magistrate orders 270,000 Kgs of rice be released for animal feed

Colombo Additional Magistrate Daminda Ramanayake yesterday ordered that 270,000 Kgs of rice worth over Rs.20 million imported from Myanmar be released for animal feed as the consignment was unfit for human consumption.
The Public Health Inspectors office in Kollonawa following information received from the public had raided a warehouse recently and had found the stock of rice, unsuitable for human consumption.
Two suspects also had been arrested in connection with the incident.
