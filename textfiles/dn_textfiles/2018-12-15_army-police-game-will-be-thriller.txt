Army - Police game will be a thriller

Army Sports Club which suffered a shock 14-24 defeat at the hands of Navy sports club last week at Ratmalana will go all out to make amends for it by overcoming Police Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club League rugby first round match at Police Park today. Kick ofF will be at 4.00pm.
Army will miss the services of their cracking former Vidyartha College Kandy captain cum centre Imanka Ariyapala due to a knee operation.
Mean while the Police will be sans second row forward Romesh Archirige due to a hand injury.
The lads from Police Park scored a superb 28-19 win against a gallant Air Force Sports club in their first round opening game played at Police Park last week and another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected today.
But if Army emerge victorious today, then it won't be a surprise as Army forwards are having one of their best seasons in the ongoing rugby league tournament.
