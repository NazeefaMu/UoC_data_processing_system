Woakes joins injury list with crack on thumb

England's injury concerns don't seem to be ending anytime soon, with Chris Woakes being the latest to join the list. The 27-year-old all-rounder was hit on the right thumb by a Mohammed Shami bouncer, which eventually got him dismissed on the fourth day (November 29) of the recently concluded third Test between India and England in Mohali.
He is reported to have suffered a ‘tiny crack’ as per the England management, after he went for an X-ray at the end of the game. Earlier in the series, Woakes was left out of the second Test in Visakhapatnam with a sore knee. However, the England team management are hopeful of a quick
recovery and expect him to be fit in time for the fourth Test in Mumbai, starting on Thursday (December 8).
In addition, the 19-year-old England opener, Haseeb Hameed is returning home for an operation to his sore little finger on the left hand, which he sustained during the Mohali Test. His replacement is likely to be announced soon.
