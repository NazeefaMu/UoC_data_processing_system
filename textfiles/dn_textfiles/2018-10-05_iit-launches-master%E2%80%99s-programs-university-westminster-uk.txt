IIT launches Master’s programs from University of Westminster  UK

Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), a pioneer in British higher education in Sri Lanka,has launched two unique Master’s programs from the University of Westminster, UK.
The two programs - MA Fashion Business Management and MScCyber Security and Forensics are introduced for the first time ever in the country.
The Master’s in Fashion Business Management programme was launched by the University of Westminster in its commitment to provide innovative programmes for individuals pursuing careers in the fashion industry locally and internationally.
It will equip students with strategic decision-making, leadership and problem-solving skills required to become an entrepreneurial and visionary fashion business leader in today’s fast-evolving fashion industry. Students will also be able to work closely with fashion industry professionals, role models and mentors.
The course offers an innovative and state-of-the-art fashion business curriculum that focuses on preparing students’ entry into senior roles in business and management within the fashion industry. The curriculum has been specifically designed to train individuals to enhance their skills and become visionaries in their respective industries. The course provides an in-depth knowledge in areas of Supply Chain Management, Strategic Fashion Business Management, Fashion Marketing and Entrepreneurship followed by a Fashion Business Project.
Students following the MSc in Cyber Security and Forensics(2-year, part-time course) will gain insights into the nature of the security threats faced by today’s computer systems, the type of information that is stored on digital devices and how digital evidences can be traced and extracted from them.
The core modules include Cyber Security Evidence and Procedures, Fundamentals of Security Technology, Internet Security, Research Methods and Professional Practice.
Expressing her views on the two newest additions to the institute’s portfolio, Naomi Krishnarajah Dean of IIT said, “IIT has always maintained close links with industry to minimize the divide between the industry and academia. These two new Master’s programmes will add a new dimension to our portfolio. When considering the fashion industry, Sri Lanka has a number of undergraduate programmes in fashion design but there aren’t any Master’s programmes. We have introduced this Master’s programme to increase the number of skilled professionals in the country to cope with this fast-changing field of IT.”
Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) was established in 1990 as the first private higher education institute that awards reputed British degrees in the field of ICT and Business. IIT is an award-winning campus offering internal postgraduate and undergraduate degrees from the University of Westminster, UK and Robert Gordon University, UK. IIT has played a pivotal role in strengthening the IT and Business sectors in Sri Lanka over the years by producing world-class graduates.
