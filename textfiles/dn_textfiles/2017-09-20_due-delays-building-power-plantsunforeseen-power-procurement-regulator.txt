Due to delays in building power plants,unforeseen power procurement: Regulator

The country’s electricity regulator in its latest report has said that the frequent delays in building the planned power plants, unforeseen power procurement and change in the power mix have resulted in a sharp increase in the average unit cost of electricity over the years.
In 2016 alone, the Ceylon Electricity Board’s (CEB) power purchases from oil based plants were six times above the budget for that year.
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka in its recent report “Electricity Supply 2020 and Beyond: Challenges and Recommendation” further stated that these unnecessary costs were due to the non-implementation of the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plans (LCLTGEP) agreed to by the CEB and approved by the Commission.
“This has resulted in cost overruns, load shedding, and unplanned power procurement in the past few years and these consequences are expected to be continued in the next few years if timely implementation of long term generation plan is not ensured”, stated the Commission in a press release on its report yesterday.
The report which analysed the country’s electricity supply, forecasted data, power plant schedule with the actual situation and how LCLTGEP’s prepared from the year 2006 to 2016 by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) also highlighted errors in the CEB’s energy forecasts, especially in the LCLTGEP 2011 plan.
The CEB, it further noted had identified the problem and is in the process of improving the accuracy of base demand forecast by adopting new forecasting tools.
“Lack of investment in the electricity sector and shortcomings in electricity supply thus has been a direct result of non adherence to any of the LCLTGEP’s proposals over the years,”the Regulator stated.
