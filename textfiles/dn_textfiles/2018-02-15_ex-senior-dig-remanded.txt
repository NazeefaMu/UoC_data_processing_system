LASANTHA WICKREMATUNGE MURDER CASE:
Ex-senior DIG remanded

Retired Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on Tuesday, for allegedly concealing evidence in the murder of former Sunday Leader Chief Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
Nanayakkara was the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at the time of Wickrematunge’s murder with Mount Lavinia coming under his jurisdiction.
He was produced before the Mount Lavinia Magistrate yesterday and remanded till February 16.
A CID source told the Daily News that the former DIG was arrested around 10.30 pm on Tuesday from his home at Fairfield Gardens. He is facing charges of aiding and abetting in destroying vital evidence in the Lasantha Wickrematunge killing.
Wickramatunge, was murdered on January 8, 2009 in Attidiya, Ratmalana, while on his way to the office.
Several high-ranking police officers and army intelligence officers have been arrested in connection with the murder including the former Crimes OIC of Mount Lavinia Police who was remanded on February 2 on allegations of having concealed vital information on the murder on the directions of senior officers. The case against the former Crimes OIC of Mount Lavinia Police is to be taken up on February 16.
“The Police field note book was found and according to that, the former DIG had instructed the Crimes OIC to refrain from continuing with the investigations. Certain pages of the note book had been removed and replaced. This information was found only after the CID took over the investigations two years ago. The investigations into the killing had commenced nine years ago but no progress was made as these high ranking police officers were trying to conceal evidence and preventing the investigations from moving forward. All these parties had banded together to sweep the investigations under the carpet.This former DIG had acted upon the instructions of the former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne,” the CID source said.
