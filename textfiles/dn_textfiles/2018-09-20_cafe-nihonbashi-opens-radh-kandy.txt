special. We have been looking at Kandy for the last 20 years and now Kandy has reached its potential, tourism numbers have risen and most importantly we have found great partners in Afzal and his son and their beautiful property – The Radh. Café Nihonbashi strives to serve simple but great Japanese cuisine for the discerning Kandy resident and visiting tourists of all countries.”
The newest entrant in the country’s ever expanding hospitality industry, The Radh, is a four star property owned and managed by Icon Hotels. With an unparalleled location in the heart of the city, the boutique hotel is just walking distance away from the Sri Dalada Maligawa.

‘The Radh’ refers to Royalty in Kandyan history and is derived from the Sinhala word ‘Radala’. As such, it is no surprise that Architect Nandika Denipitiya was inspired to a great extent by traditional Kandyan design motifs. This tribute to the heritage and cultural majesty of the ancient kingdom is manifest in unique artistic nuances throughout the hotel.Chairman Icon Hotels Afzal Marikar said “The Radh is the fulfillment of a long treasured dream. Kandy is the heart of this country. Our ancient hill capital has so much to offer visitors, and The Radh is a tribute to the grandeur of the past and the continuing wonder of the present.
I am proud to say that every effort has been made to preserve the cultural identity of our surroundings, and to bring that unique atmosphere within the walls of the property. This partnership with Nihonbashi is something I am extremely delighted with, since The Radh is now able to offer not just our guests, but everyone in Kandy, a chance to experience Dharshan’s famous cuisine”
