Vinyl Wednesday back at The Sooriya Village

The Sooriya Village is delighted to bring back Vinyl Wednesday, featuring veteran DJ, Tareeq Musafer on October 25, 7 pm. An evening of Soulful Jazz, Funk, Nostalgic 90s and Disco grooves played off the spinning discs from back in the day later into the night in an ambience set for relaxation, unwinding and perhaps a little toe tapping is what we are in for!
Vinyl Wednesday is dedicated to playing music only through phonographic turntables using original vinyl records. The idea is to bring together like minded people who appreciate all things retro, original and artistic. The music revolves around the driving beats of funk and soul classics with a few related jazz, old school hip-hop, disco and electro tunes thrown in for good measure. Whether you feel like lounging in a beanbag with a Bibidi Bobidi or enjoying a chilled beer or a glass of wine with a choice of delectable cuisine curated by Chef Koluu, Vinyl Wednesday is an event as rare in Colombo as the tunes its DJ is spinning.
