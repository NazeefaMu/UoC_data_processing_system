Sri Lanka off to winning start – beat Oman comprehensively

Sri Lanka Under 23 piled up a massive 324-5 courtesy half centuries from Avishka Fernando, Hasitha Boyagoda, Kamindu Mendis and Shammu Ashan to beat Oman Under 23 by 109 runs in the opening match of the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup played at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
In reply to Sri Lanka’s imposing score, Oman could reply with only 215-8.
Openers Sadun Weerakkody and Avishka Fernando gave Sri Lanka a solid platform to build their total with a stand of 81 off 75 balls. Fernando went onto score 56 off 54 balls inclusive of 9 fours while Weerakkody was dismissed for 29.
The Lankan innings was further boosted by a 102-run stand off 90 balls between Boyagoda and Mendis. Boyagoda batting with composure went onto top score with 80 off 94 balls (6 fours, 1 six) and Mendis scoring freely hit 75 off 62 balls (6 fours, 1 six).
Oman were further frustrated by a fifth wicket stand of 68 off 46 balls between Mendis and Shammu Ashan who hit an aggressive 55 not out off 34 balls inclusive of 3 sixes and 3 fours.
