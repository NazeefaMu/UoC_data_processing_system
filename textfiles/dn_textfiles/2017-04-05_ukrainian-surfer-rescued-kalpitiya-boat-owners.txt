Ukrainian surfer rescued by Kalpitiya boat owners

A Ukrainian who fell into difficulties while wind surfing in the deep sea off Kalpitiya was saved from drowning by a team led by Kalpitiya Tourist Boat Owners' Society's Madhuraj Fernando who was returning after a deep sea whale watching exercise on April 3 afternoon.
People who were returning after whale watching had seen a person wind-surfing being catapulted sky-high with their surf board and drop into the sea, struggling to disengage himself from the ropes entangling him. They had made a bee line at the spot and pulled him out and brought him to the shore.
Communicating with him had been difficult as he could not speak English. However, they had dropped him at the hotel he had been staying.
