Cabinet reshuffle portends a new direction: Ravi

The cabinet reshuffle built up the atmosphere to lead the country on a new direction and to create a new Sri Lanka, Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The newly appointed Foreign Affairs Minister assumed official duties at the Foreign Ministry premises yesterday, following multi religious observances.
Making his maiden speech as the new Foreign Affairs Minister, Karunanayake said that foreign affairs would be conducted in a manner which will safeguard the country as a whole and its sovereignty.
He said the Government would focus on developing the country through investments rather than financing the development strategies of the country through debts.
The Minister said; “Organising strikes and riots cannot be pointed out as solutions to conflicts. Instead every citizen must contribute their time and effort to create a country free from racism and religious tensions.” He also said that the Foreign Affairs Ministry would execute its duties impartially following ‘Friends for all – Enemies with none’ policy. The Secretary to the Foreign Affairs Ministry Esala Weerakoon said that the Foreign Affairs Ministry played its role efficiently and effectively for the past two and a half years to take the country’s unique reputation to the international level and it would continue to do so.
Weerakoon further said that the need to strengthen the efforts to develop the country had arisen in line with satisfying the expectations of the general public and that the Foreign Ministry would contribute immensely to achieve the set targets efficiently and effectively under the leadership of the Foreign Affairs Minister.
