Over 600 Ayurvedic doctors recruited to state service

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has handed over appointment letters to 650 Ayurvedic doctors recently, Health Minister spokesman said.
Cabinet papers had been presented since 2002 to recruit Ayurvedic doctors but approvals have been given to recruit only 25 Ayurvedic doctors in each year since 2002, he said. Under the Good Governance Government, 107 Ayurvedic doctors were recruited in 2016 and another 650 last week. The newly appointed were recruited to the Primary Grade of the Ayurvedic Department. Minister Senaratne held discussions with organisations of Ayurvedic students and doctors before submitting the Cabinet paper in February 28, 2015. Approval was granted for the Cabinet paper on May 27, 2015, he said.
After handing over appointments, Minister Senaratne stated that the UNP Government established the Indigenous Medicine Ministry and gave due recognition to Ayurvedic doctors and treatment. The Government has taken many steps to upgrade Ayurvedic sector, the Minister said.
