Mini chess garden

The MicroPlanter Chess Set is an adorable 3D printed vegetal chess game set, in which miniature planters replace the traditional pieces of the game, allowing you to customize your chess set with the plants of your choice. This is a beautiful concept created by designers of XYZ Worshop, who offer you to download for free the design to 3D print it by yourself.
