How one rash decision helped another nation

What a moving but sad moment it was to see England head coach Trevor Bayliss congratulating his vis-à-vis from Bangladesh Sri Lanka’s Chandika Hathurusingha after Bangladesh had defeated England in a Test match for the first time in their history at Mirpur on Sunday.
Hathurusingha, the former Sri Lanka cricketer could easily have been serving his country as head coach instead of offering his services to another country but for some foolhardy decision making by the former interim cricket administration headed by Somachandra de Silva. It was De Silva’s decision to banish Hathurusingha from Sri Lanka on disciplinary grounds over a trivial issue that could have been sorted out amicably that saw him leave the country and made him hot property for other nations. At the time De Silva appointed by the hierarchy of the former government was all too powerful and did things his own way. The result was that Sri Lanka lost a coach who could have done wonders to his country.
Hathurusingha at the time when he was sent packing was shadow coach of the Sri Lanka team to Bayliss. He was being groomed under the Australian to take over as his successor. Hathurusingha had worked his way up the ladder of coaching by being a successful coach with the Sri Lanka A team where he had helped identify the talents of Angelo Mathews, Suranga Lakmal and Tharanga Paranavithana as potential Sri Lanka cricketers after an ‘A’ tour to South Africa in 2008. All three of them went onto play for Sri Lanka with distinction. Hathurusingha also helped many cricketers individually to be successful in their careers none so than Thilan Samaraweera, who is currently the batting coach of the Bangladesh team. Hathurusingha helped Samaraweera come out of a batting slump in 2006 and made him a far more aggressive batsman than he was.
Recently at a press conference in Mirpur, Samaraweera was full of praise for his former mentor and spoke glowingly of both his personal impact on his career and his ability as a coach.
"I divide my career into two. First, it is from 2001 to 2006 when I was dropped. I became a totally different player when I met Chandika.I know what he is capable of and I would love to work with him. He gave me the freedom to express myself. He focused on the technique and mindset, the key to international cricket. I became a totally different cricketer. I think my average was close to between 50 or 60," recalled Samaraweera.
Talking of the change Hathurusingha has brought into the Bangladesh dressing room, Samaraweera said, “I think the freedom that the coaching staff led by Chandi gave to the Bangladesh players made them believe they could fight against the top teams.
“You can see in the last 18 months they beat Pakistan, India and South Africa and they also did well in the World Cup in different conditions. More freedom, belief and support from senior to younger players are what a team requires. I think more about the mental toughness, and I can see how much they have changed over the last 18 months in terms of the technical aspects.”
Such was Hathurusingha’s affect as coach with the Lankan team that when he was disciplined by the De Silva administration, Kumar Sangakkara who was the national captain at the time wrote a letter personally on behalf of the team explaining the importance of Hathurusingha’s presence in the dressing room ahead of the 2011 World Cup. However Sangakkara’s polite request fell on deaf ears.
Shunned by Sri Lanka, Hathurusingha went off to Australia with his family and made a name for himself as coach becoming head coach of New South Wales and later assistant coach of the Australia ‘A’ team before Bangladesh grabbed him and appointed him as their head coach in June 2014 replacing Shane Jurgensen.
From there on it has been a roller-coaster ride for Bangladesh cricket reaching dizzy heights never achieved before in their chequered cricket history.
They came agonizingly close to beating England in the first Test at Chittagong which they lost by 22 runs and were heading towards a similar defeat at tea on the third day of the second Test at Dhaka when England chasing 273 to win were 100 for no loss at tea. But some harsh words from Hathurusingha during the break saw a totally different Bangladesh side taking the field. Within a matter of one session they had changed the complexion of the game by consuming all ten England wickets to script out a famous victory in their 16-year history as a Test nation.
With Hathurusingha as the guiding light this certainly won’t be their last win but the start of many. Bangladesh has shown the world that they are no mere pushovers and that they deserve more than just the odd Test series. They have proved a potent force in ODIs and now they have extended it to the Test circuit. Take a bow Mr Hathurusingha.
