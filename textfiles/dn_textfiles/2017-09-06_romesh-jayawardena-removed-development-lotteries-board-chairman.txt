Romesh Jayawardena removed as Development Lotteries Board Chairman

 
The Chairman of the Development Lotteries Board, Romesh Jayawardena has been removed by the Minister of Finance.
Finance Minister, Mangala Samaraweera through the Extraordinary Gazette Notice No. 2035/2 issued on 31 August and published on Monday exercised his powers vested in Section 5 of the Development Lotteries Board Act, No. 20 of 1997 to remove Jayawardena from his post.
Jayawardena who is also the brother-in-law of the former Foreign Minister, Ravi Karunanayake, was appointed to office in 2015.
The Development and National Lotteries Boards have undergone many changes this year with it being gazette to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier this year and then re-gazetted back to the Ministry of Finance once Minister Tilak Marapana took over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs left vacant by Karunanayake in August.
