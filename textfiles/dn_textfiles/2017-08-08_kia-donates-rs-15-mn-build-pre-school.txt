Kia donates Rs 15 mn to build pre-school

Children of the Dikkowita area in Hendala have received a new purpose-built pre-school thanks to the generosity of a group of Korean students and funding support from Korean car maker Kia.
The group of 100 Korean students engaged in the project under the ‘Happy Move Global Youth Programme,’ a worldwide CSR initiative conceptualised and financially supported by Kia Motors.
The Korean volunteers were joined by three Sri Lankan college students to help build the2,112 square foot preschool comprising of five rooms of 422 square feet each. Kia Motors donated Rs 15 million (US$ 100,000) towards the construction.
In addition, Kia also provided airfare, accommodation and logistics for the 100 Korean student volunteers that participated in the construction of the floor and walls of the building, helping move cement, sand, rocks and bricks.
The studentsalso contributed towards the community by getting involved with the neighbourhood children through painting, making toys and playing games.
Besidesfacilitating the education of young children, the new preschool will also serve a centre for after-school programmes such as the teaching of English, painting and music.
The centre is to be managed Korea Food for the Hungry International (KFHI) and is intended to benefit underprivileged families of the neighbourhood. The preschool and the afterschool programmes will initially educate a total of 80 students, but the KFHI will work to increase the number of beneficiaries thereafter.
Speaking at the handing over ceremony of the preschool, graced by representatives from Kia Motors Korea and Sri Lanka, the Managing Director of Kia Motors (Lanka) Mahen Thambiah said:“Including Sri Lanka in the Happy Move Global Youth Programmethis is year is very encouraging and epitomises our social responsibility beyond building environment-friendly vehicles.”
The summer of 2017 marked the 19thedition of the Happy Move Global Youth Programme.Korean student volunteers travelled to Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam and Cambodia under the programme this year to participate in community projects.
