2017 a decisive year... what next for 2018 ?

Creating a shared future in a fractured world would be the goal of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2018. In the last 12 months the global context has changed dramatically after Donald Trump became President of the United States.
Many political issues have re-emerged on multiple fronts with wide-ranging political, economic and social consequences. Russia-USA tensions are no longer just a relic of the Cold War. Economic prosperity and social cohesion are not one and the same. The UN can no longer protect world unity or heal itself.
Politically, new and divisive narratives are transforming governance. Economically, policies are being formulated to preserve the benefits of global integration while limiting shared obligations such as sustainable development, inclusive growth and managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Globally, citizens yearn for responsive leadership; yet, a collective purpose remains elusive despite ever-expanding social and political networks. All the while, the social contract between states, religious institutions and their citizens continues to erode. Therefore religious leaders are looking to re-dedicate leaders from all walks of life to develop a shared narrative to improve the state of the world.
Given Donald Trump's 'belligerent' approach to North Korea, the risks posed to the global economy should not be ignored. High asset prices, rapid credit growth in China, political turmoil in Catalonia and a cliff-edge Brexit are key risks to an improving global outlook.
The IMF has also said the global economy’s recent recovery may not last, despite a pickup in activity in all Western countries, except the UK. Therefore for many emerging markets, 2018 would be a very decisive year. For Sri Lanka, given the tough overseas economic outlook and the huge debt portfolio it is a either saga of gloom or bloom, but from a more realistic view for Sri Lanka, it could be a balance of the two. What happens inside Sri Lanka between now and June will really determine the future direction of Sri Lanka for the next five years.
2018 Outlook
Sri Lanka in 2018 needs to arrest the trend of lower foreign investment, slow growth in manufacturing, declining exports, a large trade deficit, balance of payments difficulties and low foreign exchange reserves. We will be compelled to borrow from foreign sources to repay our foreign debt obligations. According to banking sources, interest rates are expected to largely remain at current levels; a corresponding drop in demand for credit in the private sector is therefore expected.
In addition to the challenges for the financial sector, the slowdown in credit activity for construction is expected and with Sri Lanka poised to become a regional and an international services hub, there would be new opportunities for public-private partnerships.
A continued high-interest environment may also spark a rise in bad debt, with an increase in risk in commercial real estate financing and consumer housing loans. We would certainly see new life and general buoyancy in capital markets if the regulators can get the right balance.
Sri Lanka's annual growth pace is expected to pick up from the previous year, boosted by services, stronger manufacturing activity, agricultural growth and a pickup in domestic demand. However, like other South Asian countries, Sri Lanka too is vulnerable to political developments in the Middle East, given the reliance of South Asia on imported crude oil and employment.
Private Sector
As Sri Lankan enterprises improve their governance structures, risk and compliance policies and practices, they will be better positioned to seek alternative sources of funding overseas. Easier access to capital abroad will increase competitive pressure in the domestic banking sector.
Furthermore, in light of the move to create an enabling environment for business to create larger and stronger institutions that are well capitalized, with strong regional presence, the private sector would derive scale benefits with regard to operational cost and also be able to participate in large projects to a greater degree than now.
Challenge for Sri Lanka

The big political challenge for Sri Lanka in 2018 is when Sri Lanka returns to Geneva to answer for 'collateral damage' which unfortunately is the futile aspect of war.
The other big challenge Sri Lanka is faced is the significant revenue shortfalls. However, with all the cards in his hand, President and also the Prime Minister, together should not let lesser ideals stop Sri Lanka becoming the great new entrepot centre of the Asia Pacific in its own right with many Western nations now standing steadfastly on our side.
Moreover, given Chinese involvement in the Hambantota Port and industrial park and India taking over the Mattala airport, one of the biggest concerns for the world economy is that the Chinese Bubble has begun to pop.
The Chinese economy that grew by an extraordinary amount over the past few decades is slowing down; it is only a matter of time before China starts tightening its belt for Overseas Development Aid (ODA).
Therefore, if the Chinese economy looks inward, the troubles persist in Europe and if Trump decides to strike, it is very likely to drag the rest of the world down. In addition, turmoil in the Middle East could adversely affect many developing countries who depend on worker remittances.
So countries like Sri Lanka would need to look elsewhere for low cost capital to fund their mega infrastructure development projects and to export.
Therefore all stakeholders must get together at the start of the year, to ensure targeted structural reforms are in place to attract foreign direct investment and expand the economy’s capacity to absorb new technology. And certainly export manufacturing can re-shape the economy in 2018.
On the other hand, globally economists expect credit conditions to improve in 2018 as economic growth picks up and low interest rates keep funding costs under control. Risks to this favorable outlook include property market adjustment and continued political and geopolitical uncertainty.
In addition, a number of other challenges loom, including disruptions from new technology, population aging and climate change.
