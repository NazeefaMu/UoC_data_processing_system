Unmatchable!

In a fiercely competitive industry, Misty has held its own grounds. With so many young and talented bands entering the music industry, Misty is still sought after because of its find blend of unmatchable experience and talent. Daily News speaks to Misty band leader Rajitha Rupasinghe on his competent outfit.
“Where the band members are concerned, we work as a team. But every band has its differences. But as a band leader, it is how you put them together and how you gel with them and move forward. I am very lucky. I have band members who have been performing with me for the past 15 years,” said Rupasinghe
The secret is in how you recognize them. Even their attitudes and behavior matters a lot. It is very easy to break a band. It is difficult to make a band.
“I always listen to my band members and I seek their views and I make sure I guide them. When it comes to success it is all about working hard and taking challenges positively. Every challenge has to be taken in a positive manner and to move forward. We always want to satisfy our audience and we have done that over the last 15 years as a fully-fledged band.
Patience and tolerance are so important within a band. You need to have absolute patience and sometimes you have to tolerate a lot. Over the last five years, in the industry the competition is very high now and very competitive. Credit goes to all these bands who are driving themselves and working hard. So it is difficult to cope up with young talent, and you have to have a lot of patience and understanding. You need that drive to carry you forward and sustain your work,” explained Rupasinghe
Rajitha’s humble beginnings began in 1997 as Misty.
“I started my musical career in 1994 as a Duo. So it all came together in 1997, when I got an offer from the Maldives to play at a resort in one of its many islands. I was looking for a break to start things on my own. And I thought this was the ideal platform for me to go abroad and gain some momentum for my career and receive exposure. So I took off to the Maldives in 1997. I was there for nearly two years.
I decided then to come back, because there I found that there is nothing much you can do since you get stagnated in one resort. So I came back in 1999 to Colombo. I could not fit into the Colombo Circuit straight away. So then I moved to Down South. ‘Robinson club’ is a club I used to play for predominantly Germans. So I was performing at ‘Robinson Club’ for about six to eight months.
Then I slowly worked my way into Colombo. So Misty was operating as a duo, then a trio and at the latter part as a quartet, before I formed a fully- fledged band in 2002. So that was my turning point -I gained popularity in the pub and club. These were places like Galadari, JAIC Hilton, Clancy’s were places where my career really benefited from,” pointed out Rupasinghe

The journey to success was not easy for Rupasinghe and his band.
“People came to listen to us and repetitively came to see us. But I must specifically mention Derek Wickramanayake leader of Wildfire. That was an awesome band and they turned the tables for live bands after 2000. Wildfire really set the benchmark for people like us to come up. Derek identified my talent and personally came and told me to form a band! He inspired me and I still thank him for that,” added Rupasinghe
The industry is very demanding now, because there are a lot of very talented bands out there now.
“Those days there were Gypsies, Wildfire and Ultimate. Those were the bands that were riding high then. Those were the bands that I looked into. It was not easy for me because it is definitely a challenge transforming your duo to a fully-fledged band. The work and looking for suitable members all fell into place, but it was no easy task,” pointed out Rupasinghe.
As mentioned above the strength of Rupasinghe’s band lies mainly with their experience.
“My band members – Dennis (on drums) and he is my most senior member and has been with me for the past 15 years now. Then there is Sanjeewa, he used to play with bands like Cosmic Rays. One of the most renowned members I have is Udaya. He is a veteran and an experienced musician. He has been in Switzerland and Germany before he came and played for Aquarius. He is founder member of Apple Green and a member of Friends. In the early 90’s Friends was one of the best beat bands here. Now he has been with me for nearly ten years. Then there is Sudath on guitar. Sudath played with Ultimate. And my female vocalist is Melina,” elucidated Rupasinghe.
The challenge was to form a band at that time. But due to the country’s situation and where the entertainment industry was at that time, Rupasinghe thought it was risky to form a band straight away.
“That is why I started out as a duo. But thanks to people like Derek Wickramanayake and later on Imran of Funtime who recognized my talent things moved in favorable direction.
I feel when you are a professional musician you need to have originality, you have to have your own music. Originality is good, but nowadays I feel that whatever you produce has to be rich musically and lyrically, also it has to be rich. If you are thinking of producing your own music, you need to think of these factors. The music you make should have lyrical and musical value and it should give a message to the public. I personally feel that whatever is in your mind and if you think it is something that the public would want to listen to, you should put it out. Because it is nice to be creative and relevant for that matter. For example, what is happening in our country and in the world today,” explained Rupasinghe
Versatility is also a feature when you take into account the many personalities of the band.
“We are a very versatile band. We cater to a wider audience. So I do not want to label myself. We play from Jazz to Country and to Pop Rock, which we love the most. I personally like lots of 70’s and 80’s music and the modern day R&B and Hip Hop.
Sunil Perera has inspired me a lot. I listened to his music as a kid. When music is concerned the first thing that comes to my mind is the Gypsies. To being a musician and to becoming who I am - Sunil Perera played a big role,” stated Rupasinghe.
The band believes in what they do best and that is music.
“And we do this to the best of our ability. We believe in our strengths and each one of us are unique. I have a lot of talent in this group of mine. They are dedicated. We have been blessed as a touring band. We are one of the most toured bands in this country.
We have been to USA for the past 11 years and we have been to Australia for the past 12 years. And we have traveled to other parts of the world. From Japan to New Zealand, Canada to the Mediterranean. To Europe and to Asia and Asia Pacific and the Middle East. We are fortunate to travel frequently to all parts of the world,” shared Rupasinghe.
The band has its biggest fan base in Australia. “We enjoy everywhere we go. The demand in Melbourne is really big. For me the most memorable concert is the one celebrating 10 years.
That was in 2012 and that was one heck of a concert! It was at Water’s Edge.
That was sold out in 10 days. That was our Anniversary concert,” summed up Rupasinghe.
