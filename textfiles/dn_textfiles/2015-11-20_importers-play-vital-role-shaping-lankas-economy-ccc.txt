Importers play vital role in shaping Lanka's economy - CCC

Sri Lankan importers currently face numerous challenges and the Government should identify them immediately and focus more attention towards solving them, Ceylon Chamber Of Commerce (CCC) , Import Section, Chairman Dinesh De Siva said.
Chairman De Silva made these comments at a media forum held at the CCC Auditorium.
Speaking further De Silva said the CCC, the country's largest grouping of local importers marks its 80 th anniversary and since the formation of the Association it worked tirelessly to help the national economy grow, while looking after the interest of local importers.
He said the Associations' work came to a standstill and it did not function until 1928. The Association was reestablished on December 1928.
"The Import Section plays a vital role in shaping Sri Lankan economy by promoting, coordinating and supporting the interest of the local import trade," He said it is the duty of officials to look into the problems faced by local importers and rectify them immediately before the main importers get discouraged which will affect the country's economy.
Quoting examples De Silva said although the price of imported drugs are controlled and they cannot be sold beyond the controlled price, the countries from where these drugs are brought time to time change the cost of the prices and as a result local drug importers face untold hardships. This situation must be looked into by authorities.
He also made similar comments on imported cosmetic items too.
He said "Our country still has an import dependent economy and it is the duty of authorities to focus attention towards increasing exports in order to swell the country's economy. It is sad to say that our imports from India is higher than our exports to that country,"
"Although we have forwarded the problems faced by our importers to authorities the relevant Government institutions do not take firm actions in a proper manner"
He said the Import section has taken several initiatives with the support of the successful governments to ensure that the best interest of importers are met and this will be its prime objective in future.
"The import section of the CCC plays a critical role in the continuous advancement of the import sector of the country.. It initiates action to identify future trends, he said.
Sanjeev Samaranayaka said "We maintain an excellent rapport with the state sector and provides a platform for its members to project issues affecting their trade.
He said the Import Section functions as a facilitator and a link between the members and the government sector.
"Considering the yeoman service rendered to the import trade, the Committee has thought to commemorate this historic occasion in an appropriate manner by conducting the 80 th Anniversary celebratins on November 22,"
A number of Senior CCC officials including, CCC, Chief economist, Anuska Wijesinha, CCC, Import Section Past Chairman Kevin Edwards, CCC, Import Section, Committee Member Sanjeeva Samaranayaka were also present.
