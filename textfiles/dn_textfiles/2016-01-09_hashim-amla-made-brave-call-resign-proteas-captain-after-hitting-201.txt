Hashim Amla made a brave call to resign as Proteas captain after hitting 201

Usually it's the England captain who resigns during a series with South Africa... not the other way around!
Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and I all stepped down after Tests against the Proteas, and I think Hashim Amla's decision to do the same has come as a surprise to us all.
But there are three things you have to consider when you're in that position. First, is it doing you any good as a person? Second, how is it affecting your batting? And most importantly, would your team be better off if you stood down?
Those were the questions I wrestled with in 2003 before I resigned as England captain.
It wasn't doing me any good - either as a person or a player - and I felt I had taken the team as far as I could. I had absolutely nothing left in the tank.
I also knew that Michael Vaughan, who was one-day captain at the time, would take them on and the team would be in a better place for it.
They needed a leader with energy and plenty to prove, not an angry old captain. I'd shouted at them for long enough!
People might be wondering why Amla resigned now, straight after making a double hundred, but he might well have made his mind up after defeat in Durban.
They had lost four of their last five Tests, he couldn't buy a run and he was getting slated in the media. He probably wanted to quit on the spot, but with just two days in between the two Tests he possibly felt it wouldn't leave enough time to appoint a new captain.
I think it was actually quite brave of him to go now after doing so well with the bat at Newlands and almost pulling off a remarkable victory. He could have thought to himself: 'Actually, this isn't so bad! I might just stick it out for a bit longer.'
But I think Amla realised captaincy just wasn't for him - it didn't sit comfortably on his shoulders.
People say it wasn't something he ever actively sought and he wasn't a natural leader.
So if he isn't contributing much as captain, why not give someone else a go and let Amla concentrate on his batting?
In fact, his impressive showing with the bat in this match might owe something to the fact that he knew he was about to resign, as if a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
It's certainly not a decision you take lightly, though.
It's hard to take in when you wake up the next morning and you are no longer captain of your country.
But you've got to do what's best for your team. Taking South Africa into a new era will require a lot of energy.
It will be a rollercoaster ride for AB de Villiers, or whoever takes over in the long term, and be a lot more draining than being the captain of a great side.
Quitting during a series is a bigger decision to make than waiting until the end of one. You feel like you are turning your back on your team-mates and jumping ship, but when you know you are done you are actually letting them down by carrying on. In many respects, this reflects well on Alastair Cook and his decision to fight for the captaincy when England were struggling. He was copping most of the blame and the burden of leadership was affecting his batting. He could have walked away after his side were whitewashed in the 2013-14 Ashes, but he found the energy and strength of character to stay on and prove everyone wrong.
People often ask me whether I could have done the job for one Test longer and I say no, not one day longer, not to the standard I had set myself. This is something Amla will ask himself in the years to come.
But for now, Hashim Amla is a popular person in South Africa and around the world. Johannesburg is sure to give him the rousing ovation he deserves. - Daily Mail
PROTEAS' CURSE ON ENGLAND CAPTAINS BROKEN
England's last three long-serving Test captain's have been brought unstuck by South Africa, with their final Tests in charge coming after series against the Proteas during Graeme Smith run as skipper. Amla's departure appears to break the pattern.
Nasser Hussain: Stepped down as England captain after drawn 2-2 series at home to the Proteas in 2003.
Michael Vaughan: Quit as captain after two Test defeats and a draw at home against the Proteas in 2008. He missed the fourth Test, which England won.
Andrew Strauss: Quit after losing three-Test series at home 2-0 against the country of his birth in 2012.
