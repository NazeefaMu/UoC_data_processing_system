Avengers: Infinity War
Superhero overdose !

Superhero fans were in for a treat as Marvel unspooled 2012’s ‘Avengers’. The success of the Joss Whedon direction spawned 2015’s ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ and 2018’s ‘Avengers: Infinity War’.
The latest movie is a bigger and more ambitious project. However as the saying goes that too many cooks spoils the broth, too many superheroes, action, plots and cinematic features inserted into one production causes a lot of confusion.
Two parallel plots drive ‘Avengers: Infinity War’. These two plots are destined to collide by destiny itself. Thanos, the Mad Titan, on a quest to unite the six Infinity Stones, which, when embedded in the Infinity Gauntlet, gives the owner the power to kill half the universe with a snap of his fingers.
Like almost all the other Marvel villains Thanos too believes that he is bestowing kindness on living beings by wiping out every ‘weak’ race from the universe. Thor is the first avenger to enter the picture as he encounters Thanos’ plan abroad his ship with Loki. He escapes from his enemy to be rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy. They team up to find a way to stop Thanos. Meanwhile another team – Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spiderman – go after Thanos after being warned by his arrival by Bruce Banner, and a couple of Thanos’ henchmen.
A third party is at work in Wakanda as Steve Rogers brings together the Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, Bucky and T’Challa. Their task is to defend Vision who is in possession of the Mind Stone, the last piece of the puzzle that Thanos wants to get his hands on.
Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ should be commended for its special effects. The details of the characters are finely brought out in the visuals so that they seem larger than life to the viewers. The biggest drawback is probably in packing too much details, characters and incidents into one movie. This not only causes misunderstandings but also flows along at a lazy pace with many loopholes.
The biggest strength of the movie is the characteristics developed by the previous Marvel movies. Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther, Black Widow, Captain America, The Hulk, The Guardians of the Galaxy etc have become some of the most well loved characters in the Hollywood scene by now. Therefore they have a great fan following. Marvel enthusiasts flock to theaters to catch even a few seconds glimpse of their favourites when they have been included in a production.
