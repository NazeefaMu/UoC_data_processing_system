Sarana Gunawardena further remanded till Nov. 27

Former Petroleum Industries Deputy Minister and former Chairman of Development Lotteries Board (DLB) Sarana Gunawardena was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till November 27 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
This is for the alleged misuse of a state vehicle valued over Rs.8 million, while he was serving as the Development Lotteries Board Chairman during the previous regime.
The Court had refused to grant bail on the suspects citing there is no exceptional circumstances to release him on bail.
The former Deputy Minister was arrested by Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) over offences he is alleged to have committed under the Public Property Act. The CCD alleged that former Deputy Minister Gunawardena had continued to serve in the tender board of the DLB contrary to the Lottery Board Act even after being elected to Parliament in 2008 and being appointed as a deputy minister.
Police further alleged that the suspect had imported this luxury vehicle, valued at over Rs.8 million and authorities are yet to trace the vehicle’s whereabouts.
