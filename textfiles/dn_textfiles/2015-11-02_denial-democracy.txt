Denial of Democracy

In a democracy, the representation of the people is the foremost duty of parliamentarians. In the last few decades or so did they perform their primary function satisfactorily or live up to the expectations of the citizens? Their performance has been unethical, disgraceful, un-parliamentary, and disorderly. They did bring in immense shame and disrepute to the august Assembly.
The Parliament therefore in order to ensure orderly business of the house, need to upgrade its quality of performance as a matter of priority. In keeping with the past practices and procedures of our own and the Mother Parliament – British House of Commons, we need to take necessary steps (very firmly) to apply and enforce the guidelines, rules, regulations and even precedents and traditions, both written and unwritten, without delay. It is the Speaker’s duty, proficiently assisted by the Secretary-General of Parliament, to interpret Standing Orders, impartially to maintain order and decorum in the Supreme Legislature.
The latest unruly incident that took place in Parliament was when the old-timer parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena, former Chief Government Whip, ran away with the Mace causing pandemonium. This was supported by many others including a party leader. The Mace is the symbol of authority of the Parliament and the Speaker, which is placed on the Table by the Sergeant-at-Arms before the Sittings of Parliament begins each day.
National goals
The Speaker depends mostly on numerous sources to arrive at good decisions. Erskine May was the Clerk of the House of Commons, between the period, 1871 to 1886, who wrote – “Treatise on the Law, privileges, Proceeding and Usage of Parliament. This is considered to be the most authoritative source on parliamentary, practice and procedure, widely referred to and used in the Commonwealth Parliaments. This book is also one which provides good guidance to our Speaker and the Secretary-General too to run our Parliament efficiently and effectively.
As I have observed, for a period well over thirty years, the Parliament has been traditionally a noisy place. In Sri Lankan context, the disruptions that occur almost daily in Parliament, may I say, is nothing other than “hooliganism”. It could be argued that they play “politics” - perhaps induced by the quest of a specific pre-determined role to achieve personal or group objectives in Parliament. It could be also said that these legislators had always chosen to pursue their personal and collective goals of their group selfishly by adopting strategies - that is prescriptions as to how they could most successfully invest their energies to maximize the likelihood of a preferred outcome – unquestionably not the national goals. How sad it is?
These disruptions no doubt had resulted in reducing the debating time drastically. I recall certain laws had been simply passed on several occasions without even a debate. This is a denial of democracy to the citizen. If so, do the citizenry need such a Parliament, an unbearable expenditure?
In fact, owing to these reasons, the Speaker must be advised to adopt a rehabilitated and more enlightened strategy immediately. Speaker could then recommence the proven age old practice and procedure of naming unruly MPs, which had sadly been discontinued. I would say we have no option at all but to revert to the classical English procedure in British Parliament.
If we do so, we could be heading again to a more open progressive parliamentary system (similar to pre 1970 period) encompassing a desire for a balanced governance, in order for the promotion of civic virtues, and the resistance to bad governance. Our parliamentarians do not seem to have matured democratically in the interest of the country and its people. They seem to be dragging the country to become a failed State highhandedly, if not properly check-mated using parliamentary oversight mechanism.
The Parliament being the legislative body consisting of elected representatives to pass laws and monitoring of performance of the executive authority, the role of the Speaker, strengthened by the Secretary-General indecisive.
Abusive un-parliamentary language
The Speaker must therefore search and investigate to find new and better avenues for taking the right decisions and to assist parliamentarians to improve and perform their onerous duties well, in the interest of the country and its people. It must not be forgotten the desired “change” must be made a reality – not a fantasy.
It is a must therefore for the present Speaker to be given appropriate guidance at this particular juncture. Speaker must be supported whole-heartedly with commitment and skill to pursue the right path. This is the responsibility of the Parliament Secretariat. In particular, the Secretary-General must now take up the total responsibility to focus Speaker’s direction to ensure an acceptable, people friendly, dignified, enlightened, effective and efficient role in Parliament for all the parliamentarians, whether they belong to the government or opposition.
The countrymen in the past experienced all types of serious eruptions in Parliament, due to which physical blows had been exchanged, a Buddhist priest physically manhandled, used abusive un-parliamentary language on the floor of the House and Parliamentarians staged a protest overnight - which no doubt was the first-of-the kind, which should not have been excused or tolerated at all.
The Speaker had most pragmatically pointed out that a sum of Rs.4.6 million is spent for a day to maintain Parliament. In other words, the Speaker urged all elected representatives to examine top issues under consideration, decide on policy and laws, and hold the government accountable for its actions, without unnecessarily wasting time and valuable resources in Parliament for unworthy squabbles.
There have been repeated instances in Parliament when the MPs disregarded the authority of the Speaker. The House is then suspended to resolve the relevant dispute in order to work out an amicable settlement in the Speaker’s Chambers. This practice began during the Speakership of former UNP past master Lokubandara. The genius preferred avoiding rough sea and sidestepped without using disciplinary powers vested in the Speaker in the Standing Orders.
This system needs to be totally disbanded because this has now become the order of the day for unruly parliamentarians. There has been days the Parliament had been suspended repeatedly, without adhering to the laid down and accepted practice and procedure in the House. The past practice should be re-introduced in the august Assembly at the earliest.
The usual procedure according to the Standing Orders is to name a member when he/she disregard the authority of the Chair and willfully obstruct the House by continuously refusing to comply with the Standing Orders. Under similar circumstances, the Speaker or the Chairperson says – (I name MP ….) and thereafter, the Leader of the House, the Chief Government Whip or a senior Minister present moves “that Mr. ……., MP., be suspended from the House, for which a division may be called for.
Role of the Speaker
In the past all MPs irrespective of their party affiliations supported similar moves by the Chair in order to maintain the dignity, decorum and prestige of the august Assembly. The role of the Speaker is so important and therefore the primary duty after an election is to elect a Speaker, who is also referred to as the “Presiding Officer” very often. The Speaker is the third citizen in the country. The Speaker is responsible to maintain the authority of the House and to protect its rights, privileges and the dignity of the Parliament.
It is the duty cast upon the Secretary-General who should essentially create necessary conditions to guide the Speaker on the right path so that personal preferences will not be allowed at the cost of the institutional procedure, in the Supreme Legislature.
However, this is achievable only if pursued appropriately, with commitment, sincerity, dedication and hard work by the Secretary-General and his Staff.
It reminds me of the Canadian Clerk of the House (Secretary-General), whom I had the opportunity to meet when I had the good fortune to go for an attachment to the Canadian Parliament for a training.
He was a painstakingly dedicated, committed and a colossus of a gentleman and told me that he leaves abroad only once a year.
He added that he had extensively travelled as a junior officer in Parliament. (The juniors are given minimum opportunities and the seniors fully exhaust these privileges in Sri Lanka!!) He wisecracked the Parliament Secretariat needs detailed supervision and good leadership on the part of the Secretary-General and added that he was fully satisfied with what the Secretariat has achieved under his leadership. The plight of Sri Lankan Parliament Secretariat is indeed a tale of woe.
I sincerely believe that we should admire and show gratitude always to the military for their commitment, their discipline, their dedication and the code of ethics they observed in fighting the war with the LTTE.
We had heroes in the three forces and police, without their enduring commitment and sacrifice, we could never have won the war in a country full of heavies who have only personal goals but not for the benefit of the people.
I have no doubt if the Speaker wishes to be successful - he primarily needs a competent Secretariat and a staff who are willing to develop a vision and good foresight in order to reach out that far-away end.
This is urgent. If not the present Speaker too, I repeat - would sink in a mighty ocean similar to most of his predecessors – a failure.
