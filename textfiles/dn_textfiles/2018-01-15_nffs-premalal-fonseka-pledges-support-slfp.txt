NFF's Premalal Fonseka pledges support to SLFP

Kalutara district National Freedom Front (NFF) Executive Committee member Premalal Fonseka met President Maithripala Sirisena on Saturday and extended his support, President’s media unit said.
Premalal Fonseka had met the President at the President’s official residence and commended his efforts to establish a clean political culture by eradicating corruption and fraud, and extended his support to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) at the upcoming local government elections.
Premalal Fonseka was an active member of the National Freedom Front and was among the few who initially obtained membership of the party in the Kaluthara district. Several senior members of the Wimal Weerawansa led NFF left the party in recent times to support the SLFP.
