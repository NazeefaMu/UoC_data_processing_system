Information and electronic technology has become the most important commercial tools worldwide at present, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Referring to the recent global cyber attack he said that attacks through weapons would be replaced by cyber attacks in the future, leading to create an atmosphere favourable for electronic wars.
The Minister also said that protection against cyber attacks should be further strengthened to protect the virtual world and advanced protection tools should be created.
Ranawaka further said that precautionary policies should be developed and the legal system should be strengthened to safeguard Sri Lanka against such cyber attacks.
