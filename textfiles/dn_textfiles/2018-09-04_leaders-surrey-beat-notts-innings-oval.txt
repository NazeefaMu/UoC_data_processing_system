Leaders Surrey  beat Notts  by an innings at The Oval

LONDON, Saturday: Division One leaders Surrey finished off Nottinghamshire just after lunch on the third day at The Oval to win by an innings and 125 runs to claim a seventh straight County Championship win.
Resuming on their overnight 83-2, things looked even bleaker for Notts when Morne Morkel removed Samit Patel and Billy Root in successive balls. And when opener Kraigg Brathwaite was sixth out for 60 it looked all over. Conor McKerr took 4-26 and Morkel 3-39 as Notts were all out for 149.
Surrey’s 23-point victory - their eighth in 10 Championship matches this season - strengthens their already dominant position at the top, now 55 points clear - prior to the finish of second-placed Somerset’s game with Yorkshire - with just four games left.
Reigning county champions Essex beat Hampshire by an innings and 52 runs to ease Division One relegation fears.
Australian Test paceman Peter Siddle took 5-48, while spinner Simon Harmer chipped in with 4-64. Hants, 17-2 overnight, made a bad start when Ian Holland played on before James Vince had his off stump extracted by Siddle, then Kyle Abbott was run out. From 63-5, they at least took the game well into the final session before being bowled out for 211.
Kent improved their hopes of promotion from Division Two as they beat Derbyshire by six wickets to climb above Sussex to second in the table. Derbyshire, 83-2 overnight, did not look like delaying Kent’s victory too long when they went to lunch on 167-6. But Harvey Hosein shared half-century stands with both Hardus Viljeon and Tony Palladino to reach a total of 270. That set Kent 109 to win in 28 overs and Zak Crawley’s 34 led them to 110-4 with more than eight overs to spare.
Somerset moved back to within 32 points of leaders Surrey as they beat Yorkshire to maintain their outside Championship Division One title hopes.
Jamie Overton and Lewis Gregory took four wickets each as Yorkshire, 8-2 overnight, were bowled out midway through the final session for 194. Kane Williamson (51) and Josh Shaw (41) rallied early in the day before late resistance from David Willey (34 n.o.). But Overton took the final two wickets to wrap up a 224-run victory.
Gloucestershire medium-pacer Ryan Higgins took four wickets for the second time in the match as they beat Leicestershire by 328 runs at Bristol. The visitors began the final day on 117-6 and were bowled out for 165 shortly before lunch.
Mark Cosgrove made 52, but was then caught behind down the leg-side off Higgins, who had match figures of 8-54. The game ended when Mohammad Abbas fell to 17-year-old Ben Charlesworth, his maiden first-class wicket.
