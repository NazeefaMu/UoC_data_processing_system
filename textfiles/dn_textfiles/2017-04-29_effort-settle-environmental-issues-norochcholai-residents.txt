Effort to settle environmental issues of Norochcholai residents

Public Utilities Commission initiative:
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) started discussions with the communities that raise concerns on the environment impact of the Norochcholai coal power plant in the North Western Province, a release issued by the PUUSL said.
An expert committee appointed by the Commission has started discussions with the communities, the release said.
The release adds: “A committee of experts appointed by the PUCSL in March 2016 to study the environmental impact that caused by the thermal power plants in Sri Lanka, the fisheries and farmer community, the representatives of the Ceylon Electricity Board, Central Environmental Authority, North Western Provincial Environmental Authority, Department of Coast Conservation and Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited discussed on the issue that the communities raised.
“The discussions came into light as the Supreme Court directed the PUCSL to take steps to regularise the environmental damage caused by the Norochcholei coal power plant. The direction was given with regard to the Fundamental Rights Application pending at the Supreme Court on the environmental impact of the power plant, which the PUCSL informed that it has commenced the process to reduce the damage caused by the fly ash as well as the remaining coal in that area.
“The Supreme Court said matters concerning the environmental damage caused, will be looked into by the PUCSL, which is the authority in law entitled to do so.
“The first meeting was held on April 5, 2017 and the representatives of various communities and institutions discussed the issues that the villagers voiced.
In the second meeting held on April 24, 2017, the villagers submitted their issues and concerns in writing to the Committee.
“The Lakvijaya Power Station, also known as the Norochcholai Power Station is the largest coal power station in Sri Lanka. The plant which has the capacity of 900 MW generates about 39 percent of Sri Lanka’s energy requirement.
“The need of establishing community based committees to work hand in hand with the Ceylon Electricity Board to resolve these types of issues that arise from time to time was also discussed parallel to the development of a regulatory mechanism to address issues in the short, medium and longer term basis.
The next meeting of the committee will be held on May 22, 2017.”
