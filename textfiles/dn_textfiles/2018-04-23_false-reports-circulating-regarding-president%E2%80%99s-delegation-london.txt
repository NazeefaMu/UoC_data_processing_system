False reports circulating regarding President’s delegation to London

 
False information are circulating regarding the official delegation accompanying President Maithripala Sirisena on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), the President's Media Division said. 
The President was accompanied by the President’s wife, the President’s official doctor, Minister Tilak Marapana and his wife, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Language Interpreter and two officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Apart from them, print and electronic media personnel of the President’s Media Division and journalists representing private  media institutions and few officers of President’s Security Division, who do not belong to the official delegation participated in this tour.
Despite that no person was included in the delegation under the expense of the Presidential Secretariat or attended the CHOGM or any meeting held simultaneously.
Reports stating that expenses inured by Minister of Industries and Trade Rishard Badurdeen and Minister of Finance Mangala Samaraweera or any other parties who attended the Business Forum were not met by the  Presidential Secretariat, the PMD added.
Thus, we reject certain media reports that alleged that more than hundred delegates accompanied the President in this tour.
