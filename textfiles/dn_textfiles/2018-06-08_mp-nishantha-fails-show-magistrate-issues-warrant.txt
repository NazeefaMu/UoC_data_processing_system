MP Nishantha fails to show up, Magistrate issues warrant

Chilaw Magistrate and District Judge Manjula Ratnayake yesterday issued a warrant to the Chilaw Police to arrest Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha and produce him in Court. The Magistrate and District Judge issued this order since Sanath Nishantha failed to appear in Court as ordered, when an abuse case no 93/458 was taken up for hearing yesterday.
However, Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha and his brother Arachchikattuwa Pradesheeya Sabha Chairman Jagath Samantha appeared in the Chilaw High Court yesterday morning in connection with another case involving them and since the High Court Judge was on leave, the case was postponed for August 24 by High Court Registrar Ajith Nihal Jayasinghe.
In this case, they are charged with having allegedly assaulting former Arachchikattuwa Divisional Secretary Dhanasena Surasinghe, obstructing his official duties, using criminal force and being members of an unlawful assembly.
Some attorneys who sought anonymity said, the Parliamentarian who appeared in the High Court yesterday, had caused insult to the Magistrates Court through his failure to appear in the Magistrates Court.
