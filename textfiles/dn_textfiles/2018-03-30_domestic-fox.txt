Domestic  fox!

It sounds like a tall tail - but this family really do keep a fox as a pet at home.
Mum-of-four Natalie Reynolds, 35, hand-reared her unusual pet Jasper after he was abandoned as a cub.
And now their bright eyed and bushy tailed companion lives happily alongside her young children, three dogs and a cat .
Natalie has defended her decision to keep Jasper as a pet - and told how she even walks it on a lead.
She admits the eight-month-old fox does have a tendency to nip strangers, but her son Chace, three, and daughter Marissa, five, delight in taking Jasper on their trampoline.
Natalie said: “They get such bad press but he’s around my children and he just plays with them. He’s got a different bond with me. He’s not so great with my partner.”
Natalie, who also has three dogs and a cat, added: “He’s like a cross between a cat and a dog. He’s part of the pack.
“The dogs chase him around, he loves the cat but the cat isn’t too fond of him. I always walk him on the lead - he’s so domesticated. A lot of people look down their noses at you. Some people are disgusted but most people are good about it. I’ve been told they are very versatile and that he could be released back into the wild but their average lifespan in the wild is just 18 months - they either get shot, poisoned, snared or hunted.”
Jasper was just two days old when he was abandoned by his mum and handed in at a veterinary surgery.
Natalie, whose friend works at the practice, was given the offer to raise the fox by hand. She said: “I was up every two hours in the night with him - it was like breastfeeding my children. The first week or two it was through the night, I would have to get up and feed him until it progressed to getting him downstairs and he was in a crate downstairs like a puppy would be.”
Stay at home mum Natalie, who lives in an affluent rural village in Herts., created an enclosure for Jasper in their garage. He runs free in the garden during the day - where he plays with the children - and goes out for family walks but is caged at night for his own safety.
Animal charities have raised concerns over foxes being kept as pets.
Lydia Parry, veterinary nurse at Vale Wildlife Hospital, said foxes have been known to bite children.
She said: “Obviously the fact that they are wild animals would probably increase that risk. It’s the unpredictability of the animals because they are wild animals and they will always have that instinct. We definitely don’t recommend having foxes as a pet at all. They don’t make suitable pets, they are very smelly, they are difficult to look after and from the animal’s point of view we don’t think it is ethical at all to keep a wild animal in captivity.”
The RSPCA say there is no legal restriction on keeping foxes as pets in England and Wales. But a spokeswoman added: “...because foxes are wild animals and do not fare well as domestic pets, they should not be kept as such.
“Even the most experienced fox experts have had difficulty keeping adult foxes successfully in captivity as they have very specific needs. The RSPCA would not advise or condone keeping them as pets.”
In 2013, a fox ripped a baby boy’s finger off after getting into a family home in Bromley, Kent.
Denny Dolan, who was just five-weeks-old at the time, had to have his finger reattached in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek, as well as treatment for injuries to his face and head.
