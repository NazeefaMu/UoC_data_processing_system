Musthapha wants Mirissa demolitions delayed

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha has called for a delay in demolition of unauthorised structures from the Mirissa Beach .
“When I said that I will step in to ensure that the poor people of Mirissa are not suddenly left without their livelihood, that is not to say that I will in any way subvert the Constitution and laws of this country,” he said Thursday. “I will do my best to ensure that the laws are applied in a decent, reasonable and sensitive way by balancing the contextual realities of the poor people affected by those laws,” he added.
He said the government should “temporarily put a stop to any immediate action to demolish the buildings,” and “start discussions to find a solution to reach a middle ground.”
The Coast Conservation Department has said it will demolish unauthorised structures on the popular tourist beach by May 1.
