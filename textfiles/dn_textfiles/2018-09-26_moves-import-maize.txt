Moves to import maize

The Agriculture Ministry will permit the import of maize as farmers are reluctant to cultivate it due to the inability to sell it at a good rate.
The decision was taken after a discussion held under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera with the participation of officials of maize purchasing companies, banks, Animal Production and Health Department, Department of Agriculture and National Food Promotion Board.
A committee headed by an additional secretary of the Agriculture Ministry was appointed to conduct an analysis on Sri Lanka’s maize importation structure and local maize production. The committee was instructed to prepare a maize importation plan considering the results of the analysis.
