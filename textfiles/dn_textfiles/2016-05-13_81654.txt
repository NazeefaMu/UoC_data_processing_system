Sri Lanka likely to be Pakistan's new 'home'

Pakistan Cricket Board said it failed to make any handsome profits from its "home series" held in the United Arab Emirates since 2009.
Pakistan are considering shifting their base out of the United Arab Emirates for the series against the West Indies later this year and Sri Lanka have emerged on top of their priority list.
This comes after the Pakistan Cricket Board failed to make any handsome profits from its "home series" held in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah since 2009. Organizing matches in the UAE have been highly expensive, a board official said.
The PCB has been forced to host its "home series" regularly in the UAE since terrorist attack on Sri Lankan team in Lahore in March, 2009, leading to Test teams refusing to tour the country citing serious security concerns.
Since 2009, the PCB has only hosted short limited-overs series at home against lowly ranked teams like Zimbabwe (last year in May), Kenya and Afghanistan.
But even before 2009 the PCB had hosted some of its "home series" against Australia and West Indies in the UAE as they expressed security concerns about playing in Pakistan.
Matter under discussion
"We are discussing the matter within the board and we will also speak to other boards to study the feasibility of such a move but we are looking at moving our home series to Sri Lanka," the official confirmed.
He said that the Sri Lankan board had in the past been receptive when proposals were discussed for Pakistan to host their series there.
"They were receptive even when there was a chance we might host India in a short last January but the move didn't materialize," he said.
UAE too costly
The official said the PCB had incurred expenses in millions on just paying the ground rent for the Pakistan Super League which was launched last February in Dubai and Sharjah.
The PCB says it has lost millions of dollars in estimated revenues because of being forced to host its series in UAE because teams had security concerns about playing in Pakistan.
