Eleven prisoners on the death row in the Welikada Prison have passed the English language paper at the last GCE Ordinary Level Examination.
One of them has obtained a distinction, while three have gained credit passes. Twenty one prisoners had sat the GCE Ordinary Level English paper.
A group of English educated prisoners had acted as their tutors under a programme organised by Prison Superintendent Chandana Ekanayaka with the approval of Prisons Commissioner General Nishan Dhanasinghe.
