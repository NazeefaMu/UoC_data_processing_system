UPFA meet with EPDP: plan to contest elections under a united banner

 
UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera has already begun talks with friendly parties to invite them to join hands with the SLFP to contest the forthcoming elections under a united UPFA banner.
As part of these talks, held under the advise of President Maithripala Sirisena, General Secretary Amaraweera held talks with an EPDP delegation, led by Douglas Devananda at the Kotte Parliamnetary complex on April 5.
The two parties held discussions on contesting jointly under the UPFA banner and were very successful, Amaraweera said.
He said another round of talks would be held with the EPDP soon.
Talks will be held with leaders of the several other parties in the coming days to ensure victory for the UPFA at the forthcoming elections, he added.
