Glory of renunciation

King Suddhodana had not been blessed with the opportunity of hearing the Dhamma, even though a majority in Jambudweepa had enjoyed the doctrine of the Buddha. He had not seen his son for six years since the renunciation and when he heard that Sakyamuni was at Weluwanarama on his Sasanic tour, the impatient King dispatched a minister accompanied by a retinue of several thousand followers to invite him to Kimbulwathpura. Nine ministers were sent at different times.
The present day Nepal which adds to the prestige of one time Jambudweepa within the Buddhist world was none other than the Kingdom of Kapilavasthu also known as Kimbulwathpura, was ruled by King Suddhodana of the Sakya dynasty. Nestled in a tranquil location these royal cities were hailed as the most venerated cities occupying a unique place in religious history. What was this due to? It was mainly due to the fact Bosath Siddhartha the future Thathagatha in his last life, born to the worthy Sakyan couple, renounced all his luxury and attained Buddhahood for the relief of the humanity. He emphasized that by truly and sincerely following the light of the Dhamma (his teachings), they could lead noble lives, develop their minds, practise loving kindness (Metta) and bring about peace and harmony.
Worried king
King Suddhodana had not been blessed with the opportunity of hearing the Dhamma, even though a majority in Jambudweepa had enjoyed the doctrine of the Buddha. He had not seen his son for six years since the renunciation and when he heard that Sakyamuni was at Weluwanarama on his Sasanic tour, the impatient King dispatched a minister accompanied by a retinue of several thousand followers to invite him to Kimbulwathpura. Nine ministers were sent at different times.
The anxious King was disappointed as no one returned. They had all been attracted by the Supreme Dhamma of the great Master andhad all become true Arahants now. The King in dismay quite determined turned to Minister Kaaludai – Prince Siddhartha’s playmate, born on the same day and requested him to invite his son on his behalf to come to the city.
He accepted it instantly, but on condition that he be given permission to enter the order.
Hence he was sent with yet another thousand followers who listened to theDhamma and became his disciples. After a week describing the panaromic view of the way side in 60 stanzas the Buddha was informed of the honoured invitation of his father. He said “Oh Lord of heroes, the time has come for you to visit the Sakyans coming down from the Bhageeratha generation for their emancipation”.
Gnathi Sanghahanang
“Saadhu Udai Karissami Gnathi Sanghahanan” well I did accept invitation - expressed the Buddha and set out from Weluwanarama to Kimbulwath on Medin Full moon day.
A distance of 60 yojanas is said to have covered by the Buddha paving the way for the wayside devotees to gather merit and attain Nibbana. Sakyamini was able to put through a large number. But on arrival Sakyans did not worship him, due to pure ignorance which could be termed as false pride considering him junior to them. This compelled him to use his unique psychic powers – Yamaka Prathihara – the Twin Miracle by which he could emanate at will fire from one half of the body and water from the other half.
Moved by the amazing performance, the King worshipped Sakyamuni at once followed by the proud Sakyans, reminiscing the two previous occasions that the King worshipped him.
Sandakinduru Jatakaya
Amidst the Sakyan crowd, the absence of Queen Yasodhara, the wife of Prince Siddhartha, was a prominent factor, which made the Buddha to go to her knowing that she was a faithful and sincere character throughout samsara. Recollecting the strong bond they had in their previous lives, he delivered the sermon of Sandakinduru Jataka reflecting the true love and devotion of a faithful wife.
The weeping Yasodhara who was at his feet holding them was praised for her exemplary behaviour, finally attaining Sotapanna. Her next interest was to enter the order for which he gave no reply as it was not the correct time. Prince Rahula and Nanda were ordained while the others venerated the Buddha who blessed them with overwhelming compassion.
