Vidya rape and murder
Appeals to be taken up for support tomorrow

The appeal petitions filed by the seven convicted and sentenced to death for the murder and gang rape of Sivaloganathan Vidya are to be taken up for support before the Supreme Court tomorrow (9).
The seven, including Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar, were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya of Punguduthivu in 2015 by the Jaffna High Court on September 27.
Nine suspects, Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa, Poobalasingham Jeyakumar alias Ravi, Poobalasingham Navakumar alias Sendil, Mahalingam Shashidaren alias Shashi, Pillainandan Chandrakasan alias Chandra, Shivaderan Kushange alias Periyathamby, Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan, Jeyadaran Kokilan alias Kanna and Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar were accused of the abduction, rape and murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya.
The first and the seventh accused, Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa and Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan were released due to lack of adequate evidence to prove their involvement in the murder.
The Trial-at-Bar headed by Vavuniya High Court Judge Balendren Sashi Mahendran included Jaffna High Court Judge Illancheliyan Manicckavasagar and Trincomalee High Court Judge Annalingam Premashankar.
The second, third, fifth, sixth and eighth accused were sentenced to 30 years’ rigorous imprisonment (RI), with a fine of Rs. 40,000 each.
They were also ordered to pay compensation of Rs.1 million each, to the mother of the victim. The court also ordered the extension of their prison term by four months if they failed to pay the fine.
These convicts will also have to serve two more years if they failed to pay the compensation.
The fourth and the ninth accused were sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment each, with a fine of Rs. 70,000. They were also ordered to pay Rs. 1 million each in compensation to Vidya’s parents. If they failed to pay the fine, they would be further remanded for four months and if they failed to pay the compensation, they would be remanded for another two years.
