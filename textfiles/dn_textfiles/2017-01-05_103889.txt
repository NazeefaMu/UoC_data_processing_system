Husband attacks wife, sister-in-law over land dispute

A man who stabbed his wife and cut off her sister's wrist following a family dispute was arrested by the Peradeniya Police yesterday.
The incident has taken place in Muruthalawa, Dehi-Anga, Peradeniya last Monday at around 7.30 p.m.
The woman whose hand was cut off, was admitted to the Peradeniya hospital with severe injuries.
The woman's relatives have brought the amputated limb to the hospital on medical advice.
A special medical team of the Peradeniya Hospital has performed a reattachment surgery on the hand.
"As the limb was brought to the hospital late, the success of the surgery cannot be assured," Peradeniya Hospital said.
The family dispute had been over the ownership of his wife's house.
The suspect's wife who was stabbed, had also undergone surgery.
The suspect was produced before the Kandy Magistrate and was remanded until January 13.
