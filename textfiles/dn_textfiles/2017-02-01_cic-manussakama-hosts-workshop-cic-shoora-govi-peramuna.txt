CIC Manussakama hosts workshop for CIC Shoora Govi Peramuna

A training workshop was recently held at the Gannoruwa Training Institute organised by CIC under the Manussakama programme, aiming to disseminate knowledge on new agricultural technology for the CIC Shoora Govi Peramuna.
CIC Manussakama was launched by CIC Agri Businesses in 2008 to uplift the lives of the rural agricultural community.
Since inception a number of initiatives have been implemented under this programme with a precise insight into the needs of the rural agri population, thus rendering an award winning humanitarian service that has earned many awards and accolades locally and internationally.
CIC Agri Businesses stepped into the limelight by becoming the first Sri Lankan company to claim the award for the Best Social Services Programme at the ‘Asia Pacific Responsible Entrepreneurship Award 2013’, after beating 48 countries.
The company also won the title for Asia Pacific Enterprise Leadership award in the same year..
With the aim of recognising the potential of young agricultural entrepreneurs in the country and rewarding their talents, the CIC Shoora Goviya competition series was conducted by the CIC under their Manussakama programme consecutively for four years from 2009 to 2013.
The competition, being a novel concept, drew social recognition towards the young entrepreneurs involved in the agricultural sector.
CIC Shoora Govi Peramuna encompasses 80 young agricultural entrepreneurs, comprising 20 finalists chosen after each final round. The members of the CIC Shoora Govi Peramuna have the privilege of participating in comprehensive training programmes on contemporary agricultural technologies of the 21st century, conducted by two lecture panels comprising special lecturers from the Department of Agriculture and professors from Peradeniya University.
A two-day training workshop of the programme series was held under the collaboration of CIC Agri Businesses and CIC Holdings at the Gannoruwa Training Institute recently.
The effective training sessions were conducted by Professor Buddhi Marambe of Peradeniya University's Agriculture Faculty and Advisor of CIC Manussakama Wasantha Dukgannarala.
Chief GAP Certificate Implementer A.S.M. Roshan expressed his views on the significance of obtaining the GAP (Good Agricultural Practices) certificate in export agriculture and the provisions of obtaining the certificate within Sri Lanka free of charge.
Manju Gunawardena also joining the lecture panel introduced the innovative concepts of using drone technology in large scale cultivations, and demonstrated how to conveniently control the drones via a mobile app.
CIC Shoora Govi Peramuna has scheduled the next workshop to be held on the first week of March this year and preparations are underway to continue the success of the previous yearsthrough a new series of programmes.
