Emirates catering - how food and beverage adds value to the inflight experience

There's five hours to go for the departure of Emirates flight 654 from Dubai to Colombo and Jane Zdrojewski, Operations Manager at Emirates Flight Catering, checks the Flight Preparation Monitoring Board. All meals are ready on schedule for this flight.
This is one of the myriad tasks a total of 4,500 staff at flight kitchen EKFC1, which is dedicated to Emirates flights, undertake every day to ensure high quality cuisine, route- specific menus and the bottom line - food safety, for passengers.
The ISO certified, US$ 159 million Emirates Flight Catering is the largest airline catering facility in the world, producing over 185,000 meal trays a day.
Emirates Flight Cateringhas another flight kitchen - EKFC2 - which caters to others airlines and to the lounges. In all, Emirates Flight Catering has 10,500 staff.
On an average day, EKFC1 produces a total of 185,000 meals, while EKFC2 caters to 125 airlines, producing a total of 28,000 meals.
In the very competitive airline industry, Emirates is particular about catering to the tastes of its different passengers and has regional catering managers, who together with a concept team visit their different destinations to create route-specific menus.
Emirates' cosmopolitan crew, which include some 135 nationalities, also give valuable inputs and convey passenger feedback, all of which ensure high quality cuisine, says Jane.
There are two menu cycles each month, she says. Meticulous planning means that appetizers, main course and desserts are matched. April is a key month for menu changes as it is the start of the Summer holiday season when schedules change.
Emirates standard for inflight meals is called the 'Najm standard' ('Najm' means 'star' in Arabic). “Details of each part of every meal are compiled into a specifications manual, the 'bible' of the flight kitchen, which is strictly adhered to and constantly checked for compliance with the Najm standard,” says Jane.
At EKFC1, three days' stocks are held in the Food and Non-Food storage sections. Food would include juices, water, biscuits and more while Non-food would store toiletries, slippers, children's toys and the like.
Production is where meals are prepared for batches of flights.There are hot and cold kitchens. Emirates is one airline that prepares meals from scratch and so has its own bakery which bakes all the bread, muffins and pastries and more.Starting from scratch also means that 50,000 fruit salads are meticulously prepared everyday in the cold kitchen, Jane says.
The hot kitchen has different sections for the different regions, such as Far East, Arabic and Continental.
Bulk food is then sorted into individual meals in the Dishing Room.

A key factor is ensuring food safety is temperature. So once sorted, the food goes into a blast chiller for 30 minutes to cool it to 5°C so it can be refrigerated in cold rooms a floor below, at Airside Logistics, which is tasked with ensuring food and non-food items get onboard.
Airside Logistics is so designed that all goods are stored along one side while the opposite side has wide doors which open on to the ramp. The doors are large enough for trucks to back up so carts can be loaded. Every flight has three doors, one each for First, Business and Economy Classes.
Non-food items are loaded first and then food. Food is transferred to convection ovens on meal carts before uploading onto the aircraft. All carts have stickers with the flight number, Class and other details.
Timing is also a key factor in ensuring there are no delays on account of catering. Loading into the aircraft galley begins two-and-a-half hours before departure and finishes an hour before departure. After going over the check list with cabin crew, the flight handler and his team return to prepare for the next departure.

The central procurement department overlooks suppliers for its flight kitchens, each of whom has been carefully selected to ensure they can deliver the required volume at the required quality. Suppliers are selected only after Emirates’ catering management team has visited and evaluated premises for food product and hygiene standards. Spot checks on suppliers also ensure they adhere to the airline's standard.
The flight kitchens also cater for special meals such as kosher, Hindu, low sodium, gluten-free, largely based on the IATA list.
Under Emirates Flight Catering, two other facilities are included: Food Point and Linen Craft. Food Point is an offsite food facility with a production capacity of 40 million meals a year while Linen Craft is the largest industrial laundry in the Middle East with a throughput of over 200 tons of linen and 10,000 pieces of garments a day.
EKFC has a dedicated Environmental team that recovers recyclable material from the inbound flights. An average of 1.73 million kgs of aluminium cans, wastepaper and cardboard, glass bottles, aluminium foils, plastic and 420,800 litres of used cooking oil are collected annually. Emirates, which is constantly expanding its route network, plans to add a third flight kitchen next year. (MM)
