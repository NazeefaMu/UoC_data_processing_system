Facile win  for England Women  in first ODI

 
England Women cricketers drew first blood in the four-match one-day international series against Sri Lanka Women when they won the first ODI quite easily by eight wickets with 21 overs to spare at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Winning the toss and batting first Sri Lanka Women managed to total a moderate 168-8 in their 50 overs.
Their top five batters all got starts getting into the twenties but none managed to stay long enough to play a big innings.
Sri Lanka Women’s new pair of openers Hasini Perera and Nipuni Hansika got the innings off to a fine start with a half-century partnership but from their onwards wickets fell at regular intervals and there was no substantial partnership to sustain the innings.
Needing to score at less than three and a half runs an over England Women cruised to their target scoring at over 5½ runs an over to win with ease.
An opening stand of 71 between Lauren Winfield and Tammy Beaumont got them moving rapidly towards their target score.
Skipper Heather Knight and Natalie Sciver saw England Women home with an unfinished stand of 82.
The second ODI is scheduled at the R Premadasa Stadium for November 12.
