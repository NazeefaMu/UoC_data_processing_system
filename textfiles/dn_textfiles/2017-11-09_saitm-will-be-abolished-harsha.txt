SAITM will be abolished: Harsha

The South Asia Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) will be abolished and there will be no new enrolment of students to it, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva announced yesterday.
The Deputy Minister, who heads the nine-member Committee to implement the SAITM solution, read out in Parliament a three-point letter issued after discussions with the Medical Faculty Students’ Parents Association, which had launched a ‘fast unto death’ campaign.
Making a special statement with the permission of the chair while the Constitutional Assembly debate on the Steering Committee interim report was in progress, the Deputy Minister said the Committee headed by him would discuss and make recommendations as to what steps must be taken to complete the academic activities of the students currently studying at SAITM.
He also assured that all future measures the Committee proposes would be in compliance with the provisions of the University Act.
“The suspension on admission of medical students to SAITM by the letter issued by the Higher Education Ministry Secretary on September 15 will continue.” the Deputy Minister added.
De Silva, asking for the support of all stakeholders to implement the SAITM solution and complete the entire process by December 31, also requested the medical students to return to their academic work and the Parents Association to call off the fast.
He pointed out many groups have reacted positively to the Government’s proposals announced on October 29.
He said the Committee met with five members of the Parents Association including Prof Athula Kaluarachchi and Dr. Harris Pathirage yesterday morning and agreed on the above measures.
He said acting Secretary to the President Sumith Abeysinghe, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, the Higher Education Minister and the Attorney General were also consulted prior to making those decisions.
