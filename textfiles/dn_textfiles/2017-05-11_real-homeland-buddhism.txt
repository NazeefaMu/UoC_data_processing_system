Real homeland of Buddhism

Nepal is the birthplace of the Buddha and India is the birthplace of Buddhism. But what would have happened to Buddhism if it had not found a secure and permanent home in Sri Lanka since its introduction in the third century BCE? Would Buddhism have attained the degree of acceptance and recognition in the world today if not for Sri Lanka? These are the two main questions I wish to ask myself in the course of this presentation.
In no other country has Buddhism had an unbroken presence extending to over twenty-three centuries. While the mere presence for such a long time is a record by itself, Sri Lanka has established a claim to be called the “Home of Buddhism” on account of a distinct series of remarkable contributions to the promotion and spread of Buddhism in the world. In a well recorded history in a number of chronicles, corroborated by the histories of several other nations and evidence from archaeological monuments, these contributions extend right up to present times.
sapling of the Bodhi tree
Of the nine places to which Arahant Moggaliputtatissa sent missions after the Third Buddhist Council under the patronage of Emperor Asoka, Sri Lanka had two distinct advantages. First, none of the two missions of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis under Arahants Mahinda and Sanghamitta, unlike the bhikkhus of the other eight missions, returned to India after the establishment of Buddhism in the target region. They continued to serve the Island right up to their passing away. Second, Arahant Mahinda and his sister Arahant Sanghamitta were children of the Emperor and their mission was continually supported from Pataliputra with the dispatch of bhikkhunis, the sapling of the Bodhi tree, relics, and skilled artisans. The involvement of as many as ten uncles of Arahants Mahinda and Sanghamitta in the administration of the Island, establishing thus the hereditary civil service of the Lambakannas, could have been a further source of support. These advantages would have contributed to the two major literary activities which promoted the study of Buddhism.
massive literary project
It is to Arahant Mahinda that credit is given for the first production of commentaries on the Tripitaka in Sinhala, the language of the Island. It was a massive literary project and had continued unabated until about the first century of the Current Era. There had been many recensions as Mahatthakatha or Mulatthakatha, Mahapaccariya, Kurindi and Andhattha, attributed to the Mahavihara. It is possible that the Abhayagiri Monastery had a similar tradition as suggested by the term Uttaraviharavamsatthakatha.
These comprehensive commentaries, known as Sihalatthakatha, were characterized by their exegetical authenticity as well as the reliable historical and social information that they recorded. At least one of them – most importantly the Commentary on the Vinaya – had reached China in the fifth century. The Chinese translation provides us about the closest look that we get into the contents and structure of a Sinhala Commentary and gives adequate proof of scholarly quality, coverage and educational value of these commentaries. More of it later.
The second major literary enterprise of the Sri Lankan Sangha was the reduction of the Pali Tripitaka and the Sinhala Commentaries to writing in the first century BCE in the reign of King Valagamabahu at Aluvihara, Matale. The significance of this activity is to be assessed in relation to the survival of the different Buddhist Canons in several languages up to the modern times. With the exception of the Sanskrit Tripitaka, which is available more or less intact in the Chinese translation as Agama Sutras, none of the other Canons have survived in full. We have only a few fragments to show that Canons similar to the Pali Tripitaka once existed in Sanskrit, Khotanese and some other Prakrit languages. Without the written Tripitaka in Pali, which was preserved in Sri Lanka and distributed to various parts of Asia by the Sri Lankan Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis, the world would have lost access to the most reliable record of the Buddha’s original teachings. Over the last two centuries no Buddhist studies of any depth and quality have been accomplished without reference to the Pali Tripitaka.
Mahayana doctrines
The addition of a second monastery in Anuradhapura by King Valagambahu in the form of Abhayagiri – also in the first century BCE - paved the way for the expansion and diversification of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. This monastery was more open to the new developments taking place in India and was receptive to Mahayana doctrines and practices, including scriptures in Sanskrit. As a result it became the focal point of international Buddhist relations. The third monastery, the Jetavanarama, established two centuries later by King Mahasen, followed a similar eclectic tendencies and all Buddhist traditions – Theravada, Mahayana and even Vajrayana (mentioned in the Nikayasangraha as Nilapatadarshana) co-exited and flourished as can be seen from the artifacts discovered in recent excavations of these two monasteries and elsewhere in Anuradhapura.
The wealth of coins, Intaglios, jewelry and glazed tiles hitherto discovered show the variety of international visitors to these monasteries. The existence of a most noteworthy Mahayana scripture, the Prajnaparamita, engraved on gold plates, as well references to some texts in Mihintale inscriptions is proof that the Sanskrit Mahayana literature was not only preserved but held in esteem. Bactrian coins discovered in Situlpavva in the south show a close relationship of this monastery with the land of King Menander (Milinda). It is possible that Sri Lankan Bhikkhus and bhikkhunis were involved in the development of Buddhism outside the Island in a fair portion of the then known world.
trade relations
This they could do because the strategic situation of Sri Lanka at a central point in the Maritime Silk Route between the West and the East, with connecting routes from both sides of the Indian subcontinent. As far back as the fourth century BCE, judging from Greek and Roman records even if our own records are not detailed enough, Sri Lankan ports of Mahatittha (present Mantai) and Godavaya near Ambalantota had been centres of international maritime trade with both Greek and Roman regions of the West and the Chinese and southeast Asian countries of the East. The variety of goods discovered in the course of the recent excavations of the port of Mantai from Greece, Rome, Persia, Venice, Southeast Asia and China are themselves adequate proof of the international trade to which ancient Sri Lanka was exposed. As far back as the fourth century BCE, Anuradhapura is said to have had a Greek enclave and Kautilya, the author of Arthashastra, knew that pearls came from a place called Mayura of the land of the Sinhalas. Cinnamon got the Sanskrit name Sinhalaka about the same time. As trade relations were further expanded with the discovery of the monsoons in the first century, Mahatittha was recognized by Cosmas Indicopluestes as the emporium mediatrix, serving as the entrepot for Western and Chinese ships. The Chinese pilgrim Fa-Xian in the fifth century had been impressed by the luxurious mansions of traders form the Middle-east, thus establishing the fact that trade relations lasted right through history.
Onesicritus knew details of the Sri Lankan ships plying between the Island and the Indus Basin in what is now Pakistan. Emperor Asoka sent his daughter Sanghamitta by ship down the Ganges and from the Port of Tamralipti (Tamluk) on the Bay of Bengal to Jambukola in the Jaffna Peninsula in the third century BCE.
