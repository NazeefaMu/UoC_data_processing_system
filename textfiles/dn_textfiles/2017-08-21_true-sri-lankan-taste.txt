A true Sri Lankan taste!

The Fairway Colombo Street Food (FCSF) Festival will be held for the seventh consecutive month on August 26.
The Festival is made even more special due to its unique and rustic location, the vibrant Hospital Street in Colombo 01. It will be filled to the brim with tasty street food, from the ever-popular Fish and Chips and Grills, to mouth-watering Dosas, Box Noodles, Rottis and even Achcharu.
Enhancing audience participation to an unparalleled degree, this festival offers a truly diverse range of entertainment, including performers like jugglers and clowns, a live band and a DJ playing throughout the night, which adds even more excitement to a fun night out for the whole family.
In particular, visitors will no doubt find it thrilling to try out the exciting EGB Game Zone, which is organised by Elephant House Ginger Beer (EGB). The EGB Game Zone is sure to engage and delight fans and first timers alike with sensational games and exciting prizes.
Additionally, visitors to the EGB stall can quench their thirst with the refreshing and authentic Sri Lankan flavour of EGB. Offering up a rush of fresh Ginger in each and every sip, EGB is a true local delicacy and the perfect accompaniment to any Sri Lankan food, giving those who drink it a “taste of the Real Roots of Sri Lanka.”
“The world-famous EGB is proud to be the Platinum Sponsor of the Fairway Colombo Street Food Festival, a family friendly gathering that has welcomed a minimum of 2,500 attendees per event for the last seven consecutive months. EGB is supporting this festival as it is the perfect embodiment of a real Sri Lankan street festival, where the indigenous food and atmosphere is showcased in true local style,” noted John Keells Holdings, Head of Beverages for Elephant House, and Vice President, Belindra Weerasinghe.
