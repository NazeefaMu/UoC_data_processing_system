‘Civilians hold over 1,000 licensed pistols’

Defence Ministry Additional Secretary N.D. Panditharatna says civilians hold about 1,300 licensed pistols.
He said 19,000 shotguns were issued to the farmers to protect their harvest from wild animals. He said the Ministry had not estimated how many gun holders had taken licences for 2018.
Nearly 1,000 illegal firearms including pistols and shotguns were handed over to the Ministry by the general public during the amnesty, he said.
Panditharatna said the pistol used by a MP’s wife to threaten a private bus driver at the recent Battaramulla incident had not been licensed for 2018.
The Additional Secretary said he did not know the exact number of firearms that the civilian hold. “The Defence Ministry does not have the exact figures and relevant details,” he said.
