Rohitha’s corruption case fixed for further trial on March 21

Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne yesterday fixed for March 21, to record further evidence in a corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena.
This is for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
On an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled preliminary objections raised by former Minister against the Bribery Commission's decision to amend charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monetary transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention of section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that Abeygunawardena had owned these properties which are deemed under the provisions of the act to be property acquired through bribery.
