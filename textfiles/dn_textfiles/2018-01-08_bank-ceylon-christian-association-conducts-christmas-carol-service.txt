Bank of Ceylon, Christian Association conducts Christmas Carol service

The Bank of Ceylon Christian Association celebrated their 52nd Christmas Carol Service in December 2017 with the patronage of the Bank’s Chairman Ronald C. Perera, the General Manager and Corporate Managment. The service was attended by the present and past staff members of the Bank with their families.
The Bank’s very first Carols service was held on December 17 1965. Since then, the Christmas carol service had been held in the Bank every year.
This year 36 members of the BOC staff participated in the 52nd Carol Service.
Despite their busy schedules at the work stations, and by their dedication they were able to conduct a successful and a very colorful event. The chief guest was the Rt Rev. Dr. Raymond Wickremasinghe Bishop of Galle. There were other Rev. Priests in attendance on this day.
This Service is also a long awaited event in the Bank by all staff members, irrespective of any religion, which is enjoyed by all.
The Bank’s retired staff members too, eagerly await for this carol service, as it gives them an opportunity to meet each other and share their love and joy, which is the real meaning of Christmas.
