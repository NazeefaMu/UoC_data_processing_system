Mixed electoral system for elections before SLFP’s 67th Convention: Abeywardena

Public Enterprise Development State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said he hoped to see amendments made to introduce a mixed electoral system for Provincial Councils and Parliamentary elections by the time the SLFP celebrates its 67th Convention next year.
The SLFP State Minister was addressing a media briefing held at SLFP Headquarters recently.
He said the changing of the electoral system was a main reason that many in the SLFP joined the Government .
The Minister said they would introduce the 20th Amendment to the Constitution soon.
He said the Joint Opposition has gone to courts over the Local Government Elections Amendment Act, `They blamed us for delaying elections.
Now the elections can be held, they want to delay it further.
Those who wanted an election are now postponing it,” Abeywardena said.
The State Minister said President Sirisena had introduced several changes from pruning the powers of the Executive to limiting the number of terms a person can contest for the Presidency.
He invited all party members and supporters to join the Party Convention on September 3.
He said a split in the party would affect the future of the SLFP, “The UNP remained in Opposition for 20 years because of the split. We need to remember that time,” he said.
