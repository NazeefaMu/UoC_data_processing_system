Runaway bride cherished dream of foreign job

A bride who arrived at the Ratnapura Marriage Registrar’s office to get registered in marriage had second thoughts at the last minute and quietly left the premises in a taxi, unbeknown to her family and relatives, minutes before the ceremony.
She had been engaged to marry a man proposed by her aunt and had arrived at the Registrar’s office with her family and relatives for the registration of the marriage.
The bride had been working for long in a garment factory worker and cherished hopes of going abroad to work. When her aunt brought the marriage proposal, she had told her parents and relatives that she would like to marry the boy after returning from a stint abroad.
The prospective groom agreed to her going abroad after the registration of their marriage.
Both parties had arrived at the Registrar’s Office for the marriage ceremony. Relatives who attended the ceremony were waiting in the compound until the auspicious time for the ceremony.
At the auspicious time, they were bewildered to find the bride missing. Meanwhile, the bride had spoken to her aunt over the mobile phone and said she went away thinking that her dream of working abroad would be shattered if she got married.
A dispute which would have occurred between the bride’s party and the bridegroom’s party over the unexpected cancellation of the marriage was settled with the intervention of the lady registrar.
