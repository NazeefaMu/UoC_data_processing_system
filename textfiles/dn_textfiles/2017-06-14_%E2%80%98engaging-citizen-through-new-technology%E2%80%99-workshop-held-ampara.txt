‘Engaging Citizen through New Technology’ workshop held in Ampara

The Federation of Local Government Sri Lanka with the International Republican Institute (IRI) conducted a workshop titled, “Engaging the Citizens through New Technology” at the Akkraipattu Municipal Council in Ampara recently.
The workshop focused on engaging people to get maximum service from Municipal Councils using social media platforms.
Through social media, a Municipal Council can improve its services and reach out to the people very fast. People now gather information via modern technology devices. Internet users are increasingly visiting social media sites to learn and share their findings, Steve Cima, Country Director, IRI and Zergio said.
Local Government bodies need to develop and maintain a dynamic social media presence to effectively reach out to their citizens. Communication include direct and indirect ways. The Municipal Council has to decide which social media can engage the citizens effectively in getting the service of the Municipal Council. The MC has to appoint a person as a Communication Manager to observe and expedite the service of the Municipal Council to the people, he said.
Steve Cima, Country Director, IRI and Zergio, resource person from Colombia and Hemanthi Gunasekera, Federation of Local Government Sri Lanka, A.Azmy, the Commissioner of Akkraipattu Municipal Council along with officers attached at Akkaraipattu MC participated.
