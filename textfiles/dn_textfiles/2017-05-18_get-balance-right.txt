Get the  balance  right!

 Getting involved in activities outside the classroom gives students greater opportunities to develop character, critical thinking skills, social skills, and talents. The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award equips young people for life and work. It emphasizes that not all learning happens in the classroom. Young people need experiences outside the classroom to become committed, responsible and fulfilled citizens of the world.
Two students of Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo, Dinusha Kalpani and Manonitha Perera, proved that they are diversely talented when they managed to reach the Gold Level in the international competition. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented them with the Award in March. The Award is available to all 14 to 24 year olds and is considered as the world’s leading youth achievement award.
“Your journey towards achieving the Award is a personal challenge and not a competition against others. You design your own Award program, set your own goals and record your own progress. It pushes young people to their personal limits and recognizes their achievements,” Dinusha said.

Manonitha notes that when their teachers Sriyani Edirisinghe and Sandya Mayadunne introduced this Award she thought that it would be a good opportunity to identify her own skills and capabilities.
“I believed that it would create a platform to improve my personality by developing qualities such as leadership and harnessing the confidence to take part in events in the future without shying away from the limelight,” she added.
Since its launch in 1956 by The Duke of Edinburgh, husband to Queen Elizabeth II of UK, the Award has inspired millions of young people to transform their lives. Over eight million young people have participated in the Award competition in over 140 countries and territories. The Award can play a critical role in a youth’s personal development via non formal education. To reach the award one needs to complete three levels and four sections: service, skills, physical recreation and adventurous journey. All four sections need to be completed at each level. The participants need to complete a residential project as well when they reach the Gold Level. The competition gets tougher at each level leaving room for the individuals to test their skills. A participant gets three months to complete their work during the Bronze Level while he or she gets six months for the Silver Level and one year for the Gold Level.

The Service section of the Award encourages young people to volunteer their time to and understand the benefits of this service to their community. The Skills section encourages the development of personal interests and practical and social skills. The Physical Recreation section motivates young people to participate in some form of physical recreation for the improvement of health and fitness. The Adventurous Journey section triggers a sense of adventure while undertaking a team journey or expedition. Participants will plan, train for and undertake a journey with a defined purpose in an unfamiliar environment. The Residential Project, completed only at Gold level, aims to broaden participants’ horizons through involvement with others in a residential setting.
Dinusha has written short stories for the Bronze Level. For the Silver Level and Gold Level she has engaged in sewing. She says that this helped her hone her sewing skills so that she is able to sew any type of garment now.
Going to Baththaramulla Forest Conservation Headquarters has been their pre adventurous journey for the Bronze Level. Their adventurous journey had been from Ganemulla Girl Guide Training Headquarters to Horagolla.
The duo and a group of about 20 more had gone to Ragama Tea Estate Church for the pre adventurous journey for the Silver Level while their adventurous journey had been to do research on the ancient ruins in Anuradhapura while staying at Saliya Army Camp.
For the Gold Level Dinusha’s service project has been to help out at the Sarana Elderly Home in Athurugiriya. She also gave them tea once per month using money that she has earned through giving tuition classes to a few school children. Her service for Bronze Level was to assist a teacher while she is teaching English to small children in the afternoons. She has taught a few grade two students under the teacher’s guidance for the Silver Level.
The girls had visited four temples in Gampaha doing research on King Valagamba’s activities there for their pre adventurous journey for the Gold Level. Their adventurous journey had been to climb and do research on the Belihuloya’s Paraviyangala mountain range.
“That was one of the most memorable and challenging moments in the whole competition. We ventured 23 km and out of that 11 km was on foot. We hiked a 15 000 ft mountain. It was a difficult climb because your hands get scratched when you struggle to climb upwards by clinging to the ground. Seven of us along with two elders undertook that event. It was an out of this world kind of experience,” Dinusha explained.
Her residential project has been in Panagamuwa, Kegalle, where she did a research on the eating habits and health factors of the residents. She found out that the residents have a two percent risk in getting cancer because they have begun to use artificial manure for their crops.

Manonitha had taught grade three and four students to improve their literacy using diverse methods as her service for both the Bronze Level and Silver Levels. Swimming was her physical recreation project for the Bronze Level while she chose to learn to play the violin as her skill.
She shifted to the flute for the Silver Level and took up dancing as her physical recreation project. She had learnt Pa Saramba, Goda Saramba and practiced three Wannam including Adaw and Kasthiram.
Manonitha’s service for the Gold Level was to teach knots, first aid and camp fire songs to scouts and see that they are well prepared for a camp. She chose to sew saree jackets. She mastered various sewing styles and ended up sewing on the sewing machine. She learnt to ride a bicycle and eventually rode it from Dematagoda to Ambathale.

Dinusha said that many youth’s log book had been rejected because they have not followed the rules of the competition accurately. Her log book has been 110 pages long and handwritten.
“You need to plan your actions and strategies as well as note down you goals before engaging in the activity. Then stick to that plan. You need to capture all the activities via photographs and include them in the log book. A mediator has to grade your prowess,” Manonitha said.
Manonitha has three brothers in her family. Her mother, Priyanka Kumarasinghe, is a music teacher and her father, N M Perera, is a retired army officer. Dinusha’s father, W H Chandralal, is an operation manager at a leading company while her mother, T K Wettasinghe, is a school principal.
Dinusha is the deputy head girl of Gothami Balika Vidyalaya while Manonitha is a senior prefect and a member of the youth parliament. They attribute all their triumphs in life to being Girl Guides and taking part in The Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award.
“Only 13 of us managed to reach the Gold Level at the last competition. Out of those there were only six who had completed each level. The others have just reached the Gold Level in 18 months,” Dinusha said.
She adds that youth need to take part in extracurricular activities to sooth their minds. This creates a balance in life. Studies alone will create stress.
“We should learn well by referring to books. We have lots of people to guide us in education but we need to engage in extracurricular activities to gain life experiences. It is up to us to improve our leadership, responsiveness, quality of changing challenges. Extracurricular activities develop those qualities. We can study the behaviour of the people in the society, and their way of facing the challenges. If you aware of your pros and cons then you will be able to balance everything,” Manonitha concluded.
