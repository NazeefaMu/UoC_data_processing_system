Minimum qualifications for medical education approved to be gazetted

 
The Cabinet of Ministers has approved to issue the gazette notification of the minimum qualifications for medical education.
Accordingly, a candidate who possesses two credit passes and one simple pass in G.C.E. Advance Level examination for Chemistry, Physics and Biology in one sitting is entitled to apply for medical education.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne proposed to gazette the minimum qualifications after holding discussions with relevant parties, including Attorney General and Sri Lanka Medical Council President.
Previously the minimum standard of the medical education in Sri Lanka had only received the Court of Appeal ruling.
