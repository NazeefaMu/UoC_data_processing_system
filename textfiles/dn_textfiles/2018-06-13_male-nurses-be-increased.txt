Male nurses to be increased

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will consider the possibility of increasing the percentage of male nurses recruited to the service, Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, at the moment there are 31,000 nurses in the service but around 7,000 more nurses are required for the service. At the moment only five (5) percent of male nurses are being recruited to the service.
Minister Senaratne has instructed the Deputy Director General of Health Service Dr. Donald Murage to prepare a report on recruiting male nurses to the service after considering the percentage of male nurses recruitment in other countries in the world, he said.
Attention will be paid to the possibility of recruiting more males who have already applied to join the nursing service. The allowance paid for the instructors of Nurses Training Schools (NTS) will be increased up to Rs. 20,000. At the moment it is only Rs. 10,000, he added.
