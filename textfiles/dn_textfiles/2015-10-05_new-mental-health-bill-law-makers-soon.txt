New Mental Health Bill before law makers soon

A new Mental Health Bill will be presented to Parliament soon to replace the Act on Mental Health enacted in 1892. The draft Bill is before the Cabinet Sub Committee for approval, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, a National Mental Health Policy is also ready, offering fresh guidelines on services and manpower resources of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The new law and the national policy will together contribute to drastic changes in the present approach to treating mentally ill patients.
One significant change is that mentally sick patients will be able to be admitted to any psychiatric unit in the country, the sources said. The Act will also look into strengthening long term and interim care units across the island, the sources said.
