Language is s ' war zone'

 
Ngugi wa Thiong’o would not be happy to see me writing about him in English. He would have preferred if I wrote this article in Sinhala first, and then, translated it into English. Even though his first novels were written in English, ever since he was imprisoned by the Kenyan government for writing the play Ngaahika Ndeenda (“I Will Marry When I Want”) he started to write in Gikuyu, his mother tongue.
The first novel he wrote in Gikuyu was written during his year-long imprisonment in 1978, when, after being arrested in the middle of the night, he was held without trial, in a maximum-security prison in Kenya. The reason for his arrest was his role in the writing and staging of Ngaahika Ndeenda, produced by and starring local peasants, reflecting the inequalities and injustices in Kenyan society. He continued to resist the activities of the government even while he was jailed. He wrote a novel Caitani Mutharabaini, translated into English as Devil on the Cross from his cell on the only thing available—squares of toilet paper. As he was never charged, tried or sentenced, he had no way of knowing how long he would be held captive. The novel was “a form of spiritual survival”, he says. “It was fun writing when I did not have paper. All I had was toilet paper. But occasionally I got a pen from the prison authorities if I said I was writing some kind of confession—I don’t know what there was to confess.”
It was his decision to stop writing in English while he was imprisoned that many people still question. And the answer he gives is simple; “If I meet an English person, and he says, ‘I write in English,’ I don’t ask him ‘Why are you writing in English?’ If I meet a French writer, I don’t ask him, ‘Why don’t you write in Vietnamese?’ But I am asked over and over again, ‘Why do you write in Gikuyu?’ For Africans, the view is there is something wrong about writing in an African language.”

He thinks the so-called developing countries should invest in one’s own culture and resources and say no to the language of the colonizers. He believes the colonizers weaponized native languages and used it against the natives. “If you know all the languages of the world and you don’t know your mother tongue or the language of your culture, that is enslavement. But if you know your mother tongue or the language of your culture and add to it all the languages of the world, that is empowerment. Monolingualism is the carbon monoxide of civilization. Of course, there are communities whose right to their language — as in the case of enslaved Africans — was taken away by force of law and violence. But they did create new languages. Those languages are languages in their own right, and they, like African languages, are not a lower rung on the ladder to an English heaven. I think African people, Latin American people, Asian people, must find a way of relating to each other a bit more and being able to say one thing: let us make things with our resources. And then exchange with others on the basis of equal give and equal take.”
A novelist, playwright and essayist who sits alongside the likes of Nigeria’s Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka in the modern African pantheon, Ngugi wa Thiong’o has been a perennial favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature. A Nobel, he says in one interview, would be validating but not essential. Several years ago, he shot to the top of betting on the day the result was to be announced, only for one of his daughters to call and tell him that Peru’s Mario Vargas Llosa had won. He recalls the faces of the photographers who had gathered outside his home in anticipation of his victory: “I was the one who was consoling them!”
Ngugi was born in 1938 in Kamirithu, a village north of Nairobi, one of 28 children of a mercurial father with four wives. In the 1950s, his older brother, Good Wallace, joined the Mau Mau uprising against a ruthless British occupation whose prison camps were described by the then-solicitor general as having been “distressingly reminiscent of conditions in Nazi Germany or Communist Russia”. The British response to the rebellion was brutal and relentless. It even extended to weaponising language itself, says Ngugi. “The British gave it the name of Mau Mau because it’s meaningless — as if to say it was a meaningless movement. If they had said, ‘Land and Freedom Army’, as [the fighters] called themselves, then they would be articulating the aims of the movement,” he explains. Ngugi’s half-brother Gitogo was shot in the back and killed for refusing to obey a British soldier’s command. Gitogo had not heard the command because he was deaf. His mother, who is the driving force behind his work, was detained in solitary confinement for three months.
And yet, Ngugi survived. He points to his mother’s influence as the reason he never succumbed to the obstacles in his path. “She could not read or write, but she sent me to school.” She constantly pushed him. “Even when I got 100 percent in anything, she’d still ask me whether that was the best I could do,” he says. “In every situation she comes to my mind, whether I am trying my best in whatever circumstances I might be in, whether in jail or in exile, or under attack.”
The results of his determination to do his best blossomed when in 1962, he was invited to a landmark symposium of African writers working in English, including Achebe, Soyinka, and the South African Lewis Nkosi. “Everything seemed possible,” he recalls. “We could sense a new world was coming to be.” Yet, this elation was short-lived. When he read a critique by Nigerian poet Obi Wali, “who lamented the fact that, for an African writer’s conference, there wasn’t a single text, not a single writer who wrote in an African language” Ngugi realized things should change. He used this insight to overturn the Kenyan academia proposing African literature be taught in universities — and act which would eventually lead to his exile.
In 1982, Ngugi was in London when he was warned that if he returned to Kenya he would receive a “red carpet welcome”, of the bloodthirsty kind. He lived in exile for the next 22 years, while his children and their late mother in Kenya endured periodic abuses from the authorities. In 2004, two years after Moi was defeated in democratic elections, Ngugi returned. It was to be a triumphant homecoming for the country’s most celebrated writer, as he launched Wizard of the Crow, an 800-page allegorical magical realist satire that he had written in Gikuyu. He has said that the most beautiful line in the English version that followed is, “A translation from Gikuyu by the author”.
Asked when he was growing up if he ever thought he would become an internationally renowned author and that his stories of Kenya would be translated into 60 different languages, Ngugi who now lives in the United States said, “No, never, not even that I would ever become a writer. The struggle to ensure that one seized whatever educational opportunities came one’s way was hard enough. The competition for places in the few schools and colleges available was fierce. From elementary schools to colleges, every two years were terminal exams.
There were hardly any second chances. Once you got off the train, for whatever reason, you hardly ever got on it again. But I always wanted to read. My ambition, on entering a library for the first time in my life, was to one day be able to read all the books in the world. Reality would soon clip the wings of that ambition, but the desire to read remains.”
