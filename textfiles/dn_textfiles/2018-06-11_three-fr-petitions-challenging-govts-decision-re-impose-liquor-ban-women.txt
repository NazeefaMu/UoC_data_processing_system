Three FR petitions challenging govt's decision to re-impose liquor ban on women fixed for July 16

 
Three Fundamental Rights petitions filed by several social activists including popular actress Samanalee Fonseka seeking an interim order to suspend the re-impose of liquor ban on women by the gazette notification dated January 18, 2018 was fixed for July 16 by Supreme Court.
The court was informed that Supreme Court is to make a ruling regarding a parallel matter on June 18.
The gazette notification lifting the ban imposed on selling liquor to women, employing women in places where liquor is sold or manufactured and time extensions on liquor shops was issued on January 10.
But the Finance Ministry resolved to comply with the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers and abolish the gazette notification issued to lift the ban on the sale of alcohol to women on January 18.
