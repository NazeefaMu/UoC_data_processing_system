Matale school hostels temporarily closed due to dengue

Several schools in the Matale town area have decided to close their student hostels temporarily due to a high incidence of dengue in the area. Intermittent rain in the area during recent weeks had caused a heavy increase in dengue mosquito larvae. Ukuwela, Dambulla and Galewela DS divisions and the Matale MC area have been identified as potential danger areas for the spread of dengue.
District Director of Health Services D M Wijekoon said cleaning up operations are underway in these areas to combat the spread of the disease. Cleaning operations are undertaken in state institutions on Fridays with the participation of employees on a shramadana basis.
Meanwhile, several parents complained that dengue eradication campaigns are neglected in most schools despite awareness programmes and this should gain the attention of education officials.
