The Govt. is our common enemy - MR

 
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said they are never ready to stop the struggle they have launched against the government as the government is the common enemy.
The observation was made by him while speaking at the May Day rally of the Joint Opposition at Kirulapone Lalith Athulathmudali Stadium last afternoon.
Rajapaksa added that he is accused by certain persons that he is going for deals with the UNP. He highlighted that he will never engage in deals with the United National Party (UNP), which is responsible for harassing the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and party supporters.
“I regret that the SLFP is now in the bosom of the elephant betraying the ideals of SLFP founder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. Bandaranaike formed the SLFP with the assistance of five social forces. But, the present leader brought the SLFP to the embrace of the elephant,” he said.
He further said that the SLFP is now in danger of losing its identity as a political party as the result of the coalition government.
“As an outcome of this situation, the SLFP is now in danger of losing its identity as a political party”, he said.
Rajapaksa added that he participate in the Kirulapone May Day rally representing the SLFP since the May Day rally, which organised by the Joint Opposition consists of several parties including the SLFP.
“There is another May Day rally in Galle organised by the SLFP. But, I came here to Kirulapone representing the SLFP. Several persons who went there promised me to come here using the highway constructed during my tenure,” he said.
He added that the Cabinet is equally divided between the UNP and the SLFP in what has been called a national unity government. Eventhough, the policy of this government is decided mainly by the UNP, resulting in a situation where the SLFP has been held captive and forced to follow the UNP line.
Professional groups in this country have been agitating against the decision of the UNP government to sign an Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India. The government is going to privatise the SriLankan Airlines claiming that it is a huge burden to the country’s economy” he said.
However, he noted that the airline had been making profits during his tenure. Even though the Prime Minister says that the airline is not profitable he said that he is not willing to believe it.
He said that the Prime Minister is ready to file a case against him as he had not conducted the war in a proper manner. He said he did not conduct a war but liberated the country from the clutches of LTTE terrorists. Mainly Tamils and Muslims were benefitted by the eradication of LTTE terrorism.
Rajapaksa highlighted that he would never allow anyone to separate the country, which was liberated by him.
He said that regardless that even though the prices of commodities in the world market have drastically dropped, the prices in the local market go up daily.
“If you reload Rs. 100 to your mobile connection, you can talk only to the value of Rs 53 as the rest is deducted as various levies. This government has not even given lovers a chance to use their mobile phones,” he said.
He said the government plans to initiate legal action against Basil, Namal, Gotabhaya and many others.
“I asked Namal to get ready to go in. Wimal too should get ready,” he told Wimal Weerawansa.
Speaking on the loans obtained by his government, he said that an amount of only US $ 12 billion was obtained by his government. Of the US $ 12 billion, US $ 4 billion was spent on the war.
The balance US $ 8 billion was utilised for development activities carried out countrywide, including the Mattala International Airport and Hambantota harbour. But, this government has up to now obtained US $ 7.43 billion.
Commenting on media freedom, he said that media freedom can be seen when considering the letter of the Media Ministry Secretary.
He added that he will stand for the persons who lost their jobs under this government, including those persons removed from the Presidential Secretariat
It was significant that no sooner Mahinda Rajapaksa started delivering his speech, it began raining and no sooner he finished his speech, the rain ceased.
