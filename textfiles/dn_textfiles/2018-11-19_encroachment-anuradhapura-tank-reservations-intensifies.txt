Encroachment on Anuradhapura tank reservations intensifies

The Anuradhapura Senior Citizens Society and many farmer organizations said a large number of people had encroached on reservation lands of tanks in the Anuradhapura district and relevant authorities have not taken enough measures to stop them.
The District Agriculture Committee members had discussed the issue at their many sessions with the farmer organizations and other stakeholders such as irrigation, wildlife conservation, forest conservation departments and the divisional secretaries but they could not evacuate the encroachers so far.
Some encroachers threaten officials who hand over them evacuation notices, he said.
The legal papers to evacuate encroachers should be submitted to the Irrigation Director General for approval. The Irrigation Department Colombo Legal Branch has to carry out further actions. The District Irrigation Directors are not empowered to take legal action against the offenders, they said.
The Irrigation Department control 13 tanks and the Mahaweli Authority controls the Kalawewa reservoir. Around 50,000 perches of tank reservations come under the Nuwarawewa (36,050 a.f.) Tisawewa (3,500 a.f.) Abayawewa (1675 a.f), Mahawilachchiya (30,500 a.f.), Mahakanadarawa (36,250 a.f.) Rajangane (81,000 a.f.) and Padaviya (85,000 a.f.) are occupied by 3,000 encroachers, they said.
Anuradhapura Irrigation District Director Engineer Prasanna De Silva said that during the last two years, many people had not encroached on the tank reservation and irrigation officials prevent people from encroaching on these lands as much as they can.
Police officers prevented people from encroaching on the Rajangane reservations.
Eighty acres of Galgamuwa and Thambuttegama divisions have been now encroached. The Irrigation Department will take these lands back very soon.
Twenty two unauthorized constructions were identified at the Nachchaduwa tank reservation and notices were issued to encroachers to vacate the land.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told Daily News that the illegal activities in tank reservations narrow the tanks, and pollute environment. He said the farmer organization, public organizations and officials must be committed to stop illegal activities in the tank reservations.
