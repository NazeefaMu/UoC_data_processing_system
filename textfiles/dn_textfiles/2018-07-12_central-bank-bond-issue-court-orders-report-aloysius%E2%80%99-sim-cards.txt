Central Bank bond issue: Court orders report on Aloysius’ SIM cards

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday issued an order directing the Dialog Axiata PLC that a detailed report pertaining to mobile SIM cards issued in the name of Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius along with his National Identity Card (NIC) and passport numbers, be submitted to the CID as a part of a magisterial inquiry into the Central Bank bond issue.
Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne issued the order pursuant to a request made by the Attorney-General’s Department through a motion.
Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama, appearing on behalf of the CID, told court that Aloysius had informed that his mobile phone with the SIM card which he was using in 2016, was destroyed in a swimming pool in Singapore.
Girihagama submitted to court that investigations were underway to ascertain whether Aloysius had provided the Central Bank’s information to a third party or not. She said the CID was required to inspect telephone conversation details pertaining to Arjun Aloysius in order to carry out further investigations.
PTL beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the Central Bank bond issue, were on last Thursday, ordered to be further remanded until July 19 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
