Many “faces” of patriotism

Many writers outline the frightening parallels between the United States under Trump and the Weimar Republic in Germany under Hitler. That means no matter how and when the Trump presidency ends, the specter of non liberalism will continue to haunt American politics. Damage done will effect generations to come.
The failures of democratic governance have forged a society reminiscent of pre-war Germany—one in which there’s a growing appetite for the kind of ultra nationalism espoused by Donald Trump influencing leaders like Mahinda in the third world too. Indeed, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has openly praised the Immigration Act of 1924, which not only created quotas and bans on certain immigrant communities but served as a model of sorts for Hitler’s “Mein Kampf.”
The idea in fascism is an end product of capitalism to destroy liberal economic politics. Big corporatists side with politicians who use fascist tactics, because they are trying to divert people’s attention from the real forces that caused the genuine anxiety they feel. This mental condition is not exclusively or even primarily due to economic crisis. People of minority have suffered far greater hardship, and yet they are increasingly drawn to progressive left. With displacement and breakdown of traditions majority nationality is prone to look back with fantasy.
Fascist politics
Trump and his ilk like Mahinda are channeling a noxious strain of patriotism that creates nostalgia for a past that never existed. When the dominant group made to feel like they’re the victims in the face of all the facts, then it is clear that fascist politics is taking grip. The episode also plumbs the phenomenon of fake news, both how it’s constructed and deployed. Many of Aryan and Sinhala most cherished beliefs are based on mythologies; The notion that majority nationality is spreading damma and democracy to the rest of the world perhaps the deadliest of all such beliefs.
“America has never been great,” Trump concludes. “But the idea of America can be great. It’s a future thing, greatness, not a past thing. The past is something we’re trying to overcome, and we’re trying to realize our greatness with certain ideals.” Here is Trump, and people being frightened about the echoes of fascism, not only in US but throughout the world. People world over really talk about society in disarray.
There’s an emotional feeling behind this, that what happens when societies fall apart, and when authoritarian figures hold up a notion of law and order, and the proper nationalism. Basically what they are talking about is mythology, and that’s the Trump and Mahinda connection; they develop a mythology about the past, and about when Germany was great; now they have when America and Lanka were great. They use that as a springboard for basically developing ‘us-them’ philosophy. That is the basic architecture for all such politics.
Black people
American tradition, in which the other was persecuted viciously, is continuing. It wasn’t Donald Trump who is reminding, Americans have to be great by excluding people, which is basically Hitler’s message too. He was trying to find some mythic, pure German. American did that with the Chinese Exclusion Act; rounded up the Japanese; before all that, had killed the Native Americans. American can talk all they want about their liberal tradition, but the thing that comes through in reading is immigrant-bashing, or incarceration of black people. Black people, male and female, represent 13 percent of the American population; they’re well over 50 percent of the imprisoned population that is now two and a half million people.
Pick on one word in particular, patriotism placed in so called architecture of fascism, patriotism, the pure German, make Germany great again–those exact words is, Hitler’s message–and he was as odd a figure as Trump. Hitler, very much like Trump but he invoked some idea of the perfect Aryan, blonde German, and a mythical history, and he was doing this in a Germany that’s falling apart. The echo that found there was this patriotism. Where does the ultimate madness come from? If one is going to talk about Trump as a fascistic figure, he didn’t invent himself; he’s a product–yes, his father was from Germany, and so forth. But the fact of the matter is Trump is a familiar figure in American life.
One doesn’t want to deny the toxicity that certain forms of patriotism can take. It’s just that, as American own history teaches–for example, the Civil Rights Movement, which took place in Alabama in the early 1960s, a terrifying place to hold it. That happened there, and those were Americans who did it.
Many want to honour their legacy and what they did to struggle for advances that, although sometimes it’s hard to see those advances in the face of mass incarceration and the various forms of anti-black racism and oppression of all of Americans that occurred after the Civil Rights Movement. However, Lankan or American have things in our past that are worth celebrating, and they’re worth celebrating because they’re connected to certain virtuous ideals.
Majority group
On the other hand, when patriotism takes the form that Americans are seeing it now–a nostalgia for a white past, a white Christian past–what fascism do is to create a sense of aggrieved, intense victimization by the majority group. Whenever the majority group feeling, yearning for a past that never was, where they got the appreciation they deserved, and feeling that this was taken away from them–that’s what fascism tries to do. It creates this mythic past so that the dominant group feels like they’re the world’s greatest victims.
When white Christians in the United States saying they’re the most discriminated group, then it is clear that fascist politics has taken hold and fascist politics is working the way it does. That’s what Hitler did in Germany. He constantly railed against–Germans were the greatest victims of world history.
He had Versailles ‘agreement’ to use, of course, but he blamed Versailles, bizarrely, on Jews. He said the Germans are the greatest victims. So when the dominant group being made to feel like they’re terrible victims, in the face of all the facts, that’s when fascist politics is taking grip. It’s supposed to create this model, like, ‘we once were victorious, we once ruled, and then foreign ideas came, and liberals made us share our power with foreign forces. Liberalism and Marxism destroyed our supremacy and destroyed this wonderful past where we ruled and our cultural traditions were the ones that dominated.’ Then it militarizes the feeling of nostalgia. All the anxiety and loss that people feel in their lives, say from the loss of their healthcare, the loss of their pensions, the loss of their stability, then gets rearranged into a sense that the real enemy is liberalism or leftism which led to the loss of this mythic past.
