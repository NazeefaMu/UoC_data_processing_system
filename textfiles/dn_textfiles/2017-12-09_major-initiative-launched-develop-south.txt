Major initiative launched to develop South

The Southern region will be developed as a tourism hub and an extensive tourist promotion drive was launched in this regard.
Project officials said it was initiated based on the Madunagala Hot Spring Project in Sooriyawawa.
Proposed development activities include constructions of well-equipped circuit bungalows with restaurant facilities, bathing places, sales centres for Ayurvedic drugs, homes depicting the rural environment in South and spacious sports compounds for children. Work on many of them have already been completed, they said.
