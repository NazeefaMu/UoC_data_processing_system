Sanjay Dutt Goes Back to Jail
Actor Sanjay Dutt was photographed outside his Mumbai residence on Saturday afternoon, bidding farewell to his family before returning to Pune where he has been serving a 5-year jail sentence for his involvement in the Mumbai blasts. The 56-year-old actor was allowed to leave prison for a month because his daughter Iqra, was having nose surgery. (See Pics) Sanjay Dutt embraced his wife Maanyata and hugged children Shahraan and Iqra before leaving for Pune.
His frequent breaks from jail have been criticised in the past as evidence of VIP treatment. The last time the actor was given leave from jail was in December 2014. An extension he applied for then was rejected. Between May 2013 and 2014, Dutt spent over 118 days out of prison. Yesterday, his lawyers clarified that he had never filed for pardon with the Maharashtra Governor. The clarification came after a 2013 petition by former Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju seeking pardon for the actor was rejected by the Maharashtra Governor Vidyasagar Rao.
Dutt was found guilty in 2013 of acquiring illegal weapons from those involved in the 1993 attacks in Mumbai. He was sentenced to six years in jail in 2007; he served 18 months but then was out on bail, fighting the conviction until a court in March 2013 ordered him back to jail in Pune.

Ian Somerhalder to Play Jack Hyde
Fifty Shades Darker:
Movies or TV, movies or TV — how does an actor choose? Ian Somerhalder is reportedly closer than ever to becoming Jack Hyde in Fifty Shades Darker, because rumor has it he may be quitting The Vampire Diaries and that wife Nikki Reed is really pushing him to take the big-screen plunge.
With just a few months left to go until director James Foley rounds up the troops to start shooting Fifty Shades Darker, a few crucial roles have yet to be cast, including Jack Hyde, who is Christian Grey’s rival for Anastasia Steele’s affections in the sequel. Two actors’ names have been repeatedly mentioned as possible contenders: Somerhalder and lesser known (equally as hot) model and actor Theo James. (Yes, Henry Cavill would be the most perfect Hyde of all, but he has already pretty much said it’s not happening.)
In order to take on the role, Somerhalder would likely have to quit playing Damon Salvatore on The Vampire Diaries — something Reed would reportedly love to see him do, both because she knows Fifty Shades Darker would help raise his profile and possibly lead to other film projects, and because it would also mean her new husband could stop working alongside his ex-girlfriend Nina Dobrev.
I haven’t met many women who want their husbands to work with other gorgeous women with whom they had romantic connections for many years, so it’s not that I don’t find that part of this story believable. But Reed seems pretty confident in her relationship and Somerhalder is smitten with her — my guess is that she, like many of his fans, has his best interests at heart and truly feels a leap to movies will catapult him into an even more varied and interesting acting career.
If he is chosen as Jack Hyde, Somerhalder will appear in both Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed.
Like Somerhalder, both Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson acted in projects prior to their roles as Grey and Steele, but the opportunities that have opened up for them since (Johnson is starring alongside Johnny Depp in Black Mass and Dornan plays a lead role in Anthropoid) have been incredible.
This could be huge for Somerhalder, who has had success with TV shows like Smallville and Lost but really has few big movie credits to date.
As Nikki is his wife and best friend, I’m sure his career is the first thing on her mind as she supports his decision (though never seeing Dobrev again is obviously a teeny, tiny perk).
The Stir
What’s in a name?
Ever wondered how a celebrity could have a name that are sometimes quite unusual or unique? Well that’s because they were never happy with their real names in the first place or they were just too long they just had to come up with something better. Meet some of your
favourite celebrities and their real names. The Stir
LORDE: Ella Marie Lani Yelich O’Conner
Incase you were wondering if someone actually names their daughter Lorde, the answer is no. Lorde was given the name Ella Marie Lani Yelich O’Conner. But because the “Pure Heroin” singer didn’t see the name as destined for royalty, she found something much more regal.
Julia Roberts: Julie Roberts
Julia Roberts didn’t stray too far from her chosen name, Julie. But she did change it to Julia because early in her career, the star discovered there was already an actress name Julie Roberts. Looks like this Julie Roberts emerged as the true star.
Jenna Elfman: Jennifer Mary Butala
It’s true that Jennifer Mary Butaladoesn’t have as much of a ring as Jenna Elfman. The California native who starred in Dharma and Greg abandoned a ballet career for the big screen and her birth name for something more star-powered.
Reese Witherspoon: Laura Jean Reese Witherspoon
Miss Laura Jean is just about as Southern as it gets. The star took on her mother’s maiden name, Reese, and turned it into her professional name. If you love the The Hot Pursuit star’s name, it’s still low on the popularity list, ranking #164 out of 1000 on the Nameberry List, so go ahead steal it if your preggers.
Mindy Kaling: Vera Mindy Chokalingam
It turns out the actress and producer never went by her birth name, Vera Mindy Chokalingam. Her Nigerian parents wanted a cute name, so they dubbed her Mindy. When Mindy began her stand-up career the MCs’ couldn’t pronounce her last name, so what’s a gal to do but shorten it?
Jason Derulo: Jason Joel Desrouleaux
The “Talk Dirty” singer didn’t want to overcomplicate things when it came to pronouncing his name, so Jason Joel Desrouleaux chose the stage name Jason Derulo. Derulo is actually just an alternate spelling of his last name, which shares the same pronunciation.
Jonathan Rhys Meyers: Jonathan Michal Francis O’Keefe
Sexy Dublin born Mission Impossible III actor just didn’t think Jonathan Michal Francis O’Keefe was sexy enough. So he said beannacht to his Irish mother’s maiden name and took off for LaLa Land.
Carmen Electra: Tara Leigh Patrick
Because she can! And, it sounds MUCH more star-worthy than Tara Leigh Patrick. Actually, though, it was Prince who convinced her to change her name. The two dated for a while before the Playboy Playmate became a star.
Demi Moore: Demetria Gene Guynes
Moore actually took on the last name of her first husband, Freddy Moore. The actress was born Demetria Gene Guynes. Now try saying that five times!
Charlie Sheen: Carlos Irwin Estevez
Opting for a more Americanized name, Carlos Irwin Estevez took on the name Charlie Sheen, and the rest is history. Sheen’s brother, Emilio Estevez, however, kept his original Latin name.
Vin Diesel: Mark Sinclair Vincent
The Fast and the Furious star actually adopted two of his nicknames to create his stage name Vin Diesel. Mark Sinclair Vincent’s friends used to call him Vin, from his last name Vincent, and because he never ran out of energy some of his pals called him “Diesel.” Hence, Vin Diesel.
Jennifer Aniston: Jennifer Anastassakis
Our favorite Friends star and new wife to Justin Theroux changed her Greek name Jennifer Anastassakis to a more effortless Aniston. She may have taken the lead from her father, Days of Our Lives actor Yannis Anastasskis, aka John Aniston.
Whoopi Goldberg: Caryn Elaine Johnson
Believe it or not funny gal Whoopi Goldberg chose her first name because her friends said she sounded like a whoopee cushion, and contrary to most people moving away from their ethnic names in Hollywood, Goldberg’s mom didn’t think Caryn Elaine Johnson sounded Jewish enough to make it in La La Land. And so, Whoopi Goldberg was born.
Mariah Carey: Maria Nunez
Grammy-winning diva Mariah Carey was born Maria Nunez, but Carey adopted her Venezuelan grandfather’s name, Carey, which he changed from Nunez after emigrating to the US. Mariah’s first name is from the song, “They Call The Wind Maria,” from the 1950s Broadway musical, Paint Your Wagon. At the time it was pronounced Mariah.
Bruno Mars: Peter Gene Hernandez
Born Peter Gene Hernandez, the Honolulu-born singer didn’t want to be stereotyped into just creating Latin music, so he came up with a stage name to skyrocket his career. The crooner took on his childhood nickname, Bruno, given to him because he was both strong-willed and a brute. Mars came about as the singer thought he was “out of this world.”
Alicia Keys: Alicia Augello Cook
The singer born Alicia Augello Cook took to the dictionary to choose her stage name. When Keys settled on Wild, her mom dissuaded her, saying it sounded too much like a stripper’s name. After that she decided to use Keys because the name is “like the piano keys and can open many doors.”
It’s Bollywood’s Jack Bauer
India launches its own Hindi version of terrorism drama 24:
Bollywood screen legend Anil Kapoor has launched an Indian version of 24 where he plays the Indian version of Jack Bauer.
The drama features all the same techniques and drama of the original series, but all of the characters and storylines have been changed to work with a local audience.
Instead of Jack Bauer, Kapoor plays the heroic head of the Indian Anti Terrorist Unit, Jai Singh Rathod.
In the final season of the US version of 24 Kapoor plays President Omar Hassan of the fictional Islamic Republic of Kamistan.
He is in the US to sign a peace treaty which is opposed by terrorists. The terrorists want to attack the United States and kill Hassan.
Unusually, Jack Bauer is unable to save the person who he is tasked with protecting but manages to avert nuclear Armageddon.
Speaking to CNN, Kapoor said that 24 was only previously known in India by those who could speak English. He said his version was filmed in Hindi so every small town and village across the country could tune in. Unlike earlier Indian productions, there are now sequences of singing and dancing. ‘That is not a requirement anymore,’ he added. Kapoor’s 24 is one of the most expensive TV shows ever filmed for the Indian market. Director Abhinay Deo said: ‘We are giving them their star that they love and we are giving them subject matter which is close to them, which is India, patriotism, terrorism, crime, thriller and family emotions. Where can this go wrong?’
Kapoor actually played a Middle Eastern leader in the eighth season of the US version in 2010. The popular actor said he had to bring ‘discipline and professionalism’ from US television to India to get the programmed filmed in time.
The producers created an exact replica of the CTU (counter terrorism unit) from the original US version to bring added authenticity. In the Indian version, Kapoor’s character has just 24 hours to save the country from an impending terrorist attack and save the life of leading politician. In India, much of the daily television output is dedicated to soap operas which go out daily. It is understood that a second season of 24 in India is already in production.
Raj Nayak, chief executive of Colors TV channel which is broadcasting the show said more adaptations of US shows will make their way to Indian screens.
He said: ‘When ‘24’ becomes a hit, be assured that every CEO of every broadcasting company will be on a flight to L.A. to pick up formats. My audience is the masses - the Hindi heartland. They haven’t seen this, for them it’ll be a novelty and something new.’ Daily Mail
