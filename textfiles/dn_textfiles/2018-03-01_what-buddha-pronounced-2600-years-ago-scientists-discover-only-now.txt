What Buddha pronounced 2,600 years ago, scientists discover only now

According to some latest reports from NASA, astrophysicists have, for the first time, discovered a population of planets beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Researchers at the Oklahoma University in the US, have used an astronomical phenomenon called Microlensing, which helps to detect planets. Professors, who made the discovery, using a telescope in space, were so much overjoyed that they declared, “We are very excited about this discovery. This is the first time anyone has discovered planets outside our galaxy, although planets are often discovered within our Milky Way.”
Through the use of these high powered telescopes, located in orbit, scientists have been able to come up with some ideas on the formation of our own solar system including the presence of other planets.
As announced by the Professors, this may be the first time that planets have been discovered outside our galaxy by the present day scientists. Those planets they discovered, probably belong to another galaxy, since the universe is made up of billions of galaxies. While it may be true to state that no evidence of planets has been recorded before now in other galaxies, it is not quite correct to say that “this is the first time anyone has discovered planets outside our galaxy.”
Modern science
No doubt the modern science and the unbelievable discoveries of the great scientists of our time deserve all our highest praise and unequivocal respect. But at the same time, the well recorded history has convincingly revealed that the Teachings of the Buddha goes beyond the discoveries of modern science. Over 2,600 years ago, the Buddha spoke of life on other planets, and said there are thousands of suns, thousands of moons, thousands of continents (Anguttara Nikaya). The Buddha said, again, that there are many, many other galaxies with unaccountable number of planets having different forms of life akin to them, and that they are far apart from one another (Majjima Nikaya). Let us hope that modern astronomy will gradually disclose to the world the startling revelations the Buddha made 26 centuries ago with his wisdom (Panna/Pragna).
Different life forms
Commenting on the nature and composition of the universe, the Buddha explained that many forms of life exist in other parts of the universe, and that these forms of life are found in thirty-one planes within the universe, confined to three different spheres. Venerable Kirinde Sri Dhammananda Maha Thera, an erudite monk, with many publications on Buddhism to his credit explains as follows, the different life forms existing in the 31 planes.
“Sensuous Sphere - (Kama Loka or the world of five senses)
• 4 States of unhappiness or sub human realms: (life in hells, animal life, ghost-worlds and demon-worlds) • 1 Human world. • 6 Develokas or heavenly (celestial) realms.
Form World Sphere - • 16 Rupalokas or Realms of Five-Material Forms. (Corresponding to the four levels of mental repose ( Jhana - Meditation)
Formless Worlds Sphere • 4 Arupalokas or Formless Realms. (Corresponding to the four levels of mental vacancy (Samapatti)
The existence of these other-world systems is yet to be confirmed by modern science. However, modern scientists are now working with the hypothesis that there is a possibility of other forms of life existing on other planets. As a result of today’s rapid scientific progress, we may soon find some living beings on other planets in the remotest parts of the galaxy system. Perhaps, we will find them subject to the same laws as ourselves. They might be physically quite different in both appearance, elements and chemical composition and exist in different dimensions. They might be far superior to us or they might be far inferior.”
