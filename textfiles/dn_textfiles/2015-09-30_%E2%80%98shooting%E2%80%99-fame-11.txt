‘SHOOTING’ to fame @ 11!

He is just 11 and has already earned a name as a shutter bug. Capturing animals is his forte and this talented youngster plans to hold a wildlife exhibition in the near future.
“Animals are my friends and wildlife is my passion,” smiles Dinal Wijesinghe.
“I attend St. Joseph’s College. My interest in photography grew after I got my camera and after seeing many pictures of animals. I mainly take photographs of the wildlife. I have been to Yala and Wilpattu. I like taking wildlife pictures because I find animals very interesting. I have been taking pictures for around two years. I have altogether taken around 100 pictures. I like the leopard in particular,” Dinal told the Daily News.
He says that he is always armed with the camera when travelling with his parents and school trips.
” I also take pictures of interesting places,” Dinal says. “ I have been to Yapahuwa, Panduwasnuwara and Kalutara.
I would also to hold a photography exhibition one day.”
He also reminisces of his visit to Pinnawela.
“It was fun to see all the elephants and I loved watching the baby elephants playing.”
Dinal’s mother Kusumika Wijesinghe says Dinal has been keen about photography since he was small.
“Dinal has about 100 books on wildlife. Every time he goes to a bookshop he goes to the section selling books on animals. He has many other interests but overall he is mainly focused on animals of any kind, be it a serpent, leopard or bird. He also loves watching Discovery, River Monsters and Animal Planet. He does all this wholeheartedly,” she says.
“From the time he was young it has been in him. He had this in him from the time he could speak. He insists on going to wildlife parks. We take him to wildlife parks during holidays. He focuses on a place where he can have easy access,” Kusumika says.
She said at Wilpattu he took some photographs of very rare migratory birds.
“He finds out things on his own and talks to the staff at hotels. This leads to him getting to know where he can capture pictures of animals,” she says.
Dinal’s other hobby is collecting stamps. He also has a silver medal for chess.
The photograph Dinal captured of a leopard at Wilpattu has special memories for him.
“We saw a leopard on the road while during a trip to Wilpattu. This is rare at Wilpattu. This enabled me to capture a unique photograph,” Dinal says proudly.




Dinal’s parents always encourage him.
They always select places which would be helpful to him such as visits to Hikkaduwa.
Dinal fondly remembers travelling in glass boats and seeing fish in Hikkaduwa.
“Whale watching at Mirissa, Galle and dolphins at Kalpitiya were other fantastic experiences. There is a 100 metre gap between the viewer and the whale, because the animal is so big. To see the whale you need to go 25 kilometres into the sea. The whales follow migratory paths so you have to follow those paths. Of course you can’t see the entire whale just its tail maybe,” he says.
Dinal says his interests in wildlife started with prehistoric creatures.
“I collected many books on that subject. I then switched onto the present day wildlife,” he says.
He is also concerned about the possibility of certain species becoming extinct.
His speech at the elocution exam was on ‘Endangered Animals’ - the species and how they are declining. “I spoke about the endangered animals in the world - endangered animals and marine mammals in Sri Lanka. The endangered marine mammals are the Blue Whale, Sperm Whale, Pygmy Sperm Whale, Dolphins such as the Bottle Nosed Dolphins and the Striped Dolphins. On the ground it is the Leopard, the Sloth Bear and the Elephant. If you look at the world Rhinos and Gorillas are in danger. The Pandas are almost extinct, but now there are steps taken to conserve the pandas. I will do all I can to save the endangered animals,” says Dinal with determination.
Dinal’s says his main aim is to protect wildlife while photography is only a hobby.
“Once in Grade 3, there was this little crow who had fallen off from a tree. I tried to protect this crow because the other children were trying to hit it,” he says.
“I am against cruelty towards animals. I will do my best to protect animals in every possible manner,” says a determined Dinal.
