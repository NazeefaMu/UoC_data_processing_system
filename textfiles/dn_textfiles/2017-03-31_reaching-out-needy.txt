Reaching out to the needy

BasicNeeds Sri Lanka (BNSL) with roots spanning over 14 territories all over the world, completed a little over 14-years long journey in the island.
Founded in year 2000 in the UK, BasicNeeds is an international NGO which is pursuing a vision to make sure that the basic needs of all people living with mental illness and epilepsy throughout the world are met and their basic rights are recognised and respected.
Following successful implementation of initial programme to promote and protect the needs and rights of children with, and vulnerable to, mental health problems, BNSL selected Batticaloa District for their second project. The area was chosen after observing the need for such a programme for children and adults in the region, because it had been directly affected by three-decades of violent conflict – with severe physical and psychosocial impacts.
The physical needs were being gradually addressed, however the psychosocial needs of both adults and children continued to be neglected. That was exactly why BNSL stepped in.
Various mechanisms were used in addressing the issues and one of them was working with Children’s Clubs (CCs) to build resilience among children, using the Child-to-Child and Open Dialogue approaches to educating the educators about children’s wellbeing while addressing their own mental health problems.
The project wanted to create space for children to gain knowledge, capacity and agency; to accommodate children’s need for creativity, support and security.
During the Children’s Club meetings, BNSL initiated a series of information-sharing and capacity-building exercises on different subjects, beginning with organisational development aspects like how to conduct meetings, record minutes, handle finances and networking.
Participation in club related activities contributed to improved wellbeing of children as they consider the clubs a safe place, eventually fulfilling the entity’s expectations.
Last year, the Children’s Clubs took up a new initiative: to look at their own community, identify pressing issues and their causes and examine how they affect children’s wellbeing. Working on a “One-Year Action Plan”, each club addressed or mitigated the issues while 24 MOUs have been signed between the Divisional Secretary, ESCO, implementing partner of BasicNeeds Sri Lanka and the clubs, outlining the Action Plans and the roles and responsibilities. Child Rights Promotion Officers (CRPOs) are now supporting the efficient functioning of the clubs, taking BNSL’s intentions to the next level.
