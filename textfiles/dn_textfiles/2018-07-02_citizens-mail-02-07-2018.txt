WHO IS TO BE BLAMED FOR THE PRESENT POLITICAL MESS
Has anyone thought seriously of the present political mess in this country and who is responsible.
He is none other than the former Chief Justice Sarath N Silva. His wrong judgement, which he admitted later, on temporary misappropriation of government funds allocated for ‘Helping Hambantota’ being transferred to the private account of Mahinda Rajapaksa and later reimbursed.
Had the correct judgement being delivered, would this present situation of corruption and mismanagement take place? Would we have had a better person to govern this country? This is a random thought.
