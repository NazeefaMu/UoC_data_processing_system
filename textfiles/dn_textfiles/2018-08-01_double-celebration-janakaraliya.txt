Double celebration  for Janakaraliya

Janakaraliya the multi-ethnic stage drama entity had a double celebration on its 16th anniversary.
Two brand new stage dramas; Thitta Kahata (Bitter Nectar) and Hiru Negena Thuru (Until Sun Rises) produced by Janakaraliya team were staged at the Lionel Wendt theatre on July 14 and 15 to coincide with its 16th anniversary.
The two dramas created by Janakaraliya drama team under the guidance of veteran playwright and cinema personality Parakrama Niriella are based on two hitherto untold concepts in the field of Sinhala theatre arts, either forgotten or unknown by the Sri Lankan society.
Contributors for the twin dramas were, Rasaiyah Lohanathan, Sumudu Mallawarachchi, Sevaraj Leelawathie, Ajantha Shanthakumar, Sarath Banagala, Arosha Tharangani, Devran Sri Livera, Inoka Lankapura, Ruvini Dilanthi, Praneeth Jeevantha, Vijith Hettige, Palitha Abeylal, Amila Dinesh Kumara Thilini Nimesha and Madeera Udishani.
Breathtaking performances by Rasaiyah Lohanathan and Sumudu Mallawarachchi in Hiru Nagena Thuru (Until Sun Rises) were admired by the audience. Sevaraj Leelawathie who performed the role of a grief stricken Tamil mother in the drama was virtually absorbed to her role. She was still in tears even after the drama.
The air force helicopter sound digitally aired to blend with a particular scene of the drama was a novel experience for the viewers.
Actor, Sumudu Mallawarachchi said, the theme of living in harmony is a norm accepted by the majority of people in the world and the object of Janakaraliya is to nurture and communicate this message to the masses.
The motivation and vigor of this multi-ethnic team of youth to popularize the message of Janakaraliya is tremendous.
Janakaraliya, founded by Parakrama Niriella and late H A Perera has been continuously working for the development of Sri Lankan theatre arts and for an inclusive culture through social integration.
Janakaraliya is a multi-ethnic platform to share values, customs, traditions and cultures via stage plays, irrespective of one’s religion, race, language or caste.
Parakrama Niriella said, “After experiencing limitations in aesthetic aspect in street dramas, we worked on revamping street drama to have proscenium qualities. Circus Maduwa concept of ours had qualities of a New Arena Theater. Janakaraliya dramas are staged in New Arena style mobile theaters in outstations”.
Janakaraliya mobile theatre has been transported and installed in 22 different locations throughout the country and has conducted 14 drama festivals.
Over the decades, Janakaraliya multi ethnic drama troupe has produced and performed 12 long dramas in both Sinhala and Tamil languages across the Country. In addition they have produced and performed 26 short dramas in both languages.
