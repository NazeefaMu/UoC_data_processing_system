‘Tobacco cultivation down by 300 hectares’

Tobacco cultivation in Sri Lanka have gone down by 300 hectares since the Government had taken a decision to discourage the cultivation, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Ministerial statics show that 2,500 hectares of tobacco cultivation was in Sri Lanka earlier and now it has decreased by 300 hectares, the minister said. He was addressing a meeting of the Inter Country Consultation on Alternative Livelihoods for Tobacco Farmers and Workers held in Colombo recently.
The Minister said a survey will be conducted to find ways to promote soya, banana, and pepper cultivation among farmers to encourage them to get away from tobacco cultivation.
Around 25,000 Sri Lankans die from smoking and of them, five percent die from passive smoking. Introducing alternative crops for tobacco farmers in accordance with the WHO instructions would save them, he said.
