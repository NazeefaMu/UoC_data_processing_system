COMBANK launches ‘Gedarata Thégi’ promotion

The much anticipated return of the Bank’s popular ‘GedarataThégi’ mega promotion offers remittance customers an opportunity to win 45 prizes each quarter over the next nine months and 47 prizes that are to be presented at a grand draw at the end of the promotion.
Besides the grand prize of a Hyundai Eon car and the second prize of a motor scooter, Commercial Bank will present 15 refrigerators, 15 washing machines and 15 microwave ovens after the final grand draw of the second edition of this promotion.
At each of the three quarterly draws, the Bank will present 15 hampers each worth Rs 15,000, 15 gas cookers and 15 rice cookers to customers who received remittances via the Bank in the preceding three months.
Users of e Exchange, Commercial Bank’s own money transfer service, as well as those who receive remittances via MoneyGram, Express Money and Ria from April 1 to December 31, will automatically go into these draws, the Bank said. Holders of a Commercial Bank Remittance Card – a branded Debit cum ATM Card licensed by Visa Inc. – who receive remittances via the Bank during the year will double their winning chances at these draws.
“True to its title, ‘Gedarata Thégi’ offers gifts for the home that can enhance the quality of life of our remittance customers,” Commercial Bank’s Head of Digital Banking Unit Pradeep Banduwansa said. “Commercial Bank is already the preferred Bank for remittances due to its focus on this segment of business and the convenience of its extensive branch and ATM network.This promotion is a further demonstration of our commitment to our remittance customers.”
Commercial Bank is one of the most active players in Sri Lanka in the field of remittances.
One of the Bank’s key strengths is its island-wide network of 261 branches, many of which remain open on public, bank and mercantile holidays, and its network of 758 ATMs, which is the largest automated cash dispensing system owned by a single bank in Sri Lanka.
Recipients of remittances sent to the Bank enjoy many benefits such as over 65 holiday banking centres and super market counters, a dedicated customer support call centre for remittances and SMS alerts facilities once the remittance is received and is ready to be paid out.
