CIMA Mind Challenge 2018  quiz competition held

CIMA Mind Challenge 2018, the annual quiz competition hosted by the CIMA Students’ Society (CIMASS) has been organized for the 20thconsecutive time this year. The event was held on April 22, at the Hilton Residencies JAIC Hilton.
Mind Challenge is one of the most sought-after and anticipated quiz competitions in any quiz enthusiast’s calendar. Branding itself under the tagline “The Ultimate Quiz!”, the quiz competition catered to the quiz whizzes from the CIMA fraternity, the corporate sector, State and Private universities as well as people who hail from other professional qualification bearings as well.
Last year, the CIMA Mind Challenge was revamped and made pro by transforming the quiz competition into a case study competition. The competition last year was concluded with stellar success, and due to popular demand, the CIMA Students’ Society brought back the traditional quizzing arena and its warriors into action this year.
Such a platform would undoubtedly aid in furthering CIMASS’s aim of enhancing the soft skills possessed by the participants in order to flourish in an ever-evolving competitive professional work atmosphere. In addition to that, Mind Challenge is the perfect platform for networking opportunities; for people of similar interests to converge, exchange ideas and swap business cards. Amongst the 26 teams representing both individual and corporate teams, team “High Flyers”, an individual team cinched the Mind Challenge 2018 Trophy, with the team from Dialog Axiata PLC and an individual team “Declining Returns” followingas the 1stRunners Up and 2nd Runners Up respectively.
Fashion brand REBORN stepped in as the official Main Sponsor for Mind Challenge 2018 for the fourth consecutive year this time. The Education Partner for Mind Challenge 2018 was BMS, and the official Photography/Videography Partner was Vevra.
