Moods inspired by the Muse

Drawing its inspiration from the rousing examples of successful women who have persevered against the odds, leading intimate apparel label amanté, unveiled its Autumn-Winter 2017 “Muse” Collection at a fashion show which was recently showcased in town.
The chic new collection was launched on September 21 at the ARQ Style House, where ladies were invited to find their muse, and celebrate those women that have dared to forge ahead.
In keeping with the theme of evening, prominent Sri Lankan thespian, speaker and activist Shanuki de Alwis shared her experience in overcoming a fear of public speaking, and the inspiration she took from the example of her own personal muse, her mother. Pointing to examples when women had dared to defy social norms to make lasting changes to their society and culture, she urged to draw strength from the examples of those who came before, and inspire the next generation to strive to even greater heights.
amanté is the first Sri Lankan brand to design intimate wear to compliment the silhouettes of the South Asian woman. “With our Autumn-Winter collection we hope to move the amanté brand into a space that speaks to the aspirations of the modern Sri Lankan woman. Each style in our new collection was created to give expression to the grace and strength of the feminine spirit,” Sasanka Bandara, General Manager-amanté Sri Lanka and Bangladesh explained.
Designed to inspire, the new collection pays tribute to the graceful femininity and strong substance of women everywhere–it celebrates women with courage to take risk in pursuit of a dream, those that embrace adventure, and those that persevere against overwhelming challenges.
The collection weaves together a striking color palette of rich reds and blues, mixed with smooth and light floral prints, elegant strips and botanical prints.
amanté’s “Muse” collectionis built around five styles: Lace Marvel, a padded, full cover lace bra with a pretty front picot strap with lightweight lace that sweetly transitions from dots to a floral and then geometric designs for a layered effect; Floral Fantasy, a tasteful and sophisticated padded, full cover bra that showcases an entwined floral design; Floral Blossom, a full cover wired bra with cups of printed microfiber inspired by the fragile beauty of nature; Delicate Bloom, amanté’s best-selling non-wired silhouette renewed in a limited edition seasonal print and Twilight Wonder, a demi-bra that offers less coverage for a youthful fit and a smooth, clean neckline.
