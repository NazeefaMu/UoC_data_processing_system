Firm foothold for ethnic harmony

The people of Sri Lanka, holding on to one another and trying to stand up on solid ground, have been slipping and falling from time to time from the many community pedestals they have set up for themselves. This has caused all to pull them downwards together and crash in a mighty tumble. The ethnic, language, religious, cultural differences have given rise to destructive rivalry leading to fratricide. All need to recover their senses and build ourselves into a national family living in a common homeland.
The diverse communities, Sinhala, Tamil, Muslims, Burghers and other minority groupings with their Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Christian and Atheistic and Rationalist identities have for a long time vied to stand hegemonically isolated and in a domineering and authoritative manner. The absence of frank dialogue and lack of understanding of one another’s hopes, aspirations and human yearnings have brought not only estrangement but also suspicion and distrust. It is time to dispel that and build mutual trust and understanding.
Though accidents of birth in various communities have put us together in an island home, we have together failed to live in our community habitations under one Sri Lankan roof. Our particular ethnic and community identity has blinded us to the need for national solidarity and even human fraternity and sharing.
Some have even tended to hijack patriotism for narrow and selfish political purposes to provide for themselves alone a dubious ownership of the Island, a security in wealth, power and privileges. They considered others patronisingly or as uncompromising rivals and enemies who should be forcibly controlled through state power or the barrel of a gun and if possible eliminate them completely from life itself. Thus some groups decided to terrorise, slaughter, murder and assassinate and resort to genocide to secure their power of domination over a whole people. These attempts have been inhuman, foolish and unsuccessful.
political struggles
Business magnates are concerned about economic gains and high returns on their investments while the politicians of today concern themselves about a good share not only of the gains of business magnates but also of prominent wholesale and retail traders as well as a share of the till collections along with the trustees of the temples of sundry gods and goddesses.
Meanwhile in the economic melee the gap between the rich and the poor widen and the voiceless poor continue to suffer. The elected representatives of the people are endlessly at loggerheads. They cannot come to a workable collective consensus on co-existence, development, progress and distributive justice. Lacking a vision and moral strength they often capitulate and succumb to their own narrow and selfish individual objectives and those of the powerful. The net result of their narrow political struggles is the ambushing of the poor in a blind alley.
We in Sri Lanka have to ask ourselves and honestly answer hard questions and answer them reasonably. We need to acknowledge that all of us, even persons devoted to religion, are sometimes not reasonable. To think and act unreasonably is contrary to our human nature. What are the democratic and human values we wish to uphold and live by? How often have racist conscienceless politicians and even religious leaders since Independence in 1948 ignored those values and instigated by inflammatory rhetoric, have let loose hordes of unthinking sword and knife-wielding thugs on helpless and innocent people?
Haven’t well planned capricious, racial and religious hatred and volatile social chaos been caused in our lifetime with overt and covert support of governments, politicians and state agencies? Acts of abhorrent hatred have occurred even as recently as 2014 in Aluthgama, Beruwala and Dharga Town in Kalutara District. Are we and should we be continuing to anchor ourselves in the mindset that brought about such hatred and destruction?
Have we lost the moorings of civilised behaviour and promoted anarchy through prejudice, envy and jealousy? Is that what has been reaped today after 2500 years of civilisation and the influence of the religious culture of four world religions over many generations? Have we understood how that came about and are we collectively prepared to withstand such anti-social provocations? Could we stand together and prevent them?
The sad and heart rending events and unimaginable human tragedies, compounded by the horrors of war which have left individuals and communities in isolation and divided this country, should be relegated to the past. Memories should be healed. Though recompense adequate to recoup the losses of human lives could never be made, just and fair reparation should be made to help the survivors of the horrors of war and racial fratricidal tragedies to recommence their truncated economic activities and rebuild their lives. In a free Land there should not be any “internally displaced people’’. All should be helped to become one people freely linked in a growing national identity to become one people, made one out of many communities.
New Constitution
It is in the context of a great political failure and misrule of partisan governments during the last seventy years that today a New Constitution is to be framed. Even the experiences of the last seven decades do not seem to be sufficient to some politicians who are deaf and blind with short memories, for they do not hear the cry of the helpless and the poor. They do not see nor remember the carnage and injury, arson, destruction of property and looting of people’s belongings including jewellery, desolation and despair that have affected the people of this country. It is the duty of the present rulers to put a definitive stop to all of these.
A new beginning dawned on January 8, 2015. The promised New Constitution should re-establish firm moorings for solid and stable democratic values, new relationships among all citizens, for renewed ethnic and religious communities to flourish among all Sri Lankan citizens in every part of the country. Thereby the human dignity, rights and duties, mutual self-respect and honour of all should be upheld, protected and promoted.
There are voluntary organisations of concerned citizens working in many spheres indiscriminately to improve the lives of citizens in various ways and they should be given the moral support of the government.
The best of constitutions could be nullified by inept, ego-absorbed incompetent legislators and others exercising power. The democracy minded people of Sri Lanka are now striving to grow up to higher levels of social maturity through inter community solidarity and through inner purification. Religions and fraternal religious leaders should be helpful in that.
It is one thing to adopt the draft of a New Constitution, present it to the people at a referendum, and promulgate it after the people have approved it; it is quite another to swear verbally to uphold it and yet flout it in practice. Many legislators not knowing what they have sworn to defend have often in letter and spirit flouted and desecrated all the constitutions thereby breaking the law. There should be a minimum of civilisation and culture to sustain the Constitution. The present level of civilisation and culture of the legislators, who should be mindful of all the people of the land, leaves much to be desired. Many are social oddities insufficiently educated to shoulder national responsibilities and unconcerned about the perennial human values that underpin humanity. It is too much to hope that all the legislators would transcend themselves.
Nevertheless the people hope that at least the greater majority of the legislators will be patriotic enough to be able to transcend themselves when considering the draft constitution and make it a lasting and suitable instrument of security of all the people and appropriate for good governance.
