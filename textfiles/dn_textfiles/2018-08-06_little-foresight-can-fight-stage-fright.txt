A little foresight can fight stage-fright

If the prospect of getting up in front of a group of people and performing terrifies you, you are not alone. Millions of people suffer performance anxiety, commonly called ‘stage-fright.’ It is actually the number one fear among most people. And for many it is a terror greater than the fear of death.
Welcome to the world of public performances. Most of us are familiar with encountering pre-performance nerves. Very few can perform publicly without experiencing some sort of nervousness. For many it generates an anxiety that borders on panic almost prompting them to bolt off stage.
Broadly speaking, it is an irrational fear, brought on by our tendency to judge ourselves. Still, in the case of stage fright, it is a self-induced anxiety which does not pose any real threat to our lives. Stage-fright afflicts almost every performer, the experienced and the beginners alike. Athletes, musicians, singers, stage actors, comedians, magicians, and public speakers have often suffered performance anxiety at some stage or another.
Experts call it the ‘flight-or-fight’ reaction. Most people have the same kind of response the first time they face an audience. We are all conversant with the often crippling symptoms that give us the jitters. These may include heavy breathing, a thumping heart, cold palms, profuse perspiring, knocking knees, butterflies in the stomach and an unfocused mind.
The more serious cases may be accompanied by gut-wrenching manifestations such as nausea and vomiting. Some famous entertainers admit to having stage-fright to the extent of throwing up and confess this has persisted through their entire careers. But somehow they still manage to cope and execute brilliant award-winning performances.
It’s nerves, darn it, that causes this type of debilitating dread which may often occur just before the performance. As the shrinks say, anxiety about anxiety is the real problem we are dealing with. Performers when becoming aware they are anxious or nervous, aggravate that anxiety by making themselves anxious about being anxious.
In most cases such negative impulses are triggered by lack of preparation. This is a primary cause of stage fright. If an entertainer is unsure of his or her ability to execute a successful performance, that adds to even more pressure and agitation. The main trick is to concentrate on the positive factors of your abilities. Also it is important is to take the focus away from yourself so you can concentrate completely on the performance itself.
As a professional presenter, I have observed many leading artistes and public speakers gripped by fear and almost paralysed by nervousness before coming on stage. That happens largely when they focus on themselves and their anxiety rather than the performance or presentation at hand. It can also result from the fear of facing the role as a threat, rather than a challenge.
Learning to overcome stage-fright at auditions and appearances is a challenge every performer must face. Perhaps the best method of dealing with fear and stage-fright is to know your act like the back of your palm. Preparation is unquestionably essential for any successful undertaking.
Hardly any roles are ever complete without an adequate amount of homework. The aim is to have all the content structured as early as possible to allow sufficient time to work on your role. Whatever approach you decide on would be acceptable, as long as it flows and rings out as natural. If you know what you are doing, you will be more relaxed and focused and ready to ‘wow’ your audience.
Understanding the etiquette of performing in public can help one get a clear perspective about ways to respect one’s audience and get across the messages you want to share with them clearly and effectively. As you raise your awareness of simple yet efficacious steps you can take to show you care about the act and your audience, you will become more unperturbed and confident of yourself as a refined performer. Stage-fright is normal and healthy. And if you are dealing with this fear in a positive way, you can use it to boost your performance and get better results in the execution of your role. Focus your attention on giving the audience the best presentation possible. You are there to serve them. The more determined professionals deliberately train themselves to shrug off such fears and become so practised at stepping in front of an audience that they can actually enjoy the process and have fun.
Riddled with too much stress before you step on stage will compromise your performance. A little bit of nervous energy is good, and can stimulate your performance but too much will impair it. The fundamental problem for many people is a lack of confidence. Confidence is the answer to overcoming first night nerves and having great stage presence. It is self-belief that will allow you the freedom to storm the stage and enjoy your experience. The more effortless a performance appears, the better it will be.
You just have to develop the ability to make yourself relax and understand that it isn’t a big deal even if your performance is less-than-perfect. Developing a coolness on the boards is also going to come from facing your fears and just getting up on stage and performing. And because of that your stage presence will appear natural and be more effective. Having good stage appeal comes as a result from being confident. It starts with getting rid of your stage-fright, and getting yourself comfortable to the point where you enjoy performing. After you have mastered that, you can move on to completing your performance by adding to it some innovative stage gimmicks. But be certain not to go overboard and spoil it.
And always remember to breathe deeply. Clearly, this is the best thing to do when suffering from stage anxiety. Take deep, slow breaths, the kind you take when there is a pleasing scent in the air. Count them, and do at least twenty. Breathing is the first line of defence against fear.
Also remember that the audience is there to have a good time. They don't want you to fail. Those people out there want to enjoy the show, not plot a strategy to see the end of your career as a performer.
If you suffer a case of stage-fright, do not let it overwhelm you. As mentioned earlier it is a common problem. And yes, it is true that everybody gets it. But everybody can get over it as well. It can be overcome with patience, resolve, training and practice. Many great performers in diverse fields began their careers hounded by this very fear but were able to overcome it.
Essentially, learn to be comfortable with yourself and be yourself. That is a sure way of socking it to your audience and knocking their socks off! [email protected]
