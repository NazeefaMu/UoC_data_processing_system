What is breakfast?
The word breakfast is really two words, ‘break’ and ‘fast’.
‘Fast’ is when you don’t eat food, and all during the night you have been sleeping and not eating. So, breakfast is when you break your fast by eating. Your stomach will be very happy about it and your body will be able to use the food to get the energy it needs.
Why is breakfast important?
 
What you eat is turned into energy by your body. If you don’t eat when you first get up, then your store of energy is low, you can’t think or work as well and your stomach keeps letting you know that it is waiting for food! By the time morning break comes along you are ‘starving’.
 
Some breakfast ideas
Whatever happens or whatever you do during your day, it is a good idea to have something to eat when you wake up.
*Whole meal toast, cereals and eggs all provide the power (energy) your body needs to get through the morning.
*Milk and other dairy products are especially good for growing bodies and healthy bones.
*Having a toaster can mean that you get something warm without having to stand over the cook top.
*Using a blender to blend fruit and milk into a smoothie can give you a quick, easy meal with lots of goodness.
