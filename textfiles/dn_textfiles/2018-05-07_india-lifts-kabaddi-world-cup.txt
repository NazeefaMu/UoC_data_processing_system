India lifts Kabaddi World Cup

The 15 day sporting adventure from the Kabaddi World Cup held in Ahmadabad came to an end with India lifting the World Cup for the eighth time.
The final against Iran was a tight clash but the Indians proved that this sport belonged to them. Although Pakistan was missed in this tournament, Iran filled its spot by making it to the finals, and no doubt Iran performed as best as it could. Iran’s defeat of South Korea that had defeated India in its opening match made them proud of themselves that they might win the final against India. But that really turned out to be a mistake for them.
The India Team won the final with a score of 38-29 and the match was considered a good clash rather than a one-sided dominance.
