The Chinese are working towards making China a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful.
In addition to the Third Chinese Film Festival, held in Sri Lanka this February, the 2nd Chinese Cultural Fair will be held at Arcade from March 1 – 4. In around two weeks comes the Chinese New Year - Chinese New Year of dog.
The Chinese Film Festival is one of the major events to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year, also called the Spring Festival, is one of the oldest festivals in China, which dates back 4000 years ago.

The film Festival which was a resounding success once more showcased some of the finest Chinese movies created in China. The movies were splendid and well received by the audience. The eight films did not disappoint and really made an impression on the audience.
Eight highly acclaimed Chinese films featuring romance, action, fantasy, suspense and fairy tale was screened at the National Film Corporation, starring world famous Chinese Actors.
Chief Guest Secretary of Public Administration and Management, J J Rathnasiri pointed out that culture is an essential part of any country.
“Language, history, Literature and economical activities are a part of this. China is one of the world’s oldest civilizations with thousands of years of years of history. When it comes to ancient civilizations there is the Mesopotamian civilization, the Indian Civilization and the Chinese Civilization. China has contributed to world culture by the creation of the Great Wall of China. Sri Lanka and China have enjoyed a good relationship dating back hundreds of years. We know the Fa-Hsien, the Chinese Buddhist monk came to Sri Lanka and lived here for several years.
After 1957, Sri Lanka and China, signed several agreements related to Economic, Health, Cultural and Education. There was also the signing of the historic Rubber Rice Pact, between Sri Lanka and China in 1952 bringing in a lot of advantages.
The Cultural relationship is one of the best facets of the relationship between Sri Lanka and China. The third Chinese Film Festival brings to Sri Lanka Chinese films that will help Sri Lankan people enjoy the many aspects of Chinese Culture and its film industry,” said Rathnasiri.
Rathnasiri added that these events can help strengthen the relationship between China and Sri Lanka that began long years ago.
“Today we can see the involvement of China in various spheres in Sri Lanka. We know that the BMICH was a gift from China in memory of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. The same goes for the Lotus Tower presently under construction. China is involved in that as well as many other activities,” said Rathnasiri.
Economic and Commercial Counsellor Yang Zuoyuan in his address stated that with the great support of the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka, the Chinese Film Festival has been successfully organized in the past two years with attendance of over 2700.
“We hope that the Happy Chinese New Year celebrations will bring joy and harmony to the Sri Lankan people,” said Zuoyuan.
Zuoyuan explained, that recently the world has witnessed a fast development in the Chinese film industry.
“In 2017, 970 films were produced in China. The box office revenue rose 13.45 percent on year-on-year basis to 55.91 billion RMB yuan, about 8.4 billion US dollars. 54 percent of which is generated from China-produced films. The total audience reached over 1.6 billion. The number of screens has increased 23.3 percent to 50,776. China has become the 2nd largest movie market in the world. The Embassy will continue to work with Sri Lankan to promote professional and technical exchange and cooperation in the film field between our two countries,” explained Zuoyuan.
The year 2018 marks the first year following the successful conclusion of 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It marks China’s entry into a new era. It mapped out a new blueprint for China’s development in the coming decades. The Chinese people from all ethnic groups under the leadership of CPC are working hard to realize Two Centenary Goals.
“One is to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020, and to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful by the middle of this century and to realise the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We believe that people all share the same dream for a better future of the world,” said Zuoyuan.
China and Sri Lanka are good neighbors, good friends and good partners. 2000 years ago, our ancestors established friendly relations through ancient maritime Silk Road. Now it is time for us to jointly build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road to deepen mutual beneficial cooperation and realize common development.
“The year 2018 also marks the 70th Anniversary of Independence of Sri Lanka. In the past seven decades, Sri Lanka has made tremendous progress in all fields. I am confident that Sri Lanka the pearl of the Indian Ocean will shine with even dazzling brilliance,” Zuoyuan said.
