GMOA ridicules Cabinet reshuffle

Sri Lanka removed the world’s best Finance Minister. Either Sri Lanka or the world has made a mistake, Government Medical Officers’ Association Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA is asking for the removal of the Health Minister since 2016 and he will be removed in 2018. “Then the President will say the country will be able to move forward with new vigour and hand over all state hospitals to the Media Minister,” he added.
“A male nurse cannot tell a professor to go home. The GMOA will meet ILO and complain to the International Judiciary if required. The GMOA hopes the Government will stop repressing trade unions before that. Cabinet Ministers sends letters without dates. That is the quality of their standard,” he said.
“The GMOA challenged the civil organisations and their leaders to gather at least 1,000 people and show their support. These so called civil organisations and NGOs depend on dollars and implement agendas of foreign countries. They cannot decide which direction Sri Lanka should go. They never talk about abolishing the pension. The relevant authorities should investigate how and who funds them,” said Dr. de Zoysa.
