Committee to negotiate with petitioners on Delimitation Gazette

The Party Leaders yesterday decided to appoint a three member committee to negotiate with six petitioners who filed petitions in Court of Appeal seeking an order to make Delimitation Gazzette inoperative.
The committee comprises of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and TNA Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran.
These six petitioners obtained an Interim Injunction preventing the holding of Local Government elections.
During the party leaders’ meeting, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of negotiating these petitioners in order to get their petitions withdrawn.
He pointed out that these petitions have paved the way for the interim injunction by the Court of Appeal preventing the holding of the Local Government election.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the Local Government elections should be held in January as decided earlier and the Provincial Council Elections to follow in March.
The Gazette that was issued on August 21, 2015 was studied in detail at the meeting yesterday.

The party leaders also focused on filing a motion in the Court of Appeal on November 30 to expedite the court procedure without waiting till its next date of hearing scheduled for December 4.
They also decided to seek the possibilities of holding the election within the limits of the 2015 Gazette Notification (The attention of the Party Members’ was drawn on the view that since the issue has been raised with the 64 Multi Member Constituencies, the 2015 Gazette could be implemented on the other wards).

In addition to the leaders of the parties represented in Parliament, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, Local Government and Provincial Council Minister Faizer Mustapaha were present in the meeting.
