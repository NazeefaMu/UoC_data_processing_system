‘Biased electoral system during previous regime caused delay in LG polls’

An attempt for a biased electoral system by the previous regime was the major cause for the delay in Local Government polls, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka yesterday pointed. “During the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, there were certain changes introduced to the electoral system. However, there was much resistance against the attempt then because the proposed electorate system seemed in favour of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party,” Minister Ranawaka said.
He also said the new government opted for a new and fair delimitation process. However, some groups have made it a legal issue by complaining of minor errors in the Gazette Notification with regard to this matter, in court.
Minister Ranawaka also urged for the Local Government Polls to be held at the earliest possible date. He observed that people must not be robbed of their sovereignty which is exercised through the vote.
The Minister made these observations in a video published on an official social media page.
