Tiger Woods acknowledges 'sun is setting' on his career

ger Woods, who is 'on the couch' recovering from his most recent back surgery as his U.S. compatriots prepare to take on the Internationals in next week's Presidents Cup, knows full well that the end of his Hall of Fame career is in sight.
With no timetable for when - or if - he'll be able to rebound from a second microdiscectomy, NBC/Golf Channel analyst Notah Begay III said on Wednesday that his close friend had no illusions about his future.
"I think he has a clear understanding of where he's at in regard to his career," Begay said of the former world No. 1 who has plummeted to 299th in the rankings. "The sun is setting."
Such a statement, which Begay made during a teleconference promoting the biennial competition that will take place in South Korea starting on October 8, should come as no surprise to anyone who has a passing knowledge of Woods' recent struggles on the course and in the OR. Still, to hear a Tiger intimate say such words out loud was jarring, even though we are all aware that the 14-time major winner will be 40-plus before he swings another club in competition.
