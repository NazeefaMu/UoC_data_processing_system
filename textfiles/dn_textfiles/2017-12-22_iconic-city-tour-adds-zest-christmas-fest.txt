 A Christmas Edition of the iconic Colombo City Tour service operated by Ebert Silva Holidays was launched yesterday at Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.

This service is offered on a complimentary basis for tourists.
Minister of Touirsm, John Amaratunga speaking at the launch noted that Sri Lanka was keen on developing event based tourism and Christmas and Vesak have been identified as key calendar events. “In the last few years we have transformed Colombo in to a festive hub during the Christmas season. This year we have gone a step further in association with the private sector which is the driving force behind this initiative,” said Minister Amaratunga.
Speaking on the launch Chairperson, Ebert Silva Holidays, Rajini De Silva Mendis said that Ebert Silva Holidays was very happy to be a part of the city celebrations and that the City Tour busses will link the festive events with the hotels. “We are offering a complimentary shuttle service for foreign guests as well as for Sri Lankans to get to these locations in an enjoyable manner, celebrate and then get back to their hotels using the same service.”
“I commend the Ministry of Tourism and Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau for initiating this, so that foreign visitors will not be missing Christmas at home.”
General Manager, Galle Face Hotel, Deni Ohlsen-Dukic said that Galle Face Hotel was honored to partner Sri Lanka Tourism and Colombo City Tour on this venture.
Also present at the occasion was Alston Koch, the award winning Sri Lankan born Australian artiste who has been specially flown down to Colombo by Sri Lanka Tourism for the launch of Christmas Fest, Christmas Street and other seasonal events.

A foreign tourist, Ms. Connie Sommers from Germany who was present at the launch recalled that she first visited Colombo back in 1991. “Today, Colombo is a very clean and well maintained city. The old buildings are maintained well and the people are very nice. This is a really interesting experience which I’m looking forward to,” she said.caption:
