Monthly salary for disabled War Heroes mooted

The Defence Ministry will soon seek Cabinet approval to grant monthly salary to disabled War Heroes during their lifetime, instead of their pension payment.
Currently, all the disabled War Heroes are paid their monthly salary with all other allowances until they reach their retirement age.
They are provided with pension benefits and the retirement compensation after they retire.
That decision was taken considering the requests of War Heroes who held a protest in this regard recently.
The protesters claimed that their monthly pension is inadequate to cover their expenditure and needs and they request for the payment of a monthly salary for their lifetime.
The Ministry is currently seeking for legal requirements to fulfill this demand.
