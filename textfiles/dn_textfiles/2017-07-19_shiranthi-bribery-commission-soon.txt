Shiranthi before Bribery Commission soon

Former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa is to be summoned to the Bribery Commission soon.
Sources within the Commission to Investigate into Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) said she had a number of cases attached to her and investigations into them were mostly complete.
The Investigating officers expect to call her in for a statement within the next week. Rajapaksa was initially called in for questioning by the Commission in 2015 and on that occasion, it was reported that she was questioned for close to four hours.
