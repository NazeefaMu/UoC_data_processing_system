March madness at Waters Edge

Waters Edge will celebrate all “Wonder Women” in all shapes, forms and sizes at a especially curated High Tea done with much love and care by Executive Pastry Chef Nalin Hewage on March 8. This High Tea will feature hand-picked sweets and savouries for you to enjoy with your friends, co-workers or women you look up to.
Then the Bakery at the Edge has you covered with an array of sweets and savouries. Delicious designer cakes, cupcakes, cookies, flowers from Lassana Flora and jewellery from Chamathka will be available on the day.
“Ladies Night” will take place at the Long Bar featuring free cosmopolitans for the ladies, gifts, games and surprises. The boys too can join the party after 10pm.
March Madness
From March 9 onwards the Boardwalk will entice groups of 10 and above with some exciting deals. The restaurant cum bar overlooking the Diyawanna Lake has some exciting offers for groups of 10 and larger groups of 20.
Thuna Paha is One
In celebration of the first anniversary at the authentic Sri Lankan restaurant Thuna Paha, a grand buffet will be put together on March 11. The evening will feature a “Paduru Sajjey” and there will be a guest appearance by Sri Lankan actor and singer Kamal Addararachchi.
The feast of St. Patrick
In commemoration of Saint Patrick’s Day, Waters Edge will bring alive typical Irish food and beverages on March 17 at the Long Bar. Dance to the sounds of the Slipping Chairs and don’t forget to wear green!
Good France Dinner
Together with the French Embassy in Sri Lanka, Waters Edge will once again celebrate French gastronomy with a specially curated seven-course dinner at Pranzo March 21. This dinner created by award-winning Executive Chef Buddhi will also feature perfectly paired up sparkling wine.
Rotti for the Soul
Nothing makes a better midnight snack than some piping hot rotti. Add spicy mutton curry, traditional chicken curry, creamy seafood, good ol’ eggs or some stir-fried vegetables inside it and you have a treat like no other. From March 29 – 31 Night Kade will pay homage to this favourite Sri Lankan street food.
