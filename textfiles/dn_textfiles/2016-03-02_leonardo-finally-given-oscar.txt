Leonardo finally given an Oscar

The 88th Academy awards was one of most anticipated and talked about events for the 2016 calendar. First of all, it was all about how some of Hollywood's leading A-list actors stayed away from the Oscars for the fact that not a single Black Actor was nominated in any role this year.
The host for this year's award was none other than a black actor - Chris Rock - who took his role to explain the #OscarsSoWhite protests. He added: It's the 88th Academy Awards, which means this no black nominees thing happened 71 other times.
"You got to figure that it happened in the 50s, 60s. One of those years, Sidney Poitier didn't put out a movie. Black people didn't protest, because we had real things to protest at the time. We were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer. When you're hanging from a tree, it's really hard to care about best documentary short."
He also added that everyone should be given equal opportunities - they want black actors to get the same opportunities as white actors.
So, moving on from that, we move to the night's biggest winners. The actors who received their Oscars did a pretty darn good job in their roles and deserved to take the Golden Man home. I think more than any of the other winners, the wait and anticipation for Leonardo DiCaprio's win was sky rocketing, when Facebook just went mad with GIFs, hashtags, posts and so many wishes and comments after Julianne Moore announced his name.
Some say Leonardo won for all the hype his fans and people created via social media and the Oscar should have gone to some else like Redmayne for his impeccable role as the first ever Transgender Lili Elbe. Even Matt Damon for his role in the Martian, where he is left behind on Mars as his friends think he is dead after a storm separates them. Watching this film, you actually do start to think "how in the world would you survive if you ever do become the only person to live somewhere and rest of humanity is far beyond reach or not there at all". As I am sure, all of you would have watched the Oscars, I won't bore you with anything else, but for the ones who missed it, here's the full list of winners.
