Over 35 dengue deaths and 20,000 cases to date

A total of 20,457 dengue cases had been reported from all parts of the country up to this month with 36 dengue deaths. The death rate has dropped to 0.81 percent from 0.25 percent as reported last year, National Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Hasitha Thisera said.
Addressing the press at the Government Information Department Auditorium, Colombo, he said the highest number of dengue patients was reported in January. It is 6,342. He added that mosquito breeding places should decrease to one percent from the current three percent to achieve better results.
According to Dr. Thisera, the number of dengue patients had decreased by 11,000 this year compared to last year. Special attention needs to be paid to the North and East with regard to mosquito eradication programmes because districts such as Ampara, Batticaloa and Trincomalee are in the high risk category.
Dr. Thisera said out of all mosquito breeding sites, religious places are reported to have 8.27 percent breeding sites while public places have 7.51 percent. The percentage of mosquito breeding sites located in constructions sites is 6.84. Factories have 6.40 percent of mosquito breeding sites.
