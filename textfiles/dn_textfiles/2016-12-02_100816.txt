The world today is not governed by monarchy, but it has a true democratic system. Therefore, politicians who take the leadership in this context should always have the qualities of democracy, said President Maithripala Sirisena.
The President was speaking at a ceremony to felicitate former Minister Raja Samaranayake, at the Maithri Hall in Bandaragama on Wednesday.
“Though power and corruption go hand in hand, it is the honest politician who will be honoured by the people. Former Minister Raja Samaranayake is a good example for such a politician,” the President said.
“Through the felicitation for ideal political characters such as Raja Samaranayake, the government aims to respect them as well as use them as examples and role models for today’s politicians,” he said.
