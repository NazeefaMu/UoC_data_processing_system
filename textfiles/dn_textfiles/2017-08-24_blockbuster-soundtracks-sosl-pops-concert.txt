BLOCKBUSTER SOUNDTRACKS AT SOSL POPS CONCERT

Transport yourself into worlds beyond – from The Lord of the Rings to the Chronicles of Narnia or embark on a Mission Impossible, traipse the streets of Chicago, immerse yourself in tales from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King and watch The Gladiator from the grandstand! The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka takes you on a whirlwind journey of timeless classics and blockbuster soundtracks at its annual SOSL POPS concert on the 16th and 17th of September at the Bishop’s College Auditorium with a promise of an extraordinary evening of film soundtracks guaranteed to have all film enthusiasts asking for more. Under the baton of Dushyanthi Perera, the programme gains added lustre with four amazing soloists Bhathiya Jayakody, Shehara Liyanage, Dinushka Jayawickreme and Amandhi Caldera.
The sweeping grandeur of the Symphonic Suite from the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe from The Chronicles of Narnia aptly open the curtains for a programme replete with classic film and Broadway hits, which have over decades serenaded, entertained and regaled audiences around the world. Whether it’s some swinging jazz that is so archetypically George and Ira Gershwin or some toe taps in the Salute to Ol’ Blue Eyes arranged by John Boss, a medley from Chicago reminiscent of the emotive nuances of passion, jealousy and hate or the story of the star-crossed lovers from Casablanca, the orchestral scores accompanying expressive solo voices revert you to eras past or times of the future.
Step into the fantastic stories of Walt Disney’s Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King and let out the child in you. And of course, there are missions to complete as speed defying stunts become vivid backdrops for the theme from Mission Impossible and you hear the roar of the spectators as The Gladiator marches into the arena, intense in its portrayal in the music of Hans Zimmer. Then there’s a trio of songs made popular by the phenomenal Josh Groban, all of which make this a memorable evening reminiscent of the thrills and spills of the silver screen combined with some poignant moments that brings on a tear or two.
SOSL POPS is sponsored by First Capital Holdings PLC and supported by SriLankan Airlines, the Airline Sponsor with creative partner JWT and electronic media sponsors Yes Fm, TV1 and Legends 966.
