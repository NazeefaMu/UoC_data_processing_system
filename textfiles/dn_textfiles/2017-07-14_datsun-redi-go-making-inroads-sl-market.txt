Datsun  Redi-Go making inroads in SL market

Datsun originated in Japan as DAT-GO (the DAT-car) almost a century ago in 1914. The word DAT means ‘lightning-fast’ in Japanese but is also a reference to the first letters of family names of the three financiers who supported the business at the time: Den, Aoyama and Takeuchi.
Datsun entered the Sri Lankan automotive market with Datsun Red-GO over a year ago, providing a modern choice for the local customers. The Datsun redi-GO Concept represents independence and a clear mark of success for the new age customers. Its modern crossover style and bright lime body-colour give it a head-turning presence on the road.
The Datsun Redi-GO is available at all AMW Automall outlets islandwide. AMW in partnership with its finance partners, LB Finance, Vallible finance, CDB Leasing, Capital Leasing and People's Leasing Company are offering unbeatable lease options to customers, whilst buyers could also stand a chance to win discounts, free registration and insurance.
