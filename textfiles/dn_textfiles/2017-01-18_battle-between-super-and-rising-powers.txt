Battle between super and rising powers

Before the formation of the National Unity Government after the Presidential elections and the Parliamentary elections in 2015, the foreign policy decision makers in Sri Lanka had made very serious errors and miscalculations in taking foreign policy decisions. These foreign policy errors have resulted in the USA and other Western states and also India, our closest neighbour, adopting an antagonistic attitude towards Sri Lanka.
After the defeat of the Rajapaksa regime, the National Unity Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have taken some corrective steps which have contributed to the restoration of the cordial and friendly relationship with the western countries and also India while continuing to strengthen the friendly relationship with states such as Pakistan, China and Russia that supported the Rajapaksa regime by extending economic, political and military support in diverse manner.
Sri Lanka’s foreign policy
In this article, I am attempting to examine why the USA and other Western countries and India with which Sri Lanka had a very cordial relationship and supported the peace process facilitated by Norway with a very strong sense of commitment, later changed their attitude to Sri Lanka and adopted a hostile attitude. I will also discuss the corrective steps the present government has taken to reorient Sri Lanka’s foreign policy for the restoration of the cordial relationship with all countries, specially the Great Powers and the Rising Powers both in the West and in the East and how far the Sri Lankan government has succeeded in its attempt to do so. I have also focused on the challenges that the National Unity Government is confronted with in balancing its relations with India and China, the two Asian neighbours.
After the end of the war, President Rajapaksa expressed his commitment to initially attend to the most urgent needs of rehabilitation and resettlement of the displaced persons and reconstructing damaged infrastructure facilities. The Sri Lankan government also gave an undertaking to India and to the international community that it would take steps, as a priority matter, to make necessary amendments and implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution for making the devolution of power to the Provincial Councils meaningful. However, India and international community realized that the Rajapaksa administration lacked the political will to negotiate a political settlement with the Tamil leaders.
Withdrawal of support from the West
The Western democratic countries that supported the Sri Lankan government during the peace-process facilitated by Norway, brought to the attention of the United Nations the allegations of serious violations of human rights of the civilians and also allegations of war crimes during the war. They insisted on the need for investigating these allegations both against the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE.
The Sri Lankan government’s position was that what the Sri Lankan armed forces were engaged in was a humanitarian operation, all necessary steps had been taken for the protection of civilians and war crimes were not committed by the Sri Lankan armed forces and therefore there was no need to hold any investigations against the Sri Lankan military forces. The USA and other democratic states that took the initiative for bringing this issue of violation of human rights of the civilians and also war crimes by armed forces were supported by the Indian government. By doing so, the Indian government indicated its disappointment with the Sri Lankan government’s failure to understand and address the legitimate grievances of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. What was required, after the completion of the war was addressing the root causes of the conflict. But the leaders of the Rajapaksa government argued that what Sri Lanka experienced during the last thirty years was only a terrorist problem and not an ethnic conflict.
This position of the Sri Lankan government disappointed not only the Tamil community in Sri Lanka it also irritated the Tamil community and their leaders in Tamil Nadu. It has been an aspect of the political culture in Tamil Nadu that some political problems of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka became political issues in Tamil Nadu politics. With the return to power of Chief Minister Jayalalitha and her AIADMK party in 2011, the State government urged New Delhi to increase pressure on the Rajapakse government on a range of issues including alleged war crimes and the continued hardships faced by the Tamils in the North and East.
The pro-LTTE political parties in Tamil Nadu and their political leaders accuse Sri Lankan government of war crimes during the final stage of the war. There were several anti-Sri Lanka protests and demonstrations in Tamil Nadu in 2012 and 2013. There were also several attacks on Sri Lankan pilgrims who visited India, organised by some Tamil Nadu politicians. It was due to the influence of Tamil Nadu politics and also India’a alliance with the USA and other democratic counties in the West that India supported the USA initiated resolutions in the UNHRC in Geneva in the years 2012 and 2013 against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka found itself confined to a very precarious situation after India openly supported the resolutions.
In addition to passing resolutions in the UNHRC based in Geneva, the Western countries had suspended providing economic assistance to Sri Lanka. But the reoriented foreign policy perspectives of the present government have contributed to the resumption of financial assistance by these countries.
The Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his economic policy statement in Parliament in October 2016, stated that along with the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and lending institutions of the USA, Europe and Japan have now expressed their willingness to lend Sri Lanka funds at considerable low rates of interest. He stated that the last time such funds were made available to Sri Lanka was between 2001-2004 when he was the Prime Minister. He further stated that in 2003 the application process for GSP+ facility was initiated. This concession of entry into EU markets extended to the garment industry in Sri Lanka was immensely beneficial to Sri Lanka. But, Sri Lanka lost the GSP+ incentive in 2010.
Referring to the progressive steps that the National Unity Government has already taken to revive the cordial relationship that Sri Lanka enjoyed with the Western democratic countries, the Prime Minister, in his economic statement to Parliament further stated: “During the last year the President Maithripala Sirisena and I have travelled to key destinations with an objective of reviving the interest in Sri Lanka. During my recent visit to Brussels, the officials of the European Commission expressed their confidence that the GSP + trade concession would be given favourable consideration. The Japanese Prime Minister has also appointed a senior official to especially coordinate the Japanese - Sri Lanka Joint Comprehensive Partnership Programme. Towards creating newer markets for our exports, we are also negotiating three trade agreements, ETCA with India and two FTAs with China and Singapore”.
During the last session of the UNHRC in Geneva, Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution for setting up a transitional justice mechanism because the government believed that holding such an impartial investigation regarding the serious allegations of humanitarian law and war crimes was an essential step for achieving reconciliation among the different communities in Sri Lanka.
The obvious fact is that the United Nations was intervening in Sri Lanka on behalf of a minority community, the Tamil community who strongly feel that their rights have been seriously violated during the course of the war and they have appealed to the UN through their agents for intervention. The UN has an obligation to intervene in an internal conflict in a state where a weaker party to a conflict is subjected to inhuman treatment or genocide by the armed forces of the government.
Dependence on China for managing the economic crisis
The state of isolation that the Rajapaksa government was confined to, internationally, compelled the government to seek the support of China for implementing many development projects planned by the government. The most important projects for which China extended its support were the construction of the harbour at Hambantota and the airport at Mattala close to the harbour.
The harbour and the airport at Hambantota were constructed in a strategically very important location as far as the interests of China are concerned. It is a well known fact that China has already constructed harbours at several strategically important locations in the Indian Ocean. These harbours are viewed as pearls in the “string of pearls” strategy aimed at increasing its control over the Indian Ocean. Indian leaders and diplomats have occasionally voiced their concern regarding China increasing its involvement in the development projects in Si Lanka – especially the strategically significant projects like the construction of harbours and airports. China had also financially supported the construction of some highways.
Another strategically important development project is the Colombo Port City, now called Colombo International Financial City project. It is a Megapolis built adjacent to the Colombo port by reclaiming land from the sea. It appears that when these high profile projects were planned the financial viability of the projects had not been taken into consideration. They can be considered as merely image building projects of the former head of the state – Mahinda Rajapaksa.
During the Presidential election propaganda campaign in 2015, Ranil Wickremesinghe promised to the electorate that he would stop the building of the Colombo Port City and, accordingly, just after the election, the Chinese construction company was directed to discontinue the construction work.
The construction work had been suspended for several months, but after fresh negotiations with the Chinese government, the construction company was permitted to resume construction work. According to the agreement signed with the Chinese company, China has to provide the capital for the construction of the Port City and Sri Lanka has to compensate for China’s financial contribution by allocating a part of the city to be used by china on a 99 year lease.
For overcoming the problem of making the Hambantota harbour a financially viable enterprise and also the problem of repayment of loans obtained from China with interest, the government happened to seek the assistance of China again and sign an agreement with the China Merchants Port Holdings Company. According to this partnership agreement, 80% of the port ownership would be vested with China Merchants Port Holdings Company and the balance 20% will be held by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. According to the proposed agreement a certain extent of land belonging to the port will be leased to the said company for 99 years. The government has also agreed to lease a large extent of land to the same Chinese company from the Southern Province for the development of special industrial zones.
Economic and commercial interests
India is aware that the increasing cooperation between Sri Lanka and China for development activities in Sri Lanka is motivated by economic and commercial interests only. Sri Lanka wants to maintain equally good cooperative and cordial relations with both countries. Sri Lanka is prepared to accept whatever cooperation India is prepared to extend to the economic development in Sri Lanka. In fact, India has shown a keen interest in integrated economic development with the neighbouring countries including Sri Lanka.
The Indian government, immediately after the end of the war, offered to assist the Sri Lankan government regarding the most urgent needs of the Tamil community in the North and East who had suffered immensely as a result of the war. India provided financial assistance for implementing several projects for rehabilitation and reconstruction. India had extended financial assistance for reconstructing roads and railway lines and also 50,000 houses for the displaced families. Another project undertaken by India is the construction of the coal power plant at Sampur.
The Sri Lankan government and the Indian government have started discussions regarding many other projects in which Indian investors can cooperate. Sri Lanka has also shown a keen interest in signing the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) without much delay. Some sections of the business community and professional organisations have expressed concern regarding the signing of the ETCA because of the difficulties such as non-tariff barriers experienced by the Sri Lankan businessmen in exporting their products to the Indian market. Representatives of the governments of India and Sri Lanka have already started intensive discussions regarding such issues.
China is not a threat to India’s interests in Sri Lanka
The globalization process has compelled both India and China, being rising powers in Asia, to cooperate for promotion of trade and investments and consequently China is now India’s largest trading partner in goods and both these rising powers are competing now for global markets.
Therefore, China’s increasing involvement in development projects in Sri Lanka should not be considered as a threat to India’s security interests. Both countries, being nuclear powers, have shown pragmatism in managing their disputes without permitting them to escalate to dangerous levels.
However, Sri Lankan leaders should use their diplomacy to keep India informed of the real nature and objectives of all agreements with China to ensure that our closest neighbour, India, may not misperceive or misunderstand China’s involvement in Sri Lanka.
