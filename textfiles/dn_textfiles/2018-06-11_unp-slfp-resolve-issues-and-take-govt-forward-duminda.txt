UNP, SLFP to resolve issues and take Govt. forward - Duminda

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) are attempting to resolve the issues within the Unity Government via discussions, SLFP National Organiser, Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The Minister said discussions are being headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to resolve issues and take the National Government forward.
“Both parties were discussing on how to build and maintain trust in going forward,” the Minister added.
Speaking to journalists following an event in Rajanganaya, Anuradhapura, Minister Dissanayake stated contrary to views expressed by some SLFP members, there were no discussions during the recent SLFP Central Committee(CC) meeting about the party trying to quit the Unity Government.
Dissanayake said during the first CC meeting following the appointment of a set of temporary office bearers, the SLFP had mainly discussed about party reforms.
The Minister also said the party had discussed about the JVP’s 20th Amendment to the Constitution and a decision was made to appoint a committee to study it.
Dissanayake further said that he believed President Maithripala Sirisena should be the SLFP’s candidate at the next Presidential election.
“The President has said he would contest only once, but I think he can once again galvanise all forces which supported him. We should end hate politics and the President can do it,” Minister Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake said some within the party are criticizing him for the role he is playing and added that he had come out with the President to defeat the Rajapaksa regime at the last Presidential polls, and would continue to support the President and the Unity Government in the future as well.
