‘Country needs healthy foreign trade policy’

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) requests the President to provide them with an opportunity to explain a foreign trade policy that will protect the country’s job market and health sector, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA appreciates the assurance given by the President that any foreign trade agreement will not be signed that harms the country. But a `foreign trade policy’ formulated by a gang of foreigners has been launched now that could harm the country.
The media reported that a Sri Lankan delegation left for India yesterday to hold the final discussions on ETCA. It comprises foreign nationals and Sri Lankans who do not have any interest in protecting the country. They carried out various discussions on ETCA openly and secretly in the past, he said.
The GMOA explained to the government and the country several times that the ETCA would put Sri Lankan job market and several business sectors in jeopardy, he said.
