Pannipitya Private Hospital to provide  Suraksha benefits to schoolchildren

Pannipitya Private Hospital has made arrangements to provide treatment sans cash payments to all schoolchildren who own Suraksha Insurance cards.
Schoolchildren islandwide with Suraksha medical insurance could obtain treatment from private hospitals by settling the hospital bill paying cash and then getting the amount reimbursed from Sri Lanka Insurance. However the Education Ministry has made special arrangements with seven prominent private hospitals to provide treatment without having to settle the bill by paying cash immediately after treatment.
Considering the high quality service and reasonable-low prices of Pannipitya Private Hospital, the Education Ministry has decided to grant this special status to Pannipitya Private Hospital too.
The Suraksha Insurance Scheme introduced recently by the Education Ministry is provided to all children in government, private and international schools and student Bhikshus carrying out their studies in Pirivenas. The Suraksha Insurance Scheme provides an annual hospitalization medical cover of Rs 200,000 per student.
The normal method of obtaining medical insurance benefits is by the patient initially making the payment to the hospital and them submitting the bills to the insurance company for reimbursement. However with arrangements now made with the insurance company to pay medical claims directly at Pannipitiya Private Hospital for Suraksha Insurance students, Schoolchildren will get the opportunity to settle their medical claims without paying cash.
“Our hospital that cuts off unwanted expenditure and passes that benefit also to the patients, with mush pleasure takes this opportunity to grant all benefits that comes under the Suraksha Insurance to our schoolchildren. We are also delighted that Pannipitiya Private Hospital had been granted the facility where children with Suraksha could settle their claims sans cash payments. We see this as a huge benefit for parents who admit their children for treatment to Pannipitiya Private Hospital,” said Chairman and Managing Director Ananda Kuruppuarachchi.
