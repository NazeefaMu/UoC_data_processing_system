Leshan’s unbeaten ton earns mammoth win for Isipathana

An unbeaten 162 off 165 balls with fourteen boundaries and seven sixes by Leshan Amarasinghe and a five wicket haul by Isira Kamalgoda helped Isipathana College register a 205-run win over Ananda Sastralaya in the first round of the Under 17 division one cricket tournament. The match was played at the Colts ground recently.
Invited to bat first Isipathana were four down for 86 but a 144 run fifth wicket partnership between Leshan and Shamika Wickremathilake (37 off 62 with two boundaries) saw them reach 276/5 in their allotted 50 overs.
Isira Kamalgoda grabbed five wickets for six runs off 7.1 overs while Tharusha Perera was rewarded with three wickets for nine runs off six overs to restrict the Sastralaya innings to 71. Charith Thiwanka (18) was the highest run getter.
