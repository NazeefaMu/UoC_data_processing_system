Final Score: Goal without score

Can we simply sit back and chill when the world is in shambles? Forget the Rupee depreciation, crime wave and Trump playing havoc on the world scene, and here we are, going on with our merriments. On the other hand, what else can we do? Even if are fully privy to the tragic circumstances of our surrounding, we are in no position to undo or rectify any of them.
That principle seems to govern Scott Mann’s Final Score.
The place is London. The event is a soccer match. Duration? Apparently 90 minutes! Set amid such a sporty occasion, we are transported to a forceful meditation between entertainment and enigma. A gang of terrorists kidnap the niece of a one-time war warrior with the incredible hulk-like physique and deadly combating skills who moves heaven and earth to set things right.
The battle between Michael Knox, the one-time war warrior, and the terrorist gang is full of clichés as well as thrillingly fresh perspectives. It reaches various culminations before the soccer match is over. Interestingly the soccer fans are blissfully oblivious to all what happens just around them. Even a warning from a janitor would hardly disturb their cheery mood.
This duration of 90 minutes is decisive as we get to experience dreadful deaths and assaults. The soccer game is in the full swing with the fans revelling in it, yet the audience behind the screen has to come to terms with the reality: the stadium will be demolished at some point. That striking phenomenon offers Scott Mann ample opportunity to exercise his imagination in action.
Final Score has more clichés than fresh perspectives for an action genre enthusiast. They will find less to indulge in this template. Yet the movie is not short of some thrilling nuances.
The plot offers a delicious episode as Knox’s comrade enters the scene. Quite untypical of action movies, this character does not fear the gun. Not only he seems seasoned in gunfights, but he does not dread the weapon when it is aimed at him. He remains calm and sticks to that composure as the plot advances and right up to the moment when he chooses to shoot himself down.
But the disturbing element of the movie lies with the West Ham audience oblivious to the gunfights and other expressive machismo taking place in the surrounding. How would they have possibly escaped the detection when the gunfights reach lethal levels with murders, motorbike chases over the concourse and other insanely gory details of terrorists in action? Was that generated on purpose to enhance the contrast between the terror and entertainment?
A mention must be made of Michael Knox. The character is not created to make a superhero effect. He falters at times (many times, in fact) only to rise from the very ashes taking a worse beating. But as any of us would guess, the final score is destined to be his.
He is the lead character in action, so the rest of the villains have to be beaten out of the game for our hero to emerge. Though that campaign is heavily at work, Scott Mann has set up quite a few hurdles the superhero to emerge while not to be mistaken as some ‘supernatural’ hero.
But where does it take us, the audience? Michael Knox scores, but without much goal as it was apparent throughout the movie.
