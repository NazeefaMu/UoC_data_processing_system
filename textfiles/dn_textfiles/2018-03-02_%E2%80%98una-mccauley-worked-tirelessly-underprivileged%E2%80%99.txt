‘Una McCauley worked tirelessly for the underprivileged’

“It was with a deep sense of regret that I learnt of the untimely passing of Una McCauley, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka,” said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, in a condolence message.
“I found the late Ms. McCauley committed to tirelessly supporting the underprivileged, and making special effort to understand the causes of their problems.
“As UN Resident Coordinator, on several occasions, she discussed with me the need to resettle IDPs and other issues related to Muslim IDPs and women’s rights.
“The late Ms. Mc.Cauley also supported the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by taking the time to attend events related to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 9 on industries, innovation and infrastructure.
“Even very recently - on January 8 - she was the chief guest at a workshop organized by the Consumer Affairs Authority, which falls under the aegis of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with UNIDO, where she strongly advocated for the need to ensure stringent regulation of consumer rights.
“I admire her sincerity, dedication and commitment to the people of Sri Lanka, and join my staff in extending our profound sympathies to her family and the UN.”
