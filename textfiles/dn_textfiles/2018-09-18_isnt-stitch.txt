This isn't a stitch-up!

Wiltshire-based artist Elizabeth Bond, 31, decided to attract attention to her exhibitions by creating the world's longest knitting needles.
They measure 4.4 metres (14ft 6in) in length and have a diameter of 9.01cm (3½in).
Elizabeth says she is proud to show exactly what art students can accomplish. "Everybody has potential if you just keep striving and pushing forward," she says.
"Give it a go, what's the worst that can happen?"
Betsy Bond, 30, chose the end of year Creative Exhibition at Wiltshire College Chippenham on Tuesday, June 13 to unveil her giant needles, which measure a staggering 4.4metres in length and are 9cm in diameter.
She then impressed visitors to the event, including Chippenham Mayor councillor Mary Norton by demonstrating how to knit on such a large scale.
Bond, of Dauntsey Lock, said, “It was a wonderful evening and I am thrilled that so many people came along and saw all the hard work that the entire creative art department has put into the event. I decided to go for the record as when I found out what it was I believed I could beat it. I wanted to achieve rather than just aspire. It has been a challenge that I have enjoyed every minute of."
The current world record for the World’s Largest Knitting Needles is 3.98metres long with a diameter of 8.25 metres and was set by Jim Bolin from the US in May 2013.
The knitting needles were then used to knit a tension square of 10 stitches by 10 rows.
Betsy has so far knitted 85 stitches using Stockinette provided by Manchester based company Rodo Group, who kindly donated 16kg to help her achieve her challenge.
The needles, which had to be transported from her home to the Chippenham campus on a trailer, have been made from polypipe and the points and stoppers were printed in college by Nicholas Llewellyn-Jones at the Wiltshire 3D Enterprise Centre.
