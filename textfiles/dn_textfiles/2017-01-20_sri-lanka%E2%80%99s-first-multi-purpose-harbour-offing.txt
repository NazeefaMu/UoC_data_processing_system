Sri Lanka’s first multi-purpose harbour in the offing

Sri Lanka’s first multi-purpose harbour is to be built combining Fisheries, Tourism, and Commercial sectors with the aid from the Korean Government, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
“Multi-purpose harbour will be built merging the Udappu, Kelani, Madigala, Delft, and Thangalla ports. It will create employment opportunities and a favourable economic atmosphere,” he said. The State Minister was speaking at a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
Gampaha District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Ajith Mannapperuma said the government had cancelled the agreement of outright ownership of the Port City lands and a lease agreement had been drafted instead to withhold the ownership.
Criticising previous regime’s decisions, Mannapperuma said: “The Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port reported a loss of Rs. 37.2 billion to date.
The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport and Mihin Lanka Airlines reported losses of Rs. 13.6 and Rs. 17.2 billion by June 2015.”
“Ninety percent of the government’s revenue comes from taxes. However, low income earners bear more than 80 percent of the tax expenses. As a government, we will take measures to reduce tax burden of low income earners and distribute taxes among high and low income earners equally.”
Referring to the tax payments of the high income earners, Mannapperuma said the number of income tax files had been increased from 694,000 to 1,450,000 from January, 2015 to 2016.
“Tax revenue for 2015 was 15 percent from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and tax revenue for 2016 was 16 percent from the GDP. The government wishes to increase the revenue and reduce tax burdens on the poor,” he said.
He said the Gampaha District saved Rs. 80,000,000 by following the contract service procurement process recommended by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The State Minister said 2016 recorded the highest exports of fisheries and aquatic resources. The gap between imports and exports will be reduced by introducing effective measures, he said.
