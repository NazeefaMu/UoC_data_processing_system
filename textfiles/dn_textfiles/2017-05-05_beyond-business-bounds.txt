Beyond business bounds

To function as an “ex”-traordinary Leader you need to sense see and capture the invisibilities of your surroundings…To be empowered with this visibility and possibility shifting your life and your work to a new dimension is a categorical imperative.
As the world evolves from one stage to another many facts that were established in the past seems obsolete. Even The Big Bang Theory is question-nable today.
As we move along with growing Business complexities and conquering Global challenges …alongside we grow in consciousness…we see and sense more and more of life and great business visions. If we are to guide and lead the world we need to be working with an adequate mental instrument sensing and conceiving the world with pre-cognitive abilities, not leaving our dependency on only known facts of life.
It is evident that we are at a threshold of a new age in consciousness. Dramatic changes in all spheres moves the world at an extraordinary pace compared to a few decades ago - so is the business world.
A few individuals will lead this new era, elevating themselves to a higher level of logics and understanding to face these new challenges. They will lead the world and its people to a new dimension in meaningful and purposeful living.
Humanistic values
“Perhaps you head a large corporate, wealthy, powerful, famous or certainly in the right direction to be there…
Engage your fortes to shift your life and your professions to a new dimension that empowers you to transform the planet to a better place and it’s people, to individuals of real humanistic values. Move the glory of your greatness beyond its mortal limitations.”
I will not bore you filling this artifact with detailed citings and facts of some of the greatest Leaders in the planet who with their Innovative and Visionary Thinking, have thrust the world to what it is today with all its splendor and great living environments……and some of the largest corporates who recorded astounding heights in overall growth and development with high emphasis on innovation and evolutionary centered thinking. Instead, I have tossed out a few important guidelines of what, ideally it means to move our work and life to a new dimension.
So what’s a new dimension in life and in work? Primarily let’s take life.
Physical mind
Moving your life to a new dimension is a migration into a new state of consciousness and cognition…attired with a new cognitive instrument to perceive, comprehend and capture the world with a higher sense of logics and understanding and through a wider dynamical zone than our five sensory footprint . In the sense that we recognize and even engage our non-physical faculties for progressing with human potentials such as Intuition, precognition clairvoyance and other powers that are treasured beyond the powers of the physical mind.
These undiscovered new Cognitional Faculties empowers you to sense ,see and achieve astounding accomplishments beyond the reach of an ordinary Mind.
This is not a spiritual or paranormal transcendence, but an elevation to the highest state of consciousness within our organic scale.
In our professional engagements we are going beyond the accomplishments of power, wealth and fame. Our focus here is of a humanitarian and heroic nature. While holding on to our visions and missions in whatever is our profession we are moving our energies and efforts in contributing constructively toward the betterment of the whole human race along with positive changes in the economic social and political affairs of the Planet. You’ll only see it as an obligatory and praiseworthy task when you have moved your life to these new levels of cognition.
In view of the present issues that the world is facing……The world is in need of ex-leaders… Leaders who has the capacity to think not “behind the box…but’ beyond the rational mind, beyond pragmatic thinking skills.
We have seen many addressing these issues for many decades with not much success, perhaps perceiving worldly problems with an ordinary state of logics and understanding.
Moving your work to a new dimension means guiding and directing the world and its people to better living conditions with the integrated strengths of your extraordinary intellectual abilities and your rich material possessions and dignified recognition.
Higher intelligence
To transform to extraordinary levels in leadership and management you need a liberalized mind detached from the influence and interference of your existing knowledge and life’s experience, beliefs and convictions and your ego-driven attitude …….You need to be a visionary with foresight, and engage certain promptings of a pre-cognition and premonition nature and to exercise your liberty to think abstract , illogical to hypnotize extrapolate, before you find out that they are imperceptible or elusive… In simple terms you function from the zenith of your mind that enables you to be connected to your higher intelligence.
 
In this new dimension
* You will mentally advance yourself from a five sensory to a multi-sensory Individual …in the sense that you will also encompass non-physical realities as part of your growth and development process.
* You will grow in mental-psychic clarity and will make personal and business decisions on the basis of intuition as well as rationality.
* You’ll understand psychological growth as evolutionary and develop methods and institutions not just to cure emotional disease but foster the growth of consciousness.
* You’ll see education, corporate education and personal growth and development as a discipline in moving to higher stages of consciousness, body, mind and soul to spirit and re-construct educational, cor-porate and personal growth theories and institutions accordingly, with special emphasis on hierarchic development.
* You’ll use mass media, instant telecommunication and human/computer linkages as vehicles of bonding consciousness and unity.
* You’ll re-define and re-write the principles of business management embracing the vertical growth of consciousness as a strategic constituent part of a Innovative Business mechanism powered to move business efficiencies and growth potentials to unimaginable heights.
* You’ll lead and guide the world and it’s people to live a more meaningful and purposeful life
You need to be bold and daring in your thinking and have the courage to shoulder any type of criticism before you see and feel the glory and ecstasy of your innovations.
This could be achieved by moving your work and our life to a new dimension…Where the glory and ecstasies of success transcends material limitations.
There are no social, financial standards, academic principles or disciplines that governs this migration and this quantum shift in leadership visions
Let me welcome you to a bold and daring journey in search of our undiscovered cognitive instruments that will thrust our life’s to a higher state of consciousness, logics and understanding… Let’s make a responsible choice to move our professions and our life to a new dimension empowering us to continue our prosperity and experiences beyond its material boundaries.
We don’t intend transcending to a supernatural state but we do have what it takes, to bravely say!
“Yes I intend to continue serving the planet and its people for many more centuries to come, in my own chosen way.”
