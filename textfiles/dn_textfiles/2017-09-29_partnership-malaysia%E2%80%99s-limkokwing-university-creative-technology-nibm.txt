National Institute of Business Management (NIBM), launched its futuristic education centre- the National Innovation Centre (NIC) in collaboration with Malaysia’s Limkokwing University of Creative Technology with an investment of over Rs 50 million.
The inauguration ceremony of the NIC will take place under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on the 20 October 2017.
Established by NIBM, which celebrates 50 years of excellence in human capital development, NIC will present a highly conducive environment for empowering the future generation with the demanding entrepreneurial skills along with modern technology, innovation and creativity.

The strategic synergy between NIBM and Limkokwing integrates the best of both worlds by merging their illustrious features to deliver high quality education.
Located in the heart of Colombo NIC is a national resource centre which offers a host of programs to groom a new generation of full-fledged graduates armed with the highly sought after skills. Students can choose from a range of programs that include Multimedia, Fashion, Design, Architecture, Communication, Journalism, Sound & Music and Information Technology. The institute delivers globally acclaimed professional knowledge and qualifications in addition to helping the students develop core competencies to become creative and commercially astute. Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Chandima Weerakkody expressing his views on NIC said, as a game-changer in Sri Lanka’s creative institution sector, NIC will adopt most modern teaching methodology to create independent and versatile professionals equipped with up-to-date knowledge. These young professionals will possess fine capacity to serve in a multitude of industries including Design, Film, Sound, Music, Broadcasting, Journalism, Communication, Fashion and IT.
“Creativity and innovation are two of the most crucial competencies currently in demand in the job market. The partnership between NIBM and Malaysia’s Limkokwing University will not only bring in the finest pedagogy of the two countries through the National Innovation Centre, but also generate a host of new avenues for the creative and technology savvy professionals.”
“We live in a world ruled by digital technology, industry empowerment and market demands. Creativity plays an increasingly essential role in this rapidly changing world. We produce full-fledged graduates with the capacity to drive their own ventures.
They will create new jobs instead of seeking for existing ones. They will take risks and create wealth while performing as productive global citizens. NIC will help the younger generation to design their own future, help them build their own international network, and pave the route for high income careers, “Director General of NIBM Dr. D.M.A. Kulasooriya said.
Commenting on the occasion, the Vice President Brand Creativity & Talent Development of Limkokwing University of Creative Technology Dato’ Tiffanee Marie Lim said, “The world today is divided into two groups of nations – those with the capacity to innovate and those without. Countries that practices innovation progress and become richer, while those who don’t, regress and become poorer. Innovation, in simple terms, is about making changes in order to move forward. It’s about making progress, and enabling evolution and empowering transformation.”
Creativity breeds fresh ideas. It is the core of today’s economy. The world values creativity more than ever before as creativity has the power to statistically change the global economy. NIC’s educational core values will help the students to graduate with up-to-date global knowhow together with the ability to discover their innate talents and thrive in the rapidly developing new economy of the 21st century, locally or internationally.
