Thajudeen murder case: CID explains causes for delay in investigations

Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing on behalf of the CID yesterday explained the causes which led to a delay in investigations pertaining to former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen.
DSG Ratnayake informed Colombo Additional Magistrate that the CID detectives need sufficient time since they have to unearth evidence which were buried during the past few years.
“The investigation into Wasim Thajudeen murder case is a complex one and cannot be compared with ordinary investigations. The body of Thajudeen was also exhumed in order to unearth new evidence.
The investigators also have to preserve the secrecy of investigation,” DSG Ratnayake added. He further added several persons including former DIG Anura Senanayake was responsible for covering up evidence regarding Thajudeen’s murder case. DSG Ratnayake made these remarks in response to a query by defence counsel regarding on going investigations. The defence counsel queried how long CID will take to conclude its investigation into Thajudeen’s murder case.
Defence counsel moved Colombo Additional Magistrate J. Trotsky a relief be granted on former Deputy Inspector General Anura Senanayake since he is in remand custody over a period of 12 months without substantial evidence to prove that he involved in the murder of Thajudeen.
Meanwhile, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrested over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit a murder was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till April 5 by Colombo Additional Magistrate.
