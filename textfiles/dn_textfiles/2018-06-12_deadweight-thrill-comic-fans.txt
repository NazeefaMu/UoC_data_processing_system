Deadpool 2
Deadweight thrill for  comic fans

Wade Wilson decides to commit suicide. But death doesn't come easily for him. He has to wade across the rough stream with several barriers: juggernauts, cyborgs, mutant kids and a haunting past that targets his fiance. ‘Deadpool 2’ would have been just another stinker if not for its storyline well-scripted to a comic effect.
Marvel comics are primarily known for comedy. Yes, it makes sense. Comedy writers have that knack for thrilling the audience with laughter over laughter with black comedy elements. [‘Deadpool 2’ is no exception.
The movie deserves the attention of the comic fans and maybe a welcome escape for the other genre-enthusiasts. Typical of a Marvel comic we are introduced to sanguinary scenes. But for the other genre-enthusiasts, there is a bit of homework recommended. To enjoy every dialogue in its entirety, you need to be familiar with allied movies (at least Avengers: Infinity War, for instance). You cannot just step into the movie out of the blue and enjoy the movie. The full thrill is exclusive for Marvel fans. The overly used f-word characterises Wade Wilson and the R rating of the movie. Wilson's character is sweet-natured, his voice calm and quiet. The words pour in the venom and filth but his tone is otherwise. Reynolds’ voice overcoming through the superhero fabric is intoxicating enough.
The scriptwriters, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Ryan Reynolds (who stars the title role) deserve kudos for a brilliant job with a script full of witty and humorous dialogues. If the dialogues were to be written down, it would have to be read between the lines. But then that’s what makes comics so popular – the witty dialogues.
Wade Wilson is an offshoot of a Marvel character launched in the 1990s. The character satiates the audience’s taste for superhero thrill. Metal poles piercing Wilson's head and a moment later Colossus pulls it out as if it is a pin.
Sight and sound matter quite much in this movie. That’s it with the gory scenes of how his X-team dies one by one (except for lucky Domino) along with incredible Hulk type Cyborgs and juggernauts. The beautifully crafted yet comic tension is when Wilson is torn asunder and a few days later the so-called Batman is up and about to fight injustice. That’s exactly what the scriptwriters to drive the point home, imperishable nature.
Even though Wilson tries to commit suicide by immolation, he would not succeed in it. His body parts are still alive to make sure his story is not over yet. Wilson tries to seek revenge, but later he comes to terms with his own fury. He chooses the other path – good over evil. His R rated language, comic voiceover aside, it is his sense of righteousness that emerges. That is subject to glorification especially through his association with the fellow characters.
With Russell, the mutant kid, he tries to convince that revenge is not the remedy. He overpowers Cable, the Cyborg time traveller, with his sense of righteousness. Colossus rejects to assist him but turns up at the last minute. On face value, here is someone who is quite vicious. But as the plot progresses, the audience gets to know the genuine figure within him. Wilson’s companions, both enemies and friends at certain stages, Cable, Colossus, Dopinder and Russell lament his death.
All this is set against the love story between Vanessa and Wade. The story comes alive with Vanessa’s death and Wade trying to reunite with her in the afterlife. Vanessa is not only his love but also his guardian angel. The constant vision of her in Wilson’s mind elevates the comical scenes into some philosophically questioning grounds. That strikes the ultimate balance between the mere comedy and the science-fiction.
