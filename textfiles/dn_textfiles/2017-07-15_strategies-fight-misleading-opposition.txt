Strategies to fight a misleading Opposition

The near gridlock in the Constitutional dilemma that has emerged shows little signs of being easily resolved. The issue of a change in the Constitution has clearly gone beyond an intelligent debate on matters of constitution making or the content of a new constitution. Instead, it is befuddled at what is clearly a cheap political argument, that leaves very little room for matters of public interest that are of importance to constitution making, to have any influence on the dispute.
President Sirisena has told the Mahanayakes and other prelates of the three Nikayas, who he met in Kandy last week, there was no reason whatever to have any fears about the status of Buddhism in the new Constitution, and assured them that the draft of the new Constitution would be presented to them for consideration and advise. The Prime Minister gave a similar assurance in his recent speech at Anuradhapura, and even suggested having new constitutional provisions to ensure the State does not interfere in the functioning of the Nikayas. But these are of little interest to those engaged in the political campaign that is using constitution making as the thrust in a yellow robed debate, with little interest in facts.
The issue that has to be taken up in earnest is how any section of the Sangha could give any ultimatum or issue warnings about a new Constitution that is not even in its draft stage so far. There is a clear show of a political campaign that has very little, if any, to do with the protection of Buddhism and its status in this country. Article 9 of the present Constitution makes this very clear. It states: “The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).”
The inclusion of this clause in a new constitution has been accepted and endorsed by the leaders of all other religions in the country. This may not be the position of those who believe that what is needed in Sri Lanka is a secular constitution; and they do have a right to think so and state so. But, this is not the subject of debate today. Article 9 is accepted by all other religious leaders, and will be in the new Constitution, as it has been in the Constitution since 1972 – when the first Republican Constitution was adopted. Clause 9 was not a JR Jayewardene introduction in the 1978 Constitution, which brought in the Executive Presidency. The call for the removal of the Executive Presidency is certainly what the majority of the people of Sri Lanka voted for and gave a mandate to both in the Presidential poll on January 8 and General Election in August 2015.
New alignments
What is most surprising today is that many who are now against the need for a new Constitution, not only the related sections of the Sangha, are of the view that there no need to remove the Executive Presidency. This is stated by those who are associated with the government, such as the Jathika Hela Urumaya, too, and is currently a strong position of the Sinhala nationalists who also oppose any efforts to bring a new Constitution. The thinking of these forces is that the Executive Presidency has been trimmed down sufficiently, by President Sirisena, with the adoption of the 19th Amendment, and there is no practical purpose in having it abolished. They are carrying on with a political chant that there is no mandate from the people for a change in the Constitution, or the abolition of the Executive Presidency. They conveniently use the pledges made by Maithripala Sirisena on the constitutional changes that would be introduced in the first 100 days after January 8, 2015, as being proof that there was no offer by the Common Candidate to abolish the Executive Presidency or bring in a new Constitution. What they have forgotten or ignore is what Maithripala Sirisena said in his manifesto for the Presidential Poll in January 2015 - Maithri Palanayak – Sthavara Ratak - which states in Chapter1 - “We have been unable to constitutionally change the Executive Presidential system that has prevailed since 1978, which our party continuously promised the people and the country do since 1994. Our failure to realize this goal through 20 years is a major defeat we have faced. This cannot be delayed any more”.
He also states in the manifesto that: “What I have taken as the background to change the Executive Presidential system, is the agreement with the Reasonable Society Movement (Saadarana Samajayak Sandaha Vu Vyparaya) led by Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, for the abolition of the Executive Presidency…”.
It is the campaign on this key issue, coupled with the related need to fight and eliminate corruption that gave the mandate to the Common Candidate, Maithripala Sirisena with the Swan symbol, in the polls in January 2015. This mandate was repeated in the General Election of August that year, too. So, it is a complete distortion of political reality to state there was no mandate for the abolition of the Executive Presidency or to bring in a new Constitution. These are the core issues that saw the election of the Common Candidate as President in January 2015, and brought in the coalition of National Unity after the general election of August 2015. The claim that there is no mandate or any public call for these changes is therefore wholly wrong, and completely against the political trends in the country, whether stated by any section of the Sangha or by any ethno-religious extremists or nationalists; and needs the strongest opposition by both the government and the forces of civil society that brought this government to power.
Disappearances
The other issue being canvassed by the Joint Opposition and the Sangha is the new law against enforced disappearances. The Government made a gesture of goodwill to the Sangha by not proceeding with the related Bill that was tabled in Parliament. But, such a gesture will certainly not have much of an impact on those who are using this too, as a weapon against the government; giving the twist that it is proof of how the government is giving in or being managed by the countries of the West, or the Tamil Diaspora.
The statement by the government that this law will not have retrospective effect, and is only meant for the future, has no impact on the opponents, who see it is a good tool to use against the government, based on their opposition to the policies of reconciliation and peace building. The fact that the intent of this law is to prevent enforced disappearances, not only as a peace dividend, but also as an aspect of safety for all sections of the people, has to be the stuff of debate and publicity by the government.
It is necessary to show that such enforced disappearances were what led to the white vans in the past, to the absence of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda, and many others among the Sinhalese who went missing in the years of the last government; and the prevention of such criminal activity is necessary and good for all Sri Lankans. The attempt to show that this is a means of bringing harm to the Armed Forces, who won the war against the LTTE, should be completely debunked with all the evidence available to the government.
However, there is also the necessity of working out how the government, with its message of reconciliation and understanding, could come to terms with that large number of Tamils, especially from the North, who are making every effort to have some information about those who have been missing from their families for a very long time.
In the context of the Joint Opposition being strongly opposed to this new law, it is necessary to recall that was this very issue of disappearances and the elimination of persons who had disappeared that led Mahinda Rajapaksa to make his important move to Geneva and place the facts before the UN body interested in this matter. Mahinda Rajapaksa certainly earned considerable respect and support from the people for taking up the issue of those who went missing or were eliminated during the second JVP uprising, and saw the establishment of the Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights under his leadership in 1988. There is no doubt that he did undergo much difficulty and hardship in making his journey to the UN in Geneva for this purpose, and it was a most salutary cause.
But, the JO under his leadership and the SLPP led by GL Peiris, also under his political guidance, are strongly opposed to this legislation, and is clearly raking up false information about it, with special focus on the supposed impact on the Armed Forces, to carry on the campaign against the government through this.
It is necessary for the government to work out a campaign of good strategy both on the issue of the new Constitution and that of the law against enforced disappearances, if it is to succeed in maintaining a strong unity of purpose as the completion of the second year of the government of “National Unity” approaches very fast.
