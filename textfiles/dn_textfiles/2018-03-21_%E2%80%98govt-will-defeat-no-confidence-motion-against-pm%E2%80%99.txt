‘Govt will defeat no confidence motion against PM’

The government has the strength to defeat a no confidence motion brought against the Prime Minister.
The 40-member Joint Opposition is planning to bring the motion in Parliament with the ulterior motive of destabilising the government, Home Affairs Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathuwala said.
Alawathuwla was speaking to the media after he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates at their temples in Kandy and received their blessings on March 19.
The Deputy Minister said he did not believe that any member of the UNP would support the no confidence motion.
“If the members of the SLFP group who are partners of the government wished to support the no confidence motion, they should gracefully resign from their ministerial posts,” Alawathuwala said. He said that many people who talked about removing the Prime Minister while being government ministers were those rejected by the people at the hustings.
It was a joke to see those without a mandate talking of removing the Prime Minister, he said.
Alawathuwala said the UNP would undergo a major transformation soon since Prime Minister Ranil Wikcremesinghe too subscribed to the view that the party should receive a change and new orientation.
