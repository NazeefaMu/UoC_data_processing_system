Range Bandara clashes with Mahinda Samarasinghe over appointment of VTI chairman

State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Palitha Range Bandara, yesterday lashed out at the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe's move to appoint retired Major General Gamini Hettiarachchi as Chairman of the Vocational Training Institute (VTI).
Minister Range Bandara asked under which principle of the Yahapalanaya that Minister Samarasinghe deemed suitable to designate Hettiarachchi for the above post and who directed the so-called Special Operations Room under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to inflict defeat on Maithripala Sirisena at the January 8, Presidential Election.
“Minister Mangala Samaraweere has lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department concerning this Special Operation Room where they have reportedly hatched anti-state conspiracies to prevent current President Sirisena from coming to power,” he pointed out.
“How did Minister Samarasinghe feel disposed to appoint the person who supervised activities in that room as the chairman of a key state institution?”he queried.
He made these comments on being asked if the appointment of retired Major General Hettiarachchi, was made with the approval of the President's office.
The minister said, he never meant to speak on this matter, but it would be interesting to ascertain whether anybody approved the appointment from the Presidential Task Committee and the identity of that person.
He also said that there were media reports during that time that the retired Army Generals who worked at that Gotabhaya led Special Operations Room were handsomely rewarded by Avant Garde.
“We all know that Mahinda Samarasinghe campaigned democratically to ensure Mahinda Rajapaksa's victory at the Presidential election. However, it was not so with some the others. They employed thuggery,” he said.
“One has to consider whether Minister Samarasinghe's appointee directed this facility - the Special Operations Room on behalf of the country or of Rajapaksa,” he pointed out.
Asked if he had ever sat with Minister Samarasinghe to discuss matters pertaining to vocational training and skills development, Bandara said he had never been called for such discussions.
There was no such consensus so to speak, Bandara said.
“Minister Samarasinghe had said said that he had conceded various duties and responsibilities in writing. If he had done so, it should have been announced through the Gazette. Only the Prime Minister had conceded subjects that come under his purview to relevant state ministers in that manner so far,” he said.
