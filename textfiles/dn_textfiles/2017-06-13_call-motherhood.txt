Call of  motherhood

Sirima Jayasekera who is living in London as a banker’s wife, a concert pianist and music teacher with four children found the call of her ‘Motherhood’ to reach the children of the world. Her love for children and the belief to be the cradle of ‘hope’ for mankind is deep seated. The call bloomed into a flower a decade ago noticing the fate of children in the Cancer Hospital’s children ward in Sri Lanka.
While the call of universal motherhood churned within her, she had to work out the mathematics of reality for the manifestation of the project to bear fruit. She combined two of her passions, Motherhood and Music. ‘Symphony for a Child’ is Jayasekera’s brainchild to make the funds available to create the facilities needed to up-lift children in need.
The first concert ‘Symphony for a Child’ came to being at Regent Hall in central London in 1999. It made 4, 000 sterling pounds. Ever since then she has collected 4, 000 to 6, 000 pounds every year in London. She now has a ward at IDH Angoda Sri Lanka, with a playground and now she is targeting to add a Library to it. She has also extended her motherhood to children of North and East of Sri Lanka too. She considers those living there to be victims of war and as the ‘hope’ for the nation’s peace.
This year with her presence in Sri Lanka, ‘Symphony for a Child’ will be held in Colombo at the Lionel Wendt Theater. To enhance the concert Sirima has embraced Piano, Flute, Violin, Cello, Vocal Duet, choir, Kandyan Drums, Jazz Piano and Rhythm Blues. The variety will reach a wider audience.
‘Sirima’ as she is popularly known did whatever possible and is still doing whatever possible at 85 to give a better life to children in her motherland. What manifested from her generosity are the wards 2A and 2B of the IDH hospital for HIV positive children which is on its ninth year of existence.
It is also noticeable that the wards are up to European standard in hygiene, facility and service. Sirima is not stopping here… Plans are made to venture further.
‘Symphony for a child’ does not stop at giving only shelter, cure and good health but also provides a solid foundation in education. Namal Yapage was recommended to Sirima by Susil Gunesekera. Hailing from the rural south, he completed his education in Kattubadde University and won a scholarship to Sydney West University in Australia. Today he has a doctorate in Civil Engineering having received four special awards for his thesis.
There are several others with good academic achievements. All are under the umbrella of her care without exception and they all feel that there is light at the end of the tunnel.
‘Symphony for a Child’s proceeds from inception has been donated to the AIDS foundation of Sri Lanka to treat the HIV Positive children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. The foundation supports in facilitating prevention and care programs initiated by the Sri Lankan Government. They are an indispensable unit in the efficient and effective working of the project.
Sirima does not hesitate to mention the dedicated staff of the hospital who manages the wards at IDH in Angoda. Caring is a 24 hour dedicated shift and without doubt a tiring job. Consultant doctors Nishadi Ranasinghe, Ananda Wijewickrema and Myrna Cabraal along with the devoted hands of Matron Geethani Udugamakorale Sister Madusha and ward nurses deliver the sun-dial of hope. Sirima considers them to be the engine of the project and the heavenly caring hands to the children.
‘Opportunities can change the world to good’ is Sirima’s belief. For her it is not a statement but a conviction. Her motherhood dream is a reality now.
This year’s ‘Symphony for a Child’ will be held in at Lionel Wendt Theater, Colombo, on June 25 at 7 pm. The program has been put together with many great names volunteering to perform for the cause without any financial considerations.
Sulara Nanayakkara will play the Violin; Rashane Fernando is a classical guitarist; Ramya Perera will be at the piano playing modern jazz by Fazil Say; and students of Mary Anne David will perform a combination of classical and semi classical songs that will be a delight to listen to. The students of Haasinee Andree will add to the mix with a spectrum of modern music.
Drumming a beat would be the students of Ravi Bandhu Vidhyapathy. Tilanka Jayamanne a Flautist will perform a solo.
