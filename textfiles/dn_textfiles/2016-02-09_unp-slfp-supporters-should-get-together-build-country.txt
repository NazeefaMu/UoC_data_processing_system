'UNP, SLFP supporters should get together to build country'

 
Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister, Lakshman Kiriella queried as to why cannot the supporters of the two main political parties get together when the leaders of the two main political parties can get-together?
The minister said so when he attended a Rural Road Rehabilitation Programme at the Pathadumbara Electoral Division in Kandy.
Under this programme, the development of the Poojapitiya-Dodamtenna road, Karaduwawala-Getathale road, Kasawatta-Poojapitiya road, Malwahinna-Neerella road, Vilana-Pallegama road and Bokkawala-Miliyadda road commenced.
The expenditure for the project is estimated at Rs. 481 million.
The minister said with the leaders of the two main parties joining, the country can plan on completing many matters of national importance.
"Since the party leaders are in line for a common rule, the supporters of the United National Party (UNP) as well as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should get-together and contribute in the Nation building process. No one has a right to stay away from this National Government as there are many unresolved issues in the country. It is the people of this country who are being inconvenienced. We can't stick to party differences and evade these problems. We must treat these problems as common to all people.
"After Independence, the two main parties parted and followed their agendas. When the UNP tried to solve the problems, the SLFP opposed and vice versa. This disagreement was carried out for over 60 years and resulted in a 30 year war which damaged our country's economy. But with the partnership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wikremesinghe, good governance came into being that provided permanent solutions for the problems faced by the country."
Commenting on the current political status of the country, Kiriella said: "Today there is no Opposition in the Parliament. Because of the 19th Amendment, the number of ministries was limited. Ministerial and deputy ministerial posts cannot be just handed over as in the previous regime, there is a limit. During the previous regime, Mahinda Rajapaksa gave over a 100 ministerial posts. But we cannot give away ministerial posts as we like as we cannot go pass the 19th Amendment.
"We are responsible for the people of this country. Therefore I invite SLFP supporters to join with the National Government's programmes instead of wasting time with the Joint Opposition".
Minister's Private Secretary Chamindrani Kiriella, UNP Pathadumbara Organizer Harindra Dunuwila, Pradeshiya Sabha Members Aruna Amunugama and Piyasena were also present.
