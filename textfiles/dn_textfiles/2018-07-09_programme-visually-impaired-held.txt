Programme for the visually-impaired held

Following a joint initiative taken by Rotary International and Lions Clubs International, a programme to distribute spectacles for the visually-impaired was held at the Veluwanarama temple premises, recently.
The Wellawatte Police and Civil Security Committee provided assistance for the endeavour, which was sponsored by Rotary Australia World Community Service (RAWCS), the Australian Medical Aid Foundation (AMAF) and the Rotary Club of Hills-Kellyville (District 9685).
Two-hundred and fifty patients were checked and of them, 200 received spectacles. A team of optometrists led by Lion Daya Wijetunge carried out the eye inspections.
Wellawatte Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Roshan Dias, Wellawatte Police Officer-in-Charge Kapila Wijemanne and Inspector Gamini de Silva were present.
The next programme had been scheduled for July 14 at Biyagama, which will be followed by another two at Ramboda and the outskirts of Colombo, respectively.
