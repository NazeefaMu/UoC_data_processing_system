Flood disaster leaves tea estates high and dry

Tea estates in Baddegama, Neluwa, Mapalagama, Nagoda, Elpitiya, Polgahawila, Divitura, Welivitiya, Ethkandura in Karandeniya electorate, Rekadahena and Kahaduwa were severely affected by the floods. Cultivation was found submerged for over four days. After the flood water receded, acres of dead tea plantations in the affected areas could be seen brownish in colour. Over 75 percent of tea estates of tea smallholders were affected by the floods.
Cultivating tea is the only livelihood of tea smallholders of a major of tea-growing areas of the Galle district. A well-grown tea cultivation yields a good crop and a majority of tea smallholders earn a good income of around Rs. 100,000 per month. A kilo of fresh green leaves fetches a price of Rs. 100 to Rs. 110.
Smallholders’ tea estates of the Galle district are located mostly in the river valleys of Gin Ganga and its tributaries, in the low-lying areas and close to stretches of paddy fields.
Galle District Tea Smallholders Societies President P. H. Susantha de Silva predicted that it could take at least two years to obtain a crop if replanting had to be done replacing the dead plantations.
Tea smallholders of these areas have become traumatic and emotionally disturbed, unaware of how to cope with the burning issues of earning their day to day living under the existing circumstances. Even the private factory owners find it difficult to function without green leaves which they usually obtain from smallholders on a daily basis for production.
Ishanka attached to the Disaster Management Section of Elpitiya Divisional Secretariat said the damage caused by the floods is yet to be assessed. So far, no action is taken to pay compensation to affected tea smallholders till the ongoing surveys are completed. She said paddy cultivation and home gardens are also affected. In addition to floods, even small-scale soil erosion at Ketandola, Rekadahena and Metiviliya had destroyed tea estates, she revealed.
Elpitiya Tea Inspector I. D. Dusantha said surveys of dead tea estates had already begun to assess the exact number of acres affected. He said in addition to tea, even cinnamon estates in certain areas were damaged by the floods.
Jayanthi Thuduwage and one of her daughters had been rescued by neighbouring villagers. Her tea cultivation of nearly two acres at Akuretiya, Baddegama adjoining Gin Ganga was completely destroyed by the floods. She said she could never dream of replanting her tea cultivation.
The grieving tea smallholders of affected areas said relevant authorities had to devise immediate plans for the rehabilitation of their tea cultivation.
After the flood receded, the donations from other sources had become scanty, some of the victims revealed.
