Nine corruption cases: Sarana fixed

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday fixed for November 21, nine corruption cases filed against former Deputy Minister Sarana Gunawardena.
This is over an incident where the former Deputy Minister had allegedly secured public funds when obtaining vehicles on rent for the National Lotteries Board, while he was serving as the Board Chairman.
Gunawardena was not present in Court yesterday. Court was informed that he is in remand custody over another court case. Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala issued an order directing the Welikada Prison Superintendent to produce the suspect in Court on the next hearing date.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had committed the offences between 2006 and 2007 while he was serving as the National Lotteries Board Chairman.
