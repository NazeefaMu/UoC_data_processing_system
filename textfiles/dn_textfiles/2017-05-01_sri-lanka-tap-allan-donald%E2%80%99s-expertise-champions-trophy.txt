Sri Lanka to tap Allan Donald’s  expertise for  Champions Trophy

Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday announced the appointment of Allan Donald as Consultant Fast Bowling Coach for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017.
Donald who is considered one of the most prolific pacemen of all time, was the first South African to take 300 wickets for his country, and has played a pivotal role in the shaping of world class bowling arsenals around the world since his premature retirement in 2003 due to injuries.
Donald is currently slated to take on a role as Assistant Coach at Kent County who have agreed to release him for a two month stint with SLC in the lead up to the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England and Wales from 1-18 of June.
Sri Lanka have been investing greatly in expert resource personnel and technology for the national team, employing a battery of former national players on full time assignment as coaches specializing in batting, fielding and bowling.
The pace team consist of Chaminda Vaas, Champaka Ramanayake, Ravindra Pushpakumara, and Nuwan Zoysa amongst others and Donald will work closely with the coaching team and conduct train-the-trainer sessions as well as working with the national teams.
Donald will join the team in their residential training at the Pallakelle International Stadium where they will be undergoing a high intensity Training and Conditioning program from 9-16 of May.
Donald is due to arrive in the country on 1 May and SLC will be hosting a press conference on Tuesday May 2 at 4.30 pm at SLC with the attendance of Allan Donald, National Head Coach Graham Ford, Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha and High Performance Manager Simon Willis.
