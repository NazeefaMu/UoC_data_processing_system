Trinity runs riot with 94/9 demolition of POW

Trinity College rucked, drove and powered their way to outclass Prince of Wales College by 94 (7 goals, 9 tries) to 9 (3 penalties) win in their last first round inter-school rugby match played at the Pallekelle Stadium yesterday.
It was the highest victory margin ever achieved by a school this season.
Trinity’s good team work helped them to dominate this game. They dished out a good brand of rugby to lead 41-3 at half time.
The Trinitians were fast, open and ever ready to fling the ball about, and showed a marked superiority over their opponents in every department of the game. They used their superior weight and binding much tighter and lower and had the ball back far more often. Trinity controlled the game from the very first whistle.
Referee: Anil Mangala
