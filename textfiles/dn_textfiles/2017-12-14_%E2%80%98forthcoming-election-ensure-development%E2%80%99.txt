‘Forthcoming election to ensure development’

The forthcoming local council election is aimed to ensure grassroot-level development such as building village roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, to facilitate village development rather than to change governments, said Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne.
As such, people should elect an efficient individual from the area who can ensure a good job for their benefit, rather than trying to follow the general election wave as during the time of a general election, he said.
Addressing a meeting held at Minipe recently, Deputy Minister Jayaratne said they spent the last two years studying the needs and requirements of people in the Uda Dumbara electorate. They found that about 20,000 people belonging to nearly 4,500 families lived in a wildlife zone extending from the Minipe anicut upto Randenigala.
After obtaining Cabinet approval to release the area from the wildlife zone, President Maithripala Sirisena had declared the entire Minipe DS division with 44 hamlets as the Mahaweli ‘E’ Zone and allocated Rs 400 million to distribute the land among the inhabitants through title deeds, he said. Central Provincial Council Member Nissanka Herath, Victoria Zone Resident Project Manager Udaya Kumara, and other officials were present on the occasion.
