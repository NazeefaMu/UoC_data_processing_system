No end to human-elephant conflict?
“The loser is the country!”

Following the stir caused by the killing of the Galgamuwa Tusker and the increased attention towards poaching as well as the human-elephant conflict, the Daily News sought the views of Professor Devaka Weerakoon, an esteemed Professor at the University of Colombo, well versed in the issues of human-elephant coexistence and wildlife conservationist. Professor Weerakoon opined that political involvement and interest in the matters of the human-elephant conflict is needed in great magnitude in order to come up with a long term solution to the issue.
Excerpts from the interview:
Q: What are your thoughts on the killing of the Galgamuwa crossed tusker?
A: It should have been protected, however protecting each and every tusker is next to impossible. You would need a bodyguard for every tusker 24/7. The criticisms against the Department of Wildlife Conservation are unfair for in order to ensure the protection of tuskers, political support is necessary. The reason for the publicity around the death of the tusker is the charismatic nature of such creatures and that this was resultant from poaching.
The human-elephant conflict claims the lives of a multitude of elephants each year. Approximately 200 – 250 elephants are killed every year as a result of either poaching or the human-elephant conflict. This is of an elephant population of about 6,000 in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are the laws and policies in association with elephant conservation? Do we have sufficient laws? What amendments do you think are necessary to these laws?
A: The existence of the 2006 Human Elephant Conflict Policy and the need for its update is clear. However draft policies that have been developed and proposed have not yet been implemented. It is important to note that a policy offers a direction and that actions need to be taken based on those directions. In many instances, instead of following through with the directions offered by proposed policies, policymakers look for actions already taken and use the results in the context of the policy thus persisting with incorrect strategies.
Political support is necessary and the long term impact of the deaths of elephants needs to be taken seriously. Immediate solutions are not possible, if not they would already have been implemented and utilized. Learning via a trial and error basis is the option available. For instance, on one occasion an elephant was translocated and returned 2-3 times resulting in many issues as the elephant became more restless. In other situations, an elephant that causes trouble being moved to another area is basically the translocation of a headache. The situation worsens. The use of an enclosed area has been suggested but these as well as other recommendations are abandoned the moment they are found to be ineffective. Rather than abandoning such efforts, learning from the errors and improving the strategies are necessary.
Q: What course of action do you believe should be taken by policymakers and what are your thoughts on the lack of an official policy for elephant conservation?
A: At the end of the day, a policy won’t reduce the number of deaths to zero, but it would make the threat of the human-elephant conflict more manageable by minimizing it. Approximately 80% of the elephants that are killed are male and this will have a long term impact on genetics. As one of the leading countries in research and empirical evidence on this issue, such information needs to be utilized.
Policymakers need to take this situation more seriously as it is becoming worse than armed conflict. An interest in elephant management needs to be taken. The lack of movement in a positive direction is resulting in the situation returning to the status quo. Policymakers should be taking more interest in the situation as they themselves would benefit from it. By providing those who live in the human-elephant conflict areas with solutions they have the opportunity to win favours with the masses and receive more votes and popularity. As representatives of the people they should be doing more in the interest of the people, raising a voice for them however there is a lack of sincerity on their part.
The resignation of Dr. S. Pilapitiya as Director General of Wildlife Conservation caused a stir. We (wildlife enthusiasts) have nothing to gain from conservation. Driven by the passion for wildlife and the enrichment of our environment we can only hope to preserve it for future generations. What is to be gained by government officials and wildlife conservationists destroying each other? Unfortunately the end result is the grabbing of defeat out of the jaws of victory. The loser is the country.
Q: What can be done regarding increased population and the problems associated with elephant conservation? What do you believe can be done to strengthen the protected areas in Sri Lanka?
A: Land use planning needs to be improved. Development should not be stopped completely but encroachment into wildlife conservation areas should be minimized. There should be sensitivity to both sides – development vs. conservation and land conversion should take into account the long term impacts of such. The creation of conflict to generate money is a loss.
The perspective of the people should be taken into account. Villages that are subject to human-elephant conflict need to be considered. They fear for the lives of their children, whether they will return home every day. In addition their agricultural livelihood is threatened and they risk their lives to protect their crops. At night the danger of leaving their houses is prominent. The proposal of the use of village fencing would possibly provide a solution to this as fences around villages would enable villagers to move freely knowing that the elephants are beyond a certain boundary. This would also facilitate social interaction within the village. If the point of view of the villagers is not considered they are likely to take matters into their own hands and try to solve things their way. The end result is not desirable.
Q: Translocation increasingly fails in concern with habitat encroachment as mentioned in your work, what would you recommend as measures that can be taken pertaining to this?
A: Translocation does seem to worsen the situation. Measures such as village fencing and land use planning are more likely to improve the situation. Elephant drives and use of thunder flashes increasingly worsen the situation as elephants are becoming habituated to it.
The elephant drive in Lunugamvehera is an example of how drives worsened the situation. The area was over its carrying capacity resulting in the elephants becoming emaciated and slowly deteriorating. It was the same result as shooting them in the head with a gun but merely a more inhuman form as they died slow and painful deaths. Measures need to be taken to avoid such situations and better strategies need to be formulated.
Q: Sri Lanka is a country where elephants and tuskers were historically venerated, however the human-elephant conflict is negatively impacting this as mentioned in your journal article. What are your thoughts on the involvement of religious leaders in conservation and what can you say about the desirability associated with tuskers and the establishment of tusks as icons of prestige?
A: Elephants are used in these religious processions and this is not what is taught in the religions. Currently no positive steps are taken to protect the elephants. Love can spoil a child and keeping a ten tonne animal in captivity is not ideal. Immobilization can lead to problems in the feet and the changed conditions in environment can have a drastic effect on the animal. This is however not a blanket statement. Religious leaders can encourage compassion for the creatures and motivate preservation.
Even in the case of the African tusks that were confiscated from one of the temples, they were demanded and successfully reacquired. Nowhere in religion is blood ivory considered desirable. The basic premise of religion talks about simplistic lifestyle not acquisition. The temples itself are not supposed to hold anything of value. The death of an animal for the sake of acquiring ornaments whether elephant or turtle or any other species is not encouraged. Burning these tusks does not salvage the situation but it sends a statement that blood ivory or any other ornaments should not be considered valuable. In this animal rights age where it is clear that animals have the same right to live as humans, ornaments should not be deemed desirable at the expense of life. Temples especially, which teach simplistic ways of life should not be promoting the desirability of tusks or any other ornamental objects.
Q: Don’t you think we need tougher punishment for poachers? Should poachers face the death penalty?
A: The death penalty is definitely not a solution. It doesn’t stop people from killing other humans so why would it discourage poaching? Implementation of the death penalty would insinuate that an elephant life is equivalent to that of a human life.
An appropriate legal system is definitely necessary as this is a legal issue however it must be taken into account that law doesn’t necessarily dissuade action. Just because there are laws against manslaughter doesn’t mean that people have stopped killing, so no, the death penalty should not be implemented for poaching in my opinion.
Q: Do you think our local media play a responsible role and could step up the fight against poaching?
A: The local media definitely plays a role but wildlife needs more focus. Wildlife appreciation is common and various documentaries are aired however more interest need to be generated towards wildlife conservation and elephant conservation. Educational programmes on conservation and programmes that inculcate love towards elephants and other species could help discourage poaching.
Elephants are an important resource and if not conserved they will disappear.
