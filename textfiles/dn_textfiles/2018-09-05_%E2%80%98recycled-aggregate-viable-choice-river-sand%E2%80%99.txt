‘Recycled aggregate, viable choice for river sand’

Utilization of construction and demolition waste to produce recycled aggregates (sand) should be facilitated by relevant authorities, said Ranjith Gunatillake, President of Chamber of Construction Industry Sri Lanka (CCI).
He was speaking at a seminar on Supply of Sand (Fine Aggregates) For Construction Work, organized by the Chamber of Construction Industry at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute last week.
The CCI President said that appropriate construction practices should be adopted to minimize the use of sand due to the scarcity of river sand in Sri Lanka.
“Offshore and manufactured sand can be considered as two viable alternatives to meet the increasing demand for river sand. Production of manufactured sand as the main product should be encouraged. In addition, bottom ash (coarse, granular, incombustible by-product of coal combustion) can also be utilized as a light weight fine aggregates to masonry units and other products,” he said.
He also pointed out that extraction of dune and pit sand can cause unrecoverable environmental damage and hence necessary actions should be taken to avoid further destruction.
The use of optional materials instead of river sand is available in Sri Lanka. Citing examples, he said washed soil sand could be used for building construction instead of using river sand.
“Nevertheless, local structural engineers hold different opinions on the use of washed soil sand for building construction. I would like to request all the professionals particularly structural engineers to allow the use of washed soil sand for construction work if it is in correct order and meet the correct requirement rather than promoting same old materials for building construction,” he said. Gunatillake said further that it is essential to improve workmanship as well as the use of standard size of bricks to reduce the demand for sand for building construction in Sri Lanka.
He said the price of sand per cube has not gone up very much over the years in comparison to other expenses of the general public in Sri Lanka. Making a comparison between the value of sand per cubic and the wages of engineers and labourers as per the exchange rate between Sri Lankan rupee and the US dollar during the 1980-2018 period, he said that in 1980, the salary of an engineer was US $ 67 per month and currently it stands at US $ 620 or close to Rs. 100,000 per month.
“For sand, it was only US $ 26 per cubic in 1980 and today it is about US $ 100 which is equivalent to Rs. 16,000 per cubic. In 1980, salary of a laborer was around US $ 20; today it is around US $ 220 or close to Rs. 35, 000 per month. During the period 1980-2018, value of sand per cubic has gone up by 14 times where as engineers and labourers salaries have gone up by 100 times,” he said.
CCI Secretary General and Chief Executive Officer, Nissanka Wijeratne speaking at the seminar said that sand is a special component in all construction related work, especially in brick, masonry and finishing works.Wijeratne estimated the total requirement of sand as to around 20 million cubic metres per annum in Sri Lanka.
“However, due to the increased demand, our suppliers and miners have to over extract the river base. As a result, considerable damage has been done to the ecology and in certain areas, the damage is irreversible. Because of that the government was compelled to impose a number of restrictions on the mining of river beds for sand as well as transportation of river sand,” he said.
As a result, price of river sand in Colombo has gone up to around Rs. 16,000 per cube. In addition to that, construction cost per unit in Sri Lanka is supposed to be the highest in the South Asian region as well as it is higher than Singapore and Dubai, he noted. Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka delivering the key note speech at the seminar said that construction activities in Sri Lanka have plunged during the last four months and the growth potential of the industry has been hampered to due to escalation of cost, depreciation of capital, shortage of skilled labour, scarcity of materials and etc.
“Nevertheless, despite this scenario, the industry is doing well and there is so much potential to harness both home and abroad,” he said.
“We are not in a world where construction materials are used in a sustainable manner. We have to carefully look at this aspect and need to take a holistic approach to find better alternatives to address the scarcity of construction materials in the country,” he said.
The Minister also stressed the importance of conducting more research and development activities with regard to mining natural resources in a sustainable manner in Sri Lanka.
