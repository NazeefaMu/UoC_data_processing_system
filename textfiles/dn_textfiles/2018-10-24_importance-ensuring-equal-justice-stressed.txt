Importance of ensuring equal justice stressed

The Convener of the Movement for a Just Society Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya yesterday urged President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to ensure good governance in the country by fulfilling the pledges given to the public when they came in to power.
“In 2015, people of this country proved that none of the two main political parties who ruled the country is suitable to rule this country anymore. Therefore, both parties had to form a Unity Government. But it is questionable whether these two parties united to work for the betterment of the public or to for the benefit of their fellow politicians,” Prof. Wijesuriya said.
He further stressed the importance of ensuring equal justice for all and urged the relevant authorities not to consider narrow personal objectives when appointing persons to the high ranking judicial professions.
“The people of this country are still expecting justice for the large scale crimes and corruption committed”, he said.
Executive Committee Member of the Movement for a Just Society Saman Rathnapriya said the President and the Prime Minister should take all the important decisions of this Unity Government without just demonstrating that they work together.
“People gave a mandate to form a Unity Government.
If any party wants to quit the Unity Government they have to wait until the term of Government expires,” he added.
Commenting on the Cabinet Paper submitted by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe seeking approval for calling for international tenders to supply the necessary cranes to the East Terminal, Rathnapriya said that this is a good decision taken by the Minister to develop the Eastern Terminal.
The Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port will not be privatised and 80 million US dollars will be allocated to install the necessary equipment including cranes.
