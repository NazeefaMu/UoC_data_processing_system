Rowing success!

Pain and suffering are a part of an experience in most sports yet the sport of rowing takes things to a new level. It is an endurance sport and winning comes from hard training. You have to sweat a lot and work your way through thick and thin to pick up the medals.
Hashen Hettigoda has overcome the odds and won accolades in this field. He had represented Sri Lanka at the Asian Junior Rowing Championship held in Yilan, Taiwan, in 2014 and was ranked eighth place in the Asian Junior under 18 category. He clinched gold medals in the Under 19 Scull and the Under 19 Quad Scull at the Head of Bay Regatta held in Hong Kong this year. He has also won Scull second place and Double Scull first place at the ARAE Regatta held in India recently. Hashen has taken part in the Rutherglen Regatta held in Melbourne, Australia, in 2016 and had won Open Eight Second place and Open Four third place. He bagged the Double Scull first place and Coxed Four first place at the Madras-Colombo Regatta 2016. He won the Asian Junior Under 18 13th rank at the Asian Junior Rowing Championship held in Pattaya, Thailand, in 2016. Hashen has even represented Sri Lanka in the Asian Junior Rowing Development Camp organized by the International Rowing Federation and Asian Rowing Federation held in Taiwan in 2014 and the Madras-Colombo Regatta held in Sri Lanka in 2014.
“I got into rowing when I was 12 years old. I was the ‘fat kid’ in the class. One of my friends’ uncles was the college rowing coach at that time. He spotted me and asked me to come for a session. I tried my hand at the sport and found that I am a natural at it. Team spirit made me stay and continue with it. Since then I have never looked back,” Hashen said with a smile.
Rowing is an excellent form of exercise, not only because it is good for your health, but also because it can be done solo or as a team to build teamwork. There is something both relaxing and motivating about being on the water. Once you learn the proper technique, rowing can offer a tremendous amount of physical health benefits, including increased power and strength. “Most people see rowing as a high end sport in Sri Lanka. The equipment is expensive. The smallest boat costs over Rs 1.5 million. Unless you have a good sponsor it is difficult to get into the sport.
Therefore only a few schools have taken up the sport. However as the years have flown by many more have turned to rowing. There are about 15 schools and three forces and two universities engaged in rowing,” the Captain of the Royal College Rowing Crew 2017 added.
He notes that many foreigners have visited the isle to train the coaches on the techniques of rowing. Therefore Sri Lankan rowers are fast reaching international standards. There are four types of rowing boats in Sri Lanka: Sculls (one oarsman), Pair and Double Sculls (two oarsmen each) and Fours (four oarsmen and one cox).
“Judging your prowess in the sport mainly depends on timing. You do not necessarily have to be in the water to calculate your timing. We have an indoor machine from which we can time ourselves by our pace. You need to know what you are good at too. For example there are those who do well on the Four but cannot handle the Scull. I handle the Scull, Double and Four. I represent the Senior category,” Hashen explained.
He notes that a sportsman needs to have a lot of dedication to excel as a rower.
“It is a very time consuming sport. Rowing one kilometer takes at least four mates and you need to row at least 20 kilometers per day. We have our practice sessions at Beira Lake and Diyawanna Lake.
We row from 1.30 pm till 7 pm. Rowing training is done three days, gym training is on two days, fitness is for one day and we also have a morning run on one day,” he expressed. Oarsmen have to row for two kilometers in international competitions but local competitions excluding the nationals is one kilometer. Hashen’s first rowing competition was a two kilometer under 16 race at Bolgoda Lake in 2011. His first international competition was the Asian Junior Rowing Championships in Thaiwan.
An oarsman does not necessarily have to be a good swimmer to engage in rowing. Even if the boat topples it floats and the oarsman can hang on to it till he or she is rescued.
Hashen won the Maalyn Dias Scholarship for the most outstanding emerging Sportsman of the year in 2014. He became the Colombo Rowing Club Oarsman of the Year in 2016. He became a President’s Scout this year. Hashen is also a member of the Royal College Literary Club. He was nominated for the Monash University Future Leader Award in 2016 by his school. He is in grade 13.
Queried on how he manages his studies with his rigorous rowing sessions Hashen says that it is all about a matter of planning a schedule. He will be engaging in training and then rushing back home to take up studies. Time management was the most challenging aspect of it all.
Recalling his most memorable moment in connection with the sport Hashen says that the Roy-Tho Regatta 2014 tops the list.
“We won our race by inches! The event was the A Double Scull and it was held in Beira Lake,” he mused.
The rowing calendar is from January to October. November and December is their off season. April to October is their peak season and oarsmen need to watch what they drink during this period.
“Our schedule is hectic and it is tough on our families as well at first but everyone gradually gets use to it with time,” he pointed out.
Hashen’s father and mother are both into banking. His father is Halin Hettigoda. His mother is Manoji Hettigoda. His sister too started rowing three years ago.
Hashen’s ambition is to become an engineer. He has chosen commerce for his G C E Advanced Level examination. He is also sitting for his London A Level in the maths stream.
“I look up to my Chirath Karunanayake who was the Captain of the Royal College Rowing crew in 2011. My international sports hero is the New Zealand rower Mahé Owens Drysdale. He is the current Olympic champion and five-time World champion in the single Sculls,” Hashen said.
He says that a combination of what he witness in day to day life inspires him. He notes that many believe that one needs to take supplements to be fit and excel in the sport.
“This is a misconception. You need to be dedicated and motivated towards the sport. Even if it is a painful process, just keep rowing. Try your best and plan your schedule. As long as you are spot on, you will be able to manage anything,” he advised.
