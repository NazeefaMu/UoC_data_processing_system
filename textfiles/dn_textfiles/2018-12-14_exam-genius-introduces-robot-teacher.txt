Exam Genius introduces robot teacher

Exam Genius, a leading institute researching and developing new computer systems using state-of-the-art technologies, introduces an innovative artificial teacher with inbuilt time machine that develops children’s intelligence while training them properly.
The artificial teacher has been introduced to the market through Greentel Tabs. Many academics are of the opinion that the advent of an artificial teacher with a time machine will revolutionize the modern education in Sri Lanka. It scientifically analyses pre-data as to how the child answered the questions using artificial intelligence and identifies the child’s skills, weaknesses and doubtful areas which needs special attention on each subject. Then the robot teacher goes on to decide on ideal question papers that should be given to the child based on its analysis. It is only a computerized system can efficiently and effectively analyze and come to conclusions on complicated matters.
The time machine trains the child to work within a time frame and manage the time effectively to answer the questions. A salient feature of the time machine is its ability to show the results and grades immediately after calculating the child’s scores and revising the question paper with correct answers and the way to get them.
Since it inspires and makes an interest in the child to engage in education children tend to answer question papers without parental influence. The Greentel tab has been specially designed for kids blocking internet access.
