Shangri-La Hambantota gears up for earth day celebrations

Earth Day is globally recognized and celebrated on the April 22 and Shangri-La’s Hambantota Resort & Spa will celebrate its inaugural Earth Day with many activities related to sustainability, and an emphasis to think about the environment will be the highlight this weekend at the resort.
#RootedInNature is one initiative which will be launched in the resort’s Bojunhala restaurant this weekend. This initiative will focus on promoting home-grown vegetables, free from chemicals and pesticide. Adding to this will be a free range of livestock meat, poultry, eggs and sustainable seafood.
In 2014 Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts introduced Rooted in Nature, a culinary initiative highlighting locally sourced food offerings under the auspice of the Shangri-La Group’s sustainability commitment.
Earth Day at the resort sits amongst the many CSR projects that Shangri-La supports. The resort will also showcase a kid’s fashion catwalk event, where kids will use recyclable material as the attire.
A nature walk and much more awaits all at the resort. The recreation team of the resort will also emphasize the importance of fitness and wellbeing.
