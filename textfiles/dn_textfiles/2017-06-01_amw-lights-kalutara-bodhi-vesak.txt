AMW  lights up the Kalutara Bodhi  for Vesak

Associated Motor Ways (AMW) recently undertook the meritorious task of lighting up the sacred Kalutara Bodhi for the thrice blessed Vesak festival.
There was also a Bodhi Pooja that was held at the Kalutara Bodhi by the Company attended by the Managing Director of AMW Samantha Rajapakse and the Directors, employees and their families.
Founder of AMW, Sir Cyril de Zoysa has been closely associated with the Kalutara Bodhi Trust since its inception in 1951. The Kalutara Bodhi was visited by thousands of pilgrims during Vesak since it is a much venerated place of worship for Buddhists in Sri Lanka.
