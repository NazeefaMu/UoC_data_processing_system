Parliament Select Committee on national amity

A Parliament Select Committee is to be appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya this week to recommend measures to improve communal and religious harmony in Sri Lanka.
The Committee is expected to submit its report containing recommendations within six months. The Committee is to be set up to prevent repetition of misunderstanding among communities as experienced in Kandy in March, Ampara in February this year and Beruwala in June 2014.
The Committee has been asked to provide recommendations to prevent the propagation of defamatory opinions and opinions that undermine national harmony. It will discuss and decide on the suitability of including hate speech as a crime in the Penal Code.
It will look into the possibilities of categorising the school system on a non-racial or non-religious basis and introducing a special subject into the school curriculum in order to create national reconciliation.
The Committee will seek the contributions of academics, intellectuals and persons who have won the recognition and respect of the public, for this national and religious reconciliation programme. It will propose a mechanism to seek the contribution of the Security Forces, the Police and religious leaders for the programme. It will formulate norms that should be followed when expressing views via social websites and various media networks including the print and electronic media.
It will look into banning the publishing of news which disturbs national amity and how to formulate laws in that regard. The Committee will also be tasked with making recommendations to resolve issues related to the national language policy.
It will also examine and recommend changes to the Police Ordinance and policing in general to ensure better public confidence in the Sri Lanka Police Department.
The members of the Committee are Deputy Speaker J.M. Ananda Kumarasiri, Ministers Lakshman Kiriella, Gayantha Karunathilaka, Thalatha Atukorale, Ruwan Wijewardene, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, D.M.
