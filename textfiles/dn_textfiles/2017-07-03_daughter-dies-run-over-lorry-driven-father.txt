Daughter dies run over by lorry driven by father

A little girl named Balachandran Kaushalya of Mahadowa, Madulsima died after being accidentally run over by a lorry driven by her father, S. Balachandran (40), recently.
Balachandran, a lorry driver in the Madulsima town, had stopped the lorry on his way home after work on July 1 to speak to a friend.
His daughter who had gone to a nearby boutique to buy some goods had seen her father’s lorry parked in front and rushed there calling for the father unnoticed by him.
Blachandran, who had finished the conversation with the friend, had tried to proceed on his way and as he started the engine, the lorry had accidentally reversed and its rear tyres had run over his daughter who was trying to reach the lorry before it took off.
Kaushalya, who was severely injured, had been rushed to the Passara Hospital, but she had succumbed to her injuries after admission to hospital.
Balachandran was taken into custody by Madulsima police. He was to be produced before the Baddulla Magistrate.
