Postal unions’ protest disrupts Colombo Fort traffic

Heavy traffic prevailed along D.R. Wijewardene Mawatha and in Colombo Fort area due to a protest march organised by a group of postal workers, which started outside the Central Mail Exchange (CME), yesterday.
Postal Union workers launched the protest march demanding that the government resolve issues with regard to the recruitment procedure in the Postal Services.
The public were inconvenienced as protesters blocked roads in the Fort area and vehicular traffic was severely affected.
Meanwhile, the Postmaster General on Sunday urged the trade unions to end their strike and enter into discussions with the Department.
Issuing a statement, the Postmaster General said the issues will be resolved within a month, after having discussions with the trade unions.
The Postmaster General stated that the department had been conducting the service for over 200 years, and will be responsible for the problems faced by the public. The Postal Department workers would undergo difficulties if the strike continued and the 200-year-old service would be disrupted.
Postal Trade Unions’ Convenor Chinthaka Bandara meanwhile stated that the trade unions are ready to hold talks with the authorities, but the strike would not be called off until the demands are met.
Postal Services came to a halt on June 11 with the joint trade union strike launched by 23,000 employees of 24 Postal Services’ unions. Services at 653 post offices, 3,410 sub-post offices and 100 control officers were also disrupted. Over 1,500 airmail sacks were piled up at the BIA Airport and at the Central Mail Exchange (CME) as island-wide mail collection and distribution came to a standstill.
Bandara said the strike was carried out on two demands - to amend the recruitment process and to make sub-post masters permanent.
