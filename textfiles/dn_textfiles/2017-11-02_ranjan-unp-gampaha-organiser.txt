Ranjan, UNP Gampaha Organiser

Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has been appointed the UNP Organiser for Gampaha District.
UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim refuted rumours that Deputy Minister Ramanayake was expelled from the party adding that the party valued his role and wished for him to take on the reigns in the Gampaha district with the new appointment.
“Therefore, we decided to appoint him as the District Organiser not only for the Gampaha District but to cover the whole country. Following a request of him, we decided to appoint Kithsiri Manchanayake as the Divulapitiya Organiser,” he added.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake previously served as the UNP organiser for Divulapitiya and was replaced by Kithsiri Manchanayake on October 30.
