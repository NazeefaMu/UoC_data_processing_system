COPA summons Western Provincial Council

The Western Provincial Council (WPC) has been summoned before the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) on September 18.
The COPA has summoned the WPC while it is embroiled in a controversy over the expenditure borne for its new building complex at Denzil Kobbekaduwa Mawatha in Battaramulla.
The import of 104 chairs each valued at Rs 640,000 for the council received public backlash last month.
Added to that, JVP Councilor Lakshman Nipunarachchi came up with another revelation last week that Rs.15 million has been spent on the Council’s new chamber door, which is gold plated and bears carvings from the Kotte era.
The JVP has also complained to the Auditor General over spending of public money on the Leader of the House, Chief Government Whip, Opposition Leader and Chief Opposition Whip posts in the Provincial Councils stating that those are not legitimately recognised as coming under the Provincial Council Act.
The WPC administration is due to appear before the COPA at 2.30 pm on September 18, and the public are invited to direct their complaints and issues related to the institution prior to that day through post or email.
