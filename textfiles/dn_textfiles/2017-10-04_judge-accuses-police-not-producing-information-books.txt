Judge accuses Police of not producing information books

Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Padmini Ranawaka Gunatillake directed Inspector General of Police to look into the affairs of the Headquarter Chief Inspector of Mount Lavinia Police who is not producing police information books regarding heroin drug cases that come up for trial before the High Court.
The Judge also issued notice on the Mount Lavinia Headquarter Chief Inspector to appear before Court on October 12.
When drug trafficking, the cases were taken up before Court, no police officer had been present from the Mount Lavinia Police.
“The police do not produce information books regarding the cases of drug trafficking. Although the Courts had instructed Mount Lavinia Police HQI to produce police information books regarding drug cases, the police are in the habit of not producing the information books when the cases are called before Court for trials. Why is that?” the Judge queried.
Since there is no response from Mount Lavinia Police, the Inspector General of Police must look into this matter urgently enabling the Court to dispose the drug trafficking cases, the Judge stated in Court.
The Judge made these comments when a drug trafficking case was called before Court for trial yesterday.
In this case, the Attorney General charged Adamberage Roshande Alwis with possessing more than one gram of heroin and trafficking within the jurisdiction of the High Court. The case was postponed by the Judge.
