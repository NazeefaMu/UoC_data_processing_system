British School Swimming Gala :
Newton House regains overall title

Newton House regained the overall title at the Annual Inter-House Swimming Gala of the British School in Colombo (BSC) which was worked off at their swimming pool recently.
Newton House who last won the overall championship in 2016/17 put up an outstanding performance as they clinched the title for the third occasion in six years.
Meanwhile, the defending champions Nobel House had to be content with the runners-up position following a keen contest along with their rivals Scott House and Shakespeare House.
Overall, it was a tremendous show of outstanding spirit, sportsmanship and skill demonstrated by the BSC swimmers who were inspired by the respective House Teachers and parents.
