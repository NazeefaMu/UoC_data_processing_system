Hard stuff

Many of today’s most visible feminist authors, including Filipovic and her contemporaries Jessica Valenti (Sex Object: A memoir, 2016) and Lindy West (Shrill: Notes from a loud woman, 2016), shaped their style by contributing to funny, gossipy group blogs where articles about Photoshopped actors ran next to posts detailing the latest political attack on birth control.
For every competent feminist book”, Camille Paglia wrote in the Observer in 1995, “there are twenty others shot through with inaccuracies, distortions, and propaganda.” It is an inflammatory claim – notoriously, provocation is Paglia’s primary if not exclusive mode – but without the “feminist” modifier, it is a plain fact. It is difficult for any nonfiction book to be competent, let alone good, whether the topic is women or history or science; writing well is a challenge, as is, relatedly, the exercise of logic. In the present political climate, the creation and dissemination of progressive work can feel doubly urgent, and judging by a spate of disappointing publications (Paglia’s collected essays among them), today’s mainstream feminism is not nearly as rigorous, comprehensive or useful as the moment demands.
First, a sketch, to illustrate the stakes: the United States incarcerates over 200,000 women, as many as two-thirds of whom have minors at home. When factoring in women on parole or probation, the number currently “supervised” by the criminal justice system balloons to more than a million. More than a third of American single mothers live in poverty, and according to the National Women’s Law Center, more than one in eight women are poor. In recent years, much has been made of women’s record-high college attendance, with less comment on the fact that women hold nearly 65 per cent of the nation’s student debt ($1.3 trillion at the latest tally).
Procedure inaccessible
The US has more maternal deaths than anywhere else in the developed world, and black women are almost four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than are white women. Ninety per cent of US counties lack a clinic that provides abortion, which renders the procedure inaccessible to about 40 per cent of women who can get pregnant, and it would be a mistake to assume expense is not as daunting an obstacle as location.
Meanwhile, gender violence was brought back into the headlines this summer, albeit briefly, by a report, carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), analysing murders of American women. Strangers are responsible for only 16 per cent of female homicides, which means that a woman’s killer is usually her current or former romantic partner, or else another friend or family member. In response, the CDC recommended bystander intervention training and suggested that states limit access to guns.
These measures feel inadequate (and, especially in the case of guns, impracticable). How do we keep men from killing women? Or, how do we simply keep men from killing? The question is one that mainstream feminism doesn’t ask much any more, aside from periodic invocations of “toxic masculinity”.
Labour conditions
This litany of entrenched, intentional injustices predates Donald Trump’s presidency, so professional feminists who have neglected these matters cannot excuse themselves with the claim that times abruptly changed.
The fixations that have dominated middle-class feminism in recent years – assaults on campus, underwhelming (hetero) sexual encounters, the pathetic ratio of female to male CEOs, sexism in Silicon Valley – cannot speak meaningfully to many of the horrors less advantaged women face both at home and abroad: dangerous labour conditions, deportation, murder by police, imprisonment.
This is not to say middle-class concerns are categorically frivolous but rather that their elevation comes at the expense of a more cogent and inclusive ideology.
We have narrowed the scope of public feminism to a pinprick, rehashing yet another Lena Dunham controversy when we should have been developing and promoting reforms that encompassed systems of exploitation not defined by gender alone – the rapid progression of mass incarceration, venal health-care systems and repeated, successful attacks on voter rights, to name some of the most glaring. This failure could perhaps have gone on unabated for the immediate future but now, without the superficial reassurance of a woman in the White House, mainstream feminism has to face up to its own deficiencies. One might begin with those evidenced by blogging pundits turned highprofile authors.
Jill Filipovic is one such established tastemaker who in her uninspired The H-Spot: The feminist pursuit of happiness mixes several trendy elements (women, happiness and pop psychology) to deliver a nearly substance- free result.
“We have a problem with female pleasure and that is holding women back”, she writes in her introduction. “Our political and cultural priorities aren’t about making life more enjoyable, but about getting ahead, attaining bigger and better things, ‘having it all.’” It’s a disingenuous, banal and unconvincing diagnosis of the female condition. Women are not oppressed by nebulous pressures to get ahead any more than anyone else in the West; indeed, in the first chapter, Filipovic acknowledges that “one of the paradoxes of happiness, researchers have found, is that women tend to be happier than men”.
Male enjoyment
Which is to say, if there’s a “problem with female pleasure”, we must be in the midst of an outright crisis for male enjoyment. But she persists with this flimsy frame because it allows her to expound on comfortable subjects such as why women shouldn’t change their surname when they marry and how sad it is when you grow apart from a friend after she finds a romantic partner. “Happiness is now a concept you find in magazines selling women regressive ideas”, Filipovic complains with no apparent irony.
Filipovic graduated from law school, worked as Cosmopolitan.com’s “senior political writer”, and has concerned herself, ostensibly, with social justice for years; surely she has learnt that there are far more honest claims for the exclusions and cruelties of US institutions than that they “reflect a profound and abiding antipathy toward women’s day-to-day enjoyment”.
But it is a typical liberal feminist stance that the status quo needs tweaking instead of complete demolition, and this complicity necessarily limits criticism. Filipovic admits the former (“there are . . . a great many ways to improve the status quo”) before indicating the latter by concluding that some of women’s top concerns should be “fostering relationships”, “promoting sexual pleasure” and “mak[ing] food feminist”.
Oppressive systems
Her faith in the fundamental right-ness of the state is further evidenced by her appeal to government interventions: “the day-care system in the United States is terrifyingly underregulated”, she says, and “advertising for diet products should also be more tightly regulated”. If she were willing to even momentarily address oppressive systems directly she might manage more substantial analysis; instead, she is studiously toothless. “Capitalism”, at least, receives a listing in the index, for its cameo citation: “The American pursuit of happiness has morphed . . . into a thoroughly capitalist endeavour”. And a few pages later: “happiness researchers have reached a number of important conclusions”, including that “governments influence happiness” and “human relationships impact happiness.” (my emphasis). Well, thank God for science.
Many of today’s most visible feminist authors, including Filipovic and her contemporaries Jessica Valenti (Sex Object: A memoir, 2016) and Lindy West (Shrill: Notes from a loud woman, 2016), shaped their style by contributing to funny, gossipy group blogs where articles about Photoshopped actors ran next to posts detailing the latest political attack on birth control.
They established reputations at a time when personal anecdotes counted as much as if not more than actual reporting or quantified information, when stories of individual men’s bad behaviour or excoriations of “fatphobia” reliably went viral, while sober reports on health inequity or our militarized police force, did not. Garnering the maximum number of clicks and shares usually means providing “content” that is easily digestible and free of the ponderous theorizing that distinguished second wave powerhouses like the late Kate Millett and Shulamith Firestone; a so-called take is more likely to be widely read if the author hasn’t thought much about what they are saying, or how they are saying it.
Thoughtlessness may be a feature of any writing generated to satisfy an aggressive publishing pace, and it is only fair to recognize the market pressures that shape women’s writing – which is, after all, a livelihood – but allowing one’s ideas to stagnate is plainly negligent, especially if you are a corporate media darling with continued access to large platforms. -Times Literary Supplement
