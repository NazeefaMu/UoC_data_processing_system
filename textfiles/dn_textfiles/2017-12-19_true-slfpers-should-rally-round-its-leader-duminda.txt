True SLFPers should rally round its leader: Duminda

Today a group who entered parliament under the SLFP banner is engaged in promoting a separate political party betraying the mother party and attempting to divide the SLFP, SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
He noted that from the grass-roots level up to the level of the President, they have all tried their best to unite the two factions for the well-being of the SLFP which was sabotaged as planned by some hypocrites within the party who are trying to gain their lost authority and power by hook or by crook.
He made this comment at an awareness meeting regarding the forthcoming Local Government elections at the Anuradhapura SLFP office.
The minister said any parliamentarian who was found having breached the party constitution would be severely dealt with legally. No one shall be allowed to work against the SLFP, Dissanayake stated.
“President Maithripala Sirisena, once he was elected as the Chairman of the SLFP, wanted to ensure that those who destroyed the party would leave it.
“However, there were still many issues to be resolved and some of these culprits were still to be held responsible for their actions. A mother who plucked some mangoes and the child who stole a coconut due to hunger, were remanded. But those responsible for national crimes have still not been made accountable for their crimes.
“The SLFP would definitely become cleaner and brighter if such bad eggs left the party,” he he said.
Dissanayake said a large number of political parties are contesting at the forthcoming Local Government elections, but only the SLFP candidates are in a strong position to develop the villages.
The minister pointed out to the amateur candidates that when former President Chandrika Kumaratunge retired from the office of the President, the members did not grumble that they cannot work without her, since she was instrumental in gaining power for the SLFP which continued to be in the opposition for 17 years.
That, he said, should be made applicable in the case of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. “We, the true SLFPers, are duty bound and obliged to rally round the present leader of the SLFP President Maithripala Sirisena in conformity with the SLFP rules and conditions,” Dissanayake said.
