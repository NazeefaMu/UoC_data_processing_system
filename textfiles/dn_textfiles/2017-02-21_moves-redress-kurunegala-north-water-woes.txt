Moves to redress Kurunegala North water woes

The foundation stone for the “Deduru Oya Water Supply Project” was laid by City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem, Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chang Won-sam and other dignitaries yesterday.
The project is supported by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) to provide clean and safe drinking water to the people in Mahawa and Polpithigama divisions in the Northern part of Kurunegala district as these areas are affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
The rapid spread of CKD is a huge problem in Sri Lanka while the Kurunegala district has been identified by health authorities as a severely affected area. The main reason for the spread of CKD is the consumption of unsafe ground water due to the lack of pipe borne water in the Kurunegala district.
The government aims to take measures to address the prevalence of CKD under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
To prevent this debilitating disease, Korea Eximbank expects to provide safe drinking water for residents in Mahawa and Polpithigama Divisional Secretary’s divisions in the Kurunegala North district. Through this project, pipe borne water will be provided to 18,200 households benefiting 90,800 residents.
The scope of this project includes building comprehensive water supply facilities such as intake structure, water treatment plant, transmission lines, storage reservoirs and distribution network.
Institutional capacities will be developed to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of these facilities.
Upon successful project completion in mid-2019, Korea Eximbank expects to contribute towards decreasing the incidence of CKD and water-borne diseases and improve the health environment and living conditions in the region.
