'No JO MPs will join SLFP May Day rally'

UPFA Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga yesterday said no Joint Opposition (JO) parliamentarian will go to Getambe for the SLFP May Day rally but instead will head to the Galle Face Green for the rally to be held under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Speaking to the media in Colombo Ranatunga said JO members were already active in the provinces to bring large crowds to the Galle face from all corners of the country.
Ranatunga said the JO rally will go down in history as one of the most successful held by an opposition group.
He said JO members will not fear threats or intimidation and will head to the Galle Face in their numbers on May 1. Ranatunga said he does not see the possibility of JO and SLFP members in the government teaming up together for the May Day in the current context.
He said the SLFP members in the JO knew the desire of the party members and supporters and were always willing to make any sacrifice to fulfil their expectations.
