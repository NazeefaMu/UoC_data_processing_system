Unhindered relief for drought affected: Anuradhapura GA

Food rations and drinking water are being distributed to the drought affected farmer families in the Anuradhapura district without hindrance, Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News.
He said 141,328 farmer families would receive a dry food ration worth Rs. 2,500 each under the 2nd phase of the programme. Already 2,500 families in the Mahavilachchiya Divisional Secretariat Division were provided the relief and other 21 DS Divisions would receive the relief this week, he said.
Under the first phase, 157,503 families were to receive the relief. But the Disaster Management Ministry assisted by the GA Anuradhapura and District Secretaries have reduced the number to 141,328 families after re-examining their eligibility for the relief. Many names were deleted from the list as they have neglected the social work that they were asked to engage in for five days per month in a work site noted by the GA. Wanninayaka said water distribution was limited to 11,010 families in 64 Grama Niladhari divisions in the district since the areas now receive rains.
He said 70,000 persons in 27,000 families in 18 DS divisions were provided with drinking water through water bowsers.
The GA said every drought affected family would be provided with drinking water. Pipe borne water is suplied to nearly three lakhs of people in the Anuradhapura city and the suburb through Nuwarawewa, Tisawewa and Thuruvila. He said around 40.000 cubic meters of purified water was pumped from the tanks daily.
Major reservoirs received a low quantity of water despite the rain. The water level of the Nuwarawewa reservoir rose only four inches with the rain, Wanninayake said.
The Mahaweli Water Control Committee and the Mahaweli Authority have taken steps to pump 5,000 acre feet of Mahaweli water to the tanks via the Kalawewa and Nachchaduwa, the AG said.
