Douglas visits striking prisoners

General Secretary of the EPDP and Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda visited the Magazine Prison accompanied by National Dialogue Minister Mano Ganeshan to meet Tamil prisoners who launched a satyagraha campaign in prison on Tuesday.
The visit was made at the request of parents and relatives of the pioneers, said a spokesman for the EPDP. The spokesman said Commissioner General of Prisons Rohana Pushpakumara arranged a delegation of the striking prisoners to meet the visiting group at his office considering the violence Devananda had to face when he visited Tamil prisoners in May 1997.
The prisoners alleged that they had been kept in prison without trial for over five years.
They wanted the legal process expedited to obtain their release.
The spokesmen said Devananda assured the prisoners that he would try to obtain a common amnesty for them or direct them for rehabilitation by making representations to the President and the Prime Minister.
Devananda told prisoners that eventhough he was against LTTE terrorism, he would look at the predicament of Tamil prisoners with sympathy from a humanist angle.
