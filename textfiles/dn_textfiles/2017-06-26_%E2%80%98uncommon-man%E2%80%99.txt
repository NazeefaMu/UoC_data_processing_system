An ‘Uncommon Man’

She is not your typical Sri Lankan wife and he is not the ‘common man’ you would expect a local film director to be. When two strong and unusual personalities meet, it is inevitable that sparks would fly. During the 36 years they were together Nihara Rutam, nee Jayatilleke has seen her award winning filmmaker husband, Chandran Rutnam, grow with each film and put the Sri Lankan emblem in the global cinema arena.
The film maker
Chandran is different from most of the local film directors because his initial background started from ‘The Bridge On The River Kwai’ during the 1950s. His foundation was set by the Academy Award winning director David Lean. Therefore his outlook was based on that experience. He looks at things differently and his direction too is different from typical local directors. That is why his work can easily be adapted by foreign cinema goers.
The husband
Chandran makes a fantastic husband. Here too he is not like a typical Sri Lankan husband. He is broadminded and flexible. He does not have the hang ups that most Sri Lankan husbands have. He gives me a lot of freedom to pursue my own dreams and expand my horizons. He encourages me a lot in whatever I take up.
He is also a very easy husband. He is not particular about food or other household matters. We do not keep maids. Though he does not know how to do household chores he would definitely give them a try if you tell him how to do them. The only thing he might be particular about is how his wardrobe should be. I am lucky to have him as a husband.
First meeting
I was working as the first marketing manager for Oriflame in Sri Lanka and I was on my way to a training session in India. Chandran too was on his way to India to take part in a film festival. We met at the airport in Chennai. I didn’t see him though we had briefly bumped into each other there. I happen to gatecrash the after party he was hosting. He actually remembered me because as soon as I walked in with my friends he said, “Oh, you were at the airport with me.” I generally do not take much notice of anybody when I am travelling so I don’t remember him much. I was surprised to see him because he was not what I had expected him to be.
Chandran had to head off to Malaysia the next day because he was a juror at the Malaysian Film Festival. However we kept in touch.
Route to matrimony
Our relationship was filled with loads of controversy. Chandran was going through a divorce then. I am a Sinhalese Buddhist while he is a Tamil Christian. He is also almost double my age. My mother knew that I would always do something different with my life. She knew that I would not just settle for a typical Sri Lankan man! She was shocked about my choice and she did not exactly like it but she did not oppose of it either.
The proposal
Chandran proposed quite a number of times to me. I love shoes and once he bought around 10 pairs of shoes for me, a diamond ring and 3000 red roses. I didn’t say ‘yes’ that time. Later he put up a 12 foot banner across Havelock Road saying ‘Nihara, I love you. Will you marry me? – Chandran’. That’s what probably did it.
Lots of people say I am very unusual for a Sri Lankan. So a normal Sri Lankan man wouldn’t have matched me. Chandran was different. He is very broadminded. That was something that really attracted me. He was extremely romantic too. We have been going out with each other for 20 years before we tied the knot in April 13, 2001. We have been married for 16 years.
Greatest production
I can’t pinpoint one film and say that it is Chandran’s greatest creation. He does some simple and light movies as well but I think that each one of those other serious movies have been unique in scope. Alimankada was done facing a lot of hardships because it was shot during the terrorist era. I was very difficult for us to get permission to engage in certain things then.
Every movie has a story behind it and every creation has its own unique style. Chandran is still making movies and his latest is a kid’s movie. It is a huge project which will have some international actors starring in the project. He is currently discussing it with some people in the states.
If he is done with making movies I could say that I think this particular movie is his greatest. However I do have a particularly soft corner for Alimankada. I was very involved in that project because I was an associate producer and the hardships we faced made the movie close to my heart.
Careerwise
Whenever he comes up with a new project Chandran gives me the script to read. He changes the script about a 100 times and I get a reading each time. I am not a movie buff at all. Therefore I am very critical. Chandran likes that very much. He even involves me when we select the cast because sometimes he cannot say “no” to some people while I put down my foot and say “no” to certain things that don’t seem right.
I have told him from day one, no acting in movies for me. However while shooting for ‘A Common Man’ the actress who was stepping in as an extra was getting late to come to the sets. So he got me to do the part which was on screen for only a few seconds. I also appeared in a scene in ‘According to Mathew’.
I run the Asian Aviation Center. Chandran is the chairman of the company. We train pilots, aircraft engineers and technicians. Overall anything I do he backs me up 100 percent. He has a lot of confidence in my abilities.
The joy of their life
We have a seven year old daughter, Danara. She is schooling at Musaeus College. I fly and she has seen me in my piloting uniform. Probably because of that she says that she wants to be a pilot when she grows up.
Memorable moments on the sets
Chandran is the head of Asian Film Location Services and had assisted a lot of foreign projects that were shot in Sri Lanka. Being on the sets can be fun but stressful as well. The director could be very demanding or the actors could be difficult. Once there was an Indian movie shooting here and the actress was the ‘nose up in the air’ type. This particular scene was being shot at my office in Rathmalana. I allowed her to rest in my room. She did not know who I am but she was acting very snobbish. I had to cut her down to size.
While shooting ‘Water’ John Abraham was such a humble and down to earth guy. We thought that Sir Ben Kingsley is very snooty but he was actually living his role throughout the shooting sessions. Since I am not a movie fan I do not get starstruck when I meet internationally known actors.
There were good moments and bad moments on the sets. However at the end of the day once the movie is done you part as friends.
Chilling out
We hardly have time to relax. Being with Danara is relaxing. We go out for dinner or just spend some time with her going somewhere like down south. Time is very limited. We would love to vacation abroad but we just cannot find the time to do so. France is one of our favourite places to visit. We like to walk for hours over there.
Chandran relaxes by watching movies. I love horse riding. He is interested in horses too because his parents had kept horses. I am in the committee of the Royal Turf Club so we head off to Nuwara Eliya for the races.
Foodwise
I cook breakfast and dinner. My mother makes lunch for us. We both love Japanese and Thai food. Chandran is a spaghetti bolognese fan. We try to stick to very basic things on a normal day to day basis. We only have a pizza every two months. No burgers or French fries.
Three lesser known facts
Chandran is a very private person.
Everyone thinks he is tough but he is a very big softie – in a nice way.
Everybody things that he is this high flying, sophisticated man but he is very simple in his tastes and down to earth. We do not lead the usual lifestyle of a film director. He likes simple things in life which only a few have realized.
Life together in a few words
Our life together is very exciting, never a dull moment and unpredictable.
