Dazzling 27,000sq ft showroom  under one roof

Tiesh, the leading jewellers both in Kandy and Colombo, recently unveiled its massive 27,000 sq ft showroom and now goes on record as having Sri Lanka’s largest ever Gems and Jewellery Emporium, all under one roof.
Famously known as “Lakmini (Pvt) Ltd” since its launch in 1997, this showroom at No 676, Peradeniya Road, is now completely revamped and rebranded as ‘Tiesh’ and is a virtual haven for both walk-in customers, tourists and the eagle-eyed connoisseur.
Tiesh already holds the record for owning the largest showroom in Sri Lanka since the opening of the Gallery of Sapphires in 2016, a landmark achievement at the same premises.
This new venture expands its portfolio with the addition of over 14,000sq ft of plush showroom AND an additional 13,000sq ft of service areas featuring auditoriums and theatres. The current expansion includes the new state-of-the-art workshop and museum in addition to the existing laboratory, auditorium and the near-real replica of the gem mine.
“This resplendent outlet lays claim to Tiesh’s commitment towards enhancing the customer experience and feeling of being part of something more than the mere purchase of a dazzling piece of jewellery. It is an immersive journey into a culture, spawned centuries ago, in a land which continues to appeal to the heart of gems and jewellery connoisseurs from around the world,” said its visionary Founder and Managing Director, Lasantha de Fonseka, adding that customers will be enthralled by Sri Lanka’s gemological story. “The success of Tiesh as Sri Lanka’s leading gems and jewellery provider is also due to the dedication and passion of my family, staff, tour operators and loyal customers.”
Over the years Tiesh has burgeoned into a brand of great repute. The 27,000sq foot Emporium features an exquisite array of authentic gems and handcrafted pieces of jewellery set in both precious and semi-precious gemstones, highlighting the world famed Sri Lankan Blue Sapphires and more.
All items are intricately designed with precious metals ranging from gold (yellow, white and rose in 22k, 18k and 14k) to sterling silver. With a keen eye for detail, the one-of-a-kind jewellery is crafted to international standards and designed to mesmerise.
This family-owned establishment which began on 05 September 1997, has, over the past three decades acquired great celebrity status in the local and international sphere. Spearheaded by its Founder / Managing Director Lasantha De Fonseka and his wife Bryony, Tiesh is joined by the equally hands-on next generation, with daughter Thiyasha and son Ayesh who are committed to providing an unparalleled expertise and a personal interest in each customer who steps into a world of brilliance.
The Tiesh Emporium is designed with the intention of sparking an appeal to delve into the milestones of the gem industry; from the history of the stones to the entire production, prior to becoming a gift of love, a family heirloom or an indulgence to the customer.
As one of Sri Lanka’s leading contemporary jewellers, Tiesh is not only a jewellery store with a reputation to match. It is also an engaging and hands-on learning experience. It inspires that ethereal feel of being ensconced in a world of one’s own, in which gems and jewellery take precedence. A step into the showroom lures you to luxuriate in the story of every sparkle uniquely created just for you.
