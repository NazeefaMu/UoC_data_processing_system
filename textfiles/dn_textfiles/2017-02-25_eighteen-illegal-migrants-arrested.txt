Eighteen illegal migrants arrested

The Sri Lanka Navy(SLN) arrested 18 people who attempted to illegally migrate to New Zealand or Australia by sea last morning.
These persons were taken into custody during a joint search operation conducted by the Sri Lanka Navy and the Police at around 12 noon yesterday in the Lellama area, Negombo, while arriving at the beach in a van, SLN Media Spokesman Lieutenant Commander Chaminda Walakuluge said.
The search operation was carried out on a tip-off received by the Navy. It is believed that the group of suspects consisting of 15 Tamils and three Sinhalese were hoping to board a boat to travel to the their intended destinations. According to the Navy spokesman, the skipper of the boat has said that their intended destination was Australia while three suspects said that the destination was New Zealand. However, the Navy believes that these persons had allegedly attempted to travel to Australia illegally.
The Spokesman further said that illegal immigration is a well-organised racket and the Navy is actively involved in stopping illegal migration by sea with the assistance of the Police. Lt.Commander Walakuluge said that the suspects together with the van in which they travelled were handed over to the Negombo Police for further investigations.
