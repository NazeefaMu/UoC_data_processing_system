Lavanga Resort and Spa Hikkaduwa  invests Rs 250 mn

Lavanga Resort and Spa Hikkaduwa is investing Rs. 250 million to upgrade the hotel and expand its foot print.
The hotel was first built on bare land as a 16 room all-suite hotel by Australian entrepreneur and architect, Daniel Frydman. “Since the demand for the hotel increased we decided to add 30 additional deluxe rooms,” said Managing Director, Anusha de Alwis Frydman who is now managing the property.
She said that under the third phase of the hotel development they added 16 more budget rooms after acquiring an adjoining land and have built two bridges to connect the two buildings. The other investment of the hotel included the installation of a new sewerage plant, a building for new staff quarters and up grading of rooms with European fittings, decor and furniture.
“Today we have also invested to install new lighting and décor to the roof top banquet hall, minus any pillars to cater to the growing demand. It could accommodate 400 guests and is one of the largest facilities in the area.”
She said that the hotel due to its location also has a private beach. “We are now extending the Pool Deck area to offer more dining options for our guests.” Under their other refurbishment plans the main restaurant too was extended with an outdoor dining area.
“Today resort consists of 60 various types of large rooms and Suite rooms which has air conditioning, mini bar, hot cold water, cable TV, safety deposit boxes, mini fridge and many other facilities.”
These facilities of the hotel also include huge children’s in-house playing area including a cinema hall, which is a first in the region and a kiddie’s pool, spa and a basement car park.
In addition there is a large library storing over reading material of over 10 languages, which is also the only such facility in the region. “Our main market is Russian, Ukraine and European and UK market. We also have special packages for Bank of Ceylon Card holders.”
The hotel also won best small hotels in Asia Pacific Region in the world recently along with several other awards.
