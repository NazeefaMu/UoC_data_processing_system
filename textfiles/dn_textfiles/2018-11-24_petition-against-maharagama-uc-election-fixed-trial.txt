Petition against Maharagama UC election fixed for trial

The election petition filed in the Colombo High Court seeking a declaration that the election of 23 candidates who contested for the Maharagama Urban Council under an independent group (motorcycle symbol) is invalid and that they are disqualified was fixed for trial by the Colombo High Court.
The petition was fixed for trial on January 10 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga yesterday.
This petition had been filed by 21 candidates nominated by UNP at the Local Authorities Election held on February 10, for the election of the Maharagama Urban Council.
The petitioners stated that they are entitled to be declared elected and returned to Maharagama Urban Council in terms of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance No.53 of 1946 and especially section 82 P (2) d, 82 R, 82S and 65 read with section 82 of the Ordinance.
The petitioners stated that 1 to 23 respondents of the Election Petition were not voters of the Maharagama electorate and neither are they residents within the Maharagama electoral area.
The petitioners stated that the elections of the members of the independent group No. 2 are void since they did not have the qualification required by Section 8 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. The petitioners alleged that most of candidates who contested under the motorcycle symbol were not residents of Maharagama. The petitioners said the addresses listed next to their names read as Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatte. Counsel Suren Fernando with Sanjeewa Kaluarachchi appeared for the petitioners. Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners. Counsel Lanka Dharmasiri with Mehran Careem appeared for Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
