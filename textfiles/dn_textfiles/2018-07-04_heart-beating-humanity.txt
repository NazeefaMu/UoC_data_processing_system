Heart  beating with humanity

 
“When some become leaders they tend to think of themselves as all-powerful. We tend to think that we are superior. If we can’t soothe another person there is no point in becoming a leader. You should be able to make your followers good leaders,”
Head Prefect of Princess of Wales Moratuwa, Shehara Isham believes that winning the hearts of people can have a very positive influence on society and make a huge difference in everyone’s lives. Perfect Prefects features Isham, who believes in touching hearts.
Isham believes that one form of love is the act of giving a future of stability and security to children. A Future where children can enjoy life. A future that they, in turn, can pass on to future generations.
“A leader should always be focused on the welfare of the younger generation. A leader should embody the very characteristics the young should embody – humanity, kindness and love. This is so we can build a better tomorrow. This is what the youth should stand for. A leader’s focus should always be this,” said Isham.
Understanding the circumstances
Apart from natural disasters, many problems originate amongst humans. But more than winning conflicts winning hearts is important.
“Dealing with humans is not like dealing with machines. Humans possess emotions. Understanding the circumstances they might be living in and understanding their hearts is important. We can’t understand the circumstances a person comes from by judging by outer appearances. He or she might be facing a great difficulty or he or she might be in mental distress. I need to talk to that person carefully and accurately assess and understand the situation she is in. Leading people is not bossing them around. Leading is being friendly to a person and understanding them,” explained Isham.
Becoming Head Girl was not unexpected for Isham. However, she has always had a genuine desire to help the school that has given her so much and be a role model to children.
“I really believe in loving people. This is evident from what I say and do. I have always maintained cordial relationships with my fellow students. Being obedient to the teachers and staff have also been a priority of mine. I have also given equal importance in educating myself in addition to my extracurricular activities. I enjoy reading poetry and reading novels and watching movies that won Cannes or Oscars,” stated Isham.
Isham has been to other schools but Princess of Wales is where she found her true family.
Special bond
“Princess of Wales is where I settled down at. It is celebrating 142 years of existence. This is where I found myself. I have a special bond with this school. From day one I was guided by my teachers. I have been taught proper moral values through my school and I have also learnt to be good and kind. Everything has been given to me by my school.
It has moulded my character in many ways. It has really empowered me. Even though I have been reprimanded, I have always been reminded that I am loved. I have learnt leadership qualities from my school,” pointed out Isham.
Amongst the leaders she admires is Dr Martin Luther King. King’s compassionate leadership has made quite an impression on Isham.
“He brought people together and that was something that was really hard to do. He had this special quality within him that enabled him to bring people together,” said Isham.
Isham’s ambition in life is to become an oncologist. She is currently doing bioscience and would like to pursue higher studies at Otago and Harvard.
Biggest change
“I understand that cancer patients are in distress and that really hits me hard. If I can fulfil my dream of being an oncologist, I am willing to help those who are too poor to pay for their treatment,” said Isham.
Isham believes that 7 billion hearts beating together can create the biggest change in this world. It is a force that cannot be underestimated.
“Though we as individuals differ from each other, I believe in being compassionate and influencing those around me, effecting change for the greater good. There are 7 billion hearts in this world but there are only a few that beat into others. We have to become a society that wants to help others. People need to live in the real world without living in a dream world.
We need to be down to earth. Poverty, Diseases and Mental Stress are issues that concern me the most in this world.
When a person is undergoing mental stress he or she should be helped out. I really feel for them,” explained Isham.
Leadership is more than leading from the front with bravery, intelligence and a bit of luck. Sometimes you need to be able to heal.
“When some become leaders they tend to think of themselves as all-powerful. We tend to think that we are superior. If we can’t soothe another person there is no point in becoming a leader. You should be able to make your followers good leaders,” said Isham.
Becoming Head Girl will be a day that will always remain special to her and of course school is the place she loves the most. “As Head Girl, I have a lot of responsibilities. Pressure can come from many areas of my life. But as an individual, I have always kept away from doing wrong- harming someone else or lying. Knowing that my intentions are noble, I handle the pressure that way,” said Isham.
