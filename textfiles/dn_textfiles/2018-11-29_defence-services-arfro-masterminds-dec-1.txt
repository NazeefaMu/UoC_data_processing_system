Defence Services ARFRO Masterminds on Dec. 1

ARFRO Masterminds Competition - 2018 will be held on December 1 at Golden Rose, Boralesgamuwa with the participation of Officers from the Army, Navy and Air Force.
The competition will be held with the aim of creating different learning opportunities for members of the Armed Forces while focusing on improving their reading skills and knowledge of important subjects, such as military history, current affairs, general knowledge, sport and science.
The competition is organised by the Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers (ARFRO).
ARFRO is an organisation of senior retired military officers, Brigadiers, etc who are collectively referred to as ‘Flag Rank Officers’.
ARFRO came into being in 1996 as a result of an invitation from the Worldwide Consultative Association of Retired Generals and Admirals (WACARGA) to participate in their activities.
ARFRO President Rear Admiral Sarath Rathnakeerthi said the objectives of ARFRO Masterminds Competition (ARFROMC) are to arrange a platform for the members of Armed Forces to test and add value to their knowledge and providing an opportunity to showcase the knowledge of members of the Armed Forces and disseminate their knowledge among other members. It is also aimed at creating a quizzing culture among the members of Armed Forces, and launching an event that can be added as an icon to the annual calendar of events of ARFRO in the future. He said ARFRO has plans to conduct similar competitions for other categories as well such as Higher Management Category (Lieutenant Colonels, Colonels and Brigadiers of Army and equivalents in Navy and Air Force) and Lower Management Category (Lieutenants and Second Lieutenants in the Army and equivalents in Navy and Air Force). Modus operandi for ARFROMCs in Masterminds Competitions will also be the same irrespective of category of participation.
“ARFROMC is not only for officers. We will have one arranged for non – commissioned officers/other ranks of three forces, conducted in a similar manner.
“ARFRO has made this arrangement to create a platform for a large number of serving members of Armed Forces, who are in different levels of management hierarchy, to participate in this type of programmes.”
Major General (Dr) Dudley Perera of ARFRO is expected to Chair the Panel of Judges of the ARFRO Masterminds Competition - 2018 and already, nearly 300 participants, from Army, Navy and Air Force, have registered for the competition.
