The dark story of the Little Mermaid

Little Mermaid, her sisters and the Prince are nothing like you would imagine in the original tale.
A 14-year-old mythical creature is on a mission to find true love in Hans Christian Andersen’s 1837 story. The lengths she goes to achieve that is nothing like Walt Disney’s fairytale.
The original story is dark that included a murder and suicide. When Little Mermaid visits Ursula, the Sea Witch she strikes a deal, swapping her voice and tongue for legs.
She will only survive if she wins over the affections of the Prince. In Hans’ version, she doesn’t get the man of her dreams as he marries someone else, according to a report by The Sun.
The heartbroken girl is offered another ultimatum by the Sea Witch. Murder the prince to live. She agrees but doesn’t go through with the deal.
She eventually dissolves into foam. But as her spirit floats in the sky, she gains a soul by having to carry out good deeds for 300 years.
In the Danish author’s tale Little Mermaid’s sisters were also not innocent. They would brag about luring sailors to their deaths into the water.
And the prince, well he’s no prince at all. The book reveals her would be entertained by female slaves at the palace and he describes his love for the mermaid “as he would love a little child.”
Aren’t you glad Walk Disney made some tweaks to the story? Because that is definitely no happily ever after. The Sun
