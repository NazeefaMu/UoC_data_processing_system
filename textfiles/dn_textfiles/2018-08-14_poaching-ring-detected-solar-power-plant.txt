Poaching ring detected at solar power plant

There was valid proof to suggest that employees attached to solar energy plants in the Hambantota Wild Elephant Management Forest Reserve, were engaged in deer-poaching, Hambantota Wildlife Range Officer J. A. P. Wijayakumara said.
Ten skulls and other remains of deer were found hidden inside one of the plants during a recent raid, he added.
Wijayakumara said entry to the solar energy plant compounds was forbidden to the public, including Wildlife officials. He added that employees of the plant protested when Wildlife officers entered the compound.
The Wildlife range officer said nearly 31 wire traps laid for deer were found in the forest reserve where the solar energy plant was situated and a person caught laying such a trap, was found to be an employee of the same plant.
The suspect was identified as a resident of Viharagala, Sooriyawewa. He was produced before Hambantota Magistrate Nalaka Sanjeewa Jayasuriya and fined Rs.50,000. Wijayabandara said they also reported to court about the action of the plant’s security officers, who obstructed Wildlife officers from entering the plant.
