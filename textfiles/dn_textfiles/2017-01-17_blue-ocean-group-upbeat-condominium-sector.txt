Blue Ocean Group upbeat on condominium sector

The Blue Ocean Group is upbeat on the country's condominium sector. Blue Ocean Group Chairman S Thumilan said optimism reigns in Sri Lanka with capital flows into the country the economy expected to increase during 2017, giving a major boost to the country’s burgeoning property industry.
Through Budget 2017 the Government has introduced wide-ranging initiatives to support and encourage the construction and infrastructure industry in general and condominium sector of Sri Lanka,Thumilan said. “Budget 2017 presented by the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) has proposed many positive and encouraging changes that would undoubtedly boost the property, construction and infrastructure sectors of the country,” he said.
The Government has re-emphasised the huge potential for the construction industry anticipating it to grow into a fully-fledged Rs. 6,500 billion high-value industry in the next five years.
It is pertinent to note that the burgeoning condominium industry has been identified as a sector with significant potential for foreign investment. We laud Finance Minister’s initiative to further incentivise such investment, remove freehold right restrictions from the ground floor. Hitherto foreign investors could purchase fourth floor and above only sans the 100% transaction levy. Allowing foreigners to purchasing condominiums, up to 40 percent of the cost from a domestic bank is also another positive step. With the servicing of such debt mandated to be done foreign currency will ensure more foreign exchange flowing into the industry. I have always said that the success of the Blue Ocean Group of Companies is in creating organic growth which cascades to effective solutions geared to meet global challenges.
This in turn contributes positively to the global development agenda and to the eco-system that we all contribute to.
When I founded the Blue Ocean Group, I was very keen that the Group would become the differentiator in the landscape we operated in. This is the universal Blue Ocean Strategy that we at the Blue Ocean Group of Companies are following. We are well grounded and founded in realistic and practical data; we pursue differentiation and economies of scale; we create uncontested market spaces, not really wanting to outperform competition but making competition irrelevant by reconstructing boundaries.
We empower our team through tools and frameworks to break away from competition and assess current industry status to maximise opportunity while minimising risk. Our processes and tools are inclusive, comprehensive and easily communicated. And this binds all our stakeholders into a single platform, ultimately creating a win-win formula of value, profit and people.
The Group’s consistent year on year improvement in financial results is an signal of the financial sustainability of our business model. To ensure the sustainability of the social and environmental aspects associated with our business, we continue to embrace best practices for social and environmental management. From a social perspective, our infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and improved the standard of living of our stakeholders. Our work to empower these communities has no doubt in Blue Ocean Group being an exemplary corporate citizen in Sri Lanka. The Blue Ocean Group of Companies has grown into a formidable leader and trendsetter in over six industries including real estate, construction, engineering, trading, education and corporate consultancy. Our dynamism is seen in the global networks and projects we have spawned and the expansion we fuel in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Asia, especially the UAE, UK, USA, Canada and Australia.
As a Group, we are very focused on quality to which there is no compromise. It is this that has been the overarching umbrella to our sustainable success, in each project we embark upon.
