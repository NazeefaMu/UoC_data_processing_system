Navy apprehends eight Indian fishermen, trawler seized

A Fast Attack Craft attached to the Northern Naval Command on routine patrol apprehended eight Indian fishermen and seized a fishing trawler they used for poaching in the Sri Lankan territorial waters north-east of Vettalakerni in the early hours yesterday.
The fishermen were brought to the naval base SLNS Uttara in Kankesanthurai and handed over to the Assistant Fisheries Director of Jaffna, a Navy spokesman said.
The trawler and fishing gear were retained at the SLNS Elara in Karainagar, he said.
