Pooja cancelled over dispute

A tense situation erupted at the Ruhunu Kataragama Maha Devalaya yesterday since the 4.30 am pooja could not be held as scheduled despite the presence of a large number of pilgrims.
The reason was a dispute between the Devalaya Kapu Mahattayas, officiating priests and Basnayake Nilame D P Kumarage who is alleged to have taken away the Devalaya key from them after locking the Devalaya.
Basnayake Nilame D P Kumarage when contacted said that when he went to open the Devalaya in the morning the key was not there. Thereafter, he went with a duplicate key to open the Devalaya and a Priest named Lal abused him and asked what authority he had to open the Devalaya. Thereafter, all other priests arrived and closed the main doors of the Devalaya and he returned to his official residence. But Priest Lal had a different story. He alleged that when he arrived with Priest Somipala T Ratnayake to open the Devalaya for the 4.30am pooja, the Basnayake Nilame accompanied by his son and a group and snatched the key and took it away. This was the first time the 4.30am pooja had to be cancelled and it was a bad omen for the country.
Some of the devotees present were seen kicking their heels venting their anger for the cancellation of the scheduled pooja they were longing to participate. Later the 6.30 pooja was held as scheduled since the Basnayake Nilame had returned the key to the Priests.
