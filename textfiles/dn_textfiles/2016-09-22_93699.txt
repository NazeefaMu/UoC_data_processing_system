Tom Hiddleston, Priyanka Chopra get Flirty at Emmys After-Party

 
It always seems to start with a little dance when it comes to Tom Hiddleston.
When The Night Manager star and Priyanka Chopra presented an award Sunday night at the 2016 Emmys, viewers couldn't help but notice the pair participating in a little twirl as they made their way to the microphone.

Perhaps it was just two Hollywood stars trying to make a cute moment at an A-list gathering. Or maybe you'd like to hear what went down at the Governor's Ball.
Multiple eyewitnesses tell E! News that the pair was “openly flirting with each other” at the Emmys after-party in between snapping selfies and mingling with guests.
“Tom had his arm around her and held her close. Afterwards, Tom and Priyanka talked closely and were holding hands at one point for a few moments,” our insider said. “Priyanka fixed Tom's bow-tie and then the two kissed on both cheeks.” We're told Priyanka gave her phone to Tom who then gave his phone to her. They proceeded to put their phone numbers in each other's phones before embracing in a “long hug” and “several kisses on the cheek.”

“Priyanka and Tom said goodbye and she told him that she will see him later,” our source shared. “They left the event about a minute after each other.”
Both actors were also spotted hanging out together earlier in the weekend while rehearsing for the live award show.
As pop culture fans know, Tom was last linked to Taylor Swift who both turned heads when they had a fun dance off at the 2016 Met Gala. In regards to Priyanka, the Quantico star recently opened up about relationships in an issue of Instyle. “I've never dated,” she shared in the August 2016 issue.

“I've always been in relationships. You like someone, you court each other, you get into a relationship. You're answerable to each other.” So is this just a fun evening out after one of Hollywood's biggest nights or something more?
