Ajith is a cross between James Bond and Rocky

The much anticipated trailer of Ajith’s Vivegam was released on Wednesday night and it promises to be a solid entertainer. Going by the visuals, it looks like a high-budget action fest where Ajith’s character is a cross between Sylvester Stallone in Rocky and a suave international agent, say James Bond. To a large extent, the credit goes to Ajith’s amazing transformation. The actor is looking fitter than ever before and has also sports six-pack abs.
The trailer clearly gives us a glimpse of the film’s theme and it’s to rise against all odds. Ajith is described as the phoenix (bird) that rises out of the ashes. We have already seen how Ajith’s ‘never give up’ has become a youth anthem and found its way even on T-shirts.
We also get a quick glimpse of Ajith’s personal side and there are fleeting shots of Kajal Aggarwal, who plays his wife. This is the first time she has teamed up with Ajith and their pair has already drawn attention thanks to the promos. We are going to see Ajith in very different avatars - as a dutiful agent, as a loving and caring husband and finally as a revenge-seeking man. Vivek Oberoi’s role is going to be one of the highlights and it looks like he turns rogue and will locks horns with Ajith.
