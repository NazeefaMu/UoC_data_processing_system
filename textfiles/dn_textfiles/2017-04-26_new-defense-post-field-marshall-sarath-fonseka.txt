New defense post for Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka

 
Cabinet Co-spokesperson Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said today there was the possibility that Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka would be appointed to a post that would allow him to oversee all of the defense establishments in the country.
While the Cabinet Co-spokesperson declined to offer more details on the powers the post would be vested with, he did say the President has broached the subject with the Regional Development Minister, who had shown his acquiescence.
Dr. Senaratne said the move was with the idea of instilling more discipline in the light of continued protests over varied issues.
If Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka takes up the post he will be charged with overseeing the tri-forces, including anti-riot squads and the Special Task Force.
Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka, who was Army Commander during the final stages of the civil war, was briefly appointed Chief of Defense Staff in aftermath, in 2009.
