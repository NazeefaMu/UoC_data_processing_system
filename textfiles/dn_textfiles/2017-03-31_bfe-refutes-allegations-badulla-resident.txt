BFE refutes allegations by Badulla resident

The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment yesterday refuted allegations made by a resident from Badulla that he visited the Bureau 37 times to complain about difficulties faced by his wife employed in Saudi Arabia and request to get her down, but the Bureau had failed to fulfil his request.
The Bureau in a press release said the person concerned who held a fast opposite the Bureau on March 27 and visited the Bureau only nine times to represent his wife's case and four such visits wee made only to hand over letters.
The Bureau said during investigations into the matter the man's wife had said she had not suffered any assault from her employer in Saudi Arabia who had promised to pay her back wages on her return to Sri Lanka.
The man concerned had stated in his letter dated November 17, 2016 that he did not mind his wife continuing to serve until February 8, 2017, the expiry date of her contract provided she is paid her salary arrears.
The licence of the foreign employment agency had been temporarily suspended on March 24, 2017 for its failure to get the woman back to Sri Lanka on the completion of her contract.
On March 28, the Sri Lanka Embassy in Saudi Arabia had informed that it would take the woman concerned under its charge to be sent back to Sri Lanka.
At a time when the Bureau is working with the Sri Lankan Embassy in Saudi Arabia to bring down the woman expatriate employee to Sri Lanka, her husband had staged a fast opposite the Bureau with the intention of causing embarrassment.
