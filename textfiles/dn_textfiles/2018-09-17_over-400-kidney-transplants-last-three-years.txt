Over 400 kidney transplants in last three years

Over 400 kidney transplant surgeries were carried out under the Good Governance Government, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. He was addressing the gathering after opening the new building complex of the De Zoysa Maternity Hospital in Colombo recently. He said the maternal and infant mortality rate was significantly gone down and the UNICEF admired this situation.
Sri Lanka has a better health service than that of the US. The Wold Bank report says that a poor people-friendly health service is in Sri Lanka.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka achieved all those goals because the primary healthcare system in Sri Lanka has been developed now. All types of body organs are now transplanted. Bone marrow, liver, heart and legs are transplanted now.
Even the WHO praised our health service in this regard, the Minister said.
The Minister said third heart transplantation at the Kandy General Hospital will be carried out by Consultant Dr. Anil Abeywickrama very soon and the first ever heart and liver transplantations took place at the hospital.
