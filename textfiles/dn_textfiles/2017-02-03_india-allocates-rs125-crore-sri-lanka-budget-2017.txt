India allocates Rs.125 Crore to Sri Lanka from Budget 2017

India has allocated Rs 125 Crore as aid to Sri Lanka in its Budget for 2017, Indian Media said.
The Ministry of External Affairs has been allocated Rs 14,798.55 Crore for FY 2017-18 in this year’s Union Budget.
This is an overall increase of just Rs 135 Crore compared to last year. Seychelles had been allocated Rs 300 Crore in the present Budget, while Mauritius has been allotted Rs 400 Crore. No grants have been announced for both these island nations in the last Budget.
The same could be said of Nepal, another buffer state between China (technically, the region of Tibet) and India. The MEA has allocated Rs 375 Crore to Kathmandu, an increase of 25 percent from the previous Budget, while Myanmar had been allocated 43 percent less funds this year.
