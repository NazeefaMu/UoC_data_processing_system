Madonna is Billboard’s 2016 Woman of the Year

Madonna has been named Billboard's 2016 Woman of the Year.
The Material Girl singer will be the guest of honour at the 11th annual Billboard Women In Music event in New York City in December (16).
“Madonna is one of a minuscule number of super-artists whose influence and career transcend music,” Janice Min, president and chief creative officer of The Hollywood Reporter -Billboard Media Group, says. “With her creative vision, relentless innovation, and dedication to philanthropic causes, she is an inspiration to hundreds of millions of people around the world, all while shattering every career record out there.
“She is an important feminist on top of that, a one-of-a-kind artist who's used her influence to change the conversation around women, sexuality and equal rights.”
Past recipients of the award include Taylor Swift, Pink, Katy Perry, and Beyonce. The award tops a big year for Madonna - she was named the highest grossing solo touring artist in Billboard Boxscore history with $1.31 billion in total concert grosses. She also wrapped her Rebel Heart Tour in March (16), which earned $170 million (GBP139.4 million). Music-News
