WARM HOMES IN COLD CLIMATE

Today ArchWorld takes you out of the tropics and into a colder climate. Arch World talks to Archt. Priyan Hettipathirana on how architecture is practised in those distant lands so different from Sri Lanka. Hettipathirana who lived in London for a year with his family has a unique perspective on how architecture is practised there.
“Architecture there was approached differently as the buildings are built, responding to a completely different environment. The Architecture in these regions responded to a cooler and temperate local environment. European countries are falling in the temperate and cool climate regions in the world. These countries are seasonal and they experience spring, summer, autumn and winter. The temperature in these countries can be low from 15 to 20 degrees and the humidity levels are also very low. The temperature can get even very much lower than this in winter. Due to the low humidity and temperature the need for cross ventilation does not arise because the cold wind can be very uncomfortable and can even be dreadful. The Europeans experience less sun during the year. They depend more on heat and for this European Architecture will admit the heat of the Sun into their houses through large windows as this will also bring natural light,” said Hettipathirana.
Earth’s temperature
Sustainable Architecture is a widely spoken topic today as a result of global warming. So it is important to understand the connection between Sustainable architecture and Global warming.
“In the last 100 years the Earth’s temperature has increased by 1 degree Celsius and the sea level has increased by 130 mm. In the next 100 years the prediction for the increase in temperature rise is 2 to 5 degrees Celsius and the increase in the sea level is 130 to 750 mm.

Global warming is a result of Greenhouse gases like CO2 emitted to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels to generate energy. The Construction industry contributes to more 50% of the CO2 emissions. Therefore, buildings have to be designed by architects, to reduce its energy usage to help sustain the environment.
Sustainable architecture in the cool and moderate climates has contributed towards becoming low energy buildings. This is by way of reducing the need to heat buildings by directing the heat of the sun into the building through larger windows which faces the sun directly. The temperature can be increased to a more comfortable level by natural means and not using electricity. This is known as passive heating. The architectural details in temperate climates are focused on insulating the buildings to heat up inside the space. For this double glazing is mostly used. The architecture also features glass skylights that will bring natural light and heat to the interior,” explained Hettipathirana
Well-heated spaces
People living in the temperate regions adapt their behavior to cope up with the cold temperature by living inside well heated spaces. “People in these regions like to stay close to windows facing the sun or warm objects that radiate heat which is quite opposite to the tropical hot humid countries where the inhabitant stay away from the sun or heated objects. Architecture using larger areas of glass has been used in many timeless creations in the cooler temperate regions. The modern contemporary architecture has many examples like the Gherkin building and the London City hall, great court at the city hall and the pyramid at Louvre museum to name a few main architectural attractions. These building are glass building that can trap the heat during winter by way of highly insulated window and wall joints. Many European countries have a very rich architectural history and still preserved to a very greater extent,” pointed out Hettipathirana
In tropical warm humid climates the verandahs are used to create our door shaded spaces.

“These spaces are comfortable to stay as they encourage cross ventilation. Architecturally verandahs act as an extension to the house. In a colder temperate climate the conservatory will resemble the verandah. The Conservatory has glass on all sides including the roof in most cases. It is kept closed and well insulated during colder winter seasons to gain and store the radiant solar heat,” stated Hettipathirana Further the spaces in tropical countries are more effective if there is cross ventilation through it.
“This can be done by having physical openings between spaces. This is quite the opposite in the colder temperate regions which have spaces more or less separated to encourage each compartment sealed to conserve the heat generated internally,” said Hettipathirana.
Predominantly colder countries use less shading devices in its architecture.
“Shading devices are mainly used in the tropical countries to block solar heat, this works totally in the opposite way in colder regions. Similarly walls in a building are less in the direction of the sun to allow more solar heat to in to the room. In colder countries glass is used in this direction,” informed Hettipathirana.
Interior spaces
Colder temperate climates have lower levels of humidity as well. This does not encourage rapid fungal growth and increased levels of dust mites inside enclosed spaces.
“The interior spaces of the houses use material like carpets and timber planks to reduce the cooler temperature. Fabrics and carpets can collect dust which can create stuffiness inside the space. As there is less sun light and fresh air in colder seasons the inhabitants have to regularly maintain and clean the spaces to avoid negative effects of dust and pollen,” clarified Hettipathirana.
Architecture in cooler climates use glass for the exterior building.

“This is to permit solar heat in to the buildings during day time. In addition to glass material, wooden panels, bricks, concrete and steel are also used in buildings. Most of the traditional houses use timber for the structure for the floor and stair cases when building multiple floors.
In temperate climates there is no need to use trees for shading against the heat of the sun right through the year. But in tropical countries a tree is so precious, as it gives shade right throughout the year. Trees also help to cut the glare and it enhances the natural beauty. Most importantly trees are preserved as it helps to maintain the natural CO2 cycle,” explained Hettipathirana.
Inhabitants generally feel much happier and healthier when they can take control of their own comfort issues.
“It is essential that the inhabitants feel comfortable in their working environments. Uncomfortable living environments can have an impact on performance like a feeling of annoyance. The architecture can solve these issues by the design strategies adopted,” said Hettipathirana.
Energy is used for comfort in the buildings. Out of the 50% of CO2 emissions, 40% is used for operational energy. This is mainly for fossil powered space heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation. Occupied buildings also count for use of appliances. The balance 10% emission comes during the construction in manufacturing and transporting material.
“The important question is what can architecture do in the building industry to lower the rate of CO2 emission? When talking about the cooler temperate climates, measures such as controlled human intervention, higher insulation and air tightness, use of passive heating methods will help in this.
In the tropical countries this could be addressed by passive cooling and natural ventilation. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind and waste energy too can help reduce dependence on fossil fuel.
Passive w energy
Renewable energy too can assist in reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. In 2014 more than half a million people around the world in more than 160 countries marched against climate change. Architecture can help in a large way to reduce the carbon foot print by way of passive heating and cooling - Natural means of ventilating buildings and proper detailing to insulate controlled environments. Passive solar energy can be used for direct space heating and cooling. Passive solar energy is received free. Solar power is clean and silent,” elucidated Hettipathirana.
Green Architecture is based on the guidelines laid for reducing the carbon foot print in a building.
“These guidelines are promoted so the design strategies adopted in the architecture would comply to the minimum standards of CO2 emissions of a building - per meter of floor area per year. This calculation is based on sealing and insulation properties of a building, the type and fuel of a heating system. Further targets are set to make sure that all new houses comply to achieve zero carbon emission focusing on saving fuel and energy,” summed up Hettipathirana.
