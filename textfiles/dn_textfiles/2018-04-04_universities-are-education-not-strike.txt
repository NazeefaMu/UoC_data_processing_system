Universities are for education, not for strike!

Universities are the highest educational institutions in any country. They take the leading role in imparting knowledge to students. There are 15 National Universities in Sri Lanka. Universities have not been functioning for more than one month due to the strike of non-academic staff. It is a well-known custom in the Sri Lankan university culture that the university staff or students will close the universities for months and months without thinking about the adverse consequences of the strike.
Once the universities are closed nearly 200,000 are affected. The government also pays off millions of rupees as salaries for the university academic and non-academic staff for the sole purpose of educating the students in the universities. On contrary, these universities are frequently closed down by university staff, non-academic staff and students at different intervals. Who will bear the loss by closing all these universities?
University education
In fact the remunerations of university staff and non-academic staff are paid during the strike or after the strike with arrears likewise, the Mahapola and Bursaries are paid for students monthly during the strike. The academic activities of the universities are withheld. This is very unfair for Sri Lanka. Having spent millions of rupees on higher education, neither the country nor people are benefited from the huge expenditures which the government every year allocates from the public fund. There should be an end to these endless strikes. Last year, the university activities were handicapped due to the SAITM issue. After the issue, all the universities were open along with the intake carried out. No sooner the university intake over once again the non-academic staff declared an untimely strike.
Who is responsible for this strike: government or strikers? Whoever responsible for the on-going strike should immediately settle. Indeed both parties have wasted the valuable time and money. More importantly, this concerns the precious future of the students. When we compare our university model with overseas universities, the former is entirely different.
No university is closed in the world like our local universities. Students in other foreign countries comparatively earn their first degree much earlier than our universities. Indeed a student completes his first degree at the age of nineteen or twenty whereas in our country at this age they are seeking admissions to universities. In that case, we are late in completing the first degree and these monstrous strikes are making further delay in earning or obtaining the first degree.
The delay in obtaining first degree creates various problems in the life of students and parents. On one hand, the students have to spend a number of years on university education and once he completes his degree it is too late for him to find employment. On the other hand, the parents spend a lot of money on their children’s education. They expect the children to fulfil some commitments in the family. But the children are not in a position to fulfil their commitments because by the time they pass out from the university they themselves are at the marriageable age that will bring an extra burden for the parents. This is a serious problem in the society.
Serial of strikes
We have just taken it for granted that these strikes – a serial of strikes – create serious problems in the practical life of many parents. Another serious issue connected with these strikes is the girls who study at the universities. They have to put off their marriage date until they complete their degrees. Hence these university strikes make various practical problems in the socio-economic and cultural context of the common people. We are obliged to focus on the fact that these students have been selected to universities through a fierce competition of their Advanced Level examinations.
That means only a thin percentage of students get selected to universities from a large number of students who sat for the Advanced Level examination every year. Thus these students are the best of the best thousands of students whose knowledge and skills should be utilized for the betterment of the people rather than of the country at large. So the expectations of parents, government and students are just a dream because of the incessant university strikes. The Sri Lankans have travelled a quite a long way in the journey of university education since its first inception in 1942.
We are still unable to prepare a solid framework for university education.
Is it the fault of the university or government? Still, they are unable to fix and permanent terms and conditions with regard to the remunerations of academic and non-academic staff and ethical and moral framework for university students who should follow these moral virtues during their stay in universities. These strikes, on the other hand, will affect the academic activities of overseas students who are to complete their undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral studies in Sri Lankan universities.
All in all, the activities of 15 universities have come to a standstill due to this on-going strike. Therefore, this is the responsibilities of the university lecturers and staff to give due pressure to the responsible authority to reopen all the universities and resume all academic activities immediately. University students should also behave responsibly.
When they demand something they very often tend to strike untimely and close all universities.
When the universities remain closed, they should raise their voice to reopen the universities if they are really interested in their studies.
Thus we earnestly request the government to solve the crisis of the non-academic staff of universities, on the other hand, the non-academic staff should also give more on the education and future of students who are in a stranded position between the government and the university.
