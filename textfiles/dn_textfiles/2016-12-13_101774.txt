Sri Lankan Airlines resumes flights to Chennai

 
National carrier Sri Lankan Airlines, which temporarily halted all flights to Chennai yesterday on account of cyclone ‘Vardha’ in the Bay of Bengal, has resumed service.
SriLankan spokesperson Deepal Perera said: "Chennai Airport authorities informed us this morning they were ready to reopen the airport. Therefore, Sri Lankan Airlines has now deployed five aircrafts to and from from Katunayake-Chennai, to meet the demand of previously scheduled and delayed passengers."
