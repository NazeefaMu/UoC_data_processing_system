SC orders Ports Authority to file objections on or before January 27

The Supreme Court yesterday ordered the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and other stakeholders to file objections on or before January 27 with regard to the Fundamental Rights application filed by UPFA parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara against the leasing of the Hambantota port and a land area in extent of 15,000 acres adjacent to the port, to two Chinese companies.
The Court after considering the submissions by the petitioner and the respondent parties, granted time to file objections.
The petition was taken before a Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sri Pavan and Justice Anil Gooneratne yesterday.
Sixty eight persons including Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Chinese Merchant Port Holdings Company, China Communications and Construction Company, Constitutional Council, the Attorney General and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority were cited as respondents in the case.
When the case was taken before the Supreme Court, Sanjeewa Jayawardena PC appearing for the Sri Lanka Ports Authority told court that the authority enjoys the ownership and the management of lands adjacent to the port under 88 clause of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act.
The counsel informed court that the land area in extent of 15,000 acres is owned by the Authority. He sought time to file objections against the petition. Manohara de Silva, PC who appeared for petitioner Vasudeva Nanayakkara apprised court that the Cabinet of Ministers decided to lease the Hambantota harbour and 15,000 acres of lands adjacent to the port.
The counsel pointed out that leasing the port and 15,000 acres to two Chinese companies without following a proper tender procedure is a violation of the fundamental rights of the people.
Sanjay Rajaratnam PC who appeared for the Attorney General sought time to obtain instructions from the respondents as he has not received such instructions from the respondents.
The case was fixed for February 3.
