Sketch of the greats

Sweet, slight and sincere maybe three words which pop into your mind when you have finished watching Richard Tanne’s ‘Southside With You’. The gentle, rose-tinted movie comes at a time then its protagonist Barack Obama is getting set to step down from his seat after serving his country for a long span.
Centered on the divisions in American society, ‘Southside With You’ casts an optimistic view towards what might be in store. A fictional re-creation of Barack and Michelle Obama’s first date, the movie is a venture down memory lane for the couple who have created history.
He is from Hawaii and Indonesia. She is from Chicago, the South Side. He is going to Harvard Law. She has been there, done that, and is now practicing law. With all this taking place in the background, you can see where the story is heading.
Happy ending
Most of the details of the Obamas’ early life has become well known news. In fact Barack’s side of the first date is more widely known, since he recounted it in his memoir ‘The Audacity of Hope’. However through ‘Southside With You’ Michelle’s experiences and reactions to the event are now in the spotlight. Though a happy ending is evident, Tanne’s script invests itself more in Michelle’s psychology - including her tightly wound sense of propriety, rooted in her efforts to fit in at institutions where she’s one of few black women in attendance. Worried about how their relationship might look to others, Tika Sumpter plays Michelle with her guard up, often deflecting Barack’s attempts to flirt with terse dialogue.
One of the drawback of the movie is that Tanne seem to think that the Obamas are invincible. In his eyes they can do no wrong and has only admiration for them.
Viewers get the sense of the couple as two intelligent, idealistic people simply getting to know each other. Comments like Michelle’s “You definitely have a knack for making speeches,” naturally sets the course for the White House. It is too obvious!
Gentle confidence
Another set back is that at times the movie tends to be ‘too cute’. However as soon as you get this feeling, the director draws back and adds some depth into the tale to cut off this feeling. One such example lies in the moment when Michelle asks Barack if he’s thought about a career in politics, he replies “maybe,” with a shrug, taking another drag on his cigarette.
The story opens with Michelle talking about Barack to her parents, while he tells his grandmother about Michelle. She’s his adviser at the firm where he’s a summer associate. Barack soon expresses his romantic feelings towards Michelle. She thinks their dating would be inappropriate. Still, he perseveres with gentle confidence, chipping away at her defenses with searching disquisitions. A park-bench lunch and a visit to an art show follow.
President Obama’s fans will find something to enjoy in this slightly stilted yet oddly fascinating account of the Harvard law student’s first date with the woman who would eventually become his wife. Though it is just a few minutes long, the movie manages to capture the moods and essence of the two figures during the crucial stages of their lives which shaped them to make history together.
The background visuals are stunning. The city in all its splendour is captured artfully by the team.
Parker Sawyers and Tika Sumpter make a matching couple. They dish out a decent performance as Barack and Michelle Obama.
‘Southside With You’ maybe a small scale romance but it has a big heart. This is a perfect choice for a first date.
