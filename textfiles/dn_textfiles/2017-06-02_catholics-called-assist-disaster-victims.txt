Catholics called to assist disaster victims

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference in Sri Lanka yesterday appealed the Catholic community to extend their fullest cooperation to provide humanitarian assistance to the people affected by the disaster.
The Catholic Bishops’ Conference issuing a release adds: “We appeal to the Catholic community in Sri Lanka who have shown solidarity with the affected to continue to extend their fullest cooperation to provide humanitarian help through the respective Diocesan Caritas and government agencies and civil society organizations.”
“We offer our condolences to the bereaved members of the families who lost their dear ones and pray for the repose of the souls of their dearly departed,” the release said.
“Any financial, material and human support will be of help to the affected who have lost their personal belongings and properties and to bear up the sufferings and regain their confidence to return to normal life.
They need to know and feel that they are not alone nor left to themselves to tide over the difficulties in this situation,” the release added.
