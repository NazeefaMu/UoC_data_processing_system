Hasan Ali yesterday reiterated that he did not make any statement calling for the ouster of SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem from the party "What I stressed was to have amendments to the present constitution which would prevent the party from becoming a dictatorship,"he said.
He said that he did not hatch any conspiracy to oust the party leadership. "I obtained signatures from senior party leaders seeking amendments to the Party's Constitution.
Hassan Ali added that no one has the right to ask as to why he did not participate at the SLMC's 19th Convention . "Participation at the convention has not been made compulsory," he said.
He said that he was committed for the party's victory at the last parliamentary election, but, was not granted a National List slot as promised by party leader Rauff Hakeem.
Meanwhile, SLMC leader and Minister Rauff Hakeem yesterday said that internal issues of the party can always be solved through discussions.
He said that it is not proper to challenge the party leadership when there are avenues to solve internal problems through discussions.
He said that Ali should meet him and discuss the issues without making statements to the media.
