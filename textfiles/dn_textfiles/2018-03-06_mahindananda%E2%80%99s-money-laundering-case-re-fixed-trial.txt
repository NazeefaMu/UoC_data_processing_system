Mahindananda’s money laundering case re-fixed for trial

A case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money was yesterday re-fixed for trial by Colombo High Court.
Accordingly, the case was re-fixed for trial on March 7 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga. Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of Aluthgamage sought a further trial date on personal ground.
The Court was informed that Aluthgamage has filed a transfer case in the Court of Appeal seeking an order transferring this case to any other court other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Mahindananda Aluthgamage alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs.27 million. The Attorney General alleged that the accused has failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under section 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former Minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Hafeel Farisz appeared for the accused.
