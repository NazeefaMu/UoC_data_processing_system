All Southern households provided with electricity

The Southern Regional Office of the Ceylon Electricity Board has been able to provide electricity to almost every household in the region.
Only the houses which are still under construction are left to be supplied with electricity.
Power supply projects were successfully implemented in the region by the CEB, Southern Regional Office Deputy General Manager S. S. Kahanda said.
According to a survey conducted by the CEB Southern Provincial Office, the number of families in the Southern region who had been without these facilities was nearly 8,000. At present, they have been provided with electricity.
The cost of wiring and all other service charges in this regard are borne by the CEB. An amount of about Rs. 40,000 was given to each of these households in this regard.
On the instructions of the Power and Energy Ministry, the projects were initiated in the Southern province, Deputy General Manager attached to the CEB Southern Regional Office S. S. Kahanda added.
