Nepal is one of the most beautiful countries of the world. Many people visit Nepal because of the natural beauty of this country. Nepal is full of mountains and hills.
We find various natural beauties such as lakes, rivers, caves, Mount Everest, etc.
It is a landlocked country situated between India and China. The highest mountain of the world, Mount Everest, with a height of 8848 metres is situated in Nepal. Many people come to Nepal to climb this mountain. The renowned place of Nepal, Lumbini is the birth place of the Buddha who was born in Lumbini in 563 BC. This place has a number of stupas, temples including Mayadevi Temple which is one of the biggest temples of Nepal named after mother of Prince Gautama.
There is a big stone pillar in the Lumbini Garden made the Indian Emperor Ashoka, which is named after him as Ashok Pillar.
