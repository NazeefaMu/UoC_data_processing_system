CILT hails Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake as new SLPA Chairman

The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport (CILT) Sri Lanka welcomes the appointment of one of its illustrious Fellows as the new Chairman of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake has been associated with CILT for over three decades and was the Chairman of the Sri Lankan branch from 1998 to 2000, one of his many accolades in the Shipping and Logistics sector.
The Institute is heavily encouraged by Dr. Dissanayake’s sentiments that the Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe has “a tremendous vision for the maritime sector of Sri Lanka; to bring back the old glory to the port sector”. The country will undoubtedly require well trained and qualified professionals to achieve this vision and CILT has been in the forefront of delivering this. CILT Sri Lanka extends its heartiest congratulations to Dr. Dissanayake and is confident that he will provide the required leadership to make Sri Lanka the Logistic hub of the region.
CILT will continue to work closely with SLPA with the full support and backing of a membership of professionals in supply chain, logistics and transport from over 33 countries covering shipping, aviation, road and rail transport, and logistics.
