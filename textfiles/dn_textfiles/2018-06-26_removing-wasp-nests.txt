Removing wasp nests

Members of the Bee Resources Protection Organisation removing wasp nests from the Akbar bridge in Peradeniya for relocation in preparation for the forthcoming Peradeniya University convocation ceremony due to be held on July 5. The exercise done without causing any harm to the insects took about six hours to complete. This is an annual exercise before the Convocation because wasps regroup to build their nests under the 75-year-old bridge again after sometime.
