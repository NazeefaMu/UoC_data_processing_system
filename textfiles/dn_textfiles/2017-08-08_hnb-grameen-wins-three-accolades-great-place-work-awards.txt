HNB Grameen wins three accolades at Great Place to Work Awards

HNB Grameen Finance Limited has been recognised as one of Sri Lanka’s best work places by Great Place to Work Institute Sri Lanka. The company managed to bag three accolades at this year’s awards ceremony held at Cinnamon Grand Colombo recently.
Being adjudged for the first time since its inception, HNB Grameen was awarded ‘A Great Place to Work’, one of only 25 companies in Sri Lanka to be recognized as such this year, as well as the Bronze Medal in its respective category. HNB Grameen also received the coveted Special Award for Pride and Advocacy among its workforce.
Commenting on the achievement, B.M.D.C. Prabhath, Managing Director and CEO of HNB Grameen noted, “The value of this award to us, as a debutante to this accolade, is that we as an organization have not only achieved in terms of recognition among our customers but also our own people. It’s indeed a testament to the heart and soul that our staff, the lifeblood of HNB Grameen, has put in over the past 17 years.”
The unique value of the Great Place to Work Certification is its unwavering ability to establish the true sentiment of an organization’s workforce. Conducted over a process involving a sampling of individuals, done independently by the team at Great Place to Work, including a Trust Index Employee Survey and Culture Audit®, among others, the awards are meted out based solely on the unabated employee feedback.
With over 350,000 customers being serviced through 48 branches by a strong contingent of 1665 employees, HNB Grameen is an internationally acclaimed brand for its contribution to the micro financing sector of Sri Lanka.
The unified focus and vision of HNB Grameen, throughout this journey of 17 years in the industry, has been to lead the nation as a stable and leading finance company pioneered in Microfinance, with a key focus towards a committed human touch; uplifting the populous and develop the economy of Sri Lanka.
