Minister vows to clean up SriLankan Airlines

Sri Lanka’s State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim vowed to “clean up the mafia” at SriLankan Airlines and accused its Chairman Ajith Dias of sweeping corruption of the previous regime under the carpet.
The minister said he disagreed with Dias who had dismissed findings of a far reaching anti-corruption report that highlighted corruption and irregularities under the former regime of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He said the SriLankan board had been appointed soon after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took office and he (the minister) had no direct control, but was clearly unhappy with the loss-making carrier’s management.
He said a “mafia of the former regime” was still operating at SriLankan and was being shielded by the management.
“I regret that I have not been able to make any changes, but I am determined to clean up the place,” Minister Hashim said.
“I will not give up. I will fight to get rid of them.”
“I am clearly unhappy with the loss-making carrier’s management.”
