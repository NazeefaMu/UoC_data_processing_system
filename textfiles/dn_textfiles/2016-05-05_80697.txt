PARLIAMENT

 
Fonseka questions MR’s morality
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who drastically downsised the security detail of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga when he was in power, has no moral right to comment about his security, Field Marshal and Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka said in Parliament on Tuesday.
He was speaking on the invitation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over a point of order raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena on the security given to former President Rajapaksa.
“Why cannot former President Rajapaksa come to Parliament and talk about his security concerns without asking his acolytes to speak When former President Chandrika Kumaratunga was given a security contingent of 60, this was reduced to 30 by former President Rajapaksa by giving a call to the Chief Justice. Former President Rajapaksa, who behaved in such an immoral way, has no right to comment about his security,” Fonseka said.
He said both Army and Police security was provided for him when there was terrorism in the country, adding that there is no such a necessity today.
“The government has the decision making power in this regard. In Police, there are specially trained officers for VIP security. Some Army personnel former President Rajapaksa had kept for his security had had no such a training. They were only acolytes of Rajapaksa. If Police are capable of providing adequate security to the First Citizen and the Second Citizen of the country, Rajapaksa has no reason to say Police security is insufficient for him,” he said.
At this point, the Speaker asked the minister to wind up his speech, but Fonseka continued. However, Fonseka’s mike was switched off.
“I gave you the opportunity as your name was mentioned. Now finish it please” Speaker Jayasuriya said. Later, the Speaker switched on the mike.
Fonseka said even though the Elections Commissioner ordered to give security to him at the 2010 Presidential Election, former President Rajapaksa as the then Commander of the Security forces declined it.
“My security was withdrawn five minutes after the results of the Presidential Election.
“I was placed with other hard core terrorists when I was jailed. Orders had been given to shoot me if I attempted to escape Police custody,” he said.
Fonseka said if he could manage his security with 15 Police officers, there was no reason to think that the former President could not manage his security with 200 Police personnel. He said former President Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa should take the responsibility of killing retired Major General Janaka Perera.
“When Janaka Perera asked for security, it was Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who ordered Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva on the number of security detail of Janaka Perera,” he said.
Fonseka said former Defence Secretary needs not be given Army security, adding that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s security should also be replaced with Police officers. He raised doubts about the bomb attack targeting former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa.
“Terrorists never explode bombs keeping a distance of 25 metres. Nor they target bullet-proof cars. We have doubts whether it is a preplanned one,” he said.
Minister Fonseka said the only threat for the life of former President Rajapaksa was the attempt by former Minister Johnston Fernando to kill him using a terrorist. He said former President Rajapaksa had no other life threat even when the war was ravaging.
He said Captain Neville, who was kept by former President Rajapaksa for his security, has human rights allegations before Geneva.
“While keeping him for his security, he was used to commit murders,” he said.
 
Provincial Councils seek to bar entry of Indian fishermen to SL waters
A Private Member’s Bill moved by TNA Parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran to prevent the entry of Indian fishermen to Sri Lankan territorial waters illegally has been approved by all Provincial Councils, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said on Tuesday.
He said the Northern and the North-western Provincial Councils have agreed with amendments while the others agreed to the same.
The motion was moved in Parliament on February 10. The Speaker ordered that this should be informed to the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry.
 
Report on MPs misbehaviour to Speaker
Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said the report called by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya over the incident in Parliament on Tuesday was to be handed over to the Speaker at 12 noon today.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex on Tuesday following the adjournment of the House.
He said a special Party Leaders’ Meeting is scheduled today to decide on the action to be taken against those misbehaved in the House based on the report. He said the two member committee appointed to look into the incident, comprising Deputy Chairman of Committees S Adeikkalanathan and himself, would commence investigations. He said the video and audio tapes would be obtained from Parliament and studied for the purpose.
He said the report would be presented with evidence, adding that the relevant part of the video footage would be attached to it. Responding to a question by a journalist, he said the MPs would not be summoned before the committee for questioning.
Observing that the Speaker would take appropriate decisions with regard to the MPs who misbehaved in the chamber, he said the MPs had committed wrong doings during this incident.
“We regret and vehemently condemn the incident. This incident belittles the dignity, prestige and confidence on the legislature. We will look into the reasons that led to the chaos. The MPs those who came to the aisle of chamber had contravened the Standing Orders, they had disobeyed the orders of the Speaker and exchanged blows,” he said.
He said the Party Leaders should take firm action against the MPs who misbehaved to prevent recurrence of similar incidents in the future. He said the Party Leaders could think of suspending Parliamentary time allocated to the speeches of such MPs and restricting their Parliamentary privileges.
Deputy Chairman of Committees S. Adeikkalanathan also participated.
 
 
Dinesh asks if govt backs down on MR’s security issue
Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena on Tuesday demanded Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament to state if the government would reverse the decision to remove the Army security of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
MP Gunawardena, at the commencement of sittings soon after Speaker’s announcements and presentation of Public Petitions, got up and said that Army Commandos who had specialised in VIP security detailed for the security contingent of former President Rajapaksa had been taken away.
He is the former President fought against the most ruthless terrorist organisation in the world. Threat against his life still remains as remaining LTTE cadres are seeking opportunity to take revenge for their loss,” Gunawardena said.
“When we raised this matter in this House sometime back after we received information of the government’s readiness to prune down the security provided to former President, the Leader of the House pledged that the government would not do so,” he said.
“What we feared then has happened. We need to know from the Prime Minister whether the government would reverse its decision and replenish the security reduced from the former President,” Gunawardena said.
