Literary glitz

In commemoration of September, the Provincial Secretariat of Kesbewa staged a felicitation ceremony at the Auditorium of the Kesbewa Urban Council in collaboration with the Department of Cultural Affairs and Kesbewa Cultural Board.
A Pageant of Kandyan Dancers honoured the distinguished guests who graced the function. With the invoking of blessings by Venerable Kolamuni Sumanawansa Thera, Venerable Wellempitiya Sumana Dhamma Thera, Venerable Embilipitiya Ratnajothi Thera and a few other Theras, the Literary Festival commenced.
Studying literature enables one to better understand social situations, history, one’s own emotions, and various cultural practices. It also makes one more empathetic.
Literature should be studied for a richer life. Without it, we miss out on so much. Think of all the places we get to go, people we get to meet, situations we get to experience without ever leaving our living rooms! Without reading about these people, places, events, we quite possibly would never experience similar situations. By reading about them, discussing them with others, thinking about how we would react in similar situations, we are learning. We are gathering information and tools for our life toolbox. Every book you read changes you...even if only slightly. You are a different person on the other side of it whether you recognize it or not. You are learning, collecting material, developing a personality, discovering likes and dislikes about yourself. You are studying the human condition, and this is important because you are part of the world itself.
