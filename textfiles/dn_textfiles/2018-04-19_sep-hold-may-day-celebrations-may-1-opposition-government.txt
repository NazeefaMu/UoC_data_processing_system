SEP to hold May Day celebrations on May 1, in opposition to government

 
The Socialist Equality Party (SEP)  is determined to hold the international working class solidarity on May 1, in opposition to government’s decision to postpone May Day celebrations to May 7, the International Committee of the Fourth International reported.
Accordingly, The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) will hold their celebrations in Town Hall, Colombo, at 3 p.m. on May 1.
President Maithripala Sirisena’s proposal to move May 1 celebrations to May 7 was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on March 28.
The President made this proposal in order to avoid the celebration coinciding with the Vesak full moon Poya day which falls on April 29, on request of the Mahanayake Theros.
