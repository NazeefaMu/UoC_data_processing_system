Priyanka Chopra’s dilemma about her 2 Bollywood productions

 
Priyanka Chopra has already produced two regional films, but is yet to venture into the Bollywood space. However, a source close to the heroine reveals, “Priyanka has already read two Hindi scripts, which she has loved. She wants to produce them, and is currently finalising things.”
The source also adds, “One of them is a two-hero film. That’s more of a love triangle with just one actress being paired with two actors. Another one is a strong woman-centric film, where the protagonist will play a single mother.”
Casting trouble
While PC has loved the two ideas and is ready to produce Hindi films now, she isn’t finding the right cast. The khabri tells us, “Priyanka wants to cast leading young, A-listers for the two-hero film, but no one is agreeing to play the second lead. Everyone wants to be the guy, who ends up with the girl. Priyanka, who has been part of several two-heroine films in the beginning of her career, is finding this reason hard to fathom.”
As for the heroine-centric film, “None of the actresses are game to playing a single mother. PC is looking at a certain age bracket and everyone feels this would stereotype them. In fact, since PC is not finding the right person for the project, she is contemplating doing it herself,” reveals the insider.
