The darkest way to start your morning

Black coffee is a warm beverage as old as time, but black lattes? Now that’s a soul-quenching trend that’s making our unicorn-exhausted souls do a double take.
It’s not like we haven’t seen creative twists on the coffee drink before - unicorn and matcha lattes are just two of-the-moment varieties that come to mind. But while unicorn lattes are whimsical and covered in rainbows and mythical dust, and matcha offers an antioxidant-packed punch paired with supercool designs in the foam, the new obsession, goth lattes, are black as night - but just as Instagrammable.
Although goth lattes have been popping up on social media feeds primarily in the U.K. and Australia - such as Luxe Yoga - it’s only a matter of time before the unicorn-food trend will make a hard right in the U.S. and everything will get a bit, um, darker - literally and otherwise. As reported by BuzzFeed, the reason for the drinks’ black hue is activated charcoal, a superbuzzy ingredient in the beauty and wellness worlds at the moment, which reportedly has both detoxifying and purifying properties.
But while you’re eagerly waiting to find the first shop nearby to Instagram taste-test the trendy new drink, you can try activated charcoal in a prepackaged sip, including the (also Insta-friendly) Dirty Lemon drinks.
