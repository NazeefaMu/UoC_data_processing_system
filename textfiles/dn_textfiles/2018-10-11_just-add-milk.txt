Just add milk!

Seems that some of you are wondering exactly how much protein you are getting in a glass of milk. The short answer is eight grams. The longer answer needs to address why this is important. Protein is an essential nutrient for health, it helps to create a feeling of fullness and satisfaction after a meal or snack thus helping with weight maintenance. And an easy way to boost protein at any meal or snack is simply to add a glass of milk, because in each glass of milk, you are getting those eight grams of protein.
Protein is used by our bodies for everything – building muscle, renewing skin and hair, synthesizing enzymes and immune elements, even building DNA. In foods, protein can slow digestion, making us feel full and satisfied for longer, and helping with weight maintenance. But our bodies can only use so much protein at one time.
Some of us tend to eat very little protein at breakfast and lunch, and eat a large amount at dinner. Shifting some of that evening protein to earlier in the day can maximize our bodies’ ability to use protein.
The easiest way to accomplish this, without upending your whole eating pattern, is to add a glass of milk to breakfast and lunch and eat smaller portions of your protein-rich entree at dinner.
If you tend to graze all day rather than eat meals, include milk (cheese or yogurt) in your mini-meals and snacks.
An added benefit, you will likely close the gap on other key nutrients, such as calcium, vitamin D and potassium, nutrients that are often under-consumed.
With these simple changes, you may notice you feel more satisfied after meals and snacks, and your body will definitely be able to use the protein you've eaten more efficiently.
 
*Replace water with milk in soups for a creamier and more nutritious meal.
*Cook your morning oatmeal in milk instead of water for more protein, calcium + vitamin D.
*Make a milky treat like rice pudding. Simply bring 3/4 cup long-grain rice to a boil, drain, add 5 to 6 cups of milk, 1 cup of sugar, 1 split vanilla bean and a large pinch of salt and simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally. After an hour, add a cup more milk, allow it to absorb, and serve. Instant pudding from a box mix is even quicker and uses 2-4 cups of milk.
