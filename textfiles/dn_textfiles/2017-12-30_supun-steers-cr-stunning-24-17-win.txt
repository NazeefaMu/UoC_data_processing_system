Supun steers CR to stunning 24-17 win

A young CR & FC rugby team led by their inspirational hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya who was down with high fever on the morning of the match but decided to play dished out a superb brand of open rugby together with the entire team to come from behind and stun Army SC by 24 points (3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 17 (2 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Dialog ‘A’ division inter-club league rugby match second round played at Havelock Park yesterday.
The scores were deadlocked 10-all at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy. CR & FC drew first blood when their reliable fly half cum vice-captain Tharinda Ratwatte slotted in a 35 meter penalty to go into a 3-nil lead. Army scored through flanker Pushpakumara who crashed through for a try and Salinda made the conversion for Army to lead 7-3.
Army SC scored again through the boot of Salinda when he slotted in a penalty to increase the scoreline to 10-3. CR and FC equalled the score when their granite number eight Omalka Gunaratne crashed through for a superb try. Tharinda made the conversion and the score read 10-all at half time.
Soon after the break hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya went over the line for a spectacular try after collecting the ball off a maul. Tharinda put over the conversion and CR & FC went into a 17-10 lead.
The red shirts scored again to increase their lead when off a fine three quarter move the ball changed several hands and to their speedy winger and captain Kavindu Perera who burst through and dived over under the post for a superb try. Tharinda made an easy conversion for the score to read 24-10 in favour of CR.
In the final stages of play Army scored a consolation try when their centre Bulathsinghala joined the line off a sweeping three quarter move and darted down to score a try All Blacks style which probably is one of the best scored this season. Full back Gayan Salinda made the conversion and the final score read 24-17 in favour of CR & FC.
