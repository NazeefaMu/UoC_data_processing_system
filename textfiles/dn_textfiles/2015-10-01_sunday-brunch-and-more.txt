Sunday Brunch and more

Sunday Brunches galore in the city and still feeling like there's nothing that quite cuts it right for you? Ramada Colombo presented its own style brunch at the Gardenia Coffeeshop last month.

The Gardenia brunch inspiration is drawn from a culture of long, leisurely dining allowing guests to truly savour the finer things in life.
Starting off a fabulous homemade Ginger-Beer, true to a well-guarded family recipe for a reinvigorating boost to the day, flavours from around the globe await the big palettes.
From Italian antipasto spread with beef carpaccio, delicious bruschetta and crispy crostini with delectable toppings one can nibble into homemade grissini with fabulous tapenades of black olives, avocado and garlic or sundried tomato.
The action station gives grilled mullet with citrus butter cream or herbed chicken with tarragon sauce while the Carvery provides peppered beef roulade with mustard sauce or roast stuffed lamb with mint jus.
For the sweet-toothed there is crunchy caramel cashew slices, pavlova roulade, sticky-sweet cream cheese brownie, cherry clafouti and so much more.
Everyone is invited to take a dip in the pool or enjoy the ease of mind listening to a live jazz band and children can get on the bouncer or have their face painted. Children below 12 years get to dine for half rate.
