Rhino undertakes Gold  Sponsorship of ‘Construct 2018’

Rhino Roofing Products Ltd will be the Gold Sponsor of “Construct 2018” this year.
Construct 2018 Exhibition is one of the leading exhibitions of the construction industry in Sri Lanka and it is a regular event in the National Contractors Association annual calendar.
Construct 2018 exhibition is organized by “National Construction Association of Sri Lanka” and it’s an ideal platform for building material manufacturers, importers, construction industry related stake holders, house builders etc. There is a large participation by stall holders and visitors locally and internationally.
Rhino Roofing Products Ltd Group Marketing Manager Priyantha Jayasinghe said, “For more than 10 years we have been a regular participant at the Construct Exhibition and last year we were the official roofing partner. Based on the previous year experience our management has come forward to undertake the “Gold Sponsorship of Construct 2018”.
Jayasinghe said that this is a crucial time for the construction industry. According to the present business climate in the country, the construction sector is also facing setbacks in business and even the domestic sector contribution shows a substantial decline. We believe at a time like this price wars, severe inter-rival competition, additional credit, reducing advertising budget. However, we think this is the time we must shout more about our products and elaborate on their benefits and showcase your products more. Because of this we want to come forward in large scale sponsorships of these kinds of leading exhibitions in the country.
“We are the market leader of the roofing segment of the country and we manufacture well-known brands such as Rhino; corrugated roofing and flat ceiling sheets. South East Asia’s largest machine painted brand of colored roofing and ceiling sheets – Color up and the Heritage brand of machine painted tile designs and corrugated roofing sheets”, he said.
Jayasinghe further said that “we are in the roofing business for the last 5 decades and we have maintained the market leadership for more than 15years. It is not easy to sustain the market leadership if any organization is not manufacturing high quality products. We are very much concerned about manufacturing excellent quality products, providing brilliant pre and post customer service and practice 7Ps in marketing.
With all these ingredients we will not just satisfy the customer, but we want to delight the customer as well and retain the market leadership in business.
Jayasinghe thanked the National Construction Association, its management and the members for trusting Rhino Roofing and wished that their objectives will become a reality at this exhibition. We believe this exhibition will definitely be an excellent platform for manufacturers, industry related other stake holders and customers as well.
The chief guest for this event was Minister of Agriculture, Mahinda Amaraweera.
