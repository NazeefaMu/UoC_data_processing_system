Govt stopped agreements that gave land ownership to China’

This government terminated all agreements of the previous government that gave outright ownership of lands in the Colombo Port City to the Chinese government, said Colombo Port City Project Director Nihal Fernando, yesterday.
He said the tri-party agreement in 2016 also prevented some of the other lands from being owned by the Chinese company after the 99 years lease, in par with the 2014 agreement by the previous government and all lands were granted a 99-year lease agreement. "All lands in the Colombo Port City will be owned by the Sri Lankan government after the completion of the period in the lease agreement," said Fernando. "This is a victory of the people."
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Colombo Port City project premises.
Fernando pointed out that outright ownership of 20 hectares of the Colombo Port City project had been granted to China under the 2014 agreement and the rest was leased for 99 years. "All those lands were given to the Chinese company under a 99-year lease agreement," Fernando said. "It was a responsibility of the Sri Lankan government to provide infrastructure facilities up to the terminals of the project premises and maintaining the Colombo Port City according to the 2014 agreement. But this government could minimize the government's role and proposed to set up a public-private partnership for the activities".
He said the same agreement in 2014 had prevented the government from commencing projects in government lands in the Colombo Port City premises, other than those related to education and culture, within three years of the completion of construction. However, this government could terminate those clauses and include clauses to set up hospitals, reception halls, conference halls, exhibition centres, Colombo International Financial City etc.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka also participated in the press conference.
