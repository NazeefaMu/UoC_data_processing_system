Regimental Sergeant Major in Commander’s delegation to Seoul

Warrant Officer I, H.D.W Perera, Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) of the Sri Lanka Engineers (SLE) was probably the first in the Army history to have been included in a recent overseas-bound Commander’s delegation.
This is with the objective of getting him educated and exposed to the role and task in relation to the duties of Non Commissioned Officer and Other Ranks in the South Korean Army.
Inclusion of this RSM, in the Commander’s recent delegation to South Korea to attend the Pacific Army Chiefs’ Conference (PACC) sessions was Non Commissioned Officer (NCO) made for the first time on the directives given by Army Commander Lt General Mahesh Senanayake himself who maintained that those NCOs in the Sri Lanka Army should also be allowed to learn from other foreign armies like the South Korean Army.
The Army Commander who recently participated in the PACC sessions in Seoul, South Korea took Warrant Officer I, H.D.W Perera, RSM of the SLE in his delegation, showing the Commander’s concern for enhancement of the professional standards of soldier in the Army.
The RSM in Seoul was privileged to have had several cordial interactive sessions with similar counterparts in the South Korean Army while main PACC were undergoing elsewhere with the participation of the Commander of the Army during September 18 - 21.
Commander of the Army in close contact with South Korean military personnel facilitated the RSMs interactive visits, in which he had the rare opportunity of witness demonstrations, boarder drills, living standards of the soldiers, role and task of Other Rankers (ORs) and Senior Non Commissioned Officers (SNCOs) and basically all obligations entrusted to a serial major in general.
Warrant Officer Perera is now ready to commence sub programmes to share his experiences in Seoul.
