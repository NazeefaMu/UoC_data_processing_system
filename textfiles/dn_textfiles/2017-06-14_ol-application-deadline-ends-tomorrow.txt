O/L application deadline ends tomorrow

Tomorrow will be the deadline to accept applications for the GCE Ordinary Level Examination to be held in December 2017, the Examinations Department said.
Applications for the O/L Examination 2017, to be held under two syllabuses as New and Old, are accepted by the Examinations Department until tomorrow (June 15).
School candidates should forward their applications through principals of the respective schools, while private candidates should submit their applications according to the specimen application published in national newspapers after paying the due examination fee to a post office. The deadline will not be extended on any reason again since it has already been extended owing to the disaster situation, which arose in the country due to the recent flood and landslides.
