LOLC Insurance unveils products to meet needs of customers

Strengthening its product portfolio, the Insurance arm of the LOLC Group, LOLC Insurance launched two new products under its two entities, LOLC General Insurance Limited and LOLC Life Assurance Limited.
The two new products namely, LOLC Suraki Piyasa, unveiled under LOLC General Insurance and LOLC Reality launched under the LOLC Life Assurance banner are simple and affordable insurance policies, designed to cater to the needs of a diverse customer base.
LOLC General Insurance has designed a special home insurance policy named LOLC Suraki Piyasa providing customers the chance to obtain a policy for a selected value instead of insuring for the full value of the property.
Though the insured value selected by the customer does not represent the actual value of the property, no deductions will be made at the time of claim. Through LOLC Suraki Piyasa, LOLC General Insurance hopes to encourage customers to insure their homes at affordable premium rates. LOLC Realityis adistinctive insurance solution launched byLOLC Life Assurance. Through this policy, customers can obtain the highest cover for a minimum premium with flexible term options between 5 and 30 years.
With convenient premium payment options, ranging from monthly, quarterly, half-yearly, annually to single premium, the LOLC Reality policy allows the customer to enjoy a range of additional covers.
Both LOLC General Insurance and LOLC Life Assurance follow a customer focussed strategy, backed by the strength and stability of the mother company - the LOLC Group. Both entities have leveraged on the strengths of the Group, particularly its branch network and the broad spectrum of sectors the company is engaged in.
