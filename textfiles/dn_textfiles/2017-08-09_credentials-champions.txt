Credentials for champions

We need to strive to meet the strategic demands of higher education in Sri Lanka deviating from its conventional approach into globally demanding disciplines, while accelerating the development of such initiative and to make greater contributions for a flourishing country and a powerful nation, a harmonious society and a people of well-being.
In the modern world, sport has become extremely big business. From the multi-billion dollar elite world of professional sport to the equally significant personal fitness sector, the impact of sport on both individual lives and the global economy cannot be understated. As long as civilization has existed, we’ve looked for ways to increase sports performance, raise levels of physical fitness and well-being, reduce the risk of injury, speed up recovery, and bring communities together through this shared celebration of the human body and its capabilities.
Sports science careers range from roles in sports management and marketing through to personal training, physiotherapy and nutritional consultancy. A sports science degree could provide the professional knowledge and training you need in life.
A relatively young discipline, gaining popularity in the last quarter of the 20th century, sports science reflects the seriousness with which sports and fitness are approached today. This is a relatively multi-disciplinary subject, drawing on fields such as physiology and bio-mechanics to measure what is happening in a sportsperson’s body; psychology to analyze the role of the mind in performance; nutrition to help athletes fuel their bodies correctly; and business and sports management to understand the financial and operational sides of the sports industry.
Popular sport universities
Countries such as China has paid more attention and endeavour on sport industry in recent years. Such countries showed the achievements and their determination to develop sports and make people healthier than before. So far China, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Newzealand has established sports universities and students from sport universities usually become athletes, coaches and teachers in China. Some popular sport universities are: Tianjin University of Sport, Nanjing Institute of Physical education, University of Toronto, Canada, Loughborough sporting university, University of Birmingham United Kingdom etc. In these universities prospective sporting students will receive an education as noteworthy for its theoretical focus as for its practical. Sporting Universities are the background to much great British sporting history, from Roger Bannister’s four-minute mile at Oxford’s Iffley Road track to Sebastian Coe’s Olympic gold medals, won after years of training at Loughborough. In such universities, athletes have benefit of training equipment, a running track as well as bio-mechanics laboratories.
They are finally become managers, teachers, administrators, entrepreneurs, coaches, healthcare providers, and researchers and they are all about sports, at the professional, Olympic, collegiate, interscholastic, and recreational levels.
The United States Sports Academy was the first and is the only one of its kind in the United States. It was established in 1972 to turn around a new scientific finding that linked poor preparation of coaches to the injuries incurred by the athletes they supervised. Today, coaches everywhere can prepare thoroughly for their work. Through sports-focused instruction, support of research, and teamwork with professional groups and the Academy showed how to meet sports professionals’ educational needs.
Research in sports
Through their research arm, United States Sports Academy has developed a physical fitness test battery that has been used to assess the very young to the very old. The Academy has also undertaken a variety of special studies to help governments and policymakers chart a course for their national sport efforts. A United States Sports Academy faculty member who has conducted scholarly research on “e-sports” is predicting continued global growth for the popular competitive video gaming tournaments.
At present we merely go after teaching conventional disciplines in universities. There is only few departments have developed in sport sciences in Sri Lankan universities. We cannot see students from such departments become athletes, coaches and teachers. Talented coaches’ referees could be cradled in a more organised manner under the concept of Sports University. Sri Lanka does not utilize the resources of many passionate dedicated sportsmen and women properly.
There is a necessity of developing sport facilities in universities. Professionalization of sports is also feeding into traditional university games globally. Hence, we need a dedicated mission to strengthen health, advocating sportsmanship and pursuing excellence. Our country is enriched with talents. What is lacking is commitment towards a change. Worldwide top scholars, teachers, athletes, coaches have developed globally through such universities. We need to understand the social responsibility linked with sports in the current context while developing general administration in sports in Sri Lankan higher education.
We need not to depend on general treasury; rather we could establish such initiative through public private partnership. We are lagging far behind and our youthful strength and capabilities are wasting on the roads.
There is a necessity of establishing a university aims to educate and nurture excellent sportsmen and specialized sports coaches in Sri Lanka. It may be a tedious task to be fulfilled as a country with many other issues. The importance of the physical education is important from the early childhood. China, Japan, USA, Taiwan, South Korea provides best examples in physical education. The successive governments in those countries have a vision for their future generation, to nurture them and to build a confident healthy nation. At present our higher education system does not provide adequate attention to physical education since the vision for physical education is questionable in Sri Lanka. Attempts made to build a Sports University in different eras in Sri Lanka failed due to lack of commitment and lack of a vision.
The sports university could have areas of physical education, sport coaching, community sport, sport science, traditional Sri Lankan sport such as “Angampora”, sport and industry management, applied psychology, sport rehabilitation and leisure sport etc.
Students who wish to pursue in physical education need to be provided with a key platform for student-staff exchanges and distance education between Sri Lanka and the rest of the world and need to be established academic exchange relationships in physical education. This could be categorised into different types of sports such as cricket, rugby, swimming, basketball etc. This opportunity provides admitting from the widest possible pool of talented students in Sri Lanka.
Having considered the global scenario of higher education timely measures are needed to establish a sports university. Ministry of Sports and Ministry of Higher Education could workout the plans for our future generation. May be it takes time to reap the benefits, but it is the high time to plant the seed.
