Lorry damages historic Galle fort wall

A high roof lorry when travelling through the Galle Fort Old Entrance collided against the top arch of the Fort Gate damaging the wall on Wednesday.
It is the oldest gate of the ancient fortification built in 1588 by the Portuguese with the Dutch East Indies Company, VOC Coat of Arms. The old entrance to Galle Fort is located adjacent to the Galle Old Harbour on Baladhaksha Mawatha.
The lorry which came from Polonnaruwa had entered to the Galle Fort for a banking purpose and the accident had taken place on their way back through the old fort gate. Heavy vehicles to the Galle Fort have been prohibited as per archeological regulations. However, the lorry crew had entered the fort unknowing about regulations.
