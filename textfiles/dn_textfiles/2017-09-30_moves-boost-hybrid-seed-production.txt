Moves to boost hybrid seed production

The government has taken steps to promote the production of hybrid seeds and to introduce the technology to farmers with the help of Bangladesh.
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the ministry has signed an MOU with the Bangladesh Lalteers seeds production company to launch the project, including the exchange of seed production technology. He said the country spends Rs. 1,400m to import hybrid seeds annually. The country has not achieved self-sufficiency in seed requirement even 105 years after establishing the Agriculture Department, he said.
The Minister said the Lalteers company was supposed to be the world's biggest seed production company possessing genetic resources.
He said a seed production building complex, including an agriculture laboratory, will be established at the Mahailuppallama Agriculture Research and Development Centre and the farm. The Minister said 300 acres of the farm has not been utilised for any purpose during the last four decades.
