Poson Festival – 2018:
Arrangements for devotees underway

Electricity, drinking water, sanitation and security are being arranged for devotees visitintg Anuradhapura and Mihintale during this year’s Poson festival, Anuradhapura Government Agent and National Poson Festival Steering Committee Chairman R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News recently.
The committee expects around 1 million devotees to the areas this year.
“Our special attention is focussed on the supply of adequate drinking water for the crowd expected to arrive at Anuradhapura, in view of the prevailing drought within the district. Drinking water would be provided from the Nuwara Wewa and Tissa Wewa reservoirs,” he added.
According to reports received from the Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Irrigation Department, the capacities of the two tanks are adequate to supply drinking water for the next two months, however, at the Mahaweli Water Management committee meeting which is to be held on April 6, it is planned to request the Mahaweli Development Authority to provide 5,000 acre-feet and 1,000 acre-feet of additional Mahaweli water to the Nuwara Wewa and Tissa Wewa to avoid any scarcity of drinking water during the Poson festive season, Wanninayake further said.
Nuwarakalawiya Chief Sanghanayake and Ruwanweli Chethiyaramadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayake Thera requested the authorities not to host carnivals, musical shows or any other form of entertainment in the Anuradhapura district during the Poson festival.
