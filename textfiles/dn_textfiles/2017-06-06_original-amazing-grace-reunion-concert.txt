Original Amazing Grace reunion concert

In 1973, Augie Ranaweera, who was porbably the most respected Recording and PA engineers in the land, decided to put together a new band to enter the music scene in Sri Lanka. Little did he know at the time that this idea of his was going to result in the formation of one of Sri Lanka's most influential supergroups of it's time. This then brought back together three, near lifelong musician friends, who had worked together on and off over the years, Tony Silva, (Keyboards and Vocals), Benjamin Ranabahu (Bass) and Donald Pieris (Drums and vocals).
Tony at the time was the keyboard player and one of the singers with the popular Moonstones, Donald Pieries was the drummer with the Experiments and Benjy was with The Pioneers. Augie then invited Joey Lewis, who himself was also well known in the music scene as a solo Singer and guitarist to come over and meet Tony, Benjy and Donald. ,
After hearing the guys play, Joey had asked if he could have a go with them. Joey with a borrowed guitar, plugged in, and from the very first song they played together, the birth of one of Sri Lanka's all time supergroups took place. The three voices of Tony, Donald and Joey blended so well, that there was no song they could not take on and make their own.
One of the biggest problems they were facing was to get a name that suited them. This is where Joey's mother Myfanwy came to the rescue, suggesting Amazing Grace. It was she who got them their first contract to perform at The Little Hut nightcub at the Mount Lavinia Hotel too.
Having songs from the Bee Gees, Grand Funk Railroad and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in their repertoire, performed so brilliantly, with their powerful vocal harmonies, took these four teenagers right to the top.
We were brothers in music, says Joey. We never had a cross word between us ever. Yes, we might have disagreed sometimes but our friendship and respect for each others talent, always won the day. We, each of us, had a roll to play, he says with a smile. Tony was the electronics genius and helped us to create the sound of the band, I was the frontman, Donald was the voice we all just wanted to hear, and Benjy got the girls. Amazing Grace, over the years went through many changes with Joey, Donald and Benjy venturing out and returning from time to time. Tony, together with gifted singer/guitarist Reza Deane, kept the band at the top of the music scene, with the help of other very talented local musicians who joined them at various times, until 1978 when the group broke up.
This led to Tony approaching Joey to reform the band with himself and Reza. The new phase, as it became, of Amazing Grace, then came alive with Joey Lewis going back to his roots and playing bass, Hassan Musaffer on drums and Nihal Chanderatne joining them for a whole new era of Amazing Grace. This new line up saw Amazing Grace take a completely new direction with their approach to their music, presentation and repertoire.
An Original Amazing Grace reunion show was never going to happen for many reasons, not least because of the personal commitments of the founder members, which made their trying to be available at the same time simply impossible but Damayantha Kuruppu has proved that all things are in fact possible.
DK Promotions is proud to announce that Tony, Donald, Benjy and Joey, the four guys who started the magic of Amazing Grace, will get together, after nearly 40 years, for one last time together, at the BMICH on June 11.
