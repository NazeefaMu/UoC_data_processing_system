Attempt to bribe MP :
TISL gives statement to CIABOC

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) yesterday gave a detailed statement to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) with regard to the audio recording released by UNP MP and former Minister Palitha Range Bandara on the alleged attempts to offer him a bribe to cross over.
The TISL had already lodged a complaint to the CIABOC on November 5, relating to allegations of attempts to bribe MP Range Bandara and this was a follow-up of that compliant.
According to the taped conversation, a third party tries to offer a financial incentive to UNP MP Range Bandara to commit the political act.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said TISL officials highlighted to CIABOC investigators that the contents of the telephone conversation recording shared with the media recently by the UNP MP clearly indicate an offence under Section 14 of the Bribery Act.
There are three key points to flag from the recorded conversation,TISL said. One is the offer of Rs. 500 million to cross over; secondly, the offer to pay the amount in US dollars; and thirdly, the willingness to carry out the transaction in Anamaduwa.
The tape allegedly also contains a promise that UNP MP Range Bandra would be given a ministerial portfolio when he crosses over.
The offence of bribing a Member of Parliament carries a prescribed prison term of up to seven years under the provisions of the Bribery Act.
CIABOC officials confirmed to TISL today that an investigation has been initiated into the complaint and that statements would be obtained from the relevant parties.
“We hope that upon the conclusion of this investigation, those who sought to bribe MPs will be held to account and that anybody attempting to do so in the future is mindful of the consequences,” Obeyesekere said.
