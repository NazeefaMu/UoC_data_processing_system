Blooming lotus, wilted lives

Chinthaka selling flowers
They wake up early before the first rays of the dawn can warm the coldness of the night before. And as a thin layer of mist covers day break, so begins the promise of another day of work for the flower sellers. This is the story of the flower sellers of Galgamuwa, Mahagalkadawala and Senarathgama.
Their flowers do not bring them fortunes to make them kings, but it gives value to the tiredness in their eyes so that they can continue to face the hardships of life.
The flowers are plucked the day before and prepared into bunches of lotuses and lotus buds. They then carry their merchandise in buckets and head to the main Kurunegala-Anuradhapura road. They have no shops or tents to sell from and a small bucket does the job.
The heat of the sun nor the dust on the road can be helped, the flowers need to be sold. The team consists of around 15 flower sellers and they are spread out along the road, carrying out their business. They do not compete with each other as they know that they are all on the same road trying to make a living.
As they stretched out their hands filled with lotuses for vehicles from afar to see, they engaged in a bit
of conversation with us.

I have been selling flowers for the last 20 years. I am 64-year-old and earlier I used to travel around the country selling flowers, but now I am too old to do that. Now I have to rely on my son to help me do this business. We go to Sangalpale, Anamaduwa, Galgamuwa and Medawachchiya areas to get the flowers. For a day, I manage to sell flowers for about Rs. 500 to 800. But, we also spend quite a sum to pluck these flowers. Some have suggested that we take a lease out on a tank and do this business on a larger scale, but we don’t have the financial strength to do that. If there are no flowers, after we have paid for the lease on the tank, all our money would have just been spent for nothing. So we are carrying on this way. When it is midday, I go into the shade of those trees along with the flowers.
At times we do deliver some flowers to order, but then we have to find a large number of flowers to do that and sometimes the profit from such orders is not much. But, we cannot give this up, this is the job we have been doing for a living, so we have to protect that. That is why I say that this job is not as beautiful as the lotus flowers we sell. God bless you for choosing to write about us.

I have been in this trade for the past 10 years, and for the past 10 years I have faced the general difficulties in life. In a way, it is the nature of this job. We need to survive either way. It is not only I, but it is thanks to this flower that my wife and three children live. I wake up very early and get on to the street carrying a bucket of flowers before the light hits the road.
On weekdays, I come here around 5am, but on weekends, I am on the road from around 3 to 4 am. On the weekends, many people go to Anuradhapura, so we hope to catch them early to sell some flowers. We pluck flowers worth around Rs. 1,000 to 1,500 per day, but it is not easy to sell all the flowers. And we have to wage a great war to protect our flowers from the rays of the sun. We need to have 2to 3 litres of water in hand to stop the flowers from drying up or wilting. That is how we can keep the flowers fresh until evening.
Not all vehicles stop near us and not every vehicle which does, buy some flowers. Some just ask us how much they are and others ask flowers for unfair prices. We too are put in a difficult spot at such times. When these people come in their luxury vehicles and bargain on the price of flowers, we feel quite disappointed in ourselves. They too should understand that we are in this business to make a living. By evening we sell the flowers at any rate as we cannot keep them for two or three days.

I have been selling flowers for the past five years and during this time, it is not only I, but all these sellers have earned some merit in doing so. We have sold many flowers to devotees who are on their way to worship the Buddha. So, in a way that is the only thing we can be happy about when doing this business, for this job is very difficult.
The flowers do not bloom in the tanks every day and while we engage in this trade when the flowers do bloom, we have to find alternative work when it doesn’t. More often than not, we go to cut bricks or daily labour work. Also when the monsoons arrive, we don’t engage in this sort of work. By now, the flowers in the tanks have started to decrease in number and by next month we will not have any flowers.
The struggle we have to undergo on this road from morning is indescribable. We need to wave our flowers in a way in which the vehicles can see them and so our hands can never be free. We start early morning and sell flowers until around 2pm, and then go back around 3 or 4pm to find flowers for the next day. That is how we spend our days. One bunch needs around 15 flowers and we sell a bunch for Rs 100. People cannot buy a bunch for this price in Anuradhapura, the flowers are more expensive there, but some vehicles ask for a bunch for a mere Rs 50. Our labour cost is hardly covered with that price. Sometimes, people pay us extra out of their own goodwill but we deal with a variety of people on a daily basis.

I am now 52-years-old, I have been in this flower business for the past eight years. The past eight years has been a monotonous sort of life. The bunch of flowers I bring in the morning is prepared the night before. My wife and I get together and tie the flowers into bunches of about 60 or 70. We also go through a lot of trouble to get the flowers.
We cannot get them from the village tank every day, as the flowers are over in a day or two when we do that. So we also visit areas of Anuradhapura, Galgamuwa, Sangappalaya, Nikaweratiya and Kuliyapitiya to get the flowers we need. But, the flowers don’t come free. We need at least Rs 500 to 1,000 at hand to pay those who own the tanks.
Even some of the Buddhist Temples give us flowers only when we pay them a certain amount. Having got permission, we enter the tanks with a branch in hand, these are tanks we are not familiar with and they may have dangers lurking in them. Especially crocodiles are a major risk. We keep God in mind and get into the tank.
Some tanks make you sink in, some have wells dug in them and there are times we fall into them. But we come back home safe and start work having once again prayed to God and having hung another branch.

I have been in this job for the last two years now. I also have a small vegetable shop on the side to add to my income. My husband plucks the flowers for me. We make bunches out of them and sell it the next day. It is not easy to do this job with the child, but we cannot stop it due to that. Some people pay extra for the flowers at times. But at times, vehicles stop and ask two bunches for Rs. 100 and we are put in a difficult spot then.
We do not want to hurt their feelings because they are on their way to worship the Buddha, so I smile and walk away or I refuse their offer in a way which does not offend them.
There are not many such people fortunately. But, there are all sorts of people.
I also have some regular customers who purchase flowers only from me whenever they go to Anuradhapura, those bonds have been formed based on our goodwill over time and all of us have a few like that. On Poya days our sales are quite good, but on the other days, the income is not much.
