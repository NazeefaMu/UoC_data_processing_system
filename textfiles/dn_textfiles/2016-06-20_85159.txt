Pathetic Sri Lanka loses all at Monaco 7s

Sri Lanka after a pathetic performance in the group stages where they lost all their three group games suffered a fourth defeat when Morocco beat them by 33 points to 14 in the Challenge Trophy quarter-finals at the 2016 Rio Olympic Repechage Men’s Rugby 7s at the Stade Louse II in Monaco on Sunday.
In their first group match, Sri Lanka after trailing 0-28 at half time were thrashed by 42 points to 5 by Germany. The solitary try for Sri Lanka was scored by captain Sudarshana Muthuthantri.
This defeat was followed by a 0-57 drubbing from Canada in the second game. Sri Lanka showed a bit of improvement against Uruguay in their third and final group match but still finished on the losing side 40 points to 14 to be placed at the bottom of Pool ‘B’.
In this game Sri Lanka gave a good fight in the first half and were trailing 12-14 at one stage before going down 14-40. For the Sri Lankan Tuskers Jason Dissanayaka and Richard Dharmapala scored one try apiece and former captain and fly half Fazil Marija fired across two conversions.
In the quarter-final match against Morocco, one try each were scored by Richard Dharmapala and Kanchana Ramanayake with Srinath Sooriyabandara putting over the two conversions.
