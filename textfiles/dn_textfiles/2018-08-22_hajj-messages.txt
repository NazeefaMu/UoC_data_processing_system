Hajj messages

Cherish self-respect: Opposition Leader
The Hajj festival emphasizes the need to care for those who are poor and downtrodden and enable them to join the celebrations, stated Tamil National Alliance Leader and Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan in his Hajj message.
He stated: “My heartiest wishes to all Muslims in Sri Lanka on this sacred day of Hajj. The Hajj festival reminds us of the importance of sacrificial life and the benefits that it could bring to the humankind.
Being one of the two festivals celebrated by the Muslims all over the world, the Hajj festival emphasizes the need to care for those who are poor and downtrodden and enable them to join the celebrations. While we celebrate this sacred festival, I call upon the people of this island nation to come together to build a country that will cherish self-respect and allow people to live in harmony and peace, with an attitude of unselfishness and to seek the betterment of our future generation.”

Build better Sri Lanka for all: State Minister Fowzie
National Unity and Co-existence State Minister A. H. M. Fowzie emphasized the importance in applying the good deeds to our lives and joining hands with the government in building a better Sri Lanka for all belonging to all faiths as Sri Lankans are a mixed community.
“The Hajj festival (Eid-Ul-Adha) stresses upon the importance of sacrifice, particularly to give up one’s pride, arrogance, high status and become one of commoners draped in a simple white cloth and to collectively march against evils, seeking common good of all,” State Minister Fowzie said in his message marking the Hajj festival.
He said, Prophet Mohammed Sallallahu alai wasallam set an example to Muslims to respect others while preserving the religion, culture and right to live in peace and harmony.
“On this sacred day of Hajj festival, I am happy to convey my sincere greetings to all Muslim fraternity throughout the country with ever lasting peace and prosperity,” he said.
As State Minister for National Unity and Co-existence, he said he appeals to the Muslim community to continue to adopt patience, practiced by the fore-fathers, in a manner that makes other communities understand that Islam promotes love, friendship, brotherhood, unity and peaceful co-existence with others.
“As far as the Sri Lankan Muslims are concerned,” the State Minister said he is happy that Muslims are a well-disciplined community conducting themselves according to the teachings of Islam. “In doing so, they pay due respect to other religions and take enough care not to hurt the susceptibilities to fellow citizens.”
“I wish all my fraternity EID MUBARAK,” he said.

Celebrate life, revere mercy of Almighty Allah: Minister Hakeem
Muslims, during Hajj reflect upon the boundless sense of sacrifice and the tradition of humility and submission of Prophet Ibrahim and Ismail. We celebrate Prophet Ibrahim’s demonstrated willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of supreme submission to God's command this day, stated Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem marking Hajj.
He added: “As He decreed, we celebrate life and revere the mercy and immeasurable kindness of Almighty Allah.
We have arrived at yet another holy day to reflect upon the term ‘sacrifice’ and the Almighty God’s compassion, at daring times of threats to human dignity and social justice faced by Muslims in Sri Lanka and in many other parts of the world.
The community continues to bear the brunt of antagonism of extremist forces with patience and faces political impediments that have unleashed mutation. At times of despair that they face as minorities, regardless of changing regimes and state policies, this day reverberates the essence of Hajj with special resonance in Sri Lanka.
As followers of the traditions of Prophet Ibrahim, more than any other community in the world, we understand that we too as a community are facing challenges of modernization.
We have endured such critical phases. However, our community of Muslims pledge to give our best to cooperate and to work towards a meaningful reconciliation in our country now. In some parts of the world, oppressed communities have also taken to extreme radical Islamic values and militancy.
Our prayers are with those who are displaced; those suffering in internment; the impoverished and the ailing fellow beings. We reflect upon them and pray for mercy at our moment of celebrationon this Holy day of sacrifice, as always.
May the merciful Almighty Allah help us uphold Islamic values and principles of social justice, at all times.
My sincere best wishes and Eid Mubarak!”

Strengthen national unity: Deputy Mayor
May the Hajj Festival shower blessings of Allah to fill our hearts and minds with virtuous values, stated Deputy Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council M. T. M. Iqbal in a Hajj message issued yesterday.
The message added that Islam devotees from countries throughout the world assemble at the holy city of Mecca to perform Hajj, recalling the unwavering confidence and dedication on Allah by Ismail Nabi.
"Concurrently, we as Sri Lankans make use of Hajj to strengthen national unity and resolve to help others without any discrimination in the name of humanity. Allah does not look at a person's wealth or features. He only looks at their hearts and behaviour.
"Let us also follow suit and fill our hearts and minds with virtue with the blessing of Allah," he said.

Fill heart with inner peace: envoy
Hajj rituals fill a Muslim’s heart with inner peace and tranquilly. Various rituals of Hajj purify one’s body and soul. The Hajj festival is also an occasion to propagate unity among all, Sri Lankan Ambassador to Palestine M. Fawzan Anwer said in a Hajj message.
His message added: “Hajj, one of the five main pillars of Islam, has a message for the benefit and wellbeing of all people of the world, be they Muslim or not. The wonderful message of Hajj is that a Muslim should live in peace with his brothers in humanity, even if they are of different faiths.
“Though Hajj is obligatory once in a lifetime on financially and physically capable Muslims, every single Muslim, man or woman, rich or poor, dreams to repeatedly offer it”.
“During the Hajj rituals, a Muslim respects and accepts the opinions of different juristic schools.”
