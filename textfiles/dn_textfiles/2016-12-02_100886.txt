School uniform material distribution incident: Principal suspended temporarily

The Principal of Badiudeen Mahmud Girls College Kandy, has been temporarily suspended from duty in connection with an incident related to school uniform material distribution.
The suspension has been imposed by the Education Ministry as the Principal had allegedly purchased and distributed school uniform material to students instead of giving them the vouchers issued by the ministry.
The ministry says that the Principal was temporarily suspended pending an investigation into the incident.
The Education Ministry states that according to the new circular it is the responsibility of all school principals to hand over uniform vouchers to students.
