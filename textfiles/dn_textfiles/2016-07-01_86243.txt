DSS retains trophy with 28-12 rout of Mahanama

 
D.S. Senanayake College retained the Battle of the Gold trophy in their 10th annual inter schools rugby “Big Match” encounter when they beat Mahanama College by 28 points (4 tries, 1 conversion, 2 penalties) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion) at CR&FC grounds, Longden Place yesterday. DSS led 12-5 at the breather.
Although starting the match as favourites D.S.Senanayake had to face stiff resistance and there was doubts cast whether they could retain the trophy for another year.
Mahanama had an indifferent season but had shown their capabilities when they beat some top schools, hence an enthralling battle was expected.
Both the teams played high class rugby which is a tribute to their coaches but two individuals stood out and were the stars of the team. Mahanama skipper and flanker Dinesh Bandara led from the front and was always in the thick of the action, while D.S. Senanayake open side flanker Inura Samarawickrama was surely the player of the game for his cracking runs to go along with his spectacular tackles and steady performance.
Samarawickrama was easily the highest point’s scorer along with Mahanama skipper Bandara as each scored two sensational tries apiece.
D.S. Senanayake opened scoring when flanker Samarawickrama crashed through for a try which captain Mohamad Ashroff fluffed with the conversion and they went into a 5-nil lead.
DSS scored again when prop forward Imaad Siddik went over the line off a forward rush. This time around Ashroff made the conversion and they extended their lead to 12-nil.
Mahanama immediately cut down the lead when Bandara dummied his way over for a superb try. Dimantha Gimhana missed the difficult conversion and the score read 12-5 in favour of DSS which was the score at half time. Soon after the interval DSS scored through their cracking centre Ruchira Weerakoon who touched down for a sensational try through a three quarter move. Ashroff made a good conversion and they went further ahead to lead 20-5.
Bandara quickly reduced the lead with a sensational try and Gimhana made a good conversion so that the scoreline read 20-12.
Within a couple of minutes Ashroff slotted a superb 35 metre penalty to extend the lead to 23-12.
DSS sealed the match when their hard working flanker cum hero of the day Samarawickrama collected a ball off a ruck and crashed through on the blind side to score. Place kicker cum captain Ashroff failed with the conversion but the final score was a commendable 28-12.
