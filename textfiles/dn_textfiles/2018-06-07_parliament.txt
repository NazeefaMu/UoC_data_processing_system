JO attempting to sabotage Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement: PM
The Joint Opposition is attempting to sabotage the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement with unfounded criticisms, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday, replying to a question by JO MP Bandula Gunawardena. The MP alleged that the Government entered into the agreement without informing Parliament and without facilitating an open dialogue with professionals’ associations and the general public. He called on the Government to suspend the implementation of the agreement and start an open dialogue.
The PM said the Agreement was inked after it received Cabinet approval and that a panel of officials conducted extensive discussions on its content. He said the Agreement was in line with the country’s laws and policies and that due procedures followed in its making.
“I cannot understand why you are running after FTA with Singapore. It was during former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s time that Chinese engineers and labourers came here in large numbers. There were well-experienced engineers among them and we benefitted from their knowledge. Even Bangladesh workers were brought in here to work in road development projects. We did not hire foreign workers when the Mahaweli Project was carried out or when we built huge industrial zones,” he said.
The PM said the talk of JO does not match with what it practices. “All your monies are deposited in foreign banks in Dubai, Seychelles, Hong Kong, etc. You do not deposit your money in banks in Sri Lanka.
You say one thing to the country, but do completely the opposite. Did you inform Parliament when the Port City and Shangri La lands were given outright? Did you inquire for our opinion before starting the Hambantota project?” he told the JO.
Audit Bill would be taken up for debate soon: Speaker
The National Audit Bill would be moved for debate in Parliament shortly after finalizing the Amendments to it, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He said he brought to the attention of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the need to pass the Audit Bill soon. “The Prime Minister promised me that the Bill would be taken up for debate soon. The Public Service Commission has also provided their recommendations on the Bill, while those were also studied. We are also keen on getting this Bill through Parliament as soon as possible,” he said.
The Speaker made these observations in reply to a query by JO MP Ranjith de Soyza, who brought the attention of the House to the issues the Audit Commission has faced due to the delay in passing legislation.
Rift in JO over 20th Amendment
The Joint Opposition group meeting held at the Parliamentary complex on Tuesday, was divided on the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, Parliament sources said yesterday.
During the meeting, JO MP Kumara Welgama had proposed to invite JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake to brief them on the contents of the Bill to abolish the Executive Presidency.
He had said that the SLFP group could then question the JVP and get a thorough understanding of the amendment.
While some JO members welcomed the proposal, some including MP Wimal Weerawansa had opposed it.
Weerawansa, who defected from the JVP and his supporters in the JO had spoken against inviting the JVP leader to brief them on the 20th Amendment.
An irate Welgama had then demanded Weerawansa to brief the JO group on the contents of the amendment and be prepared to provide answers to all the questions he had about it, sources said.
NWSDB trade union action unfair: Minister Hakeem
The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) workers’ Trade Union action is very unfair at a time when they had been given a 20 percent salary hike, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said.
The minister told Parliament yesterday, that the NWSDB workers demanded a 23 percent salary hike and they were given a 20 percent salary hike after discussens held with the Treasury after obtaining Cabinet approval.
“This entire agitation is because they wanted another 3 percent increase. This is nothing but bargaining by taking the innocent consumers for granted. In addition to this salary hike, each salary cadre had received about a 10 percent increase because we removed the salary anomalies,” he said.
“The TU action was launched without prior notice. We are discussing with the Treasury as to whether we could facilitate an incentive payment to the tune of 3 percent. We are ready to solve this issue,” he added.
“The NWSDB workers are demanding a salary hike in par with the CEB and CPC, but we are facing financial difficulties because there had been no revision of water tariff for the last 6 months. We did not increase the water tariff as it would inconvenience the public. In 2015, the salaries of the NWSDB workers were raised by 30 percent,” he said.
The minister made this observations when MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena asked for the immediate intervention of the Minister to resolve the problem in the the NWSDB without letting it create a water scarcity in the country.
Female workers entitled to 84 days wages for live births: Minister Samarawickrama
Having realized the discriminatory provision in the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, the government under the amendment, has done away with the differentiated payments and made all live births of children of a woman worker entitled to full benefits of all 84 days of wages, without discrimination for all child births, said the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.
“As for the existing provisions, only for the first and the second child maternity benefits were given in terms of wages for 12 weeks. Accordingly, a woman is entitled to the payment of maternity benefits two weeks before confinement and another ten weeks after confinement in the case of an issue of a live birth. However, in terms of a still birth, payment was restricted to only six weeks, which is 47 days,” he said, adding that in giving birth to a third child or more, the woman worker was entitled to maternity benefits and wages exactly for only half of the period, which is only 42 days prior to and after confinement.
He said there are no generalised insurance fund to cover maternity expenses of female employees, hence, the Ministry of Labour would initially take steps to correct the anomalies in the Maternity Ordinance and later steps would also be taken to establish a fund for the purpose of insurance cover during pregnancies at a future date.
The minister made this statement presenting two important amendments to the Shop and Office Employees (Amendment) Bill and the Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Bill in Parliament yesterday, for the benefit of the workers of the country who are really in need of relief.
The subject of maternity benefits is covered under two laws, the Maternity Benefits Ordinance and the Shop and Office Employees Act. The Maternity Benefits Ordinance provides for the granting of maternity benefits to women covered under the Wages Board Ordinance and the Factories Ordinance. The Shop and Office Employees Act grants maternity benefits to women workers in shops and offices. On account of basic differences in the basic nature of work under these laws, for several decades, maternity benefits had been provided at different levels, but not on an equal basis. The way the maternity benefits have been provided under the Ordinance, the woman workers who are generally engaged in manual labour underwent hardships on account of several discriminatory provisions. He also said that having corrected the anomalies, the number of days granted for maternity leave would be counted only taking into account the number of working days.
“Among the basic differences in the two laws in comparison were gaps in the standards set out in the Maternity Protection Convention of the ILO, which Sri Lanka ratified in April 1993. On account of these anomalies, the two laws and gaps in comparison with ILO standards, the successive governments were subjected to criticism for not initiating action to rectify these anomalies of the two laws in operation for several decades.
Thus, all these amendments are long overdue. In the amendment to the Maternity Benefits Ordinance, steps were taken to remove several discriminatory provisions in the ordinance in the process of equalizing the standard of the Shops and Office Employees Act. To activate this exercise which has been suggested not only by the ILO, but also from several trade unions and Women’s organisations, suggesting the removal of the prevailing anomalies in the Maternity Benefits Ordinance merely granting benefits on the number of children,” Samarawickrama noted.
‘Charge sheeted Police officers not entitled for promotions’
An officer who has a charge sheet against him would not be granted promotions, as this was the policy maintained by not only the Police Department, but in all state institutions, said Law and Order and State Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
He said this in response to a question raise by Joint Opposition MP Shehan Semasinghe as to why despite the recommendations of the Police Commission to reinstate SP Priyadharshana Herath who had been suspended for one year, the IGP had still taken steps to suspend his services further. Having been re-instated, the said police officer had been in service for just 20 days, when the IG had again suspended his services, disregarding the recommendations of the Police Commission.
Semasinghe questioned as to whether the IGP had the power to disregard a recommendation of the Police Commission and if it was not in violation of the Constitution.
In response, the Law and Order Minister said, “The relevant police officer had been given a charge sheet and as such, such a person is not entitled to a promotion, not only in the Police service, but it is the policy of all state institutions.”
However, Semasinghe asked the Law and Order Minister to pay attention to the many problems that are affecting the members of the Police Department.
He also asked the minister to focus his attention to the increasing crime and drug related incidents affecting the country.
However, Minister Madduma Bandara said in fact the rate of crimes had reduced in the country and measures were being taken to further reduce crimes in the country.
