Pizza Hut is a household name around the world bringing joy to pizza lovers for decades, constantly innovating new cuisine and delighting family and friends with the best pizza in the world.
And now, Pizza Hut is honoured to have brought its world-famous Pan Pizza to the Maldives.
The move to Maldives is an exciting one for Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd as they will now be managing operations in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Currently being the franchisee for 55 Pizza Hut outlets in Sri Lanka, Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd is a fully owned subsidiary of Gamma Pizzakraft Overseas (Pvt) Ltd, led by a team of high-profile professionals and business personalities.
“It’s a chance for us to venture into a new and beautiful country to dish out one of the biggest international franchises in the world to a new nation. It’s an exciting prospect to us, because we get to expand our own diverse and much-adored menu to serve the expectations of the community of Maldives. As a brand that has constantly evolved and endeavoured to innovate new recipes and cuisines, it is a challenge that we are glad to accept”, said Yasa Nadaraja, CEO of Gamma Pizzakraft Lanka (Pvt) Ltd.
The pre-launch ceremony was held on March 28, 2018 and was graced by the presence of the Minister of Economic Development, Mohamed Saeed.
Pizza Hut Maldives officially opened to the public on March 29, 2018 and long queues were seen outside the restaurant in anticipation of the doors opening at 11 am.
The restaurant can accommodate up to 70 customers and is currently available for customers to dine-in or take away their meals.
