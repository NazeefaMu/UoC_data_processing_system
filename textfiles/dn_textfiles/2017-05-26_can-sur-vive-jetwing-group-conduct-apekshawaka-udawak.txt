CAN-SUR-VIVE, Jetwing Group to conduct  Apekshawaka Udawak

CAN-SUR-VIVE Trust of Sri Lanka in collaboration with Jetwing Group will conduct ‘CAN-SUR-VIVE’ (Apekshawaka Udawak) CSR programme for the sixth occasion on June 4, at 8.00 a.m at Lanka Hospitals, 10th floor auditorium.
The programme is conducted free for women who are mainly under medication for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and gynecological cancer.
The workshop will comprise lectures by Consultants, including well-known Clinicians, Psychologist, Occupational therapists, Physiotherapists, Sociologists while financial advisors, Clergymen will discuss the main issues and challenges faced by the survivors.
The CSR focuses on reinstating lost zeal of cancer patients/survivors while uplifting the status of emotional, psychological and societal wellbeing of the survivor.
The workshop also aims at educating survivors of breast cancer on medical, physical, financial, spiritual and other related issues pertaining directly to a cancer survivor’s well-being while enhancing the survivors’ and family members’ self-confidence.
In Sri Lanka there is poor attention towards survivors of cancer including counseling. In certain instances survivors have contracted cancer again due to negligence and lack of proper medical advice. Hence this endeavour by the CAN-SUR-VIVE Trust is of vast importance as far as Sri Lankan medical sector is concerned.
CAN-SUR-VIVE (Apekshawaka Udawak) programmes held previously saw specialists and resource persons dedicating themselves towards uplifting physical, mental, spiritual and even financial wellbeing of survivors of cancer.
Hiran Cooray, Chairman, Jetwing Group, commenting on CAN-SUR-VIVE (Apekshawaka Udawak) programme said Jetwing Group is sponsoring this noble CSR venture for the fourth occasion.
