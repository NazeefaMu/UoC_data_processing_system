Go on a Date – With Yourself

I remember a time after I left the University and started work at the Sunday Observer when I would read 5-6 books a week! I would go to the second-hand bookshops at Gamini Hall whenever I wanted to, roam around Pettah because the place fascinated me or even hop on a bus to travel to Galle on my own to see my grandma. I still love to read. I enjoy browsing in bookstores and traveling to Galle even though grandma is no more and traveling on the expressway is so boring. All those things I loved in the past, I still love. But sadly in this life in which I work fast, eat fast, walk fast, even sleep fast, when days blur into weeks and weeks blur into months - faster than the time it takes to download a song on YouTube there is no time to spend on the things I love anymore.
Are you with me?
Hope you are. If you are like the rest of us, chances are you find it hard to slow down too. As Thomas Moore, author of ‘Care of the Soul’, says, “We seem to have a complex about busyness in our lives. Most of us do have time in our days that we could devote to simple relaxation, but we convince ourselves that we don’t.” It seems there is always something that needs doing, always someone who needs our attention. “Unfortunately,” Moore says, “we don’t get a lot of support in this culture for doing nothing. If we aren’t accomplishing something, we feel that we’re wasting time.”
It’s not our fault I suppose that we feel compelled to measure our success in terms of acquisition and accomplishment. But even those of us who are unwilling to buy into such a narrow definition of success may feel uncomfortable with the idea of claiming time just for ourselves, with no agenda whatsoever. Often when we find we have an empty hour, we spend that time cleaning cobwebs off the ceiling or calling an aunt who lives on her own to check how she is doing. And on those rare moments when there is no one around us and we are alone at home, we all reach for the phone—or the TV remote or the pile of washed clothes waiting to be folded. As Katrina Kenison writes in her article ‘Why you must have time alone’, “we avoid ourselves because we are afraid of what we might find: a forlorn, flawed someone who’s missing out on life’s party.” But, the good news is, says Kenison, “We can retreat from the world for a time without being renounced by it.”
I think children know how to do this better than us adults. Whenever I see my 8-year-old play in the garden, I marvel at her contentment and self-sufficiency. She is completely absorbed as she plants twigs in an empty flowerpot and chatters to her teddy who incidentally is named Happy. She is enjoying her own good company—a trait that, somewhere along the line, so many of us seems to have lost.
More creative!
So, it is important that we force ourselves to be alone. Mostly because experts say we are more creative alone. This could be why Pulitzer prize–winning writer John Updike, author of 51 books, attributes his astonishing productivity to a schedule that honors empty time. “Ideally,” he explains, “much of my day should be, in a strict sense, idle, for it is often in idle moments that real inspiration comes.”
Being alone with ourselves also helps us see things more clearly. “We live in an extremely externalized culture,” Moore says. “We are constantly pulled outside ourselves—by other people, by the media, by the demands of daily life. Nothing in our culture or in our education teaches us how to go inward, how to steady the mind and calm our attention. As a consequence, we tend to devote very little time to the life of the soul, the life of the spirit.”
We need to balance the pace and intensity of modern life with periods of what poet May Sarton has called “open time, with no obligations except toward the inner world and what is going on there.” Alone—in moments of prayer or meditation, or simply in stillness—we breathe more deeply, see more fully, hear more keenly. We notice more, and in the process, we return to what is sacred.
So, if, like me, you and your inner self have been out of touch for quite some time now, build a new relationship with someone who deserves attention—you.
Make a date with yourself. Do what novelist, poet and lecturer Julia Cameron encourages her readers to do, in her book The Right to Write, - treat yourself to a weekly “artist date”—a solo expedition to a place that interests you. That might be a clothes store, an art or natural history museum, a movie or the beach. The point is not to accomplish something or even to learn something; it’s simply to have fun—alone. When we romance our creative consciousness, she says, we have far more energy to bring to our everyday lives.
Two is a crowd!
To do so, however, remember to stand firm. It’s funny how easily time alone turns into something else—but remember, when it comes to solitude, two is a crowd. Even if you are tempted to invite a friend to go on a walk with you, keep in mind that friends are priceless, but so is an opportunity to walk in silence through the footpaths at Diyawanna or on a quiet road near your home.
Experts also say when you are in the process of finding time for yourself it is always best to be clear about your needs. “I need some time for myself” sounds both desperate and vague. If you are married your spouse;s response to this timeworn refrain could easily be “Yeah, so do I.” Next time, be clear and practical: “On Saturday afternoon, I will be gone from two o’clock to five o’clock. Will you be able to watch the kids?”
If you find time for yourself make sure you help others in their efforts to take time off too. If you claim Saturday afternoon, invite your partner to follow his or her own inclinations next time, while you hold down the fort.
Meanwhile, be on the lookout for stolen moments. “There are empty spaces in almost every day, tiny nooks of time that you can inhabit in solitude,” says Kenison. Try arriving ten minutes early for appointments, walking to work, working on your laptop out in the garden, making dinner without the phone pressed to one ear. “Breathe deeply, be still, and check in with yourself, if only for a few minutes.”
Finally, practice doing nothing. Your need to replenish and play is as important as your need to get through the to-do list. “Just don’t make too big a deal out of figuring out how to relax,” Moore says. “If you make a program of it, you’re back to busyness.”
Got it yet? Accept it. Carving out a little solitude can make a world of difference. So go ahead—give yourself a break. Give your soul a holiday. Sit still and watch the clouds go by. After all, you won’t see that particular cloud in that particular place in the sky, ever again.
Tips for making ‘me’ time a reality
First, decide that you deserve some time to yourself each day. Stop feeling guilty for taking time out for you, and realize in the long run, it’s a win-win for everyone. When you are tired, stressed out and pulled in too many directions, it is hard to give your best to all you must accomplish. Remember, self-time is not selfish—it’s a necessary dimension of self-care!
Decide how best to spend “me” time. How each of us chooses to spend free time is as individualized as we all are. If you had an extra 15 minutes, a half hour, an afternoon or an entire day, what would you do to make yourself feel rejuvenated, relaxed and happy? Write a list and keep it handy when you begin scheduling time into your calendar.
Evaluate the things that are wasting your time each day. Do you check your emails constantly and end up spending more time on your computer than you planned? Do you answer personal calls in the middle of your workday? If this sounds like you, you must take the time to organize your responsibilities, and you will gain more free time than you can imagine.
Learn to say “no” to requests to do things that you don’t really want to, don’t value or don’t bring you satisfaction and joy.
Ask for help with chores that don’t necessarily have to be completed by you alone.
At the beginning of each week, take a few minutes to designate specific time slots for all that must be accomplished—including “me” time. Treat your personal time like you would any other appointment and make it non-negotiable.
Commit to a minimum of 15-20 minutes of “me” time every day. Do something (or nothing) that completely lets go of responsibilities and releases your mind, allowing you to be alone with your thoughts.
Create a daily ritual. This can be a bath, listening to music, taking a walk or meditating. Make it something you can look forward to.
