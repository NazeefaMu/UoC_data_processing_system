Athlete Kotakadeniya chief guest
The annual Colours awarding ceremony of St. Sylvester's College was held a few days back at the school hall under the distinguished patronage of one of their old boys Air Vice Marshal HMSKB “Sagara” Kotakadeniya, who was a top class athlete. While at school he was provincial and national athlete. Born 27 June 1965 he joined the Air Force in 1985, and took part in athletics and at present is the Air Force Cycling president.
Fazil to step down from National 15’s
Fazil Marija (born 2 December 1985), one of Sri Lanka's finest rugby payers and one of Asia’s best, has decided to step down from national XV a side rugby after the Asian tournament in Malaysia.
Fazil comes from a sporting family background, with at least 17 members through two generations having represented various clubs, services teams and national teams during the past four decades. He mastered his rugby skills at Kingswood College, played for his school from U-13 to U-20. In 2004 he led his school as unbeaten triple champions in 2004. He first represented Sri Lanka in 2000. That year he toured for the first time with Sri Lanka National U16 team for the Junior Rugby Asiad. While still at school, in 2003 he was called up by SLRFU to be on the starting lineup in the match against touring Hong Kong at Nittawela. In 2004 he started his club rugby with Kandy SC in their second round match against Havelock SC at Nittawela. The same season he played in the Clifford cup knockouts. He led his club, which gave him all the needed backing in two different years to win the league and knockouts in 2010 and 2015. He is hoping to play another inter club season. Fazil has won numerous rugby awards for his excellence in the field. In 2007 and 2009, he became the Most Outstanding Player of the Year, in 2009 he was also recognised as the ‘Best Three Quarter’, in 2011 he became the ‘Best Ruggerite of the Year’ and in 2012 he became ‘Best Fly Half of the Year’.
Peradeniya Univesity to field a strong side

The tournament will be a 50-over affair. The 12 teams will be divided into four groups; the top two teams of each group will play in the knockouts.
DM Dharmathilake trophy

Antonian-Kingswood rugby clash
St. Anthony's who beat Vidyartha in their first “Plate” championship game last week will scrum down with Kingswood today at the Bogambara Stadium at 4.30 pm.
The Kingwoodians who went down to their rivals Dharmaraja in their last outing have effected key changes in their starting line for this clash, which has the ingredients of turning out to being a thriller. The Antonians are well in form after their last win and should play out their open brand of rugby. Kingswood too will be addressing themselves to the game with equal determination.
Rajans have edge over Vidyartha
The confrontation between the high riding Dharmaraja and Vidyartha ruggerites at Nittawela on Sunday points out to be a battle between the Rajans three-quarters and Vidyartha forwards. Rajans who are playing well, will depend heavily on their backs to deliver the goods, they are the ones who have paved the way for their last win against Kingswood.
Vidyartha are with a very young side, and in most of the matches they have done their best in the first four minutes, but in the second forty minutes have failed to keep it going. In this game their forwards will have a big say in their play.
Ex-cricketer Thilina is PC sports minister
Cricketer-turned-politician Thilina Tennakoon on Tuesday was appointed as minister in which sports is included by President Maithripala Sirisena. Central Province was badly in need of a sports minister who can give a hand to promote sports.
Thilina played cricket for Dharmaraja College and later for BRC and was one time KDCA and CPCA president. He is the son of sports promoter late Yasaratne Tennakoon and son in law of sportsman and promoter late Shelton Ranaraja who were both ministers.
CPRFU AGM
The Central Province Rugby Football Union is the governing body for rugby in Central Province which is headed by well-known rugby player and promoter Iswan Omar.
The AGM is to be held end of this month and Omar is likely to retain his position as president. The CPRFU was established in 1992 in accordance with the SLRFU guidelines and constitution. At its peak in 2002 the CPRFU included top clubs Kandy SC, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya Maskeliya CC, Peradeniya University, OTSC and Kandy Youth SC, all of whom have at one time or another competed in the ‘A’ Division competition. Today only Kandy SC is alive.
The CPRFU also embarked in forming ‘B’ division clubs, which included Katugastota RFC, Polgolla RFC, Mawilmada RFC, Matale RFC, Nuwara Eliya RFC and Pilimatalawa RFC and by 2008 had 18 clubs playing in the up-country rugby league. At the time late Maurice Perera was the president and the present president was the secretary.
During that time 52 schools engaged in rugby apart from the Schools Association schools teams Trinity, Kingswood, St. Anthony’s, Dharmaraja, St Sylvester’s and Vidyartha.
