UNP fears General Elections: Ranatunge

Gampaha District SLPP Leader and Joint Opposition Group convenor Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunge said he would challenge the UNP and the JVP to withdraw their petitions before the Supreme Court if they did not fear to face a General Election.
He said today, the vast majority of people are demanding a General Election wanting to elect Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister with a two thirds majority in Parliament.
Ranatunge was addressing a meeting of the Minuwangoda electorate SLPP Central Organisation at the Udugampola Reggie Ranatunge Memorial Hall on November 17.
Prasanna Ranatunge said, “The political environment today is much different to the environment which existed when we first planned to convene this meeting. From the day Mahinda Rajapaksa lost the last Presidential election, people craved to bring him back to power again. We took to the streets on his behalf and led demonstrations and protest campaigns.
“It was the people of Minuwangoda who requested to shun portfolios and stand by Mahinda Rajapaksa at all times. I have kept that promise without wavering.”
Ranatunge said the convincing victory gained by the SLPP at the local government election gave the confidence that Mahinda Rajapaksa derive strength for his future victories.
Ranatunge said when the President highlighted the Central Bank fraud and the misdeeds of certain UNP Ministers, the understanding between the President and the UNP fell apart. Then an alleged plot to assassinate the President and the former Defence Secretary came to light with certain UNP names also being mentioned.
The subsequent political instability forced the President to appoint a person who had his confidence as Prime Minister. Since both Karu Jayasuriya and Sajith Premadasa declined the offer, he requested Mahinda Rajapaksa to accept the post as the Joint Opposition led by him was the main force within Parliament.
Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted the Prime Minister’s post to settle urgent problems confronting the country, provide relief to the people and conduct a General Election as soon as possible.
He said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should be held responsible for the present crisis in the Legislature, Ranatunge said.
JVP was acting like a pawn in the hands of the UNP. The JVP should be ashamed to co-operate with the UNP which murdered Rohana Wijeveera in cold blood and burnt his body.
