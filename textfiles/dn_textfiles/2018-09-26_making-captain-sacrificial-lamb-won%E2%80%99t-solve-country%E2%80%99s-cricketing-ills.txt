Making captain the sacrificial lamb won’t solve country’s cricketing ills

When the country’s cricket has fallen to its lowest depth as it has today somebody has to be thrown to the crocodiles and unfortunately and very unfairly it has been the captain of the side Angelo Mathews when the national selectors which includes the head coach who are facing the wrath of the public are getting away scot free.
Mathews is the sacrificial lamb in covering up of the real weaknesses in the system - lack of a proper administration in place and the national selection committee.
As Mathews says quite rightly in his letter that he has been made a scapegoat for Sri Lanka’s early exit from the Asia Cup.
To quote Mathews: “Though I was initially surprised, it was immediately felt that I have been made the scapegoat in this entire saga of Sri Lanka’s dismal performances against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. I’m willing to take part of the blame but at the same time, feel betrayed and let down if the blame is solely put on me. As you know all decisions are taken through a mutual understanding with the Selectors and the Head Coach. And though I do not agree with the reasoning that the losses should be accrued single handed to the Captaincy, I however eagerly and wholeheartedly respect the request of the selection committee and the head coach in asking me to step down and do so with immediate effect.”
Chief selector Graeme Labrooy had made a statement to a Sunday newspaper where he very clearly states that the selectors had long discussions with the captain and the head coach and it was from their line of thinking that they agreed to the 16 which they believed was the best to win the Asia Cup. Without saying it in so many words what the chief selector was saying is that they picked the 16 which the head coach wanted.
Therein lies the problem of all what is happening today. Head coach Chandika Hathurusingha by taking over selections has created an untenable situation for himself similar to what happened to him with the Bangladesh side. He has recreated the situation where any which way you look at it the players are now revolting against the coach. By making the captain as the scapegoat these weaknesses are not going to disappear.
As a selection committee you don’t call the captain and tell him to resign. If you are not happy with his performance you sack him.
Now that Mathews’ letter has become public in all fairness to the captain he has pointed out that the entire blame should not be pinned on him. That alone shows that he is not in agreement with the selectors on their decision.
In the first instance Mathews should never have been appointed captain after he resigned from the ODI series against Zimbabwe in July 2017.
But as he states in his letter: “Thereafter, pursuant to Sri Lanka suffering heavy defeats in all formats and having several appointed Captains, namely Upul Tharanga, Thisara Perera, Chamara Kapugedara, Lasith Malinga and Dinesh Chandimal during the tenure between July 2017 and December 2017 in the ODI and T20 formats, Mr Chandika Hathurusingha immediately having been appointed as Head coach met with me in person, requested me to reconsider taking up the Captaincy until the World Cup in 2019. Though myself, my family and close friends discouraged me in taking up the mantle, being confident in Hathurusingha and his plans to elevate the performances of the Sri Lankan team and in the best interest of my country I agreed to do so until the World Cup.”
Now it seems the faith in which Mathews had with the head coach who is also a selector has disappeared after the coach had sold him down the river.
The selection committee has to take full blame for appointing Mathews first of all as captain knowing well that he was half fit and that he was unable to bowl in the shorter format. They took a big gamble by appointing him and look what’s happened.
Former captain Kumar Sangakkara also put his neck on the line by backing Hathurusingha and saying that Mathews is the key to Sri Lanka’s World Cup hopes in the ICC website. What has the legend got to say now?
In all fairness ex-players have no business to comment on selections it’s unethical because you have a selection committee. If you don’t agree with their policies objectively criticise them but you don’t go around saying so and so must be the captain and so on and so forth. They are the ones who have created this situation with ex-SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala gullible enough to believe them.
All the wounds that Sri Lanka are facing today have become very objective ones and goes back to the sacking of the Kapila Wijegunawardene selection committee in March 2016. The moment the Sumathipala administration did that everybody lost faith in the whole system.
The Wijegunawardene selection committee had the temerity to appoint Dinesh Chandimal as the one-day captain for the World T20 – a decision that was squashed by the Sumathipala administration by having that committee sacked and replaced by an adhoc selection committee headed by Aravinda de Silva and comprising Sangakkara, Kaluwitharana and Kaluperuma.
The Wijegunawardene committee appointed Chandimal because Lasith Malinga was unfit and so was Mathews. One of the biggest problems the head coach at the time Graham Ford had was that he had three captains during the Asia Cup. So to overcome that crisis Chandimal being the fittest was appointed captain. What happened was the De Silva committee came in and threw out the recommendation and gave the captaincy to Mathews and included Malinga who was not fit. They also brought in Lahiru Thirimanne and Suranga Lakmal who was not even in the nominated 25 squad in place of poor Niroshan Dickwella and Jeffrey Vandersay who were on their way to the airport when they were informed that they were not part of the squad.
When you behave in an unfair way even the gods have reason to punish you.
What we see today are the results of the wrong decisions taken.
