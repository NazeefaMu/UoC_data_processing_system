Army Construction Contingent returns from Mali

A total of 53 Other Rankers of the Corps of Engineer Services (CES) of the Sri Lanka Army completing their six-month long tenure of service at the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) who left for the construction of the preliminary structural work, returned home early Tuesday morning.
The welcome ceremony organized by the Army took place at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) premises, headed by Major General Jagath Ratnayake, Colonel Commandant, CES, together with Colonel Rathnasiri Ganegoda, Centre Commandant, CES and senior Officers.
The CES contingent of the Army who initially left for Mali completed the establishment of accommodation, sanitary facilities, stores and other requirements to facilitate the incoming Combat Convoy Company (CCC) of the Sri Lankan Army in December.
The contingent of the 200-member CCC of the Sri Lanka Army is set to leave for Mali for another UN Peace Keeping Mission. Mali is a landlocked West African country, marred by ethnic tensions.
The latest Sri Lankan contingent would leave for Mali under specified categories in groups, considering prioritized requirements in Mali.
The first CCC of the Army for UN Peace Enforcing Mission under the Chapter 7 of the UN Charter as scheduled leaves the island for Mali at the end of December for a period of one year.
The CCC of the Sri Lanka Army including 16 Officers and 184 Other Rankers, comprising 10 Regiments of the Army is commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupure.
The formal military parade of the Mali-bound CCC of the Sri Lanka Army was held recently at the Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI) Headquarters parade ground in Panagoda, led by Major General Amal Karunasekara, Colonel of the Regiment, SLLI.
