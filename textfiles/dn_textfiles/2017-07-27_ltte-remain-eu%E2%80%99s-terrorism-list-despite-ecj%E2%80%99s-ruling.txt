LTTE to remain on EU’s terrorism list despite ECJ’s ruling

The European Union (EU) has taken note of the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ’s) judgement annulling measures against the LTTE, namely the designation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and the freezing of LTTE funds.
The judgment is a legal ruling of the European Court of Justice on the procedure used for listing the LTTE. It does not involve any assessment by the Court of the substantive reasons for the designation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation.
The annulled measures cover the period 2011-2015. Designations of the LTTE adopted by the Council later in 2015-2017 are not covered by the present ruling. This means that the LTTE remains listed as a terrorist organisation by the EU, an official statement said.
EU institutions systematically review their practices following rulings of the European Court of Justice. The current ruling will be carefully analysed. Any necessary remedial action will be taken to adjust the listings to these procedural requirements and to ensure legally robust designations.
In summary, the European Union continues to consider the LTTE as a terrorist organisation and the EU’s restrictive measures against the LTTE remain in force.
