CanHOPE Avurudu at Apeksha

CanHOPE Colombo organized Sinhala and Tamil New year celebrations at the Pediatric Section of Apeksha Hospital, Maharagama recently.
The celebrations stetted up a canopy of fun with a Magic Show and a collection of games.
Each game was carefully planned out so that children would enjoy with lots of fun, while taking care of their safety first. The children were filled with exceptional energy to see the wonder of the magician and to take part in the games. The games included the musical chairs for the children and for the mothers, eye on the elephant, throw the hoop to the corn and throwing of the dice.
With enthusiasm, the children bravely raced in to each of the games, laughing and cheering the others as each game was conducted. There was also musical session by the group SHESH to entertain the children with cheerful acoustic music as each child was given a New Year gift by CanHOPE Colombo.
