England to host India in 2018 Test series

LONDON: England will host India in a five-match Test series in 2018, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Tuesday.
The teams will play three Twenty20 matches in July, followed by three one-day internationals and then Tests at Edgbaston, Lord's, Trent Bridge, the Rose Bowl and The Oval.
England's schedule for the year also includes meetings with Pakistan, Australia and Scotland.
“A five-Test series against India is at the heart of next summer's international programme,” said ECB chief executive officer Tom Harrison in a press release.
“This is always a much-anticipated contest which attracts a huge following across the globe for the five-day game.
“Test match cricket has a strong, consistent and passionate following across England and Wales and the seven summer Tests, starting with the Pakistan matches, are sure to attract good crowds.
“Alongside these, England's white-ball contests against India, Australia and Scotland will give a fascinating guide to form ahead of the ICC Cricket World Cup, to be staged here in 2019.” It will be only the second time India, the world's number one Test side, play a five-Test series in England since 1959.
England's summer will begin in May with two Tests against Pakistan at Lord's and Headingley.
They have a one-off one-day game against Scotland in Edinburgh on June 10, followed by five one-day internationals and a T20 match against Australia later that month.
