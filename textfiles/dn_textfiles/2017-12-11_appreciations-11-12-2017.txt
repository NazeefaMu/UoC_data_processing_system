[APPRECIATIONS - (11-12-2017)]

Dr. P.R. Anthonis
He was a liberal intellectual
The professional colossus, Dr. P.R. Anthonis, passed away peacefully on the morning of December 17, 2009, at the age of 98 years.
Born on the January 21, 1911, as the second child of a family of 16 children, Polwatearachchige Romiel Anthonis learned the Sinhala alphabet at the age of six yeas under the tutelage of Ven. Vajiragnana Thera at the Dharmasalawa, Bambalapitiya (presently Vijiraramaya). A year later, he entered the Milagiriya Sinhalese School, which is presently non-existent, where he studied up to the 4th standard. At the age of 10 years, he was admitted to St. Joseph’s College South, Bambalapitiya, as St. Peter’s College was known then. The brilliant student he was, he ended up carrying away almost all class prizes at the annual prize giving of St. Peter’s College; during the following years, which included General Proficiency, Latin, French, and Mathematics.
Romiel Anthonis entered the University College to do the pre-medicals, coming first in the batch, a feat that was amazing considering the fact that he had not studied Physics and Zoology before. He entered the Medial Faculty in Colombo in 1930, the only medical school in the country where too, he was always on top of the batch and carried away the Loos Gold Medal for Pathology. The Mathew Gold Medal for Forensic Medicine, the Rockwood Gold Medal for Surgery, and the Government Diploma Medal. He passed as a doctor in 1936 and took up appointment as a medical officer in government service.
Dr. Anthonis was awarded a scholarship to study surgery in the UK in 1937, but the Second World War prevented him from proceeding to UK. However, eight years later in 1945, he went to the UK. Dr. Anthonis was the first to be successful in the FRCS Primary and Final Examinations in the first sitting, thereby, not only creating a record at the Royal College of Surgeons of the UK, but also becoming the youngest Fellow of the College. He was also the first non-university officer to be appointed by the Royal College of Surgeons of the UK as the Examiner to Primary FRCS, FDS, and FFA examinations. Turning down a lucrative job in England, he returned to Sri Lanka in 1947 and was appointed Consultant Surgeon to the present National Hospital.
Since then, until his retirement from the public service in 1971, this healing angel saved he lives of thousands of people, working from the early hours of the morning, going up to the late hours of the night. After retirement from public service, he took to private practice. He had a clientele who had immense faith in his healing prowess. He has never refused to see a patient in distress.
Dr. Anthonis has been the Chairman of the Medical Council, the watch-dog of ethics and standards in the medical profession, the Founder President of the College of Surgeons, President of the Sri Lanka Medical Association, and has also been the Editor of the Ceylon Medical Journal. So much was his service to the medical community.
As a Trade Unionist, being the President of the Medical Specialists Association, he led a strike of Medical Specialists against the government’s decision to abolish private practice in respect of doctors as from August 1, 1974. The strike, which was launched on February 1, 1964, had the support of the Government Medical Officers’ Association. The doctors, under the leadership of Dr. Anthonis, won the day. Incidentally, private practice is still to be abolished.
The busy professional was a member of the Board of Governors of the YMBA, a member of the Board of Trustees of Vajiraramaya, and the Most Senior Trustee of the Bandaranayake Memorial International Conference Hall. He was the Chancellor of the University of Colombo for 21 and a half years from 1981 to 2003. In fact, the School of Computing of the Colombo University, owes its existence to the efforts of Dr. Anthonis. He was actively interested in student and staff welfare of the University and was a loved figure among the University students and staff. He was the Founder President of the Japan International Cooperation Agency Alumni Association of Sri Lanka and was its unanimously elected President for 37 years—a post he held until his demise. He was also the Chairman of the Sasakawa Memorial Sri Lanka Japan Cultural Centre, Vice Patron of the Lanka Japan Friendship Society, and Vice Patron of Colombo Plan International Society.
Dr. P.R. Anthonis was awarded the prestigious Order of the Sacred Treasure of Japan in 1981 by the Japanese government, in recognition of the invaluable services rendered by him in promoting the Sri Lanka-Japan cultural and friendly ties, and his links with Japan were deeply rooted.
Dr. Anthonis was bestowed the highest national honour, Deshamanya, in 1986 and has also been honoured with the Viswa Parasadini award as well. The medical profession extended him with the honour Pride of the Medical Profession, the only professional to be honoured. Dr. Anthonis treasured a plaque presented to him by medical students with the wording “A Healer, a Teacher, a Mentor, an inspiration over generations, bridging the years with service and commitment. We salute you over the years,” which speaks of the high-esteem with which he was held.
The surgical skill of Dr. Anthonis is amply demonstrated by a tribute paid to him by an internationally renowned counterpart. A businessman who had seriously injured his leg and who had been cured through surgery here, decided to take his case history to one of the most renowned surgeons in the Hadassah Medical Institute in Israel, famous world over for its medical advancement. The renowned surgeon examined the leg, studied the case history with utmost care and said “You shouldn’t be having this leg. Only a brilliant piece of surgery has saved it. Who preformed the surgical miracle on you?” The businessman had answered, “Dr. P.R. Anthonis.” The renowned surgeon added, “I am not surprised. It would have taken a man of Dr. Anthonis’ skill to save the leg. We have heard of his capabilities over here too.”
The simplicity and devotion to his work are found in a poem written by late eminent lawyer E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy, in tribute to this great human being.
Let’s salute this son of our soil
Who does his work and continues his toil
Sans vulgar pomp and needless empty sound
But achieves more than all men around
To achieve fame and honour is rare. To possess a personality uninfluenced by fame and success in unique. And that was Dr. Anthonis, the Everest among professionals.
By his demise, the country lost a liberal intellectual, a great humanist, and a citizen committed to public service. He was a good leader and gentleman par excellence The vacuum crated by his death cannot be easily filled.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

W. D. Amaradeva
Sri Lanka’s musical genius
Our country’s gift to the world of music. - Lester James Peiris.
Gone! One year ago—the Nightingale of Sri Lanka, born and bred in Koralawella, Moratuwa, leaving behind his melodious voice and rhythmic actions.
Koralawella, although considered somewhat a backward village, is really not so. While the old Galle Road went through Koralawella with a crossing at Modara to Panadura, it was later diverted at Digarolla through Horetuduwa and Gorakana. Some of the finest mansions still remain on the Koralawella Road. One in particular is the Melville, now a Home for Elders, a “palace” referred to as Built in Vanity, Given to Charity.
Koralawella has produced many distinguished persons such as former Talawakelle State Council Member P. de Mel, former Moratuwa MP Merryl Fernando, Public Works former Director M. R. Fernando, Road Development Authority former Chairman B. M. de Soysa, Steel Corporation former Chairman Prof. P. A. de Silva, Ports Authority Managing Director and later RDA Chairman Sarath Fonseka (apologies to those missed) and to crown them all, W. D. Amaradeva. The news of Amaradeva receiving this honour overcame my own joy of getting the honour of Vidya Nidhi.
He was my sunday school-mate and later, my schoolmate at Sri Sumangala College, Panadura. Albert Perera and his brother Arthur were close friends of our family. I remember when the Waagwardana Society of Koralawella decided to have a concert, they selected Albert Perera and Chithrasena—two teenagers whom they picked for a duet—Albert on the violin and Chithrasena on the tubla. This would have been the first public performance of Amaradeva—then teenage schoolboy Albert.
Unfortunately, Chithrasena passed away shortly after due to typhoid.
Practices for this concert were done at our home, Sirinimal, at Mahavidana Lane, Koralawella and I remember asking Albert to teach me the violin. He agreed and showed me how, starting with sa-ri-ga-ma, and then sasa-riri-gaga-mama and that was all I could eschew. Later on, I wondered whether, professionally, I would not have done better if I had followed my good friend Albert and stuck to music rather than engineering!
Albert Perera was in the Town Branch of Sri Sumangala College, whereas myself and two others from Koralawella were in Nalluruwa. There was a weekly singing class led by Ananda Samarakoon during afternoons after school, and we used to attend this. I mentioned this to Albert and dragged him along to the singing class and that is where he first met Ananda Samarakoon. I prompted that Albert plays the violin. My good friend Tennyson Rodrigo lent his violin to Albert and he played it masterly that it astonished Ananda Samarakoon and others present.
Up to now, whenever we stand up to sing the National Anthem, my thoughts go back to that singing class where Ananda Samarakoon wrote the words on the blackboard and taught us to sing Namo, Namo, Maatha.
To return home after school, there was no train from Panadura to Egoda Uyana until 4 o’clock. So sometimes, seven or eight of us get into a fit and decide to walk. Never mind the hot sun, under the shade of coconut palms, we trudged along, joking all the way, and one by one fell off at their homes and the last to be left were Albert and I. When Albert also dropped off, I used to recall John Still’s essay Villager Goes to Town and trudge the last half mile home. As I entered home I, could hear the train pass and get a thorough reprimand from my mother.
Albert developed his musical talents in India and other places and later, won top awards.
One day, during an evening function at the Hotel Suise, Kandy, I ran into Amaradeva and family and I invited him home, but he said that he had already booked himself and his troupe at the Hantane University Bungalow and invited us in turn for the evening. The reverberations once again of the Hantane Range that evening still runs in me.
When the Sri Lankan Institution of Engineers was planning the opening ceremony of their 100th Anniversary, I suggested that Amaradeva be invited and there he was, singing the opening song in the introductory ballet.
Moratuwa should be proud of them and quite rightly, the Moratuwa Municipal Council has named the Moratuwa - Modara road going through Koralawella as W. D. Amaradeva Mawatha.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana, and on his way to Nirvana, may he be born over and over again in Sri Lanka.
Lloyd Perera, Koralawella, Moratuwa.
Nagalingam Ratnasabapathy
A jewel of a son
It has been seven years, on July 31, this year, since the demise of Nagalingam Ratnasabapathy of uptown, Louis Peiris Mawatha, Kandy, who was also known as Sri Lanka Sigamani.
He passed away on July 31, 2010 after a brief illness at the mortal dotage of 81 years.
On July 31, this year, he was remembered by his youngest sibling, son Ratnasabapathy Mohan and family, at their chateau home in Louis Peiris Mawatha, Kandy and thereafter, at their business establishment, Nagalingams Jewellers at No. 101, Colombo street, Kandy.
The memorial services were held alternately at both places.
Late Ratnasabapathy was well-known as an ethnic promoter. He was a jewel of a son.
His son Ratnasabapathy Mohan, a distinguished old boy of Trinity College, Kandy, who runs the business-house after the demise of his beloved pater, from time to time and around the year, donates materials, tomes, and books to needy children in memory of his late pater.
He moved closely with vital religious affairs of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, Kandy, though born a Hindu.
This is evident by the replica of the sacred Tooth Relic that is presently placed on the office table at his business-house.
In this appreciation, I wish to emphasise that the late Nagalingam Ratnasabapathy was born and bred in Point Pedro in the Jaffna Peninsula and was schooled at the famous soccer school, Hartley College, Pt. Pedro. He migrated to Kandy after his school career at the request of his father.
Adding some lurid details to this appreciation, that Hartleyan school boy, Nagalingam Ratnasabapathy, earned a name as a soccer player at his school and later, for club soccer in Jaffna and Pt. Pedro. He distinguished himself in soccer as a mid-fielder and later, in the full-back position.
Our sympathies go out to his four sons and their families.
May he attain Ama Maha Nivana, the Greatest Blissful Nirvana!

Vijaya Dahanayake
Gentlman politician
Vijaya, as we all knew him in school, was born with poor eyesight, but he never showed any hesitation in meeting, chatting or behaving like one who had such a disability.
He never in his wildest dreams thought of being a politician. Perhaps his close association with his uncle, W. Dahanayake, one-time Prime Minister, and being his private secretary and the influence he had on him, made him embrace politics in the local region, not seeking parliamentary positions.
I often used to meet him at his residence whenever I visited Galle, and when he was the Mayor, when he used to travel with his wife overseas. He always had a vision to improve Galle and not his ego. He enjoyed his family life, and the closeness he had with his father, mother, and two brothers, Saranaguptha and Prakrana, certainly had some influence on his compassionate nature.
His father and mother were excellent examples of parents. I remember whilst in school, whenever we visited Vijaya and his cousin Ranjith (who later was my Police colleague), Vijay’s mother always ensured that we had a biscuit and a cup of tea. Vijaya certainly lived up to their expectations, maintaining principles with a great sense of compassion, love, and care, tempered with high degrees of honesty and integrity, and never forgot his friends when they were in dire need.
For him, his family and outsiders in need, were equal. Vijaya acquired his parents’ characters and habits. Life is full of decisions, some minor and some, life-changing, but tragically many people are the victims of their own decisions, faced with choices every day. They turn their back on what is right or what is best and decide on what is wrong, which result in bad consequences. But Vijaya, in his own imitable style, thought wisely, discussed with others, and made decisions. Probably that is why he decided to end his political career as the Mayor of Galle and not seek parliamentary elections. He, his wife, and brothers were always content and happy and he believed in the saying Happiness is the byproduct of something greater, not an end to itself. Happiness cannot be pursued and caught any more than one can pursue.
He practiced that anger must be overcome with gentleness, evil with goodness, a miser with generosity and the liar with truth. Vijaya was an avid reader while in school, but never gave up general knowledge, listening to world views and seeking the assistance of others to read to him history and world news from books, magazines, journals, and newspapers, due to his poor eyesight.
He was certainly up to date with local and foreign current events and never behind current events. He was always keen to learn more about world affairs, history, and general knowledge. It was certainly enjoyable speaking to him as he spoke fluently in English on various topics, with his authentic information and knowledge, which gave him a sound foundation. The late K. Dahanayake was his mentor. Vijaya was a gentleman politician who never cared about amassing wealth. A gentleman who was always content with what he had, he never complained about his inadequacies or illnesses. But he had wealth of knowledge and was affectionate and sincere to his friends and family.
To us as schoolmates and friends, Vijaya is in our thoughts till we leave this world.
