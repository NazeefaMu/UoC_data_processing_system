Horana tyre factory on course

The controversial Horana Tyre factory would go ahead as planned, according to Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Finance Minister addressing a media briefing at the Finance Ministry yesterday, said the factory was not closed but the issues surrounding the granting of land was being resolved by Development Strategies and International Trade Minster Malik Samarawickrema.
Nandana Lokuwithana, the businessman behind the factory, promised an investment of US$ 75 million for it and the government earlier granted him 100 acres of land on a 99-year lease for an annual rent of just Rs 100 an acre. When the deal was made public, President Sirisena issued an order to suspend the project and Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has insisted that the President suspended the project because Lokuwithana was a close ally of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and was allegedly involved in various scandals, the minister said.
Karunanayake however quipped that the project was not suspended and that the fact that the businessman had dealings with the previous regime, was not a reason to not do business with him now,
“There is no law which states that just because you deal with one government, you cannot deal with the next. They are all investments,” the minister said.
