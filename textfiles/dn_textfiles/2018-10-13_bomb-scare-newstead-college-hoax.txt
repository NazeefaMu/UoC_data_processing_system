Bomb scare at Newstead College, a hoax

A tense situation was reported at Newstead Girls’ College in Negombo last morning with a bomb scare after a telephone call received by the Principal.
The incident took place around 8.00 am and the school authorities had immediately assembled all students to the school playground and informed the police.
The Police Crime Division along with the Army, STF and the Bomb Disposal Unit conducted a search operation with sniffing dogs by 8.30 am.
However the call turned out to be a hoax with nothing harmful found in the six-hour long operation.
The police and school authorities believe that this might have been done to disrupt the prize awarding ceremony to be held yesterday.
However, the scheduled ceremony was held at the school later in the evening.
