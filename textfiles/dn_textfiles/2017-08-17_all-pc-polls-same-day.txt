All PC Polls on same day

CABINET GRANTS APPROVAL :
Cabinet approval was given to hold all Provincial Council elections on the same day, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Jayasekara said the objective was not to delay elections but to hold it on the same day. He said it is a waste of money to hold elections on different dates and added that changing the electoral system was a promise given to the people.
Jayasekara said it was a long process and still there is time to decide on it and added that the decision can be challenged in court if there are objections. Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne said even if the elections were delayed it will be delayed only for six to seven months but in future Provincial Council elections will be held under a proper system. “Not only United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) but all parties including Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) wanted a new constitution and finally it is only former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who is standing on the opposite side of the fence”, he said.
