Programmed to exist

Let me put some crucial thoughts down. Some of the noblest beings have done this in the past. What is the purpose of our lives Has it been pre-determined Or have we been set down upon this earth already programmed Or are we part of the vast evolutionary processes described by Charles Darwin
Where does God come in What about different religious perspectives, belief, disbelief and miracles How do they enlighten us What is the meaning of this wondrous existence I despair even before I begin to find the answers.
Unlike philosophers or religionists trying to find answers to universal problems, I merely wish to understand for myself. Is there rebirth Or do we go through one lifetime, given the one single chance in life to make or break it. Why was I born a Muslim Was it by choice, or that this profound experience will resolve things for me.
To my understanding, there is nothing that can explain and resolve the inequities in this world- the suffering that humans have undergone in the past, the existence of animals and creatures lower down the evolutionary scale. Why is there such an endless detour to eventual happiness
As a Muslim I am given to know that God knows all things and we with our puny understanding are all but ignorant. As the Sufis (spiritual masters) have reached the pinnacle of spirituality will tell us, it is the final absorption in God, in the Divine through first an entry into states of bliss and into a heaven that will be the ultimate revelation.
Prophets sent down to earth by God have brought revelations as guidance for humanity and revelations sent down to Prophet Muhammad, setting a seal upon all the earlier revelations and perfecting them.
Is this then the solution that has been and is available to the billions of beings which offers salvation to them all
The Sufis tell us that it is Love at its loftiest heights, Love that infuses all things that surely is the finale to such a grandiose play which describes our sojourn on earth. How long does it take finally - an eternity or many eternities
