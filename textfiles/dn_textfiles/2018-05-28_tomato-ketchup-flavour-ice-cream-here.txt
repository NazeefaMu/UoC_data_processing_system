Tomato ketchup flavour ice cream is here!

An ice cream parlour in Ireland has created a ketchup flavour ice cream and we’re just not sure how to feel.
Gelati artisan ice cream shop has branches in Enniscrone and Ballina, and decided to make the savoury scoop in honour of Ed Sheeran. The singer has a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup tattooed on him, he loves the stuff that much, and Gelati even gave away free ketchup cones for anyone who attended one of his recent Irish dates.
The freaky flavour went viral after someone posted a video of it on Twitter.The ice cream is topped with a drizzle of Heinz tomato sauce – and thank God it’s made with the real deal and not a cheap, vinegary imitation. Imagine. You can get it in a cone or a pot. The savoury flavour has been receiving mixed reviews on social media, and when we say ‘mixed’ we mean ‘negative’.
If you want to get your lips around some Heinz tomato ketchup flavour ice cream, get yourself to over to Gelati in Ireland. Metro
