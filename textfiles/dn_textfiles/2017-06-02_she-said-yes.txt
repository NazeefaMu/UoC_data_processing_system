She Said Yes

When you have a crush, they say, it’s always best to crush the crush. But not if you happen to be Katie Holmes. A year after she had left her role as Joey Potter on Dawson’s Creek, when she said in an interview with Seventeen magazine, “I think every little girl dreams about her wedding, I used to think I was going to marry Tom Cruise,” her message reached its target. Two years later her crush became her husband.
The Dawson’s Creek star, 37, and Mission Impossible hunk, 54, tied the knot on November 18, 2006, in a lavish Italian wedding. Inside Italy’s 15th-century Odescalchi Castle known as Bracciano, the couple shared their vows before a star-studded guest list that included the likes of Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, John Travolta, David Beckham and Victoria Beckham, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez as well as Cruise’s older kids - Isabella and Connor and ex-wife Nicole Kidman.
The event that led to the wedding had as much drama as one of Cruise’s movies. Especially when Cruise appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and declared his love for Holmes and went on to punch the floor, grab Winfrey’s hands and, most memorably, jump on her couch with joy. (The appearance instantly became infamous, known as Cruise’s “couch jumping” episode). This was followed by the announcement of their engagement, just shy of eight weeks from having first met. Cruise proposed to Holmes in Paris at the Eiffel Tower at a restaurant on the Tower’s second floor. He did not go down on one knee, but he presented her with a ring reportedly containing a five-carat yellow diamond. She said yes.
Their wedding reportedly cost a cool $3 million. Not to mention, Holmes wore two custom gowns by Giorgio Armani - including one strapless lace dress that was covered with thousands of Swarovski crystals that reportedly took 350 hours to place. Armani also designed the entire wedding party’s ensemble, including Tom’s wedding tux, and the bridesmaids’ and groomsmen’s apparel.
The wedding ceremony itself was short and sweet, lasting only 15 minutes. The real fireworks were outside, where a magnificent fireworks display erupted over the castle. Inside, guests dined on four courses, including sea bass and steak, before enjoying a five-tier white chocolate wedding cake. They were serenaded by famed Italian opera superstar Andrea Bocelli, and Tom Cruise himself sang The Righteous Brothers’ “You’ve Lost That Loving Feeling.” It was a strange choice for a wedding serenade, even if it was a scene from Top Gun.
Called the celebrity wedding of the year, if not the decade, with a price tag that grand, Tom and Katie’s wedding cemented itself in celebrity bridal history. From the cream of the crop Hollywood guest list and double wedding gowns to a dinner serenade by Bocelli, it looked as though no expense was spared on the night Katie Holmes became Mrs. Tom Cruise.
As bizarre as Cruise’s dating tactics may seem, a source who knows the couple said Cruise was “completely in love with Katie.”
Obviously, some crushes should not be crushed.
