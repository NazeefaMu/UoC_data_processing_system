Positive response from President - GMOA

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said President Maithripala Sirisena gave a positive response to their demands during the discussion they had with the President yesterday.
GMOA secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said the President had given them an assurance that the final decision with regard to their demands would be taken after a discussion with the Finance Minister and Finance Ministry officials.
He said the President promised them that the discussion would be held under his patronage between December 10 - 19 before the budget proposals are adopted in Parliament.
Herath said the President responded positively towards their demands to remove the tax on hybrid and electric cars.
