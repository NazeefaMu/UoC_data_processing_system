Beauty of Boredom

It was last weekend when I was chatting with him on Facebook that my friend in Australia told me it’s OK to be bored. When I had told him the argument we were having over the last chapter in ‘Wuthering Heights’ (he thought it was a flop), has to be continued later as my eight-year -old was complaining of being bored and I had to find something for her to do, that he said it. In fact, he said, boredom could even be a good thing.
After suggesting several options to my daughter that would keep her busy, all of which she refused, I let her play a game on my phone and returned to my computer to find out if boredom could really be a good thing.
No sooner than I typed the words on to the search engine I found about 16,600,000 links that presumably said children should be bored.
busy parents
The first article I read was by Dr. Vanesssa Lapointe who in her essay “Why you should do nothing when your child says ‘I’m Bored” asked, “What does your gut do when you hear the two words every parent dreads? “I’m bored.” As if she had been watching the scene in my living room Dr. Lapointe went on to add “Maybe it is because of the incredible guilt that a lot of today’s busy parents carry around with them, or maybe because in the grand scheme it feels like the path of least resistance, but many of us are tempted to respond to those dreaded two words with a running list of options. Best case scenario is the child grabs onto one of your ideas. Worst case, you frustratingly give in to another 30 minutes of screen time just to get them out of your hair.”
She suggests the next time your child says, “I’m bored,” you should just smile at them and say, “I love bored”. Not only might that be incredibly freeing for you, but it also is actually really good for your child’s development. Why? “Children need to sit in their own boredom for the world to become quiet enough that they can hear themselves. It is only when we are surrounded by nothing that something comes alive on the inside,” says Dr. Lapointe.
over-scheduling children
So, if you have been planning to entertain your kids with art school, piano classes, or tennis lessons during the August holidays just around the corner, think again. It is true that these activities fill children’s time and supply much-needed childcare when kids are out of school. But psychologists and child development experts suggest that over-scheduling children during the school holidays is unnecessary and could ultimately keep kids from discovering what truly interests them.
“Your role as a parent is to prepare children to take their place in society. Being an adult means occupying yourself and filling up your leisure time in a way that will make you happy,” says Lyn Fry, a child psychologist in London with a focus on education. “If parents spend all their time filling up their child’s spare time, then the child’s never going to learn to do this for themselves.”
Fry is not the only one to point out the benefits of boredom. Dr. Teresa Belton, visiting fellow at the University of East Anglia with a focus on the connection between boredom and imagination, told the BBC recently that boredom is crucial for developing “internal stimulus,” which then allows true creativity.
Unstructured time
It is said that unstructured time also challenges children to explore their own passions. If we keep them busy with lessons and structured activity, or they “fill” their time with screen entertainment, they never learn to respond to the stirrings of their own hearts, which might lead them to build a playhouse in the back yard, make a monster from clay, write a short story or song, organize themselves into making a drama, or simply study the bugs on the lawn (as Einstein reportedly did for hours). These calls from our heart are what lead us to those passions that make life meaningful, and they are available to us beginning in childhood - but only when children are given free rein to explore and pursue where their interests lead them.
As Nancy H. Blakey said, “It is possible for boredom to deliver us to our best selves, the ones that long for risk and illumination and unspeakable beauty. If we sit still long enough, we may hear the call behind boredom. With practice, we may have the imagination to rise up from the emptiness and answer.”
Try it and you will realize that most children given unstructured time will rise to the occasion (after some minor complaining) and find something interesting to do with it. Experts say kids are always happiest in self-directed play. That’s because play is children’s work. It’s how they work out emotions and experiences they’ve had. Watch any group of children playing (outside, when screens are not an option) and they will organize themselves into an activity of some sort, whether that’s making a dam for a stream made by an open tap, playing “pretend” or seeing who can jump farthest.
While there is a good chance children might mope around for a while and be bored, it’s important to realize that this isn’t wasted time.
“There’s no problem with being bored,” says Fry. “It’s not a sin, is it? I think children need to learn how to be bored in order to motivate themselves to get things done. Being bored is a way to make children self-reliant.”
Value of boredom
This same theory was put forward in 1930 by philosopher Bertrand Russell, who devoted a chapter of his book ‘The Conquest of Happiness’ to the potential value of boredom. Imagination and capacity to cope with boredom must be learned as a child, he wrote: “A child develops best when, like a young plant, he is left undisturbed in the same soil. Too much travel, too much variety of impressions, are not good for the young, and cause them as they grow up to become incapable of enduring fruitful monotony.”
Surely it’s high time we changed our antipathy towards boredom. Boredom is the elixir of creativity and passion. Boredom is the pathway to drive and ambition. Boredom is magical.
Tips to encourage free time
* Leave openings for open-ended unplanned time if possible, at least once a week. If that is not possible, plan for once a month. This could be during a long car ride, a walk, or time at home on a rainy day. Try not to jump in to plan an activity but give your child time to think of what she’d like to do and then join her in that activity.
* Have open-ended materials available for times when boredom might arise. A cupboard at your child’s level filled with art supplies, a bin of recycled cardboard boxes or dress-up materials, or a space outside where your child can dig or plant or create; offer the conditions for creativity to grow from boredom.
* Participate in “Screenbreak”, a week in the school holidays where your family watches no television or other screens for seven days. This gives families an opportunity to see what happens when screens are off for an extended time period.
* There are many expectations on children’s time that are out of our control; but look for the parts you can impact. Look at boredom as an opportunity to try something different which may be beneficial in your child’s life. The next time your child says “I’m bored,” welcome the opportunity. Give open-ended time a try to see what happens. It might be good for you too.
