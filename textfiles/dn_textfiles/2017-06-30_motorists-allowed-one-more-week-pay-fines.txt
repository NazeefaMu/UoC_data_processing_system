Motorists allowed one more week to pay fines

Police yesterday announced a concessionary period of one week to motorists to pay traffic fines due to the ongoing postal strike.
According to Police Spokesman SSP Ruwan Gunasekara, drivers have faced a problem of paying traffic fines to post offices as postal staff has been engaging in trade union action for three days.
“We have decided to grant a concessionary period of one week to the date mentioned before filing cases for finable offences,” he said.
He said that the drivers can pay their fines to the Divisional Secretariats islandwide and the relevant receipts can be submitted to the Police station concerned.
Gunasekera added that additional counters have been opened at Divisional Secretariats to accept payments from the drivers.
