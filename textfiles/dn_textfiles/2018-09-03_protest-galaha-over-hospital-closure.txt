Protest in Galaha over hospital closure

A large group of people held a protest in Galaha town yesterday demanding that authorities re-open the Galaha Hospital which was closed following a tense situation last Tuesday after the death of a child.
The people in Galaha complain that they are inconvenienced by the closure of the hospital as the next nearest government health facility is in Deltota, which is 10 kilometres from Galaha.
Last Tuesday, the Police Special Task Force and riot squads had to be deployed following a tense situation outside the Galaha Hospital. The situation arose following the death of an infant who had been admitted to the hospital for treatment.
An angry mob of close to 2,000 attacked the hospital forcing police to be deployed to provide security to the premises and the staff. The crowd alleged that the one-and-a-half-year-old child died following a delay in administering treatment at the hospital. The parents had then taken the child to the Peradeniya Hospital in a trishaw, but the child died before they reached the hospital. The angry mob had damaged hospital property and several vehicles parked in the premises.
Central Province Health Director Dr. Shanthi Samarasinghe took steps to immediately transfer doctors at the hospital and health authorities and the police have begun investigations. Seven persons allegedly responsible for damaging public property were arrested yesterday.
