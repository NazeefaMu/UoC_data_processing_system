Moves against terror

PREVENTION OF TERRORISM (TEMPORARY) PROVISIONS ACT AND ITS AFTERMATH:
It was ides of July 1979. I saw the Bill for Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions). I felt that its Section 7 was repugnant to the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution as it kept the arrested person in police custody for a period not exceeding seventy-two hours without producing him to the Magistrate.
When a police officer, not below the rank of Superintendent would make an application in writing that such person should be remanded until the conclusion of the trial. The Magistrate was debarred from exercising his judicial discretion. It undermined the ‘Judicial Power of the Court’ that is enshrined under Articles 3 and 4 (c) of the Constitution. Article 3 states inter-alia that ‘sovereignty is in the people and it is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the exercise of fundamental rights too.
Thereupon, I telephoned to then Leader of the Opposition, Amirthalingam and told him that I intended to challenge the Bill. I entertained a fanciful thought that he would be pleased and praise me. To my utter dismay, I was given a severe dressing down.
Birth of PTA
Amirthalingam told me that President, JR Jayewardene had promised to grant several demands of the TULF and my petition in opposition would render negative approach by JR. Though I did not agree to his line of thinking, I told him that several provisions of the Bill violated the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. He admonished me and queried me whether I could claim more knowledge than Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam on the Constitution. I was made to understand that Dr. Neelan Thiruchelvam had approved the Bill in toto and had expressed his satisfaction and none need to entertain obnoxiousness in any one of its provisions.
Then I became aware that Law No.16 of 1978, proscribing the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was originally intended to operate for two years but on the request of Amirthalingam the period was reduced to one year. In the same way Amirthalingam wanted PTA for a period of two years and JR gave him a solemn undertaking to do so.
Kuttimani episode
The provisions of PTA had subsumed the provisions of Penal Code for murder. In or about 1981, Kuttimani was indicted under both provisions before the High Court for murder of a police officer. Upon conviction he was sentenced to death.
After the judgement, Amirthalingam wanted to arrange a date for consultation with V.S.A. Pullenayakam to enable him, Sivasithambaram and Neelan to attend such consultation. I did arrange a date for consultation but refrained from participating. Chandrahasan, Kumaralingam, Perinpanayakam and Navaratnam, Attorneys-at-law participated. Pullenayakam informed me that they did not attend the consultation. I telephoned Amirthalingam to find out why they did not attend. Amirthalingam was lamenting that JR had deceived them and they intended to take up those matters with JR at the next meeting and would get them rectified. However, PTA remained unamended.
JR had also manoeuvred to have the period of operation of PTA for three years and PTA was made a permanent statute by a subsequent amendment. JR, a Machiavellian of all times, gave innumerable promises to Amirthalingam that he would pass legislation or frame regulations to smooth the grievances of the Tamils in the field of education, colonization, employment and of the use of Tamil Language. He honoured his promises in the breach and succeeded in the scheme to destroy the political strength of the TULF among the Tamils but failed to destroy LTTE.
K.W. Devanayakam, Minister of Justice moved the Bill in Parliament on July 18, 1979. The Bill was passed by 129 votes without opposition.
None of the TULF Members ever participated in Parliament. All of them refrained from participating at the debate of the Bill as previously promised to JR.
The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Bill, which came subsequent to PTA, had a provision that ‘bail cannot be granted except with the sanction of the Attorney General’. It was held by the Supreme, that ‘it was a fetter on, and in effect a power of control over, Judicial Power of the Court. The granting of bail is an exercise of judicial power, which can only be controlled or reviewed by a higher court. Such power cannot be given to the Attorney General or a non-judicial body’. The Supreme Court recommended that ‘the said provisions require to be passed by a two-thirds majority and approved by the People at a Referendum or else the amendment should be deleted entirely’. Consequently, the said provision was amended by Parliament to provide for the grant of bail by courts in exceptional circumstances.
If it is construed that granting of bail with the sanction of the Attorney General a fetter on judicial power, does not the act of remanding a person until the conclusion of trial on a written application by a police officer become a fetter on judicial power?
Maithripala Senanayake only opposed
In Parliament Maithripala Senanayake spoke on behalf of the SLFP on the Bill. He proclaimed that ‘relations between the Sinhalese and the Tamils had been allowed to deteriorate very rapidly’ and the PTA would create ‘the solid groundwork for a police state’. He declared that the ‘problems of the Tamils cannot be solved by military action’.
He further said “The directive issued by the President to the Commander of the Armed Forces in Jaffna to eliminate terrorism in all its forms before December 31, 1979 is reminiscent of Adolf Hitler’s directive fixing a deadline for the final solution of the Jewish problem”.
Maithripala Senanayake wanted the ‘operation of the Bill only in the Jaffna District and to remain in operation only for so long as a state of Emergency was in force in that District’.
Today, we witness many suspects in remand for a prolonged period of incarceration under PTA without trial or bail: their fundamental rights being violated without sanction: they are being convicted on confessions obtained by threats, intimidation and torture and they are compelled to fast unto death to accelerate the hearing of their trials.
Amendment to PTA was moved in March 1982: Section 15A (a) of the Amendment Bill empowered the Minister to keep a person in custody of any authority. Chandrahasan wanted to object this amendment and I became the Petitioner though my name was wrongly entered in the record. Court held that the removal of a person from judicial custody and placing him under ministerial custody was an interference with the judicial order and was inconsistent with Article 4 (c) read with Article 3 of the Constitution.
Two international covenants
Sri Lanka has ratified in 1980 the two International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights rendering the Government to act according to the international norms, rules and practices.
PTA is blot on humanity. A reading of the Reports on “Ethnic Conflict and Violence on Sri Lanka” prepared by Professor Virginia A Leary on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists and “Sri Lanka A Mounting Tragedy of Errors” prepared by its Chairman, Paul Seighart have recommended the repeal of and replace of PTA in keeping with International Covenants.
Sri Lanka Government was a co-sponsor with UN and other International Communities to review and repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and replace it with anti-terrorism legislation in line with international best practices.
Joint resolution
Joint Resolution was passed in 2015 but Sri Lankan Government has till the PTA in force. It is earnestly hoped that when Sri Lankan Government would decide to bring the New Act, it would not be worse than PTA in its nature, effect and operation.
