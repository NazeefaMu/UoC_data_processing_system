Pork  pie wedding cake

A couple ditched the traditional wedding cake for a tower of pork pies instead. Rebekah and Kyle Johnson’s wedding took place in Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, on 19 May.
The four-tiered pork pie cake was displayed alongside a more traditional wedding dessert made from 100 cupcakes, after it was won in the #NotTheOnlyWedding campaign, where Pork Farms called for pork pie fans to step forward if they were getting married on the same day as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
22-year-old Rebekah, a buyer for a men’s gift company, said, “I entered a lot of Royal Wedding-themed competitions and when people found out about the pork pie wedding cake they were quite surprised, but they thought it was a good idea. We had already decided to have a tiered cake with 100 cupcakes, so we thought it would be nice to put the two ‘cakes’ alongside each other. The pork pie cake was fantastic. The second layer from the bottom contained caramelised onion and the rest was traditional pork pie. We got married at St Matthew’s Church in Sutton Bridge followed by a reception at the Curlew Centre. Kyle is not a huge fan of pork pies but he did like this one. I’ve loved pork pies since I was a little girl. This one was distributed among our friends and family and people were still eating pork pie for a week after the wedding.”
Kyle, an electrician, added, “It was a great cake.”
The custom-made pork pie wedding cake was created at Pork Farms’ Nottingham bakery by Chef Brian Poulson, who cooked the pie in four different sections, then meticulously crafted pastry decorations. Each tier was made using hot water crust pastry, 100 per cent British pork and topped off with seasoned jelly.
Brian then assembled the pie at the wedding venue just hours before the ceremony.
Pork Farms spokesman Kim Burgess said, “We were delighted to be a small part of Rebekah and Kyle’s celebrations, and we hope that this unique take on the traditional wedding cake will be one of the many special memories for them as they look back on their special day. Special thanks has to go to our wonderful chef Brian Poulson, who worked hard to put everything together and assemble the pie for the couple. We’re delighted with the finished result, and we hope Bex and Kyle were too.”
