Is Brad being sought after by Rihanna?

Could Brad Pitt and Rihanna strike up a romance after his divorce?
According to a new report, Rihanna may be harboring feelings for the 52-year-old actor and as he continues to go through a messy split from wife Angelina Jolie, the singer, 28, is hoping to be a means of support.
“You look at Brad Pitt and it’s like, ‘Damn!’” Rihanna gushes to friends, according to a November 1 report by OK! Magazine.
In addition to her comments about Brad Pitt’s looks, the singer has reportedly gotten herself a life-size portrait of the Fury actor, which sits over her bed. Speaking to friends, Rihanna reportedly says, “There hangs my future husband.”
Rihanna is newly single after splitting from Drake weeks ago following an on-and-off romance with the rapper. As fans will recall, Rihanna and Drake seemed to embark on a full-blown relationship after Drake professed his love for the singer at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, but after getting matching tattoos and being spotted in New York City and Miami, they called it quits.
Meanwhile, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie parted ways in September after a 12-year relationship and two years of marriage. The couple also shares six children together, Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and Vivienne and Knox, 8.
“Now that Angelina Jolie’s kicked [Brad Pitt] to the curb and filed for divorce, RiRi’s romantic fantasies can finally become a reality… She’s wanted to get it on with him for years,” the magazine’s source alleged.
While Brad Pitt and Rihanna may both be single at this point in time, the singer’s friends are reportedly concerned about Pitt’s potential dark side. As fans will likely recall, Pitt was recently targeted by an investigation after he allegedly got physical with his son, Maddox, during a plane ride from France to Los Angeles.
As the magazine’s report noted, Rihanna was the victim of domestic abuse in 2009 when her former boyfriend, Chris Brown, savagely beat her after an awards show in Los Angeles. So, when it comes to claims made against Brad Pitt, her friends are hoping she doesn’t travel down a dangerous path.
While Brad Pitt has only been single for several weeks, Rihanna has reportedly had her eye on the actor for the past few years. According to the magazine, Rihanna has been a shadow lurking in Brad Pitt’s marriage since 2012, when the “Work” singer performed at his Make It Right charity concert in New Orleans.
After the show, Brad Pitt’s wife, Angelina Jolie, reportedly flew into a jealous rage and warned Pitt to “stay away from that woman.” Inquisitr
