Walk for values

“When individuals change, society will change. And when society changes, the whole world will change. The welfare of the individual is bound up with the welfare of society as a whole.”
The society is a pellucid mirror that reflects our values and beliefs and had been the base of human interaction since time immemorial. Just like a mother protects, nurtures and directs the child; so does the society play a massive role in molding man into a valuable citizen.
How can we reform the society? What are the key factors for ‘Unity in diversity’? The only answer to this is through spreading and practising Human Values. The five basic universal values namely: Truth, Right Conduct, Peace, Love and Non Violence are the undercurrent for the flourishing of the society at large; eventually leading to global peace and harmony.
“Walk for values” is a unique attempt designed with the simple intention of transforming these values into action. In this era where chaos and calamities have become predominant, the inculcation of human values has become vital for a peaceful dawn. Walking together in unison creates the thirst to practise these values through which, the dream of uplifting the entire human race would become a reality.
On April 23, the walk will commence at 6.30 am from the Nelum Pokuna premises and reach the ‘Galle Face Green’ via the Galle Road, imprinting footsteps of values along the way. This will approximately consume an hour covering up a gross distance of 4 km. Pledging to practice a value that you can clearly relate to, rising up and walking for that value is certainly going be a lifetime experience!
The registration formalities can be completed online or through social media and do not involve any cost - All we need is your active participation in raising awareness of these great virtues. Come and join hands in spreading noble values across the nation together with the leaders from the government, giant corporate chains, community service organizations, multi faith groups, leading artists and many other inspiring individuals.
We encourage everyone to wear the uniform T-shirt designed with the “Walk for Values” Logo as it promotes the sense of oneness.
However we are flexible in accommodating any other modest attire which will fall in line with preserving the sanctity of this event. For such participants, alternatives such as caps, badges, shawls and scarfs are made available for sale. Please stay connected with us for more updates pertaining to the walk.
You may choose to carry flags and placards with slogans based on the five basic values mentioned above. Please feel free to contact us for any assistance regarding banners you wish to carry during the walk or any other matters.
Let our lives be our message. Let’s all be messengers, spreading love and peace across the world beyond the barriers of language, cast, religion and race. We cordially invite you all to be a part of this delightful experience!
