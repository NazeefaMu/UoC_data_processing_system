Never refused union demands - Transport Minister

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva, while condemning the action taken by Railway trade unions at the expense of railway commuters, yesterday said the Cabinet of Ministers has never refused to grant the demands made by them.
He stressed that the Cabinet of Ministers has discussed this issue extensively and finding a solution to their demands takes time.
He requested the trade union leaders in the department not to indulge in union action in an unfair manner, inconveniencing commuters.
The minister requested trade union leaders to stop their union action as it inconveniences students sitting for the GCE Advanced level examination.
