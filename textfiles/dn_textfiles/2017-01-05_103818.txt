Citizens' Mail

UNPROTECTED RAILWAY CROSSING
It is a surprise to us that there isn’t a protective device at the point of crossing the railway near Mulgampola. As a result, there are possibilities of dangers for the people who frequently pass that way to visit the Keels Food complex situated on the lower road of Kandy. It is shocking to hear that once there occurred an accident at the unprotected railway crossing. Why is the Government heedless of this unsafe crossing while the next point of crossing is fully protected?
Nowadays, the media focuses upon the frequent occurrences of accidents from motor cars and buses as well as trains in various parts of the country. Then why are the authorities not taking preventive measures in order to reduce the rate of such accidents in future. The loss of life due to lack of proper government measures cannot be justified at all. It is the bounden duty of the rulers to protect the precious lives of citizens by taking special care and caution in facilitating the people to live safely and comfortably.
