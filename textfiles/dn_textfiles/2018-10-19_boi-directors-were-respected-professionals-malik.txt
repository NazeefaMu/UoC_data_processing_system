BoI Directors were respected professionals - Malik

Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama categorically rejected some media reports casting aspersions on the conduct of the Board of Directors of the Board of Investment yesterday.
He said that the BoI Directors comprised of highly respected professionals, who functioned with utmost responsibility and integrity.
The Minister added that such misleading media reports would erode investor sentiment at a time when much progress is being achieved by the Board of Investment. The full statement: “Some news reports yesterday and today, quoting Presidential Media sources, casting aspersions on the conduct of the Board of Directors of the Board of Investment are irresponsible and factually incorrect.
I categorically reject these baseless allegations made in those news items. I can state with all confidence that the Board of Directors of the BOI comprised of highly respected professionals, who functioned with utmost responsibility and integrity. The Board comprised of honourable people who sought to bring back professionalism into the institution and guide the country’s investment facilitation and promotion activities. From all reports I have received, the
staff of the institution as well as genuine investors have appreciated their professional conduct. Thanks to the investment policies of the Government and the efforts of the Board, the value of the projects approved in 2018 exceeds US$ 18 Billion. Realized FDI inflows in 2017 was also a record US$ 1.9 Billion. Misleading media reports would erode investor sentiment at a time when much progress is being achieved,”the statement added.
