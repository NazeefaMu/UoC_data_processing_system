Lanka shows no improvement in Corruption Perception Index

 Sri Lanka’s position in the Corruption Perception Index has not improved as per the 2016 data.
The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) ranks countries according to the perceived level of public sector corruption where Sri Lanka is ranked  95th out of 176 counties with a poor score of 36, Electoral Integrity Project Manager of Transparency International Sri Lanka Sashee de Mel said.
Addressing a press briefing at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute in Colombo yesterday she said that the ranks are based on a scoring system that ranges between 0 (public sector perceived as highly corrupt) to 100 (public sector perceived as very clean).
The Corruption Perceptions Index aggregates data from a number of different sources that provide perceptions of business people and country experts of the level of corruption in the public sector. The CPI 2016 is calculated using 13 different data sources from 12 different institutions that capture perceptions of corruption within the past two years, she said.
Globally, the data reveals that a staggering 69 percent of the 176 countries scored below 50 in the 2016 CPI indicating the high levels of perceived public sector corruption prevalent throughout the world. 2016 also marks an alarming trend where more countries had declined rather than improve in the overall index. Denmark and New Zealand are jointly ranked 1st in the 2016 CPI with a score of 90 followed by Finland, Sweden and Switzerland ranked 3rd, 4th and 5th respectively. India has scored highest in the South Asian region with a score of 40 and ranked 79th overall. India is followed by Sri Lanka and the Maldives which are jointly ranked 95th, she added.
