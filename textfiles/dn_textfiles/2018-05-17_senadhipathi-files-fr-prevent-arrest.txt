Senadhipathi files FR to prevent arrest

Avant Garde Maritime Service Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi has filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order against him being arrested.
This is on the purported violation of the Firearms Ordinance and Explosive Act as set out in the B report submitted to the Magistrate’s court of Galle case.
In his petition, Senadhipathi cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekara, the Attorney General and 15 others as respondents. Senadhipathi stated that the vessel MV Avant Garde was detained and taken control of by the Sri Lanka Navy in international waters.
The weapons and ammunition on board MV Avant Garde belonged to the Government of Sri Lanka and entrusted to Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Limited (RALL) which is also a fully state owned entity which was under the purview of the Defence Ministry.
He said there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate that the operations carried out between Avant Garde and RALL were tainted with any form of illegality.
Senadhipathi believes that police officers visited his residence informing him to visit the CID to record a statement. He believes that no sooner the said statement is recorded that he will be arrested and taken into custody for the alleged violations of the provisions in the Firearms Ordinance and Explosive Act based on the ex-facie false and baseless allegations. This petition had been filed through counsel Sanath Wijewardena.
