Education Ministry to grant four G.C.E. A/L opportunities for flood-affected students

According to a decision of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, the Education Ministry has decided to grant four opportunities for flood-affected students to sit for the G.C.E. (A.L.) examinations. The Ministry hopes to offer a special relief to these flood-affected students. Therefore, students of the flood-affected administrative districts can appear for four times if they are really interested in doing so now, said A.M. Herath, a senior school principal of a national school of Kurunegala District when contacted by the Daily News yesterday.
