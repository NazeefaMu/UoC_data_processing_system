Tackling tactics!

He has often been dubbed as one of Sri Lanka’s rugby legends. Once he tackles the ball, there is no stopping him. He has led his team towards achieving many victories. He has also represented Sri Lanka in many international tournaments, both in 7 a side and 15 a side. With stints like playing for the Asia Pacific Barbarians and Auckland Blues and training along with Northland ITM Cup Development Squad under his belt he has evolved to become Sri Lanka’s rugby prodigy as a stand-out player across Asia, setting a benchmark in the process. Yasara Abeynayake reveals that there is much more to her husband, the former Sri Lankan sevens and fifteens skipper and prolific fly-half Fazil Marija, than meets the eye.
Life with Fazil in three words
Calm – Fazil does not lose his cool easily. So even if I lose my temper at certain stages he just keeps quiet. Due to this tactic I too cool down quickly. We also live in a calm and peaceful area in Kandy.
Peaceful – Fazil dislikes keeping problems in his head. Even if there is an issue, he just sleeps it off and wakes up refreshened.
Security – Even if I have any issues: familywise or socially, I know that Fazil is always there for me. He does not give up on things easily. He always tries harder than anyone else around me to make things work.
The meeting
I am not actually a sports fan. I used to work at a private television channel. I got to know Fazil through that. After leaving the job I met him about a year later and since we have met each other before we began chatting regularly.
From friend to fiancé
We were friends for about a year. Neither he nor I were ready for a relationship then. I was based abroad for a span and even then the connection was still there. We used to talk over the phone, text and skype. By the time I returned back to Sri Lanka the realization had sunk in both of us that this is more than a friendship. So on my return we became a couple - officially.
He is ‘the one’
I actually did not know that Fazil is ‘the one’. Even after he proposed to me I was still pretty nervous about it. Everything was happening pretty fast. We got a nekatha (auspicious day) for our wedding three months after he proposed. However, I had great faith in him and believed that whatever he has said, he had said from the heart. I thank my lucky stars that I chose correctly and it worked out well! We tied the knot in December 2, 2015. Our registration was at Kingsbury Hotel and the wedding reception was at Galle Face Hotel.
Religious differences
Fazil is a Malay Muslim and I am a Catholic. There was no opposition from my parents since I come from a mixed family. My father is a Buddhist and my mother is a Christian. Therefore we are used to mixed religion marriages. However I do have very strong religious connections from my extended family and so does Fazil. Naturally, both sides had concerns but we told them that religion is a spiritual aspect that you practice for yourself. You don’t need to make it a big deal. So we went ahead with our plans, respecting both sides, and so far so good…
His passions vs her passions
I am totally not a sports freak. I am more of an arty person. I love drama, theater, movies and music. I guess this passion derives from my grandfather - the late Gamini Fonseka. He has four daughters. He did not want any of them to get into acting. Only his son, Damith, took up the profession. Therefore I was not really pushed towards the acting side. However I was behind the camera, producing and directing programs.
Fazil likes music but he is not into other forms of art. Therefore it is mostly my friends who accompany me to the theater. However we are united in our passion for music. I like various genres of music but Fazil is into the ‘guys stuff’ like hip hop and RnB.
Daily schedule
Fazil is employed at MAS, Kandy. He wakes up around 6 am and heads off to the gym. He goes to his work place straight from the gym. He is allowed to leave work early during the season because of his sports commitments. Therefore he goes for his training session. He is usually out till around 6.30 pm.
Free time
Fazil has an active schedule. He moves from his desk job to exercising, running and training. That is very energy consuming. Therefore, whenever he gets some free time he likes to relax at home and not do too much.
Travelling
Fazil and I wanted to travel as much as possible before having a baby. However I became pregnant one and a half into the marriage. We have been to Wales a couple of times and that has become our favourite holiday destination.
Most glorious moment in rugby
Fazil has quite a number of outstanding moments in his life. This is because he had to play the role of captaining the Kandy team, the Sri Lanka 7 and 15 teams. He has quite a lot of milestones in his life so it is difficult to pick out just one moment.
Happiest memories in life
When Fazil captains a side they usually end up winning always. So winning a tournament goes down as a happy reminiscent down memory lane.
On a more personal note Fazil has sweated a lot over trying to build a house for us. He has been struggling with the process for four or five years. Finally this year we managed to move into our own home in Polgolla, Kandy. He has been collecting money for the house for a long time.
Greatest strength and greatest weakness
Fazil is extremely hard working. I haven’t seen someone working like that in a long time. If he wants something done he would even turn the world upside down and make sure that it is done. That is his greatest plus point. His weakness is that he is very forgetful. Even if I tell him something now, he would forget all about it in two minutes! I have to keep on reminding him and then I start sounding like a nag!
Particulars
Fazil is not a fussy person but he is very stern with time management. That is the only time he gets annoyed with me because I am usually flexible with time. If he wants something done, it should be done on the dot!
Foodwise
Fazil loves anything fried. Roti and fried chicken are his idea of a perfect meal. Whatever meal he takes, he wants me to include at least one fried item. He likes my cooking. I am ok with anything. I don’t eat most meat items except for chicken and seafood.
We are open to try anything new when we dine out. We both are fans of the Japanese cuisine.
Birthday celebrations
Fazil’s birthday is in December and his father passed away during the same month. So he does not like to celebrate his birthday. We usually have a quiet meal. I invited a few friends over and whipped up a meal for his last birthday. I have gone off the whole ‘party stage’ for my birthdays too. So we headed off down south and spent the day together at a hotel for my last birthday.
Most touching gesture
There was some really bad media situation going on when we were dating. Fazil really stood by me through it all despite people calling him and relating all sorts of things. He had a difficult time with his colleagues and social media pressurizing him but he helped me get through it all simply by being by my side.
The expectant father
Fazil is wonderful in that nature. That is not something that I expected in him. He helps me out in various ways, from doing the household chores to getting the baby’s things organized. I did not anticipate him to be this good at the job! He is eagerly waiting for our child to arrive next month.
