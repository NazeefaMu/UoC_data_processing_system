Audit Bill: New feather in Govt’s cap

Finally, the National Audit Bill, a key public finance legislation that many awaited eagerly and even fought for, sailed through Parliament this week ending years of dilly-dallying and bargaining.
True, the Bill has been watered-down considerably compared to its earlier drafts that had been passing to and fro between the Legal Draftsman and the Cabinet not only during the last three years but also for the last 15 years since 2003, the year the Cabinet approved the first draft of National Audit Bill.
It was an onerous task for the Government to strike a balance between the powers of Sri Lanka Administrative Service Officials and Audit Officials, as it had to make sure that the Ministry Secretaries’ powers are not infringed upon while the Audit Commission headed by the Auditor General wields considerable power.
The Bill passed in to law with amendments, even including several proposed by the JVP and the SLFP, receiving unanimous consent of the House on Thursday. Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, along with other senior officials of his Department, remained in the Parliament complex throughout the debate.
The Bill seeing the light of the day preserving its spirit was another feather in Government’s cap despite the repeated setbacks it has come across in many other fronts. The long-overdue Audit Bill was a key pre-election pledge of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena. JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti reminded that the Bill should have been passed in Parliament on March 19, 2015, had the Government been serious on its 100-day work programme.
Democratic structures in place
This historic piece of legislation was moved for debate by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Bill provides for the powers, duties and functions of the Audit Service Commission. It also provides for the establishment of the National Audit Office and the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. It specifies the role of the Auditor General over public finance.
Moving the Bill, the PM rejoiced that the major reforms the Government had brought in since 2015 have put a total democratic structure in place that the people have started to enjoy their freedoms in all aspects.
“All independent commissions, Judicial Services, Election, Public Service, Police and now Audit Service have been established. The Constitutional Council is functioning. The Right to Information law is enacted. With all these legislation we have put a democratic structure into place where the administration and judiciary can function without coming under undue political pressure. There will be shortcomings. We can correct those. This Parliament is becoming more and more powerful and as we go along we will have a Parliament which we can be proud of and would be on par or even better than the Lok Sabha in India,” the Premier said.
Surcharge provision
JVP Parliamentarian Handunnetti expressed his satisfaction that the draft Bill, which had been left to lie idle since 2003-2015, ultimately found its way to Parliament because of the perseverance of this Government, Auditor General and the staff. The MP, who works closely with the Auditor General as the Head of COPE, presented the Audit Bill as a Private Member’s Bill in November last year when the Government was seen bidding more time. Pointing at several loose ends of the Bill, he said his party has proposed 16 amendments to empower and preserve the true spirit of the legislation and urged the Government to consider them at the third reading.
With the passage of the Audit Bill, the Audit Service Commission, which had been inactive for over two and half years since its birth after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, will spring into life. The Commission with its new found teeth will be able to keep tabs on public accounts helping to curb the public sector corruption.
The Audit Bill was revised for over 23 times mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision which provides for “a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to Government for which that officer is held responsible”. This provision has been diluted to vest the authority to impose surcharge back in the Chief Accounting Officers (Ministry Secretaries/Department Heads), and not the Auditor General. In cases where the CAO has been implicated, the power to impose the surcharge lies with the Treasury Secretary. A Surcharge Appeal Committee comprising of five members will be appointed by the Constitutional Council to hear and determine appeals by any person against whom a surcharge has been imposed.
Vijayakala under fire
Much has been said in Parliament to condemn and haul ex-State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran over the coals for her apparently ill-advised statement reportedly on reviving the LTTE in the North. Both Government and Opposition members came up strong against her statement showing rare unity demanding tough action against her.
The first salvo against her was fired by the UNP, despite her being a member of the same party. This was not the first time, Vijayakala, widow of slain ex-MP T. Maheswaran, uttered sentiments that glorified the LTTE. Like some rabble-rousing politicians in the South who pander to chauvinistic feelings of the Sinhala conservative voters, her remarks could be understood as pandering to communal feelings of the Tamils in the North mostly to win their hearts and thereby translate them into votes. This time around her words cost her dearly as she had to step down from her post pending disciplinary inquiries by the UNP hierarchy and the Speaker.
Both Government and Opposition members were on the same page that she, in the first place, should not have made such a statement that rekindled bitter past memories of ruthless terrorism that brought misery to many people across ethnic divisions. Another allegation against the UNP Jaffna District MP was that she breached the oath taken by MPs not to “directly or indirectly support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate” separatism.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was quick to distance his party from the controversial statement, while the TNA was cautious not to get into the controversy. Thus the TNA avoided having to deal with a political minefield.
JO’s theatrics
With Child Affairs State Minister Maheswaran at the centre of controversy, it was a happening day in Parliament on Tuesday as Joint Opposition MPs, who were waiting in the wings to play their ‘Tiger card’, got back to their antics in Parliament. They staged a protest by storming the Well of the House forcing the Speaker to abruptly end the sittings by 2.25 pm, barely one and half hours since the sittings began.
For the JO, remarks on resurgence of LTTE came at a time it was desperately looking for a bait to distract the public and media attention from the recent blows it suffered from the New York Times investigative report as well as the controversial ‘Hilter’ comment. While the Government took time to use the trump cards on its hand, the JO grabbed Vijayakala’s remarks from both hands and created a lot of hype. It also helped the JO to keep its internal fissures out of the glare of the public eye at least temporarily.
Interestingly, JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena did not show much interest throughout the protest and mostly idled near his seat. This was contrary to his usual behaviour in the House, but it was difficult to construe the reasons for his sudden change.
It was NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa who led the protest in the Well of the House, and he together with MP Prasanna Ranaweera made a lot of ugly scenes drawing the ire of the Speaker. They shouted slogans and hurled abuse at the Chair. Both Weerawansa and Ranaweera repeatedly defied the orders of the Speaker and behaved aggressive. ‘SLFP Group of 16’ members Dayasiri Jayasekara and Chandima Weerakkody were also in the forefront arguing with the Speaker.
Grabbing the Mace
The Speaker came to a head when MP Ranaweera tried to grab the Mace and run. The Serjeant-at-Arms, along with his Deputy and Assistant, prevented the MP from running with the Mace and a few UNP back-benchers also came to their support. The Speaker at this point named MP Ranaweera and ordered him out of the main chamber. As MP Ranaweera did not obey, he ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him, but Parliament was adjourned before the order was executed.
The provision to impose four weeks’ suspension on any member who touches the Mace during the sittings has been included into the new set of Standing Orders adopted from April 15. In addition, a Code of Conduct for MPs has also been adopted. If these rules and regulations are limited to books and left on tables to gather dust, one can expect the current trend of misbehavior to continue further humiliating the ‘August Assembly’. MP Ranaweera was suspended from Parliament for a week in May 2016 for his involvement in a brawl and he had been at the centre of similar in-house brawl in January this year.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tackled the LTTE revival claims head on when he addressed Parliament the next day. While assuring to uphold sovereignty of the country, the Premier reiterated the Government’s commitment to reach a political solution acceptable to all communities in the country. “Those who question Maheswaran today, appointed ex-LTTE frontline leader Karuna Amman as SLFP office bearer, and sent former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka to jail. What is the moral right they have to make a fuss over this statement?”, the PM queried in lighter vein.
