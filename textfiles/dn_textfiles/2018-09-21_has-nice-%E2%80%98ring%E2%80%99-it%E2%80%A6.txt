Has a nice ‘ring’ to it…

As wedding trends continue to get more elaborate it seems even engagements are getting a makeover.
With the all-important social media announcement – and photo of the ring – becoming more important one company has gone one step further to ensure their rings are memorable.
You can now get an exact copy of your ring, and hand, in cookie form. Taking a leaf out of the Bake Off book, jewellers Beaverbrooks are giving away the engagement cookies free with every purchase of a diamond ring.
The edible souvenir, made by Custom Cookie Co, will recreate the hand and ring on a vanilla biscuit finished with icing sugar frosting and glazed sugar.
Ben McHugh, store manager at Beaverbrooks Westfield Stratford, said: “Proposal announcements are getting bigger and better, with newly engaged couples always on the lookout for new and creative ways of spreading their happy news.
“As well as looking great on social media feeds, our unique engagement ring hand cookies are a fun (and tasty) way of announcing the special event – it’s the sweetest engagement trend yet!”
The limited-edition cookies are available to couples who purchase a ring at the London Westfield Stratford store.
