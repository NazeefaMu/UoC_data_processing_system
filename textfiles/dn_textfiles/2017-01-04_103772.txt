Cost of living today unbearable: Muthuhettigama

The cost of living has risen to unbearable heights today. The government has sufficient rice in its warehouses, but it failed to control the price. Farmers do not receive fertiliser on time.
The two-year-old good governance government was not receiving a favourable response at the rallies, Ports and Shipping Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama said.
Addressing a press conference in Galle, Muthuhettigama said the President was making a genuine effort to solve country's problems, and they were supporting his endeavour. But the UNP government members led by the Prime Minister were turning a blind eye to their efforts as if they were deaf. However, they will endeavour to take good governance along the correct track in the future. Muthuhettigama said he was confident that the SLFP would attain a convenient victory at the forthcoming local government elections. He said he made this prediction as a person who reposed great confidence in the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He would also request former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to join their fold to march towards victory together. Mahinda-Maithri unity would be the best to set up a people-friendly government before 2020.
He said he would always endeavour to carry out the duties of his deputy ministerial post to the best of his ability.
He did not belong to the ilk that gave up entrusted responsibilities and reversed. They would do everything possible to prevent the sale of ports to foreigners, he said. Today there were strikes island wide. If this trend continued, they would be in a deep trouble.
Therefore, he would request the President to intervene and resolve those problems, the Deputy Minister said.
