SLFP requires MR's support to win forthcoming LG polls - Dilan

Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) requires the support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to win the forthcoming Local Government election.
Minister Perera was speaking at a press conference at the Information Department yesterday.
He said the cooperation of Mahinda Rajapaksa and President Maithripala Sirisena is required to win the forthcoming election
"There are parties who want to create rifts within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Those in the United National Party like to see division in the SLFP," he said.
The minister also added that there is a question with regard to the impartiality and legality of the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID). He said that there can not be an institution within the Police Department which does not come under the purview of the National Police Commission. Perera insisted that the FCID should be brought under the National Police Commission forthwith
"We had a question over the FCID from the beginning, but, we are seriously concerned about its impartiality and legality after the NPC was setup," he said.
He said that former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa has awoken up after a long slumber. Perera added that the 1982 referendum was defeated because of Basil Rajapaksa.
The minister said that the former Economic Development Minister did not strive for the party's well being. "He worked for his well being," he said. "No one knows whether Basil Rajapaksa has struck a deal with the aim of making the UNP victorious at the forthcoming election," he said.
