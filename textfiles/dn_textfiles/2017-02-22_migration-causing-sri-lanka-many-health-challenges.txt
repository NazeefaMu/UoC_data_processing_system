Migration causing Sri Lanka many health challenges

Sri Lanka faces many health challenges due to migration and could continue to do so. The experiences and understanding gained over the past years have helped to develop an all inclusive Migration Health Policy, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. Addressing the inauguration of the second Global Consultation on Migrant Health : Resetting the agenda, held at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo yesterday, he said the National Migration Health Policy was launched in Sri Lanka in 2013 during President Maithripala Sirisena’s tenure as the Health Minister. According to Senaratne, Sri Lanka included key health components in the National Migration Health Policy such as inbound migration, outbound migration, families left behind and internal migration.
He said at the 106th IOM Council in November 2015, that a High-level Panel on Migration, Human Mobility and Global Health was organised.
During the Session, President Maithripala Sirisena, offered to host a Global Consultation on migrant health and it is currently taking place in Sri Lanka. Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama and several others spoke. Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara and many others were present at the occasion.
