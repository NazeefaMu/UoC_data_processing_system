Worth the break

Tom Cruise's ‘Mission: Impossible – Fallout’ has been met with rave reviews from critics who say the franchise's latest installment may just been the best one yet.
Fallout - landing in theaters on July 27 - has been described as a 'stupefyingly awesome' 'save-the-world bonanza' that will 'put this summer's other action-adventure blockbusters to shame'.
While the premise itself - which follows IMF agent Ethan Hunt - is said to be lacking, reviewers have said the film is a must-see thanks to the non-stop action sequences Cruise is famous for.
The leading man, 56, is joined by a strong cast including Henry Cavill, Alec Baldwin, Vanessa Kirby, Angela Bassett and Simon Pegg.
The Mission: Impossible franchise has been churning out blockbusters since since the first installment came out in 1996 - and Fallout will be no exception, according to reviews.
