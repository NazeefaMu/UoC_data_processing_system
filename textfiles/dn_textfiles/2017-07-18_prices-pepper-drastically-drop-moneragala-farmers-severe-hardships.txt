Prices of pepper drastically drop: Moneragala farmers in severe hardships

Pepper prices have drastically gone down dragging farmers in Badalkumbura, Siyabalanduwa, Medadama, Bibile, Siyambalanduwa, Dambagalla, Meegahapitiya and many other areas in the Moneragala district into severe hardships.
The farmers said they sold a pepper kilo at Rs. 1,500 earlier, but now they sell a kilo of raw pepper only at Rs. 200-300.
The farmers urge authorities to bring relief for them by taking steps to create a viable market for them to sell their produce at a reasonable price.
