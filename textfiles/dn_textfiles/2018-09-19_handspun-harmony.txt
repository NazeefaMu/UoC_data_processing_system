Handspun harmony

Walking through the winding hallways of the BMICH last week, one would think that one was wandering through a Middle Eastern bazaar. The inauguration of Shilpa Abhimani 2018, Presidential Awards Handicrafts Competition & Exhibition had all the allure and the beauty of the East that fascinates the West. The Handicrafts were of a unique Sri Lankan identity and were the pride of Sri Lanka.
Daily News visited the inauguration that saw the attendance of many dignitaries including Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Buddhika Pathirana, Guest of Honor High Commissioner of India Taranjith Singh Sandhu and Chairperson National Crafts Council Heshani Bogollagama.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, commended the craftsmen for their efforts, calling the field of crafts one of great value that has a long history in Sri Lanka.
“This traditional festival showcases designs of great beauty and innovation from around the country. This is not just a competition but a carefully planned arts festival contributing to the growth of the Sri Lankan Crafts Sector. It is all about hard work. Our government is now working on a project touching on the revival of traditional textiles and women’s handicrafts in North and East provinces. We are also expanding our crafts training centres under the NCC (National Crafts Council) while conducting various training courses and workshops around the country for our future craftsmen that touches on various important and timely subjects,” said Bathiudeen.
He pointed out that he has no doubt that such initiatives will give our Sri Lankan Craftsman more opportunities in the future and a promising future.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Buddhika Pathirana pointed out that the National Crafts are, our historical and traditional legacy.
“This has been handed down through the centuries. It goes hand in hand with our Sri Lankan Culture. Regardless of their background, these handicraftsmen carry with them this legacy I talk about. Sri Lanka and India are connected by the traditional Arts and Crafts. We also have ties with other countries in our region through the Arts and Crafts. We need to go forth into the future and at the same time preserve these handicrafts. That is the challenge which we face right now. This is the journey those in the crafts sector must take along with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The challenge is protecting our handicrafts and placing it in the hands of the coming generations to carry with them into the future. For this we must adopt a carefully studied strategy,” said Pathirana.
Pathirana pointed out that if you take our arts and crafts and our heritage it cannot be measured in terms of money.
“We need to protect our craftsmen from being exploited, and this is something the NCC should take very seriously. So with the leadership of our minister, we are now taking the necessary steps. We need to fully use the benefits of modern information technology. I feel we need to put our trust in media such as Facebook, regardless of the fact that some people say it is a liability. We do not stop air travel just because planes crash? We need to find out how to solve the problems that FB presents. Prohibiting FB is not the answer. How do we use the advantages of FB economically? We know that people access the internet and email through their smartphones. Technology is evolving!” explained Pathirana.
Pathirana pointed out that in the future there will be unthinkable development and changes. The field of entertainment will be transformed in unimaginable ways and we need to keep up with the changing times.
Guest of Honor High Commissioner of India Taranjith Singh Sandhu stated that Sri Lanka like India has a tradition of Handicrafts and that the handicrafts in both nations have a very long history citing the Sigiriya Frescoes and wood carvings in temples.
“Our craftsmen are master craftsmen with exceptional skills. The history of Indian Handicrafts goes back to almost 5000 years. There is evidence of handicrafts from the Indus Valley Civilization. Indian handicrafts have earned a place for itself in the world. People travel hundreds of miles to view these handicrafts. Handicrafts in Sri Lanka and India tell a unique story. Each handicraft leaves a legacy. There is a niche market out there for handicrafts and products made out of organic products which are natural, and this is now growing,” said Sandhu.
Sandhu pointed out that we need to innovate and grow together.
“Even Gandhi promoted a handspun fabric as a symbol of freedom and self –respect. He said that he was a firm believer of working with hands, and said that he saw god in every thread that he put through the spinning wheel. People to people relations are the pillar of Sri Lanka and India’s partnerships. This partnership is expanding in handicrafts. Indian Handicrafts are not unknown to Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankan creations are very popular with Indians. Hundreds of Indian tourists take beautiful Sri Lankan products back to India. Such interactions create opportunities to exchange ideas. Shilpa Abhimani is a unique event where an international platform is provided to the artisans. I congratulate NCC for conducting this event. I would like to say to the craftsmen of Sri Lanka that their hands are magic. It is their skills that ensure the continuity of tradition and the cultures,” explained Sandhu.
Chairperson National Crafts Council Heshani Bogollagama commented that the aim and goal of the National Crafts Council are to preserve, develop and promote the invaluable national handicrafts sector of Sri Lanka.
“Around 26,000 handicraftsmen from all parts of the island have been registered with the National Crafts Council. We understand the need to recognize these craftsmen and show the world their capabilities and talents, which is part of why we are holding Shilpa Abhimani. Our Kings of Sri Lanka recognized these craftsmen in the past and we feel that they must be recognized once more by the president of Sri Lanka. We feel our craftsmen deserve to be recognized in the highest way possible – the presidential award,” said Bogollagama.
Bogollagama also commented that under the leadership of Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen along with the National Crafts Council, in the space of three years, they have found solutions to many of the problem within the industry. Along with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, many new programs were launched.
“Along with the Ministry of Education, the NCC, launched ‘Shilpa Navoda’ to popularize handicrafts and make it attractive amongst the youth of Sri Lanka. We the NCC is always behind our craftsmen helping them with all facets of the industry helping the economic situation of these craftsmen. We are greatly pleased to hold Shilpa Abhimani and the programs that come under it because through that we are helping these craftsmen get through their difficulties.
At the Provincial level, 1418 creations which won awards at the provincial competitions were featured national competition - The Shilpa Abhimani 2018, presidential awards competition and exhibition. Under ‘Shilpa Navoda’ a very successful school handicraft competition was conducted last year. Because of this success, a special handicraft training workshop for school children was launched. Over 10,000 school children were trained in the handicrafts to ensure the next generation takes this forward,” explained Bogollagama.
Bogollagama also pointed out that uplifting the livelihoods of these poor craftsmen and helping them to solve the problems they face with the modern market is part of the mandate of NCC.
“This year Shilpa Abhimani 2018, saw a record number of over 8000 crafts, brought forward by over 4000 craftsmen to participate in this competition. We are grateful to President Maithripala Sirisena for giving us the opportunity to hold a presidential award winning the competition and give the highest felicitation for our craftsmen,” stated Bogollagama.
Bogollagama thanked Guest of Honor High Commissioner of India Taranjith Singh Sandhu for the help rendered by the Indian Government to the NCC in the field of Sri Lankan Handicrafts. The Indian Cultural Center has always assisted the NCC in all national events hosted by the NCC.
“We are grateful for the Indian High Commission who funded Rs. 20 million, to establish a marketing village in Hambantota for our rural craftsmen. This will be opened to the public later this year,” said Bogollagama.
