Education is indeed the bedrock for the future success of a youth, a country and a generation. It is an undeniable truth that a sound secondary and tertiary education would most certainly pave a path of greater success for the individual and society at large. This truth has been ingrained in citizens of Sri Lanka to whom education is considered of prime importance.
This October, education invites you to BMICH, to give you the “passport to your future” where Sri Lanka’s most focused higher education and career exhibition, Adyapana 2015, will be held for the 10th consecutive year from October 2 to 4.
