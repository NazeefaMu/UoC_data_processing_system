Health staff warned against granting media access

Health authorities will be compelled to take action against health staff who grant access to the media to enter restricted areas like intensive care units, mortuaries and theatres, without necessary permission, to record visuals, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe said.
He was speaking to the media during a session on suicide reporting guidelines at the Government Information Department auditorium on Wednesday.
He said that recently a television channel showed visuals of a health worker who opened the freezer of a mortuary for the media and disrespectfully touched the corpse. Health authorities cannot allow such incidents to take place.
“I served at the Accident Ward of the General Hospital from 2001 to 2009 and the media was not allowed into the ICU, the mortuary or the theatres to record anything. Earlier, the media published and broadcast pictures with blood and body parts, but now the state does not allow such sensitive material to be published or broadcast,” Dr. Jasinghe said.
“Sometimes the media dramatises incidents. The electronic media reports incidents such as suicides like dramas, while reading a newspaper is like reading a novel that ends in tragedy. Positive news is not news, while negative news is always treated as ‘hot’ news. Some newspapers publish what only a medical student needs to read; instead, newspapers should educate people on topics such as preventing diseases,” he said.
Government Information Director General Sudarshana Gunawardana said that the government highly respected media freedom and the freedom of expression, but some reporting has negative effects. Although the intention of the media is not to cause any harm, sometimes reporting could have adverse effects on certain parties such as marginalised groups. Journalists always need to think about the impact on victims when reporting, he said.
