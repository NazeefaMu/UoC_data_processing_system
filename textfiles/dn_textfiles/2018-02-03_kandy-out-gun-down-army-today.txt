KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
Kandy out to gun down Army today

The league title is already in the hands of Kandy Sports Club but they have two more games, one will be played today against Sri Lanka Army at Ratmalana. The two teams go head-to-head for the second time. Kandy have won all 12 games they have played and scored 506 points (77 tries, 50 conversions and 7 penalties) this season. When Kandy has the ball in hand they know how to move it around and make play that has resulted in these points. They have a fantastic style of rugby where the ball is kept moving from player to player for long periods of play. When it comes to winning, no one does it quite like giants Kandy. They are hot favorites to beat the soldiers — and with good reason — they have tasted victory in all the matches they played and they hold a dominant record over every rugby game this season. Kandy SC grades all its players by weight, so players always play against other players of similar weight and what differentiates them is skill. As they develop the most skilled players rise to the top and there are clear pathways to representative that nurture talent and feed into the team. Today everyone likes the play of Kandy SC and no one will be against this team in a blind fit, but there are some who usually stab from behind. Kandy’s attacking style of play helps drive their ability to demolish opponents. The biggest gift for Kandy SC is that they are blessed with some of the country’s best rugby brains, including the current rugby committee.
