Moves to redress Badagiriya water issues

Steps have been taken to provide short term and long term solutions to drinking water issues at Badagiriya in Hambantota.
Drinking water will be provided to residents by purifying the water of Badagiriyawewa by using the latest technology as a short term solution, according to National Water supply and Drainage Board Director Mahilal Silva.
The Ruhunupura water supply project will be extended as the along term solution, he said.
