Upholding democracy during tough times

The averred RAW exposure situation with regard to the alleged plot to assassinate the President has continued this week, bringing out a truly raw depiction of the divisions in the governing coalition.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s visit to India last week, enabled further explanation of the situation that arose in that controversial Cabinet meeting, with a cordial meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The discussions between the two Prime Ministers certainly helped restore good understanding between the two countries, after President Sirisena’s own telephone conversation with PM Modi relating to this matter.
However, the pressures of local politics, particularly the running and rising differences between the SLFP and UNP saw the RAW issue kept in the political terrain, to further drive the party differences, with little consideration to the larger issue of international and good neighbourly relations. The statement by UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera that the four Cabinet ministers who leaked the RAW story to the media would be exposed, followed by the earlier criticism of this leak by SLFP spokesman minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, clearly showed the SLFP’s desire to keep this controversy alive, with hidden s fingers pointing at UNP ministers in the Cabinet. While the UNP ministers had to deny any such ‘leak’, we saw Namal Rajapaksa get more publicity by calling for exposure of the ‘leakers'.
What was clear was the political aim from the SLFP to use the RAW allegation, which President Sirisena himself has denied to both the Indian Prime Minister and High Commissioner, as part of the political battle with the UNP in the current situation of confrontational politics; where the goal of a Caretaker Government is kept dangling in the political domain, even with such a caretaker being increasingly considered unrealistic.
There is a quixotic situation arising from these allegations of leaking to the media a situation that officially did not take place at the Cabinet meeting. The SLFP Ministers are no doubt aware of President Sirisena’s own denial of any reference to the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of the Indian Intelligence Institution. If there was no such statement and reference, what was there to leak? Did the reference to RAW involve what ministers said, other than what the president said? Was it mere RAW banter, if the President was not suspicious of any RAW involvement in the alleged assassination probe? The more this is dragged on, it will be an unhelpful situation relating to Sri Lanka-India relations, as well as an attempt to use even an imaginary situation to drive deeper the divisions between the SLFP and UNP.
Interestingly, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who now leads the SLPP, and one who has more seriously accused RAW of involvement in the election of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena as President by defeating him, has said it is hard to believe there are ministers with affiliations to RAW. While stating that such a situation would be treason, ‘I don’t believe there are ministers with RAW affiliations”, he said at a meeting in Tangalle.
It will be helpful for the SLFP purveyors of this RAW narration, to know that issues facing the country and people are more diverse and much deeper in content, such as economics, cost of living, and corruption, and would draw little public attention in the current political content. Paying more attention to improved relations with India, would be far better in the wider political context, beyond the narrow interest of rival party politics.
Provincial politics
Termination of the first Northern Provincial Council this week, brings a new interest in the democratic process in the country. This is now the sixth provincial council to be dissolved, with no signs of elections to these councils, raising major issues about the advance or continuance of democracy in the country.
The Northern Province had its first PC election, five years after ending of the separatist war with the LTTE, in September 2013, following which C. V. Wigneswaran of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) was elected Chief Minister. Since his taking up the office of Chief Minister there have been increasing disagreements with the TNA, leading to open divergence between him and the largest political party of the Tamil people. There was agreement between him and the TNA leadership when it supported the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena in the January 2015 Presidential election. In the General Election that followed the TNA had the largest members elected from the Opposition political parties, and its leader M. Sampanthan was chosen Lender of the Opposition in Parliament.
The disagreements between Wigneswaran and the TNA leadership was initially due to the delay in the constitutional reforms promised in the campaign for the Common Candidate, which were key aspects of the policies proposed by the Movement for Social Justice led by the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, and the political alliance that supported the Common Candidate.
With the delay in constitutional reform, and the government moving away from the promises of wider devolution, beyond the limits of the 13th Amendment, which introduced devolution and the Provincial Councils, there was increased dissatisfaction among sections of the Tamil political leadership, moving away from the TNA’s hopeful alignment with the Government.
Chief Minister Wigneswaran soon became a voice for Tamil political opinion that is critical of government’s policies, and moved closer to the more extremist and racist thinking of Tamil political opinion, with increasing dissatisfaction with the government’s slow and uncertain policies of reconciliation, understanding and peace building. Although the government has done much on reconciliation, the influence of Tamil Diaspora voices functioning abroad, and the rise of majoritarian thinking and policies with the government and the Joint Opposition, combined the buildup of the more radical Tamil political thinking in the North.
This has now resulted in the Wigneswaran being a founder of the new Tamil People’s Council (TMC) or Thamil Makkal Kootani, a political party that will throw a challenge to the TNA, and its leadership given to the Tamil, people, for more than three decades. This includes the period of the LTTE war of separation in the much curtailed parliamentary context, when many leading members of the TNA and its associate parties were assassinated by the LTTE.
Apart from the challenge the TNA will have to its position of leadership among the Tamil community, especially in the North and East, the forming of a new political party by Wigneswaran and his political allies also raises a major problem for the government, over the continuing delay in the holding of Provincial Council elections. The Sabaragamuwa, North Central, Eastern, North Western and Central Provincial Councils have ceased to function for some time, with the first three over one year. The sixth such PC – Northern Province, raises a major issue on the devolution of power to the Tamil people. The Northern and Eastern PCs are no not functional, and their administrations are handled by the Governors. This certainly raises questions about the democratic process in the country, and the absence of a clear statement by the Government about the holding of elections to the now dissolved PCs.
This certainly gives much cause for the political opposition led by the SLPP and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to intensify its campaign for speedy PC elections, which will now have a bigger push from Wigneswaran’s TMC. This will bring an ethnic aspect to the demand for provincial democracy, and will certainly extend to the wider call for better and a functional democracy in the country.
The call for polls from the North, combined with the East, will bring added pressure on the Elections Commission too. There will be increased questions raised as to how and why the Elections Commission continues to be seen as in accord with what are the government’s legislative delays in holding the PC elections in time. It is also possible that this matter may move towards a Supreme Court determination, which will be in keeping with an earlier decision of the Supreme Court on the former Elections Commissioner having to act in keeping with the legislation on elections, and not the government’s political and administrative delays on the matter.
The new politics of the Northern Province will see a whole new trend in political developments, which will bring the aspects of constitutional change to the front, which the government is not ready or able to present in the context of the divisions between the SLFP and UNP; as well as the general move away from the promises of the Common Candidacy in January 2015, and the General Election later that year.
Political amnesia
Political memories could be a serious issue among those who have been in politics for many decades. The recent recognition of the role of the Senanayakes in national politics has certainly led to forgetfulness of key aspects of UNP politics, especially in the context of the UNP and SLFP alignment, which is moving towards separation. Those who had joy in having an alignment with the once Senanayake led UNP, would do well to revive memories of the major changes that JR Jayewardene brought to the UNP and the country, the most important of which is the Executive Presidency, which did not have any Senanayake contribution. Such political amnesia could contribute to divisive politics where reality is replaced by opportunist thinking.
