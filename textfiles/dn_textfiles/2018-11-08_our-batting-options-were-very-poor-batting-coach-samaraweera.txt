Our batting options were very  poor - batting coach Samaraweera

GALLE, Tuesday: Sri Lanka’s batting coach Thilan Samaraweera put down his team’s dismal batting performance on the second day of the first Test against England at the Galle International Stadium to “poor batting options”.
“There was nothing wrong with the pitch, no demons on it, our batting options were very poor today. We didn’t bat well honestly and that’s the bottom line,” said Samaraweera at the end of the day.
“It’s not a 200 pitch because on day two also it behaved really well. Our options were all wrong. Five to six guys were out to very soft dismissals”.
“Not much technically more mindset. We know England’s spinners bowled with defensive field settings and our options were a little bit wrong,” he said.
Summing up the match at the end of day two Samaraweera said, “We are behind in this test and the first three hours tomorrow will be crucial.”
“We can take it from there where we stand. We have to get England out for a small total as possible and then try to chase down whatever target we are left with.”
CHANDIMAL DOUBTFUL
Giving an update on captain Dinesh Chandimal’s groin strain, Samaraweera said that he will undergo an MRI scan before assessing whether he can play for the rest of the series.
“At the moment the physio is assessing him I don’t think he can field, hopefully he will bat after no. 6 in the second innings.”
Chandimal batted for 96 minutes yesterday with a lot of discomfort and did not take the field during England’s second innings.
England are leading overall by 177 runs after dismissing Sri Lanka for 203 in their first innings.
