Underhill denied late try as All Blacks hit back to beat England

TWICKENHAM, Saturday - England's Sam Underhill was denied a late and potentially match-winning try as world champions New Zealand came from 15-0 down to win 16-15 at a rainswept Twickenham on Saturday.
Just four minutes remained when England thought they were about to record just an eighth win in 41 Tests against the All Blacks when replacement Courtney Lawes charged down reserve scrum-half TJ Perenara's kick and Underhill, weaving his way past Beauden Barrett, crossed.
But French referee Jerome Garces, after consulting South African television match official Marius Jonker, decided Lawes had been offside and disallowed the score to the dismay of a capacity Twickenham crowd of over 82,000.
Garces's decision came just days after a new World Rugby edict declaring that “try scoring should be an on-field decision with the referee being responsible, but the team of four (the referee, two touch judges and the TMO) can all contribute”.
New Zealand had earlier recovered from the shock of England's impressive start to be just five points down at half-time thanks to fullback Damian McKenzie's converted try and a Barrett penalty.
Fly-half Barrett's second-half drop-goal and penalty then proved the decisive scores in what was the first England-New Zealand clash for four years -- and one that took place fewer than 12 months out from the 2019 World Cup in Japan. - AFP
