South Asia  Textiles strategises  with MTI

South Asia Textiles Limited recently nominated MTI Consulting to conduct a detailed review of their current position and develop a long term strategic business plan.
This project will also encompass South Asia Textiles’ future direction in terms of achieving significant growth while creating sustainable competitive advantage and maintaining its dominance within the dynamic textile industry.
South Asia Textiles, a subsidiary of Lanka Century Investments commenced its commercial operations in 2004. Strategically located in close proximity to garment manufacturing units and export processing zones that produces high quality garments to both local and international clients, South Asia Textiles maintains its manufacturing dominance through its ultra-modern manufacturing plant that produces exceptional quality weft knitted fabric.
The company also specialises in knitting, dyeing, finishing, printing, brushing, sueding and anti-pin micro/polar fleece fabric for leading global brands such as Victoria Secret, Next, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Calvin Klein, Decathlon and Adidas.
“The global fashion industry has always been very dynamic. Trends in fashion have short life cycles and with the influence of e-commerce and m-commerce, these cycles have become even shorter. Global markets are shrinking and competition is intense. The total industry is experiencing rapid changes much faster than 5-10 years ago. As an important spoke of the supply chain process to the fashion industry, the regional apparel industry is also experiencing rapid change. Sustainability, in this race, is key for survival,”South Asia Textiles Limited MD and CEO Pritiv Dorai said.MTI will employ its internationally acclaimed 8S(r) Model framework to execute the project. This framework would engage the management team through a highly inclusive process of strategic planning consisting of eight stages namely; Scope, Scan, Sights, Strategy, Structure, Staff, Sustainability/Social Responsibility and Systems.
“In order to guard its competitive position from potential regional threats, South Asia Textiles has understood the importance of responding effectively and profitably to the fast changing dynamics of the industry. As a result, the need to identify and chart its strategic direction becomes essential. With the implementation of this project, the company has opted for a proactive stance and is equipping themselves internally to face the changes and challenges that they may encounter in the future”, MTI CEO Hilmy Cader said.
MTI Consulting has worked on over 550 assignments in over 41 countries, covering a diverse range of industries, clients and business challenges.
