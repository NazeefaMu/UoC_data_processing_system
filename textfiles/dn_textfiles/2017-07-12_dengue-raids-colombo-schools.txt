Measures have been taken to raid schools in the Colombo Municipality area for dengue following complaints claiming that dengue larvae have been found from main schools in the area, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Fizer Mustapha said.
Addressing the media at the Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry yesterday, Minister Mustapha said principals and the heads of institutions should take the responsibility of school environment.
He said an operation office has been established with the assistance of the tri-forces and police environment unit to monitor the dengue prevention and garbage disposal process of the local government bodies.
The minister stressed the necessity of suspending the licence of the construction sites found with mosquito breeding spots.
The Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry and the Science and Technology Ministry have jointly taken measures to install 100 CCTV cameras within the Colombo City to identify those who dispose garbage illegally, the minister said.
