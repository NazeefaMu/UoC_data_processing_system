Zaheer Khan set to replace Malinga  as bowling mentor of Mumbai Indians

Former Indian pacer Zaheer Khan can make his comeback to the Indian Premier League (IPL), as a coach of a franchise. As per a report in The Mumbai Mirror, he might be appointed as the bowling mentor of Mumbai Indians, taking the place of Lasith Malinga. The latter took over the job in the previous season after going unsold in the auction.
“It is expected. Malinga has been playing other leagues of the world. He had even played for Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup, and he wants to test himself in the IPL which precedes the World Cup. He wants to play in the IPL to be match-fit for the World Cup,” an IPL insider was quoted as saying by The Mumbai Mirror.
Should Zaheer join Mumbai Indians as the bowling mentor, it will be his maiden coaching assignment with any team. Although, he was the captain cum mentor at Delhi Daredevils during his stay at the franchise but was not the official mentor of the team.
A veteran of 92 Tests and 200 ODIs, Zaheer was expected to join the coaching staff of an IPL team in 2018 itself but that didn’t happen. Next year, though, he might be a part of Mumbai Indians’ staff, a team which he represented in three editions.
Presently, the coaching staff of Mumbai Indians is headed by Mahela Jayawardene, who took over from Ricky Ponting ahead of IPL 2017.
