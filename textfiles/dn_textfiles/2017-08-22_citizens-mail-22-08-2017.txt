Grieve your dementia
It is astonishing how the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa has recently made a quizzical statement at a function launching the Sri Lanka Podujana Lawyers’ association that he is still the SLFP leader after the SLFP leadership has been handed over to the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena.
I feel sorry that he is suffering from a kind of dementia that he forgets the past which he gave the SLFP leadership to the incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena soon after his defeat in the Presidential election at a SLFP function held in Sri Lanka Freedom Party Headquarters in Darley road. His accusation that the appointment of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is unconstitutional and is also baseless because the Executive President in Sri Lanka after winning in the election can appoint his Cabinet and the Prime Minister of his own wishes according to the Constitution.
He should understand that real democracy prevails in the country now but not in the past during the dark reign of the Rajapaksa cronies. In a democratic party like the UNP, there is no harm in bringing a no confidence motion against one of its ministers or members of parliament. It is quite possible either for SLFP or the UNP or any other party to bring a no confidence motion against a member who transgresses the party norms.
He is blaming the Government that it sells the national assets but in the meanwhile he has forgotten he has sold more 50 acres of the Galle Face Green to a Chinese company to construct the port city. There are many other foreign deals he manipulated during his tenure of office which he has forgotten. It is lamentable that the present Government has to pay the price for the sins he has committed is intolerable for the poor people of the country.
