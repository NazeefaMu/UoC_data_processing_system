Religious leaders denounce violence

The Congress of Religions comprising leaders from the Buddhist, Christian, Islamic and Hindu faiths while denouncing in the strongest terms, all those who resort to intimidation, thuggery and violence, urged the government to take prompt action to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The religious leaders in one voice urged the government to enforce the law in a manner that safeguards the security and dignity of each and every citizen of the country without discrimination. Speaking at a press conference at the Mahabodhi Society in Colombo, they reiterated that victims of communal riots in several parts of the Kandy district and elsewhere should be given compensation. The Mahanayake of the Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Dhamma Sabhawa, Most Ven.Ittepane Dhammalankara Thera made an appeal to each and every citizen to exercise restraint and maintain peace.
He said that almost all citizens of the country do not want to see bloodshed and divisions in the country on sectarian grounds.
“All we need to do is to look for all possible ways to lead a happy and peaceful life with religious diversity as its strength,” the Thera said.
Speaking on the occasion, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith called for religious unity in the face of violence.
“We have been together for centuries: Sinhalese, Muslims, Hindus, and Christians,” he said. “We have battled out several battles together, including the Independence struggle. We must continue to preserve that unity.”
“We have to be united in our diversity, especially concerning our religious identity,” he said. Referencing the recent mob attacks against Muslims in communities surrounding Kandy, Cardinal Ranjith said “religion can never justify violence, as the Buddha himself said, and even our own religious founder, Jesus Christ.”
“In fact Islam, the word Islam means, ‘for peace,’” he added. “So we are for peace, all of us are for peace.
Sivasiri Vaidheeshwara Kurukkal said that it is vital to find the core issues to communal unrest and rectify them in order to lead a peaceful life.
He noted that Sri Lanka was able to maintain a good image among international communities after the war and took several measures to restore peace and harmony but incidents like these are destabilizing the reconciliation process of the country.
Former Diplomat Javid Yusuf said that co-existence is not a new thing for Sri Lankans. We have lived together in peace all these years.
“There is no problem between the neighbours or villagers. Creating a communal issue was a motive of a group of individuals and unfortunately they were very successful in implementing their plan. Sri Lankans irrespective of their religions live a peaceful life. There was humanity even in diversity. We should react as Sri Lankans and not based on our religions,” he said.
