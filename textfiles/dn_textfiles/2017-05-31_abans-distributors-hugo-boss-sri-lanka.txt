Abans distributors for HUGO BOSS in Sri Lanka

Abans, a subsidiary of the prestigious Abans Group of Companies, has been announced as the authorised distributor for HUGO BOSS, the first luxury brand to have retail presence in Sri Lanka.
This milestone epitomizes Abans’ commitment towards introducing high-caliber, globally acclaimed brands that add quality, sophistication, and value to the lives of Sri Lankan consumers.
The unique collaboration between Abans and HUGO BOSS has alsospearheaded an all new luxury retail market segment for local clientele, which was previously non-existent in Sri Lanka, by recently unveiling the first ever BOSS Store at Arcade Independence Square.
Both brands are strikingly similar in respect to the fact that they are pioneers that make bold movements in the retail market. For instance, HUGO BOSS has always been the first to venture into new emerging markets such as Myanmar, Cambodia, and now Sri Lanka, whilst Abans has been redefining the retail space within Sri Lanka for over 30 years.
HUGO BOSS further resonates with the globalized fashion preferences of local consumers who usually have to travel outside Sri Lanka to access high-end fashion by featuring an ample assortment of classic apparel and accessories at the BOSS Store. Through this, HUGO BOSS will empower Sri Lankan consumers with the choice of selecting the perfect look for any situation including glamorous events and weddings.
Commenting on Abans’ and HUGO BOSS’ one-of-a-kind partnership, an Abans representative said, “We always focus on partnering with internationally renowned brands that share the same value and belief systems as us. For instance, we collaborated with HUGO BOSS to introduce the first ever luxury retail store in Sri Lanka as we felt that our consumer base was ready to experience a higher level of quality and elegance pertaining to fashion and accessories. Abans further aims to not only revolutionize the local retail market, but also ensure that we offer brands which truly enrich the lives of our consumers.”
You can access the exclusive BOSS and BOSS Green collections by visiting the BOSS store at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo-07.
