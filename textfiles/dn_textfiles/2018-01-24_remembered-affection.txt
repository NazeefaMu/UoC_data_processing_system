Remembered  with affection

Why would anyone get into the hearty, yet heartbreaking, singing business? There must be times when all the agony pays off – when, for instance, you get to stage a strange local ballet without betraying yourself. Rukmani Devi is best known as the local nightingale.
What the majority of the younger generation would not know is that Rukmani Devi was not much conversant in Sinhalese though she voiced lyrics of that language. That remains not to be a talent, but a legacy. Probably why the younger generation still follows her songs knowingly or unknowingly.
A big secret is that singing quietly requires just as much air as singing loudly. Singing quietly is also a lot harder to sustain than singing loudly, because for loud sounds you can use projection to make your voice carry. With singing quietly, you have to sustain your voice with breathing and air supply rather than projection. So during a quiet passage, or in a more tender song like a ballad, make sure you remember to breathe!
Rukmani Devi had the best technique and most consistent live vocal performances. You may have listened to many older, revered solo artists, who may have incredible expression and great technique as well, and other current solo artists and groups, but Rukmani Devi is still better vocally. Her technique and resulting sound is consistently on pitch, resonant and free of strain. Her warm timbre just makes everything that much better.
She had amazing pitch control and good vocal range, but most importantly it is her diction and pronunciation of words that Rukmani Devi stand out, never slurring or pronouncing them in a strange manner.
A grand musical concert was organised at the Tower Hall to commemorate Rukmani Devi recently. Sri Lanka Sakala Kala Association President Sriyani Disanayaka has now made it a custom to organise a concert, on an annual basis, in memory of the legendary songstress. Dissanayake, herself a veteran dancer, singer and actress sang about 25 songs of Rukmani Devi. She was accompanied by H R Soysa, Upali Kannangara, Ishak Beig and Extreme Youth Association Maharagama. Amali Star Dance Guild was responsible for choreography. Priyanka Perera and Sri Mal Liyanage compered the event.
The proceeds of the concert will be channelled to the neglected, disabled and forgotten soldiers, underprivileged children, and to repair the Rukmani Devi monument. A standing ovation was delivered with a thundering applause from the audience when the song Nili Rajina Kokilawi Tribute was sung by Sriyani Dissanayake, of which the lyrics were composed by Dr Ajantha Ranasinghe.
The silent, yet mesmerized, audience really enjoyed the soft singing, music and heart-soothing lyrics voiced by Sriyani Dissanayake. These songs were indeed meaningful in contrast to noisy songs and music heard in today’s platforms.
