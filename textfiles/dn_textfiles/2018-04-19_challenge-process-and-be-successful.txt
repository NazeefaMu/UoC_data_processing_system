From crisis to sustenance – Part 23
Challenge  the process  and be successful

Let’s get right to it - history is useful for many things, but the experience and wisdom acquired from days gone by should be a springboard to the future, not an excuse for living in the past. Smart leaders simply don’t waste precious resources on refining initiatives – they invest in reimagination efforts. Leaders would be well served to apply reimagination to all aspects of their business, but particularly with regard to constantly reimagining how they lead.
Leaders venture out and are not afraid to challenge the status quo. They step into the unknown, looking for opportunities to grow, innovate and inspire. All the stories collected by Kouzes & Posner involved leaders facing a challenge – and no one claimed a personal best by keeping things the same.
Leaders who challenge the process are willing to challenge the system to get new products, processes, services and systems adopted – even if there is a risk of failure. And if they do fail, they learn quickly from their actions.
Anything in business can be improved, everything can be reimagined, and many things can flat out be eliminated. The trick is knowing what items to focus on. While the following list is clearly not exhaustive, it identifies 9 things all leaders should challenge:
 
1. Challenge the Foundation - Bad things happen when your foundation is shaky. If the core values, vision, and strategy aren’t sound and aligned, everything else will suffer. If you don’t have a clearly articulated direction and purpose, how can you expect to achieve the right outcomes? The best leaders stand for something bigger than themselves, and they’re driven by more than just profit motive. They understand the value of a purpose driven business. If what I’ve just said doesn’t make any sense, it’s time to start the reimagination process.
 
2. Challenge the destination - Leadership isn’t destination based – it’s a continuum. Great leaders think beyond the outcome. They think about what if and what’s next. They don’t get trapped in the journey to a specific destination but remain in constant search of discovery in order to seek new and better opportunities.
 
3. Challenge the promise - Is your brand promise on target? Is it deliverable? Is it sustainable? If you cannot keep your promise to customers, you won’t have much of a business to worry about. Few things hinder the advance of a business like a brand in need of a refresh.
 
4. Challenge the model - Not all business models are created equal. Furthermore, just because you have a business model doesn’t mean it’s the right one, or that it’s sustainable. Break the business model down from the revenue engine all the way down to the distribution model and delivery strategy. Does it afford you a competitive advantage moving forward, or does it need to be reimagined?
 
5. Challenge the information – Not all inputs are created equal. Don’t think big data – think good data. Smart leaders understand there’s a difference between gut instincts, data, information and knowledge. Furthermore, as much as some don’t want to hear this, opinion and theory aren’t always synonymous with fact and reality. Agendas and bias often pervade the information flow, so trust and credibility must factor in when assessing information quality.
Always challenge the information but recognize there’s a difference between being a skeptic and being discerning. Lastly, it’s always worth reimagining how you process information to yield better decisions.
 
6. Challenge the organization - I’ve been around long enough to see almost every type of organizational design come and go, only to come again. A great example of this would be Matrix organizations, or what I call the corporate version of the Matrix Trilogy. The Matrix model has been around for nearly 30 years.
While many organizations have killed the Matrix, some have readopted it, others have remained trapped in the Matrix for decades, but virtually every large enterprise using it is over-matrixed. I can think of no better target for reimagination than the Matrix. Where’s Neo when you need him? For those of you not trapped in the Matrix, you’re not off the hook. Any organizational structure can be reimagined and improved.
 
7. Challenge the culture - Every organization has a culture. Some are carefully created and curated by design, and others evolve by default. Some are toxic; some are barely surviving on life support, while others are healthy and vibrant. The bottom line is culture can be a significant asset or a tremendous liability. The thing about cultural dynamics is they can change very rapidly – either in your favor or against it. Leaders who fail to constantly challenge cultural norms and constructs are failing themselves and those they lead.
 
8. Challenge the talent - Many things benefit from compromise, but talent is not one of them. If you settle for anything less than acquiring, deploying, developing, and retaining the best talent possible, shame on you.
I’ve often said, leaders deserve the teams they build. If you cannot seamlessly mobilize and deploy the best talent to your greatest opportunities or your biggest risks you have a problem.
If succession isn’t an enterprise wide concern there is trouble on the horizon. If leadership development is just a buzzword and not a point of emphasis you won’t remain competitive.
The areas of leadership development, organizational development, and talent acquisition should constantly be challenged and reimagined.
9. Challenge the complex - Don’t fall into the trap of believing sophistication is synonymous with complexity – it’s not.
Great leaders challenge all things complex, and if they’re smart, they look to simplify everything. Whether it’s strategy, organization, process, or execution, if it’s complex it needs to be reimagined.
Opportunities
Leaders have to search for opportunities by seeking innovative ways to change, grow, and improve. Each leader has to ask himself, ‘How do I go to work today and do something that will move the enterprise and myself another step in the right direction?” Although there has never been a time when a company could rest on its laurels and survive, it is even truer today that if you are holding your own, everyone else will be passing you by.
To search for opportunities, leaders must use the four essentials:
1. Seize the initiative
To be effective on the battlefield, or the boardroom you must gain and maintain the initiative. It is essential to make your competition react to you, not you to them. Once initiative is lost, all control of the situation goes to your opponent.
2. Make challenge meaningful
This ties right back into “Inspire a Shared Vision.” When people understand why they are doing things, they buy into it and are much more motivated to accomplish their objectives.
3. Innovate and create
Routine work drives out non-routine work and smothers to death all creative planning, all fundamental change in any institution.
4. Look outward for fresh ideas
We need to leave behind the Not Invented Here (NIH) attitude.
There are all kinds of sources of information and knowledge that we have not yet tapped into. Continually question the status quo and look to see how others are handling their challenges. Experiment and take risks by constantly generating small wins and learning from mistakes.
Behaviors that derail the Challenge
Challenge the Process is more easily preached than practiced, often resulting in a strong feeling of hypocrisy about leaders. On numerous occasions, people have told me, “My boss says she wants us to be creative, challenge the status quo, and think outside the box. But when we question why certain work must be done the way it is being suggested, we hear something akin to, “If you have a problem with it, no one is forcing you to work here!”
How would you translate that message? It can certainly come across as controlling, duplicitous, and quite disabling to creative efforts. It is usually much easier for you to challenge something you believe needs improving, than to have others challenge something you believe does not.
There will always be operations in an organization that are untouchable at the moment. But, you will lose your credibility as a leader if you declare yourself immune to change or your favorite things off limits to the scrutiny of others.
Sometimes, the practice is communicated as “challenge only the little things.” There are organizations that seem to allow people to dabble, tweak, fine-tune, or slightly improve, but any change that might be considered too big is off limits. There is nothing at all wrong with continuous improvement. It just does not require the same degree of leadership that more ambitious opportunities call for.
Inherent in this practice is the need to experiment and take risks. Challenge the Process is never completely safe. Remember, if there is no chance of failure, there would be no risk taking, only sure thing taking. Leaders must continue to work at creating an environment which promotes the taking of a few chances.
Challenging the process is not “something else” that people need to do, on their own time. It is the only way to keep up with change occurring every day—from competitors, technology, economic conditions or whatever. If change is not done by you, it will be done to you, and leaders know on which side of that statement they most want to be.
