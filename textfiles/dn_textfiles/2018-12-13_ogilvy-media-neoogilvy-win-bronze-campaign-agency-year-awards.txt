Ogilvy Media, [email protected] win Bronze at  Campaign Agency of the Year Awards

Ogilvy Media, premier media agency, and [email protected], a leading digital agency in Sri Lanka,were awarded the ‘Rest of South Asia Media Agency of the Year – Bronze’ and the ‘Rest of South Asia Digital Agency of the Year – Bronze’ at the recently concluded South Asia leg of the Campaign Agency of the Year Awards 2018 in Mumbai, India.
The award entrants are judged on the overall performance of the agency business, the objectives set out at the beginning of the year, the strategies adopted to accomplish these objectives and most importantly the results achieved at the end of the relevant 12 month period.
Key criteria considered include business growth, innovations and new initiatives, client and talent retention, as well as recognition received and industry initiatives introduced.
The Ogilvy Media entry highlighted how the agency embraced change to adapt and succeed in one of its most challenging years yet. In addition to adverse macro and micro economic factors,higher media inflation, rapid changes in the media landscape, and client demand for higher effectiveness at a lower cost saw most agencies responding with a price war with an increased media commoditization. However, Ogilvy Media’s approach revolved around six key strategy pillars which prioritised on preventing any possible decline in business while upholding its uniqueness in planning excellence and service quality.
Through this, the agency was able to achieve outstanding results in client retention, business acquisition, staff development and retention, and innovation – as well as becoming the most awarded agency at the Effie Awards Sri Lanka 2017.
The [email protected] entry focused on the agency’s two-fold approach to address the exponential evolution of digital platforms, as well as to developing talent.One of the key strategies saw the forming of strategic partnerships with digital platforms such as Facebook and Eskimi and regulatory agencies such as ICTA, providing [email protected] with a two-steps-ahead advantage.
“With the advent of new media, the current environment is both stimulating and challenging. In this context, the key to being a sustainable and growing business is adaptability and innovation. These were central in our approach not only to our business, but in our service offering to clients as well as managing our people. I am extremely proud of the effort by the team at Ogilvy Media this past year, and honoured to be recognised by this regional accolade,” said Lalith Sumanasiri, Managing Director of Ogilvy Media and [email protected].
“The digital landscape in Sri Lanka is an exciting one, but its growth needs to be understood and anticipated in order to remain successful. I truly appreciate all the work put in by the team at [email protected] last year, and dedicate this award to their untiring efforts,” said Amitha Amarasinghe, Chief Operating Officer, [email protected].
