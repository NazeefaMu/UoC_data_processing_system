Aathumunai Road in disrepair

Aathimunai Road in the Pottuvil Divisional Secretariat Division in the Ampara District is in disrepair.
The road is full of pot-holes which turn into muddy puddles on rainy days, inconveniencing motorists and pedestrians.
About 300 farmer families in the surrounding areas of the road in Pottuvil DS division undergo hardships transporting their produce to the town. Schoolchildren attend Kavivaanan M.A. Abdul Azees Vidyalaya with much difficulty.
Affected villagers urge authorities to take steps to reconstruct the dilapidated road.
