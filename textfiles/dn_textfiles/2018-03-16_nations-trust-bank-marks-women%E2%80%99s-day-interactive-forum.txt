Nations Trust Bank marks Women’s Day with an interactive forum

The life of the successful modern woman is often a delicate balancing act between work and home. Understanding this dynamic in detail and learning from the experiences of others can help young women looking to build a career for themselves.
In this light and to mark Women’s Day, Nations Trust Bank recently organized a forum for young career professionals within its ranks to engage with successful senior women leaders, of which the bank has many.
Five women speakers delivered inspiring talks about their own journeys to success and this was followed by an active Q & A session, with young women who are building careers at Nations Trust Bank engaging with the speakers.
The speakers, all in top ranking positions within the bank, have successfully navigated the delicate balancing act of building a successful career, whilst maintaining a fulfilling home and private life.
Renuka Fernando – Director/Chief Executive Officer, Ramanika Unamboowe Executive Vice President Human Resources , Shaan Wickremasinghe –Senior Vice President Marketing, Kushlani Allis –Vice President Management Reporting & Planning and Tilani Mendis- Senior Manager, Panadura Branch spoke about ‘Building Confidence in Yourself as a Woman’, ‘How to Meet the Challenge of Continuously Building Skills and Knowledge’, ‘What Women Leaders Bring to the Table Vis a Vis Men’, ‘Do We Need to Make Personal Choices along the way as Women’ and ‘Balancing Home & Work as a Young Mother’, respectively.
Speaking about the event, Shaan Wickremasinghe-Senior Vice President Marketing said, “At Nations Trust we seek to create an environment conducive to career building for everyone. Part of this effort is addressing issues that are particular to women and what better time to provide a platform for this discussion than Women’s Day. ”
Nations Trust Bank conducts numerous internal events to develop their staff and this forum was one such initiative. What set it apart was its focus on women’s concerns and the fact that it provided a platform for young women to speak about matters that are important to them and that often remain unaddressed.
