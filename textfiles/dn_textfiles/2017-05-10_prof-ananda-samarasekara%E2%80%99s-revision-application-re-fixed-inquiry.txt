Prof. Ananda Samarasekara’s revision application re-fixed for inquiry

The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrate’s Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for July 7 by Colombo High Court.
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents. At a previous occasion, former Colombo Chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen. On September 15, 2016 Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
