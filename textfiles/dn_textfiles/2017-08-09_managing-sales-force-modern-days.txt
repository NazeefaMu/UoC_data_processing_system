Managing the Sales Force in Modern Days

Sales management as a profession has gone up more prominently particularly with the progressions that have been occurring in the economy.
Sales Managers react to changes in nature by implementing new methodologies and strategies to improve Sales Capability. Sales Management reacts to new difficulties by perceiving the significance of expert capabilities. In this article, we discuss few strategies and responsibilities which revolves around sales managers in modern days.
Management is defined as a process of planning, organizing, directing, motivating, coordinating and controlling the activities where the same principles can be applied to managing the sales team in a most efficient and effective manner. In fact, in term of the functions of sales management in modern days, the sales manager needs to focus, define, allocate, monitor progress, take corrective action and make sure each activity is accomplished successfully.
Sales managers’ role in research
In the management role of sales, the responsibility to achieve the organizational corporate objective is by the way of achieving the functional objective (target). Furthermore, sales objectives are translated into sales targets which are a quantifiable measure where the sales manager needs to be a researcher to understand the market potential accurately.
In addition, the competition, the behaviours of products and brands, the sales potential of the market, customer needs and market conditions changes that take place over a period of time need to be explored and investigated by the sales manager.
Meanwhile, the sales target setting will be discussed in detail in “Sales forecasting”, but most of the time it is observed that sales managers focus on their routine activities and less priority is given to market research or completely neglected at most of the times.
Furthermore, in some instances the sales managers view in setting up the sales targets in a narrow aspect where targets are set based on the previous month or same month last year achievements. Also, the achievement is looked at only by the numbers, but not the other market conditions which were favorable or non-favourable towards the achievements of previous year or the month.
Meanwhile, if the sales manager expect to enjoy the performance in the current year as a benchmark to the previous year, it is also needed to make sure the competencies of the sales team, commitment, level of motivation and maturity level of the sales people is also bench marked accordingly.
Manpower planning
For example, in most of the cases in sales consultations, it is evident in certain cases that sales have not increased by substantial percentage over a period, but when assessed, it is seen that most of the time the sales efficiency or per sales person contribution has been declined, in fact, most of the time the sales manager does not take much interest to look into this setback. As a result, we need to emphasize that sales manager’s need to focus and allocate more time on research of sales environment which can create some better results on achieving the targets and maintain the sales costs.
Market conditions and sales competencies
Many external factors could create an impact on sales volumes. The government regulations, political stability, technological changes, climatic conditions, economical surrounding, and also social conditions can have an impact on own and competitor sales volumes. Also the customer preference could be changed over time.
Accordingly the capability and the competency requirements of the sales people have been changed over a period. If the sales manager fails to research on these circumstances, all the activities carried out will be a waste. Sales manager need to take the leadership in matching the sales competencies of the sales force to the requirements of the market and monitor performance closely otherwise, the sales manager will realize the mistake after some times when it comes to monthly or annual review or at target setting for the next financial year.
Sales Managers role in anticipation
Marketing is defined as the management process which identifies & anticipates the customer needs to satisfy them at a profit to the organization in a socially responsible manner. By all means, where the same responsibility and the accountability remain with the sales manager to implement the marketing definition to anticipate the needs and wants of the customer, distributor, retailer and the channel partners.
Especially when it comes to achieving the organizationalgoals, the sales managers highly depend on the channels and business partners including the distributors and retailers. Distributor as an investor and businessman his concern is mainly on ROI, and we see most of the time the sales managers knowledge and competency level on finance management, financial concepts and reporting is not substantial and as a result failing to respond, negotiate, and convince the distributor’s concerns. Also seen some distributors are investors only but not entrepreneurs. The sales manager should be smart enough to answer the distributor concerns from the (win-win) business perspective.
The retailer's point of view is also the same, and if the sales manager is vigilant of the retailer perceptions, a proper competitor analysis and competitor benefits analysis to the retailer is done, most of the time it is possible to create an interest generating or convincing story (what’s in it for me) for the retailer. Without which it is not possible to create a reason for retailer to promote, sell our own products and services. We all know we as customers buy the benefits not the features. As a result, the sales manager needs to assist the sales force with a proper benefit realization model for convincing the channel. Henceforth, the sales manager anticipation regarding the situations will assist for early preparation.
Sales manager is an organiser
In marketing STP means, targeting the right segment and deliver all marketing strategies towards selected targeted customer segment. Sales management is the most prominent in the promotional mix, focusing on segmentation, targeting the sales efforts accordingly to achieve the organizational objectives. Understanding the right market segment of the customer is critical in B 2 B and B 2 C markets. In B 2 B market at most times we see the lack of knowledge of the sales person to handle the customers, buyers or the influencers. For certain technical products most of the time the sales manager fits in with the knowledge and the skills, but the issue is with the persuasion, selling and the basic interpersonal skills. In such situations the sales manager holds a major responsibility in balancing the capabilities
In such situations, the sales manager holds a primary responsibility in making sure there is a balance of capabilities. Also in B 2 C markets we find that understanding the segments, and customization of the offers. If we analyse the retail markets, in modern trade we can find the the bigger packages (1 kg or 1.5 liters), whereas in small retail shops in rural and extreme interiors availability of smaller sachets and packs. Though it is the distribution strategy of the organization, the management and execution of such strategy is a fundamental requirement of the sales manager. Allocating the sales efforts and the level of service frequency assigned to each segment of the customers or retailers is critical in terms of maximizing the opportunity for sales. In one of the B 2 B team discussions, a concern came up from one of the sales team was that the time is a constraint to visit the existing base, service them and to answer their telephone calls and to attend to their requirements and concerns. In a situation like this, it’s difficult to think of a sales funnel and more prospects. The take home for the sales manager is that if the salesman is in this mind-set the probability of achieving the organizational objectives and goals will be very low. The sales manager needs to be extremely vigilant of the allocation of sales efforts and managing efforts while keeping the focus on resource enhancement wherever required for the best efficiency and output.
Sales controlling and evaluations
Planning and control go as an integrated unit whereas Sales objectives are assessed to inspect where we stand today, how we set out, where we are going, and how to reach there. Sales plans are analyzed alongside approaches and techniques. The control procedure begins by setting up the execution measures. The real execution is then measured. The outcomes are contrasted and the models set. Varieties are profoundly inspected. Lastly, corrective action is made to solve the issue. Salespersons are in charge of controlling the individual effort exerted of the hierarchical units they head. The purpose of this control is to guarantee that business office targets come with as little wasted energy which could be expected under the circumstances. Salespersons begin by exploring the individual sales objectives of the firm and resolving the shortcomings likewise, setting quantitative principles against which to measure performance.
If the sales manager only evaluates and keep records of daily targets vs. actual by the sales team, it is not leading to any performance improvement but only recording the day-to-daysales figures. It is necessary to evaluate all possible drawbacks and any loss opportunities that the salesman is experiencing by having a closer evaluation on all efficiency KPI’s.
Salesforce planning and supervision
To be an exceptional sales manager who is performing and maintaining a high efficiency like recruitment, selection, training, and utilization. The question most of the time is recruitment the function of the sales manager or the human resource manager. Even though this is the key accountability of the sales manager, who is an expert in understanding the right type of Sales person required for the market.
The same number of extensive organizations utilizing many offers toSalespeople is on the expansion, the requirement for managers whose sole task is to regulate the fieldoffering exercises of the Sales people is getting to be plainly unavoidable. The discoveries of the investigation are pre-empted to wind up evidently a base of deciding the sum and nature of supervision to be given to the business as a component of the organization's vital promoting plan. Obviously, these sales reps have gotbroad preparing, and rectifying the issue would be more affordable than reusing them. To limit of the conceivable separation suits, the discoveries of the examination would have the capacity to direct sales supervisors to ensure that they have done everything to motivating them.
Techniques of Selection
In sales force planning, supervision and selection the sales manager need to be extremely skillful. Given if the right choiceis made,close supervision can lead towards the organizational objectives as the leadership characteristics of the sales manager.
The sales manager’s role as a leader, mentor, consultant and coach to the team israre in modern sales organizations.
As a result one may argue the productivity and morale of the sales force are damaged by the sales leadership. The salesman is a human, and most of the time the sales manager tends to forget the fact that managing the motivation and managing the emotions of the sales team could generate better results than being policeman behind the salesman. Consequently, Proper training and socialization between the sales team can create harmony within the team and overall managing ofthe staffing function will contribute, in achieving the salesman objectives.
To emphasize, McGregor who formulated the X & Y theory suggested that any organization will have two types of sales people conversely the X type of sales people who will need more supervision, close monitoring and dislike work. On the other hand, the Y type ofsalespeople who are more proactive, work with passion and they don’t need pushing to perform.
The sales manager needs to understand these two types of sales people, and if the correct approach is not made to handle these two categories of sales people the effort of managing the sales force will not be successful.
Effective recruitment and selection of salespeople is a standout amongst the most crucial tasks of sales management. It involves discovering individuals who fit the position required by a firm. Along these lines, enlistment and determination of staff start with a deliberately created work examination.
We will further discuss in the next weeks some of the other management areas of the sales manager for the modern day’s sales management.
