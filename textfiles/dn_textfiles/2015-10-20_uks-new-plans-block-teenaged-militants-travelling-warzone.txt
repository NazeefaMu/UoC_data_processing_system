UK's new plans to block teenaged militants travelling to warzone

UK: British parents worried that their 16 and 17-year-old children might travel to Syria or Iraq under the influence of militants will be able to apply to have their passports removed, Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday.
He will say that defeating Islamist extremism "will be the struggle of our generation" as he reveals new laws to disrupt radicals operating in Britain.
Under the current passport rules, parents can apply to have the passports of under-16s removed by the authorities.
However, Mr Cameron will say this will now be extended to under-18s amid fears that terror groups such as Islamic State are using social media websites like Twitter to radicalise teens and convince them to travel to Syria. Mr Cameron will say the measures are to be included in a new anti-extremism bill containing a range of measures.
"A key part of this new approach is going further to protect children and vulnerable people from the risk of radicalisation by empowering parents and public institutions with all the advice, tools and practical support they need," he is expected to say.
The new measures are aimed at disrupting a steady stream of young Britons lured by the Islamic State's radical ideology to join the militant group fighting in the Middle East.
As part of the plan, extremist Islamists and hate preachers will be treated like paedophiles and banned from all contact with children, Mr Cameron will announce. .
He will also announce sweeping new powers for the Disclosure and Barring Service to ensure that anyone with a conviction for terrorist or extremist activity is automatically banned from working with children and vulnerable people - in the same way as those convicted of sexual offences against children.
