Prelude to 1956 General Election

The infamous speech by a junior minister in the UNP government that vernacular teachers can afford to live with a lower salary as they did not eat cheese or ham-bacon like ‘refined, extraordinary’ teachers in the English medium, cost them heavily with Sinhala educated middle class voting en masse for Bandaranaike, while Tamil teachers voted for Federal party. The schools then had been categorized language-wise as Sinhala and English. Teachers in English schools were placed on a higher scale compared to the rest, compelling the aggrieved to agitate for parity.
Language policy was keenly committed on the stage. For the first time in country’s history communal feelings among the different communities was deliberately instigated by Sinhalese politicians for gaining political advantage. The move was spear-headed by the SWRD Bandaranaike led SLFP campaign in 1956. The consequences of this campaign contributed to the flare-up, decades later to a civil war.
UNP’s response to salary anomaly of Sinhala teachers
The UNP government of John Kotelawala in 1956 had been fast losing strength. Poor economic performance, neglect of rural masses, Kotelawala’s elitist style of governance contributing to it. The general mood back in 1956, had fashioned a proper atmosphere for taking strong actions against religious and social injustices to village folk. A neglected lot who expected a change in society were a number of intelligentsia such as non-English speaking teachers, Ayurvedic practitioners, peasants and Bhikkus who were brought up under conventional local culture.
The people had been eagerly waiting to grab an opportunity for social transformations and restructuring. Almost all top posts of the plantation industry were packed with well-paid Europeans. A minority of English educated affluent Sinhalese and Tamils descending from high-class families in Colombo and Jaffna were absorbed in to positions of the public sector, which was considered a matter of pride. The living standards of the people was far below the satisfactory level. Withdrawal of rice subsidiary in 1953, which the ordinary masses considered their birth right, poor health conditions, inadequate housing, messy education, unemployment made the situation worse. In his report to the UNP annual sessions, Sir Ukwatte Jayasundera, the party secretary stated, “Everything is ready to face the election, we have adequate resources, and the backing of the bureaucracy, with the men, machinery and necessary spirit.” He said, “Sir John, is an undisputed leader, terror of the idler.” The Matara Local Government polls and the Buttala and Aluthnuwara by-election victories gave them confidence. This prompted Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala to dissolve the Parliament an year ahead of scheduled date early in February 1956.
Bandaranaike’s new party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party championed a popular socialist platform, promised to make Sinhala the official language. The UNP who hitherto defended the rights of Tamil speaking minority, mader the biggest blunder by changing its stance in early 1956 to fall in line with SLFP. Bandaranaike responded with a ‘smart’ slogan; “Sinhala only in 24 hours.” The Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party campaigned for parity of status between Sinhala and Tamil, with both to jointly replacing English as the official language.
The Tamil parties supported the Marxist in claiming parity of status or to keep English as the official language. Bandaranaike was passionate in forming an alliance with the Bhasha Peramuna of W. Dahanayake and several independent groups like IMRA Iriyagolla, T. B. Subasinghe who came forward to extend their support. SLFP entered into a coalition with a group of small parties that included Philip Gunawarden’s VLSSP forming the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) on February 21, 1956 under the leadership of SWRD Bandaranaike, the defected former UNP second-in- command.
Addressing a rally on the eve of election, PM Kotelawala said, “the UNP is the only party that can implement Sinhalese only but in implementing this programme still ensure justice and fairplay for all communities, as it has built up traditions of tolerance and fairplay. The MEP on the other hand, has within its ranks fanatical and dangerous ultra-nationalists who will plunge this happy country of ours into a communal strife and discord.”
New language policy
Bandaranaike having realized that it was impossible to defeat UNP without the support of left parties took the initiative to open negotiations with major opposition groups to reach a consensus on a no-contest pact. Tamil MPs and Cabinet Ministers demanded Sir John to review its new language policy to no avail, since it was suicidal to the UNP at the impending General Election. They did not falter to accuse Sir John Kotelawala’s UNP government with linguistic bias and tendered their resignations. Under Sir John’s premiership 1952--1956, the space between the UNP and the ordinary people widened. He failed to evaluate the emergence of economic, language and cultural revival movement.
At one point Sir John declared that he would continue to be the Prime Minister even if he won only 10 seats in the parliament. The opposition did not hesitate to point out that Sir John had already admitted his defeat and accused him of planning a fascist coup.
In the North and parts of East the campaign was centred on the Federal Party [established in 1949 by S. J. V. Chelvanayagam as a breakaway group of Tamil Congress-TC] and TC led by G. G. Ponnambalam. The reason for this division was GG’s decision to enter D. S. Senanayaka’s Cabinet. In 1952 only two Federal party members entered Parliament, but the Tamil Congress secured four seats out of seven. However, by 1956 the FP became more popular and it emerged as the most powerful Tamil Party. The Federal Party used this opportunity to convince Tamils on the harmful effects of ‘Sinhala Only’ official language.
There were many differences in political interests between Muslims and Tamils. Muslims at the time considered that Tamils enjoyed more privileges in the educational sphere than the Muslims. M. A. Abdul Majid the independent candidate for Kalmunai declared his support to Bandaranaike’s party and he openly condemned Federalism. A. H. Macan Marker, an independent contestant for Kalkudah opposed the Federal Party. However, the Muslim factor was not so dominant during the election time of 1956. The majority of Muslims was in favour of the Sinhala Only Policy.
The majority of the daily papers were sympathetic to the UNP except one Sinhala daily.
The Eksath Bhikku Peramuna led by dynamic Buddhist monks, Ven. Yakkaduwe Pragnarama Thera, Ven. Walpola Rahula Thera, Ven. Baddegama Wimalawansa Thera, Ven. Henpitigedera Gnanasiha Thera of Ratnapura and Buddharakkitha of Kelaniya were the leaders of the Bhikku Peramuna. They presented an action programme shortly before the election to Bandaranaike advocating:
‘Implement the Buddhist Commission Report; promote the revival of our arts and craft; take steps to make Sinhala the official language of the country; bring about a fair distribution of wealth; promote Ayurveda and all other aspects of our national heritage and the return to a simpler way of life and refuse government assistance to all institutions that promote communal disharmony or which destroy peace and equality among the people’.
The MEP had a setback when two members of Parliament, Bernard Aluvihare, grandfather of present two UNP junior ministers, and a former Secretary of the party and H.B. Tenne left the party shortly before the handing over of nominations for the 1956 elections to contest on the UNP ticket and lost the seat. In fact Matale was the first result to be announced.
