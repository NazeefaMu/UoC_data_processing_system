Manohar steps down as BCCI president

NEW DELHI: Shashank Manohar on Tuesday stepped down as BCCI president barely seven months after being appointed for a second term in place of the late Jagmohan Dalmiya and is all set to take over as first independent chairman of ICC.
Manohar leaves at a time when the board is being directed to comply with the Supreme Court-appointed Justice Lodha panel's reform recommendations. In a letter addressed to Thakur, Manohar said, “I hereby tender my resignation with immediate effect from the post of President of Board of Control for Cricket in India. I also resign with immediate effect as the representative of BCCI on the International Cricket Council, as also the Asian Cricket Council on which I was nominated by the General Body of BCCI. I thank all my colleagues and the staff for their support and cooperation during my tenure.
I wish all of you all the very best in taking the cause of Cricket to greater heights.”According to reliable sources, BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur is being tipped to take over the hot seat. PTI
