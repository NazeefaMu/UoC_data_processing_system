Ampara steps up anti-dengue programme

 
The Ampara district has stepped up its anti-dengue drive, and in addition to fogging and awareness programmes, Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) are conducting house-to-house inspections.
The PHIs are thoroughly inspecting houses and taking legal action against any persons found to be guilty of having mosquito breeding grounds.
