Keen tussle  at Dambulla to  gain upper hand

 
A keen tussle to gain the upper hand was on in the decisive third and final 4-day unofficial test between Sri Lanka A and West Indies A played at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
By stumps on the second day West Indies A replying to Sri Lanka A’s first innings of 318 had made 183 for four wickets to trail by 135 runs with six first innings wickets in hand.
Sri Lanka A resuming at their overnight total of 272-7 added a further 46 runs for their remaining three wickets to be dismissed for 318.
Left-arm fast bowler Delorn Johnson took two of the wickets to finish with figures of 4 for 65 but not before West Indies A were frustrated by a last wicket stand of 32 between Kasun Madushanka (20) and Lahiru Gamage (12 n.o.).
Roshen Silva who resumed at 40 failed to complete his half-century being dismissed for 49 by edging a catch behind the wicket to Jahmar Hamilton to give Kemar Roach his only wicket.
West Indies A began poorly losing both openers to be 35 for 2, but a superb knock of 94 off 93 balls from 19-year-old Guyanian Shimron Hetmyer steadied the innings.
Hetmyer who stroked 17 fours in his delightful knock shared a century stand with his skipper Shamarh Brooks who was unbeaten on 43 at the close. The three-match series is tied at one-all.
