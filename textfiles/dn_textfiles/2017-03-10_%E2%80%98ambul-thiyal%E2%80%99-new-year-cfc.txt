‘Ambul Thiyal’ for New Year by CFC

The Ceylon Fisheries Corporation has decided to cook ‘Ambul Thiyal’ for sale during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year season at its outlets countrywide.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Development Ministry said in a release that already, corporation marketing centres in Gampaha sell the ‘Ambul Thiyal’ preparation. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had directed corporation Chairman Jagath Perera to introduce this to corporation marketing centres in other parts of the country as well. He has directed him to introduce women in fishery families to take up ‘Ambul Thiyal’ preparation as a means of self-employment.
The release said since the corporation had introduced a scheme to make on-the-spot fish purchases from fishermen at the beach itself, ‘Balaya’ and other tuna varieties would be used for the preparation of ‘Ambul Thiyal’.
