Belleza Italiana

 
With the Sinhala and Tamil New-year in sight, Tiesh proudly presented Belleza Italiana (Italian Beauty), a new collection comprising modern, specially imported Italian Filigree jewellery with intricate and exquisite Craftsmanship.
Tiesh hosted a Champagne evening, a ladies only event for all their extremely loyal female clientele who have supported them over the past 12 months.
"Belleza Italiana is a collection specially imported from the best manufacturers in Italy with the Sri Lankan modern lady in mind. Each and every item is unique and different to one another and most will have a special transformative aspect where it could be worn either as a necklace or a bracelet. Our very special ring which transforms into a Bangle is by far my favorite item from our new collection and I think a must have this season", Tiesh Director Ayesh De Fonseka speaking to Daily News said.
The new range comprises necklaces, bracelets, earrings, pendants, rings and special transformative jewellery and is quite different from all other collections that Tiesh carries in their beautiful showroom in Kollupitiya. While most of Tiesh's items are usually embellished or studded with beautiful diamonds and Sri Lankan Sapphires and Gemstones, this collection has been created with the intention of capturing the raw beauty of pure gold. Most items in the new collection are in 22kt and 18kt Gold - Yellow, White and the ever-so-popular Rose Gold. Belleza Italiana tantalizes and appeals to the visual and creative sense of the discerning woman.
Tiesh is a highly focused family entrepreneurship with a three decade heritage of high quality jewellery and impeccable craftsmanship. Lasantha, Bryony, Thiyasha and Ayesh De Fonseka believe in a hands-on approach to ensure that every piece is unique and thus truly special.
Located at Duplication Road in Kollupitiya, opposite the Liberty Arcade, Tiesh is not only a jewellery store with a reputation to match, it is a destination frequented by large numbers of local and foreign visitors alike.
