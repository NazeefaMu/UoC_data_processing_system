Development of inland fishing industry:
Process underway in 26 tanks

Development activities of the inland fishery industry is currently being carried out in 26 tanks in the Walawe zone of the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Development Authority. The said tanks include Uda Walawe, Chandrika Wewa, Urusita Wewa, Kiri-Ibban Wewa, Andiyagama Wewa, Kachchigala Wewa and Habaralu Wewa.
The Mahaweli Authority is at present, providing the necessary impetus to inland fishermen by supplying fishing nets, boats and other equipment on easy payment terms. Two agriculture stations at Udawalewa and near the Urusita wewa, are currently providing the fingerlings.
The popular fish varieties are prawns and carp. Nearly 3,000 fisher families who had gained membership in inland fishery societies attached to the respective tanks, had gained successful income avenues through inland fishing, Walawe Zone Project Manager A. L. Osmund de Silva said.
