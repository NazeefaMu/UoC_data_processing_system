Ashwin grabs six as India stun Australia

BANGALORE March 7 Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin grabbed six wickets as India stopped Australia in their tracks to win a fiery second Test and level the series 1-1 on Tuesday.
Australia, needing 188 for victory, were bowled out for just 112 half-an-hour into the final session on day four at Bangalore’s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.
Tempers frayed between the world’s top two ranked sides as the hosts bounced back from a humiliating opening Test defeat in Pune.
Ashwin (6-41), who bagged his 25th five-wicket haul in his 47th Test, took the final wicket of Nathan Lyon, caught and bowled for two, sparking celebrations among the Indian players.
“After losing the first Test the way we did, we wanted to bounce back and not show anyone but ourselves what we are made of,” said India skipper Virat Kohli.
“They showed the intent and the belief that we can win from any position. It was about taking responsibility. The way they showed heart and character, along with the crowd, is unbelievable.” Cheteshwar Pujara (92) and Ajinkya Rahane (52) put on a crucial 118-run partnership for India’s fifth wicket before the Australian bowlers struck back in the morning session.
