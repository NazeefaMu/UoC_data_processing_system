Death for drug-peddling youth

A 23-year-od youth who was found guilty of possessing and peddling 9.41 grams of heroin in 2012 was yesterday sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court.
While handing out a judgement against the accused, High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga observed that the prosecutors have proved the accused’s guilt ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. The accused Ranga Sumith Bandara, a resident of Grandpass in Colombo, had been arrested by the Police Special Task Force on or around August 20, 2012.
The Attorney General (AG) had indicted the accused under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Act No. 13 of 1984.
