Heavy rains and thundershowers in several provinces, districts today

 
Heavy rains and thundershowers of above 100mm are expected at some places, particularly in Central, Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Western and North-western provinces and in Ampara, Batticaloa, Galle and Matara districts, the Meteorology Department said.
The Met. Department said that the prevailing weather condition is due to low level atmospheric disturbance associated with Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (the low pressure zone where the Northern and Southern hemispheric winds meet)in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.
Furthermore they said that there may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers.
The Met. Department urged the public to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by lightning activity.
