Aitken Spence Printing wins at GSK Global Environmental Sustainability Awards

Aitken Spence Printing received the prestigious GSK 2016 Environmental Sustainability Award alongside the US-based DOW Chemical Company.
The awards aim to recognize vendors who excel in the area of sustainability from an international pool of suppliers who work with GSK.
The win marks another milestone for Aitken Spence Printing, the only Carbon neutral printing facility operator in Southeast Asia.
Caroline Ruter of Glaxo Smith Kline said “through Aitken Spence Printing's Integrated Green Supply Chain Strategy, the company has become Carbon neutral.
We were impressed with their holistic approach to sustainability and how embedded it is throughout their company.”
Aitken Spence Printing has committed towards the embedding of the Integrated Green Supply Chain Strategy by making extensive efforts including investments in green technologies to improving processes and enhancing existing technology. In the last year, the company invested in a Carbon neutral offset printing machine, introduced electronic verification and replaced Infrared in the coating machine with hot air.
“We are delighted to have received this award from GlaxoSmithKline for our initiatives in ensuring that the operation we run is sustainable. We have continued over the years to maintain a highly sustainable outlook in every aspect so as to pass on the benefit to our customers when they do business with us. In the present context, environmental and social governance is a priority for all business operations. It is a priority we strive towards everyday” commented Prasanna Karunatilka, Managing Director - Aitken Spence Printing. In recent years, Aitken Spence Printing has won many laurels for achievements in the area of sustainability through the activities conducted to engage the local community.
The company is a subsidiary of Aitken Spence PLC, the only Sri Lankan corporate to be named among the best corporate citizens of the country by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for ten consecutive years.
