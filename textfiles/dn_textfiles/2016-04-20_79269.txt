Mothers’ Monologue

 I am so happy that you, my most consummate of beings living on my body have set aside a day to think of me. International Mother Earth Day. You have also given a day to think of your darling mothers. Remember, they are for all time. One cannot measure a mother's love or speak of her sacrifices by a twenty four hour yardstick just for one day.
My sweet humans, as Mother Earth my love is beyond borders, nationality, creed and colour.
Fauna and flora on my body vary. But they are all the same to me. They make me to be a joyous and living mother.
Please, my children spare a few moments of your time and give ear to me on this beautiful day. I am the mother of both the living and the non living. My body stretches from the summit of Mount Everest to the dark and deep abyss in the Pacific Ocean. On my body are the oceans and land. Mothers are compared to magnets. Mothers attract children, children are attracted to mothers. Magnets attract many metals. As for me, I attract all things – be they terrestrial or celestial, onto my body. My body becomes the final resting place for all things animate and inanimate.
The noble teachers of our world had loving mothers. They have all left their sweet footprints on me, while treading on me, cuddling their sons. Their sons must have clung on to them. Beautiful. I have also been honoured to have been able to kiss the feet of these matters who walked on me preaching their immortal doctrines on compassion, righteousness, forgiveness, love, peace and humility. Yes! I think that I am the most blessed of all mothers.
Within me is water-life giving fresh water, oceans that give sentience and mobility for your journeys to other lands, rivers, water falls, glaciers, valleys, reefs, exquisite flowers, birds, fauna.
Above all you. Beneath my body is untold wealth – oil, gold precious stones and many ores for you to harness and share for the benefit of all, mankind.
I was overjoyed my darlings in seeing you, spread over my body. I thought that you were going to make a golden chain of love encircling me, together with the fauna and flora living on my body. I wanted to hear the patter of the feet of little humans, and all others on my body, the chirping of birds and the flight of butterflies and bees.
Alas! My darling humans, what have you given me You have desecrated my humble body with the pock marks from the shells of missiles and rockets. Also toxic waste, land mines, ammunition dumps, military bunkers and blood soaked dungeons. All this to destroy your own kind, and sadly the innocent animals and plants suffer because of these cruelties. All these have caused my body to shudder and give ......... tsunamis, earthquakes, earthquakes and volcanoes. You have desecrated me by wantonly destroying my natural shape and vegetation. Result is global warming and the drying up of my sources of beautiful water.
Your wars have soaked my body with the blood and tears of gallant young sons and daughters. You commemorate their death by once again firing guns and observing two minutes silence.
You rejoice when yo see the young ones of your opponents die. How many tears have I shed in seeing mothers walking, walking, walking on me, with babes in their arms crying of hunger. At times, these little ones fall off their tired and feeble grasps of their mothers, only to be unintentionally trampled by those followings.
They walk into unknown lands as refugees. It reminds me of two events. The flight into Egypt of Jesus Christ and the Hejire of Mohammed Nabi memories. One hallowed teacher reached His ultimate vision and enlightenment seated on me. The blood of another soaked my body with His blood at the foot of the cross on which he was crucified.
My children, I shudder as a mother when I think of the million of babes, whose cut up pieces are sucked out of their mothers womb and dumped into pails. These pieces and, at times tiny humans about to come into our world are buried inside me. They rollicked happily in their mothers water bag, only to be scattered on my body. Only my small innocent my name bearing, gentle earth warm will bear witness to these tragedies.
You, my beautiful children have set aside a day to think of me. Me, a once happy mother, saddened by the deeds of my lovely humans.
Only you have the ability to know what is right and wrong. Please make this day to think of all those who live on me.
Yes! You speak so much about me. Honouring the motherland, dying for the motherland. Humans call their country of their birth, their motherland. National Anthums mention my name.
Please think of my role in your lives. I am just an abode for you. Please, only you, my darling humans can make me happy.
The only way to make me happy is to abide by the beautiful teachings of your Celestial Matters and, do nob do to others, what you do not wish to be done to yourself, love your neighbour as yourself and wish that peace with all those who are living on me to senile think, with lots of laughter and amity and show me by example that you are my most precious gems.
