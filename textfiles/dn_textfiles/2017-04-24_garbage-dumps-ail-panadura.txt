Garbage dumps ail Panadura

Residents in the Panadura Urban Council and the Pradeshiya Sabha areas are facing a serious health hazard and environmental issues due to local institutions' failure to collect garbage in the city and suburbs.
Adequate steps are not taken in this regard due to the shortage of employees and vehicles at the Panadura Urban Council and the Pradesiya Sabha to collect garbage in the Panadura town, Kehelwatte, and Wadduwa.
The collected garbage was transported to the Garbage Recycling Centre in the Veyangoda area at a cost of Rs 21,000 per tipper lorry to the Panadura Urban Council.
The Panadura Garbage Collecting Centre is filled with garbage at present.
The number of PHI officers deployed in the area is inadequate, the public complain.
This year, over 250 dengue patients were reported from the area, they said.
