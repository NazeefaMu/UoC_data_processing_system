Economy responding to stabilisation measures

Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumers’ Price Index (CCPI), has increased to 5.5 per cent in January 2017 from 4.5 per cent in December 2016, the Central Bank said yesterday.
Core inflation, based on CCPI, also accelerated to 7.0 per cent in January 2017 from 5.8 per cent in December 2016. Headline inflation and core inflation, based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), which is available with a time lag, also reflected an upward trend in December 2016, recording 4.2 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, the CBSL said in its review for January.
In spite of the increase in inflation in recent times, which is mainly attributed to the impact of tax adjustments and the adverse weather conditions, inflation is projected to remain in mid-single digit levels, on average during the year supported by appropriate supply side and demand management policies.
Meanwhile, the year-on-year growth of credit extended to the private sector by commercial banks remained high at 21.9 per cent by end 2016.
In the external sector, the cumulative deficit in the trade balance expanded further to US dollars 8.2 billion during the first eleven months of 2016 from US dollars 7.6 billion during the corresponding period in 2015, as a result of increased import expenditure, amidst the contraction in export earnings. Earnings from tourism and workers’ remittances continued to dampen the adverse impact of the trade deficit on the overall balance of payments.
Earnings from tourism were estimated to have increased by 14.0 per cent to around US dollars 3.4 billion during 2016, while workers’ remittances increased by 3.7 per cent to US dollars 7.2 billion during the year. The realisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows was below expectations in the first nine months of the year, while there were some outflows of foreign investments from the rupee denominated government securities market.
The Monetary Board is of the view that the economy is gradually responding to the stabilisation measures adopted by the Central Bank and the government since late 2015. However, close monitoring of macroeconomic developments is necessary in the period ahead, with a view to adopting further corrective measures, if required.
