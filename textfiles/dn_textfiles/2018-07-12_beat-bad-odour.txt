Beat bad odour

Bad odour does not only come from the underarms. It can originate anywhere there are sebaceous (oil) and sweat glands. This includes the scalp, genitals, feet, and even the nipples. Bad breath is another cause for embarrassment. Banish body odour and bad breath for good with these solutions. 
Best way to help cure foot odour 
Smelly feet are less of a problem socially than underarm body ordour because the unpleasant odour is usually contained by shoes and socks. However, the smell may become obvious if the person with smelly feet visits a home where shoes are taken off before entering, as is the custom in various countries and homes.
 
The following steps may help control foot odour: 
1) Wash your feet at least once a day: Warm water is better at killing bacteria than cold water. Make sure you dry your feet thoroughly afterward, including in between your toes.
2) Socks: They must allow the sweat to evaporate. The best socks are those made of a combination of man-made fibers and wool. Wear a clean pair of socks each day.
3) Shoes: If you wear trainers or shoes with plastic linings make sure it is not for long. A leather lining is better for sweat evaporation. If you have a problem with sweaty feet, do not wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Shoes do not completely dry overnight.
4) Pumice stone: Bacteria thrive on dead skin. If the soles of your feet have patches of dead skin remove them with a pumice stone. These are available to buy online.
5) Deodorants and antiperspirants: Ask your pharmacist for special foot deodorants and antiperspirants. If you have athlete’s foot, you should not use deodorants or antiperspirants. Treat the fungal infection with appropriate medication.
6) Walk around barefoot: Whenever you can, walk around barefoot or at least slip out of your shoes regularly.
 
Causes of bad breath 
Persistent bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth may be a warning sign of gum (periodontal) disease. Gum disease is caused by the buildup of plaque on teeth. Bacteria cause the formation of toxins to form, which irritate the gums. If gum disease continues untreated, it can damage the gums and jawbone.
Get rid of bad breath
Bad breath can be reduced or prevented if you: 
Practice good oral hygiene. Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste to remove food debris and plaque. Brush teeth after you eat (keep a toothbrush at work or school to brush after lunch). Don’t forget to brush the tongue, too. Replace your toothbrush every two to three months or after an illness.
Use floss or an interdental cleaner to remove food particles and plaque between teeth once a day. Rinse with an antibacterial mouthwash twice a day. Dentures should be removed at night and cleaned thoroughly before being placed in your mouth the next morning. See your dentist regularly - at least twice a year. He or she will conduct an oral exam and professional teeth cleaning and will be able to detect and treat periodontal disease, dry mouth, or other problems that may be the cause of bad mouth odour. Stop smoking and chewing tobacco-based products. Ask your dentist for tips on kicking the habit.
Drink lots of water. This will keep your mouth moist. Chewing gum (preferably sugarless) or sucking on candy (preferably sugarless) also stimulates the production of saliva, which helps wash away food particles and bacteria. Gums and mints containing xylitol are best.
Keep a log of the foods you eat. If you think they may be causing bad breath, bring the log to your dentist to review. Similarly, make a list of the medications you take. Some drugs may play a role in creating mouth odours.

Tips on how to followa routine to avoid body odour 
 
1. Keep yourself squeaky clean 
Shower at least once a day, and you’ll wash away sweat and get rid of some of the bacteria on your skin.
Sweat by itself is basically odourless. But when the bacteria that live on your skin mix with sweat, they multiply quickly and raise quite a stink.
Washing thoroughly, especially the areas where you tend to sweat, can help with body odour.
 
2. Use antibacterial soap 
Washing thoroughly with an antibacterial soap bar will help get rid of some bacteria, which can help with the odour. Look for the word “antibacterial” on the soap’s packaging.
 
3. Towel off well 
Once you’ve showered, dry yourself completely, paying close attention to any areas where you sweat a lot.
 
4. Use ‘industrial strength’ antiperspirants 
Once you’re clean and dry, use a strong antiperspirant on your underarms. These have aluminum chloride, a chemical that helps keep sweat at bay, and they often also have a deodorant in them. Use it twice a day - once in the morning and once in the evening.
You don’t need a prescription to get a powerful antiperspirant. Look for ones that say they’re higher strength. If you think you need more help, ask your doctor about prescription antiperspirants.  
 
5. Keep your clothes clean 
Change clothes often when you’re sweating heavily. Fresh clothes help keep body odour down. Be sure to change your socks as well, especially if you tend to have foot odour. Use deodorant powders in your shoes, replace insoles often, and go barefoot when possible.
 
6. Cut out or cut back on certain foods or drinks 
What you eat affects your body odour. Foods that tend to make you sweat more, such as hot peppers or other spicy foods, might also lead to body odour. And the aroma of foods like onions or garlic can be carried in your sweat. Drinks with caffeine or alcohol may also make you sweat more.
