FR against UPFA National List re-fixed for support

 
The Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed by former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri and former Minister Tissa Vitharana challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament were yesterday re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court and two petitions are to be taken up again on May 6.
The Supreme Court yesterday directed the petitioners that the captions of the petitions be amended in line with the changes of the respondents cited in the petitions.
In his petition, former MP Somaweera Chandrasiri who is also functioning as the Vice Chairman of Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) cited Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya, UPFA General Secretary Prof.Vishwa Warnapala, its former General Secretary Susil Premajantha, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
The Petitioner states the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties (MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP) and that the very inception the said Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner and all the decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all the constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajantha in his capacity as the Secretary of the said Alliance submitted a list of names including the Petitioners' for the national list.
He alleged that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala was subsequently appointed as the General Secretary of UPFA by the incumbent President without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
He stated that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with some the persons, who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be Members of Parliament.
He is seeking the Court for a declaration that he is entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament submitted according to the first list.
He is also seeking the Court to cancel and or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as members of Parliament.
