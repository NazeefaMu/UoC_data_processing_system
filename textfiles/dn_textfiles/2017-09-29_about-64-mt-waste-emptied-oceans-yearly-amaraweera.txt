About 6.4 MT waste emptied to oceans yearly: Amaraweera

Port City Colombo donates Rs. 1 million for beach cleanup:
About 6.4 metric tons of waste is emptied into the ocean on a yearly basis. The main reason for Sri Lanka’s coastline pollution is the irregular disposal of plastic and polythene, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
He made this observation at the beach cleanup programme to commemorate the National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week, launched at Crow Island Beach Park in Mattakkuliya. It was organised by the Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA). Port City Colombo was the chief sponsor of the island-wide beach cleanup programme, donating Rs. 1 million towards its facilitation.
The mega clean-up operation was conducted in 72 locations in 14 beachside districts.
The minister said his ministry had already set a plan in motion to ensure that fishermen going out to sea would be bringing back the plastics and polythene they carry on their fishing trips.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya, Deputy Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environmental Anuradha Jayarathne, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, CHEC Port City Colombo Managing Director Jiang Houliang, Head of Environmental Management Plan Team for Port City Colombo W. A. D. D. Wijesooriya and Head of Public Relations for Port City Colombo Kassapa Senarath were also present.
The Colombo Port City, the largest private investment and development project in Sri Lanka is committed to supporting CSR projects of this nature, which are of national importance. The company has already provided funding for a number of community projects in the Negombo area, initiated by the government to uplift fisher livelihoods.
Port City Colombo is built as an extension of the existing Colombo CBD with an initial investment of US$ 1.4 billion and an expected US$ 15 billion overall investment when completed. Spanning 269 hectares, it is a sea reclamation project joined to the current central business district. Port City Colombo is made up of five different precincts which are the Financial District, Central Park Living, Island Living, The Marina and the International Island.
When completed, it is estimated to have some 5.65 million square metres of built up space, with some of the best in design Grade A offices, medical facilities, educational facilities, integrated resort, Marina, retail destinations, hotels and various lifestyle developments. Using the latest sustainable city design and smart city concepts, Port City Colombo will be the hub of South Asia.
