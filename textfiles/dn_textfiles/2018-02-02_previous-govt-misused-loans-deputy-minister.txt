Previous Govt misused loans - Deputy Minister

Deputy Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Harsha de Silva said that the recent statement made by the President about loans taken by the previous government was certain and added that they never maintained a proper assets registry.
President Maithripala Sirisena recently said that of the Rs 10 trillion loans taken by the previous government only about Rs 1 trillion could be accounted for in the assets and huge sums of money could not be accounted for in the documents in the Finance Ministry.
Addressing the media yesterday at UNP headquarters in Sirikotha, de Silva said the previous government could not maintain a proper asset registry as the loans were spent on their daily expenses.
“The Rajapaksas’ claim that they got loans for development purposes which is not true. If they had taken loans for development projects, they could have easily maintained an asset registry. All the money went into their pockets, so they did not want to mention anything about it”, he said.
Deputy Minister further said that former governor of Central Bank Nivard Cabraal who was helping the former government in every way to hide their corruption is today claiming that nothing as such happened.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about President Sirisena’s statement that he is going to take up economic management in to his hands, Deputy Minister said that if he really meant it, he would have already taken the ministries in to his hand but what he mentioned was to work through national economic council.
