A TALENT-LIT EVE BY SUJATHAIANS

 
Excitement is in the air. Months of sacrifice and effort will soon culminate in a performance that will do justice to the spirit of the girls, staff and management of Sujatha Vidyalaya, Nugegoda - an institution that has produced fine young women. The Daily News visited Sujatha Vidyalaya to speak to the students and staff.
The grand finale of the celebration of the Golden Jubilee of Sujatha Vidyalaya, will be a concert involving the whole school. ‘Nipuna Prathibha’ is an event at Sujatha Vidyalaya held to showcase the talents of students. This year, the ‘Nipuna Prathibha’ concert will be held involving the whole school.
“This is to mark the 50th anniversary of Sujatha Vidyalaya. The event will be celebrated on a grand scale at the BMICH on October 3. The 50th anniversary celebrations will close with the ‘Nipuna Prathibha’ concert. Here the school orchestra will perform and there will be dancing and singing items,” said upper school dancing teacher Samadhi Silva.

A variety of items will be performed by girls of different age groups.
“We have been involved in rehearsals for many months every day. The school management is giving us a lot of support. The parents have also been very cooperative. There is also a teacher who comes to train us with the orchestra - Sumith Priyankara. He guides our orchestra. This is the first time such a huge orchestra from Sujatha performs on a stage as big as the BMCIH. The show will start at 6.30pm. This is a big event for our school,” stated Silva.
The primary and upper schools consist of over 1,000 students. All items in the aesthetic department will be featured. The sections performing in the concert are pre-school, the primary section and upper school (6- 8, 9-11 and A/L).
“This is very much a collaborative team effort. The greatest strength of this event is its variety. It is a balanced event. This is not a public show. It is open only to parents. This will definitely be a success as we have done successful performances before. The management is helping us a lot,” pointed out Silva.
The Daily News managed to speak to some of the adorable young ones who will certainly reap the benefits of this experience in the years to come and become smart young women who will be leaders in their chosen fields.
Little 11-year-old Dinithi of Grade 6, was the first to speak to us.
“Our show will be made successful by our beloved teachers. This is a really big opportunity for us. The teachers have been very helpful in teaching us dancing. Even my friend are making a big effort.”
Thirteen-year-old Dahamya said: “There are four dance items from Grades 6 to 8. Our teachers are behind us all the time training us and guiding us. I feel very confident that this endeavour will be a success. My friends are also very keen and practicing very hard.”
Eleven-year-old Chanuli said that she felt fortunate to have received this experience. “This is a great opportunity for us, and my friends have been with me, helping me and teaching me my steps.” The Daily News also managed to speak to some English announcers who candidly shared their views on the event. From their comments, it is evident that this has become a journey of discovery and bonding.
“This event has given us a great opportunity to show our talents. Almost all of the students in school are participating. They are performing in various ways like dancing, announcing, singing and the orchestra. I feel it is a great opportunity,” said Thenuri Silva. “We are organizing this marking our Golden Jubilee. This has been a journey of 50 years. We are so happy to be a part of this event to showcase our talents, the talents of almost the entire school,” said Nusra Nazar. “We all get to work as one, and we get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each other, and build up on our weaknesses. The good thing is that it will be on a grand scale,” said Amali Haniffa.“I think this event will be very successful because everyone is showing a great amount of commitment. We are getting down professional trainers and we have beautiful costumes. The talents of the students will be brought out by this event,” said Yohara Ranasinghe.
The Sinhala announcers did not conceal the fact that they were proud to be where they are now. Like the English announcers, this has been a novel experience for them and something that is unforgettable.
“Bringing our talents out has been the most rewarding outcome of these preparations. Sujatha Vidyalaya is an institution where everyone is keen on bringing out the inner strengths of students. I am so happy and proud to be a student of Sujatha Vidyalaya,” said Yashodara Silva.
“The overall purpose of Sujatha is to develop the characters of its students. Prior to this, there have been other concerts. There is so much scope for children to develop,” said Prashansa Wimalasundere.
“We have come here with great expectations. I am proud to be a student of this great school,” said Malsha Liyanage.
The Daily News also chatted to some of the teachers on what they think of the mega event. They expressed their satisfaction at the zeal the students display in this important event.
“It will be a great success and I say this because of the admirable effort our teachers have put into this endeavour. It has been well planned with much astuteness, paying attention to the need for variety.
We have been practicing long and hard because this involves children and therefore a lot of attention has to be given. Also the parents have given a lot of support. It has been an all- round effort,” said dancing teacher Sandumini Perera.

“This is a truly remarkable event. The children are keen to participate, even though they are fully involved in their studies. They are truly having fun. Extra- curricular activities are as important as studies. The children learn how to face challenges by taking part in events like this,” said A/L teacher Eranga Rodrigo.
“This is an event with a difference in various aspects when it comes to items. This show is bigger and more glamourous than any show we have previously done. It is successful in a way we never anticipated. The children are very enthusiastic,” said primary section dancing teacher Venuri Wijeweera. Finally the Daily News spoke to three young students who are doing something different from what we normally see at a concert.

Monali who is performing a Latin dance item, expressed her opinion on what a positive impact this event has. “We are doing this willingly because we realize how important this experience is. Performing in front of a crowd will mold us. We have rehearsals every day and we practice a lot. But we are able to balance our studies and prepare for exams.”
“My dance item comes from Japanese culture. Japanese is offered as a subject in our school. That is why for the folk dance, we opted to do a Japanese item. This is a very interesting dance item. There is less than a week for the concert and we are really putting in everything we have! We expect this to be a success,” Hansini.

“The folk dance consists of dances from four cultures – Japan, Mexican, Latin and Indian. I am performing a Japanese folk dance. It is a challenge since it is foreign to us. But I will give it my best shot. The Japanese dance form is performed in a special way by the Japanese people. So it is something that needs to be perfected,” said Hansini.
