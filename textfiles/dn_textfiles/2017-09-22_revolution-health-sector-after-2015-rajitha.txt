Revolution in health sector after 2015: Rajitha

A positive revolution in the health sector in Sri Lanka commenced in 2015. During the previous regime, although there was a physical development in the health sector, there was no development in human resources, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, during the past, some patients had to wait until their fate decided whether to live or not. They died at a young age. But now patients receive drugs for life without financial limitations. The poor enjoy the free health system now, he said.
The Minister was addressing the inauguration of the second workshop organized by the Prenatal Society of Sri Lanka to educate family health midwives, in Gampaha, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the workshop is important because the services need to be offered to grassroots level. Some doctors' organizations only have doctors' activities. They only talk about their issues and there is no way of bringing services to the people, he said.
“Wrong concepts and myths spread in society due to the lack of intelligence. The productivity of society has reduced because people are not healthy. The government has commenced work to create a healthy and intelligent population,” he added.
