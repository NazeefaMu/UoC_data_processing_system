Sparkling 169 by Himasha

The captain of Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya Himasha Liyanage scored a hurricane 169 runs which consisted of fourteen hits to the ropes and eight over in and facing 141 balls and occupying the crease for 195 minutes guided his Alma-mater to a first innings victory over formidable and more fancied St. Peter's College, Bambalapitiya played at Bambalapitiya.
Himasha scored 169 runs out of 230 runs for the Palians and all the other ten batsman could contrbute only 61 runs. Second highest contribution was twelve runs from Julaj Ashen and perhaps his score may be the highest ever individual score recorded by a Palian first eleven cricketer against Peterites at the Peterites grounds.
Homesters replied with 192 runs and in the Palians second essay Peterites bounced back and showed their prowess and skittled out the visitors for a paltry 111 runs and Himasha cracked a fluent 66 runs with eight fours and three towering sixes to bring his tally to 235 runs in the same game and some of his shots were spraying like bullets and the fielders looked on helplessly.
