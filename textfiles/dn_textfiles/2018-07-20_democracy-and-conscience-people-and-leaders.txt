DEMOCRACY AND CONSCIENCE OF PEOPLE AND LEADERS

The Sri Lankan people came to exercise a hitherto unexperienced process of universal franchise in 1931. People began to participate in the choice of those who were to represent them and look after their general well-being at local and national levels, culminating in electing the rulers of Independent Lanka in 1948 and thereafter every five years or so. Thus people began to elect and experience democratic governance through free elections before fairness was made to disappear and high-handedness and intimidation also appeared until the democratic hopes revived in January 2015. But now we are overshadowed again by bleak prospects.
Democratic rights of the people are prior to their being acknowledged or enshrined in Constitutions with the laws of democratic governance. Not only politicians, all peoples’ representatives, public servants should adhere to the fundamental principles of democracy, freedom and rule of law. When the people concede to them power to govern, judge, administer, many succumb to their character flaws, neglect their duty, surpass their authority and flout democratic principles without acting as servants of the people.
Democratic rights are not concessions of politicians, public servants or policemen to the people. They come from the natural law and moral law which are the sources of freedom, democracy and democratic principles. Freedom is not freedom to misbehave or misconduct, to act wickedly or cause injury but freedom to be creatively active within the moral law. All have the right to life from conception to natural death. Rights in a democracy have their source in human life; human dignity and rights which derive from natural law, the highest law, prior to Constitutions. The very basis of democracy is in human rights which are not arbitrary desires.
The centralization of authority, at a national summit, is for the common good and should not suffocate all activity of private initiative of resourceful individuals who enrich the whole of society. Those vested with authority should respect the principle of subsidiarity and let private initiative be free and when needed coordinate them towards better functioning. Authority should so order the common good according to a hierarchy of values and care for each one's autonomy and promote the freedom and security of all in the harmony of a society of equal persons endowed with human dignity and human rights, in justice, unity and peace. And when authority is not just, strong and steady, but fails, voices are raised recalling it to its obligations. Now it seems to be happening in an unacceptably incongruous strident manner.
PROFICIENCY OF STATE AGENCIES
The persons and organs of central and institutional authority have to operate in unity. They have to so organise and coordinate their activities so as to be constantly circumspective and watch over the legally proper and proportionate ordering of the multiplicity of needs and demands of a diversity of people coming under their range and cover. And the legislative, judicial and executive branches and under them the agencies of the state as well as private institutions sustained by peoples’ participation should function proficiently according to the law and not in an arbitrary manner, that the people may be contentedly served.
Arbitrariness, disorder, long neglect of proper functioning, deficiencies in transparency and accountability that lead to an inability to satisfy the just demands and needs of the people would tend to create displeasure, disappointment and chaos among them in addition to suspicion of corrupt management. Transactions among people and public and private organisations cannot take place without trust. Unfortunately, along with disregard of the law there an abuse of trust has begun to appear in spheres where big finances are concerned.
The top most institutional leader responsible is seen as incapable of justly handling a situation, is caught napping with the narrow selfish interests and feels trapped and unfree, entangled with shady deals and is indecisive in taking right action. Ministers even in Provinces and officials who are incompetent in just and fair management take arbitrary decisions and create disorder, unpleasantness and dissatisfaction causing also mayhem. This occurs today in Sri Lanka.
GOVERNANCE AND DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS
In the administration of ministries appointments are often done to give employment to the unemployed, to employ party loyalists or to re-employ the party loyalists who have been ousted by the outgoing ministers of the previous government, to accommodate the choice favourites of the minister in charge. The procedures of recruitment of teachers, for instance, seem ad hoc and arbitrary. The service of the people may need the qualified and professionally competent but this gets overlooked. Overlooked are also the well merited to get appropriate promotions.
Ministers in general who exercise arbitrary and inefficient control mistakenly think that they are managing well even while there is widespread disgust and dissatisfaction over their ways. In many ministries, mismanagement, lethargy, overspending, wasteful corrupt expenditure on duty-free luxury vehicles and corruption due to a multiplication of bureaucrats not only undermine efficiency, it undermines democracy, increasing the cost of administration thus burdening the people and increasing the cost of living, especially for the poor. Many try to either find fault with or justify the procedures adopted, as if their procedures alone ensure democratic rights. With disregard for the rule of law, democracy breaks down.
FAITH IN DEMOCRACY WOBBLES
Democracy is generally understood to be the prevalence of the will of the majority. However, the majority should also be concerned that democracy should pursue what is right and not what is wrong, what is moral and not what is immoral. Democracy does not mean carrying out the wishes of the majority even when the natural law and the moral law are ignored and people are denied human rights and their rightful belongings expropriated. What is against the natural law and the moral law and what is against human life, human dignity and human rights cannot be legalized by the will of the majority.
Party government and party leaders often ignore the conscientious views of their own party cadres as well as those of the minorities. This has happened in Sri Lanka from 1956 and after and polarized the people. Today we have come to a stage when whoever comes to power governs without giving much thought to the human dignity and rights of the people, presuming they have power over their life and death.
No economic plans are clearly presented to the people nor how the problems facing the country are going to be solved, in a way their cooperation could be obtained. Nutty opposition politicians keep dashing coconuts. Over these issues people are apprehensive.
It is always into an environment of confusion, disorder that tyrants have walked in through a democratic process, with populist backing, and taken hold of central authority like Hitler. He went on to usurp power to dominate and control people as a dictator and commit genocide in an unbelievable manner. When elected rulers descend to malignant wickedness and exercise power arbitrarily, people’s faith in democracy tends to wobble and crumble. At least some conscientious, even heroic, citizens should not let this happen in Sri Lanka. They should waken the consciences of the people, mobilize them and elect a government that will rule democratically and justly.
