Herath winds down career on ODIs and T20Is

Sri Lanka's third highest wicket-taker in Tests left-arm spinner Rangana Herath has announced his retirement from One-Day International and Twenty20 International cricket.
In a letter addressed to Sri Lanka Cricket, Herath said he would like to concentrate on Test cricket - which has always been his personal passion.
He went on to say: "Every cricketer has to stop at the right time I feel it's time to make room for fresh talent to be groomed with the 2019 World Cup in view."
Herath 38 has borne the brunt of Sri Lanka's spin bowling attack since the retirement of legendary spinner Muthiah Muralitharan in 2010 and is currently three wickets shy of reaching the milestone of 300 Test wickets.
In 71 ODIs he has captured 74 wickets (avg. 31.91) and in 17 T20Is took 20 wickets (avg. 20.72) with career best figures of 5/3 against New Zealand that enabled Sri Lanka to go and win the World T20 title in 2014.
Herath has been an integral part of the Sri Lanka bowling arsenal where his brilliant accuracy and subtle variation in pace and flight made him a force to be reckoned with both at home and away.
In an interview with Wisden India during the WT20, Herath described his uncomplicated style by saying: "Wherever I go, I try not to change anything. I give the ball air and try to get the batsmen out. ..... I figure out the conditions... I have faith in me that I can adjust with the conditions" - a philosophy he is likely to share with the younger generation.
