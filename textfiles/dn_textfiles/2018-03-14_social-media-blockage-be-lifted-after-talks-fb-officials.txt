Social media blockage to be lifted after talks with FB Officials

 
Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said today that the ongoing social media blockage will be lifted on Friday after holding talks with Officials from Facebook.
The Minister is scheduled to meet the Facebook Officials in Colombo on Thursday.
The government blocked all social media sites including Facebook on March 7 after the eruption of communal conflicts in Teldeniya, Kandy.
The move was taken in order to avoid false and malicious content being spread through social media.
