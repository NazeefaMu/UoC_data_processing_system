Army holds ‘Sooriya Mangallya’

The ‘Sooriya Mangallya’, the annual auspicious event of traditional New Year games and other associated fun-making events, was held at the Colombo Malay cricket club on April 7.
Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva graced the occasion as its Chief Guest together with Army Seva Vanitha Unit President Nayana De Silva, and a host of other senior officers, including the Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Officers.
The Chief Guest was welcomed by Senior Officers before hoisting of the national flag and the Army flag by the Army Commander and the Deputy Chief of Staff.
A 2-minute silence by all attendees recalled the memory of fallen War Heroes before the traditional oil lamp lighting got underway with the participation of the Chief Guest and a representative gathering of all wings in the Army.
The chain of collective events began to get off the ground soon after separate organisers gathered at specific places to flag off each event.
A cross-country marathon run that took place early in the morning was competed by hundreds of all ranks serving the Army Headquarters before the main ceremony got off the ground after the Chief Guest’s arrival.
Traditional and merry-making games and collective competitions dominated the day’s agenda.
The model, ‘Gemi Gedara’ in the premises with its elegantly-clad occupants symbolised the rites and rituals, associated with the tea table, filled with traditional sweetmeats and attracted spectators as the surroundings in the ‘Gemi Gedara’ were coloured by typical villagers and beautiful damsels, dressed in New Year clothes. A few features, presented by wheelchair-riding disabled War Heroes and other physically handicapped War Heroes were among the day’s highlights.
Officers, several ASVU executive members, other rankers, invitees and members of the civil staff witnessed the sequence of events with joy.
A mini music entertainment by Army Ranaviru Real Star participants added musicality to the flow of the event. The Army Commander presented the prizes to the winners.
