Arbitrary scheme to grant car permits to public servants
Despite all our financial woes, the government is planning to remove the upper ceiling of the value of imported vehicles, and to grant hitherto unheard of tax relief to the public sector officials who hold permits.
This may be the moronic idea of the powers-that-be, to regain the popularity lost in the Provincial Council elections. Don’t they realize that the masses cast the deciding vote, and if any wooing is to be done, the government has to placate the masses, by placing a cap on the prices of essential food, repairing and maintaining rural roads and bridges, improving the transport sector, overhauling the education system and providing basic comforts for the long suffering masses?
About 6,000 public servants will benefit from this scheme of “Value and Tax Cuts”. It has been reported that the Treasury, (already in a woeful state) will lose nearly 65 billion rupees per year, when this is implemented. All public servants should be instructed to buy only second-hand vehicles below a stipulated value, they should be ordered to fly “ordinary class”, allowed to stay only in 3-star hotels and told to keep to a minimum, whatever is spent on them by the Treasury. This should also include house rent, petrol allowance and general expenses incurred for their living. It is time they took a cut in their salaries and perks.
It is apparent to all of us, that after about one year in office, these public servants increase in girth, and their hair turns totally black! Spending public money, they gorge at disgracefully loaded buffet tables, while the masses sometimes are unable to have even one square meal a day.
Yahapalanaya, please realize that all this is contrary to the ideals of the Venerable Madulawe Sobitha Thera. We expected so much from you.
