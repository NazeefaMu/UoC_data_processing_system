A wide spectrum of industries to benefit from GSP+ concession

Deputy Minister of Policy Planning & Economic Development Dr. Harsha de Silva stated that a large and wide spectrum of industries from fisheries, apparel, toys to chemical related products would benefit from the GSP + concession, which had been won by the present government after sustained efforts.
Dr. de Silva said that it is up to the private sector to take up the challenge to substantially increase export revenue to the country, while assuring the government’s fullest commitment to continue improving the current business climate.
The minister expressed his comments at a panel discussion organized by the UNP’s Young Professionals Organisation (YPO) yesterday under the theme of GSP+, How Real is It? Moderated by Harshana Rajakaruna MP, President of the YPO and featured economist Deshal De Mel, the Secretary General of the Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) Tuli Cooray and Spokesperson of Sri Lanka Seafood Exporters Association Col. Channa Weeratunga.
