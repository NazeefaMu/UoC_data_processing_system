RIL Property capitalises on office space with Parkland, Readywear projects

According to independent industry research reports, the demand for Grade ‘A’ office space is expected to grow and continue to outstrip the supply base in the mid and long term.
RIL Property has capitalised on this favourable industry conditions via its Colombo 2 focused offering through Parkland, and mid-term demand via the development of the Readywear building situated adjacent to Parkland.
“In the long term, the company is expected capitalize on its land bank to meet the Grade ‘A’ office space demand,” RIL Property Limited CEO Hiroshini Fernando.
Real-estate industry has seen a tremendous growth since the end of the civil war. However there has been a lack of focus given to the development of Grade ‘A’ office spaces hence there is an enormous void in this market segment.
Speaking to Daily News Business she said that a key reason would be that real estate developers have very much focused more on quick returns that have been available in the high end residential and hotel property markets. “Therefore it is imperative that developers re adapt their strategy towards the development of the commercial office space market, which has been projected as a great platform that provides good return on investment in the mid and long term.”
Asked how the development of Grade ‘A’ office spaces facilitate the Government's Megalopolis project and boost investor confidence she said that the Megalopolis project would entice the foreign investors to further invest in Sri Lankan projects,. “In addition to currently available incentives offered by the government, they would also be able to utilize the infrastructure facilities that would be available.
The corporates then would require their offices to be setup in the central business district. Existence of developments such as Parkland will also boost investor confidence by portraying a mature real estate market.”
Developments such as Parkland would be their first choice of commercial space as it falls in line with regulatory/compliance requirements currently being promoted by multinational corporations. This is evident with Parkland as it has secured a diverse and highly creditworthy tenant base in a short span of time.
“Furthermore, our next project, which is the refurbishment of the Readywear building, will further provide Grade ‘A’ office spaces for both local and foreign corporate with state-of-the-art amenities.”
With the expected growth in the economy, the entrance of multinational corporations and the expansion of business of local and foreign corporates, RIL foresees a steady demand growth.
“We see great potential and are confident that we would be able to meet our projections made on the Readywear building.
As was visible with the launch of Parkland we brought in many firsts to the commercial space segment and we have surpassed our clients’ expectations while offering competitive pricing.”
Comenting on the RIL IPO was recently oversubscribed she said that the IPO funds will be utilized for the refurbishment of the Readywear building at an investment of Rs. 694.1 mn. The renovation is expected to complete by mid-2018 with a rentable area of 45,897 sq. ft.
The IPO funds will also be utilized for the expansion of BreadTalk at an investment of Rs. 256 Million, targeting the setting up of 16 outlets by the financial year 2020/21 The expansion of BreadTalk is based on per capita income growth, lifestyle changes, and food preferences. (VW)
