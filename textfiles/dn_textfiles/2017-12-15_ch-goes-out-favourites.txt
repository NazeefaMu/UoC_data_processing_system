CH goes out as favourites

Rejuvenated CH and FC outfit will go out as favourites against Navy Sports Club when they clash in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club League rugby first round match at Race Course Grounds in Reid Avenue, Colombo today. Match will commence at 4.00pm.
Even though CH and FC are favourites and playing this match in their home grounds at Race Course they will have a stiff resistance from the Navy side. CH performed better in their last two outings with a closely fought out 21 all draw against Police Sports club at Police Park and a comprehensive runaway victory against the formidable Air Force Sports Club by 43-31 at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana last week.
The player to watch from the CH camp undoubtedly will be their unsung hero and former St. Anthony’s College play maker fly half Samuel Maduwantha.
Mean while the Navy SC savoured mixed fortunes in their last two games wining against Air Force sports club by 10 points to nil last week at Navy grounds in Welisara and losing to Kandy Sports Club by 33-19 at Nittawala. Hence a keen tussle for supremacy can be expected in today’s game.
