Architecture students from Amity University Dubai visit Altair

A visit to Altair, Sri Lanka’s architecturally unique twin-tower high rise was part of an on-going five-day study tour for architecture students of Dubai’s Amity University.
The group comprising of 30 final year students and two lecturers visited the Altair site at Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Colombo 2 for a conducted tour of the iconic structure with its distinguishing sloping and vertical towers.
This study tour is an annual highlight of the University’s curriculum for students of architecture. Last year’sstudy tour was to Singapore and included Marina Bay Sands, also designed by Altair architect Moshe Safdie.
“We were delighted to have these students, who were already familiar with Mr Safdie’s work, visit the site,” Altair Head of Sales & Marketing Jay Dias said. “Although the Amity University islocated in a city known for its skyscrapers, both the students and their lectures were impressed by Altair’s design and distinctive structure.”
Now at its 58thlevel on the vertical tower and the 55thon the sloping tower, Altair will on completion comprise of a 63-storey tower which leans in to a taller, 68-storey tower. Acknowledged as a game changer in contemporary living in Sri Lanka, the Altair building has already brought a new dimension in aesthetics to Colombo’s skyline. It is intended to be a one-of-its-kind development in South Asia in terms of architectural design, structural engineering, and living experience.
Altair will offer its 400 apartments spectacular views of the Beira Lake, the Indian Ocean and the city of Colombo.
The development’s 1.5 million square feet of high-end eco-friendly living space will be supported by 40,000 square feet of supportive up-market retail space.
