South Africa rest Imran Tahir for Sri Lanka ODIs

South Africa’s top-ranked ODI bowler at No.6 in the world Imran Tahir has been rested from the ODI squad to play Sri Lanka in July-August as the country gears up for Vision 2019.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj, who has played two ODIs, and left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi have been included in the 15-man squad in Tahir’s place.
The series, which will consist of five ODIs and a one-off T20I, is the first of five in South Africa’s build-up to the 2019 World Cup, and the first since AB de Villiers announced his international retirement. The uncapped Reeza Hendricks, wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen and Aiden Markram are the three players in contention for de Villiers’ middle-order spot.
Faf du Plessis returns as captain, after missing five of the six ODIs against India earlier in the year with a broken finger, and Junior Dala, who has played three T20s, comes in as an option in place of the retired Morne Morkel. Wiaan Mulder is the only other addition from the group that played against India, and replaces Chris Morris, who is injured.
SOUTH AFRICA ODI SQUAD: Faf du Plessis (captain), Hashim Amla, Junior Dala, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Reeza Hendricks, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, David Miller, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi.
