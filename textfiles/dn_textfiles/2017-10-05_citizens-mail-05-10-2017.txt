CITIZENS' Mail - (05-10-2017)

Prestige is not yours, Mr Clean!
Arjuna Ranatunga earned the Mr Clean accolade after winning the 1996 World Cup. But following the appointment of his brother to the position of Ports Authority Chairperson while being the minister, Mr Clean lost the sheen. His brother is neither qualified nor credited with any relevant experience.
Minister Ranatunga condemns the SLC on a regular basis. He slams Thilanga Sumathipala, a respectable and decent politician. Little has he realised that his family had been in this legal business for quite long. Mr Clean is blind to the fact that Sumathipala is well positioned to point the fingers at Ranatunga’s family as one full of fraudsters. Arjuna’s brother, Prasanna Ranatunga, for instance, has been indicted in the court for a colossal fraud. Nishantha, another Ranatunga sibling was a shameless part of many frauds such as the missing golden rivet while holding the prestigious position of Sri Lanka Cricket Secretary a few years ago. Thanks to the heavy political backing, Nishantha could escape the investigations.
It is now amusing – or hilarious, rather - to see this so-called Mr Clean seeking the intervention of the Mahanayaka Thera to intervene and save the SLC.
He always accuses the Sport Minister of not being knowledgeable about cricket. It is not foolish to seek the Mahanayaka’s intervention. His motive is clear. Ranatunga wants his sibling back on the wheel.
