WiLAT field visit to Finlay Cold Storage

Women in Logistics and Transport (WiLAT), the Women’s Forum of The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) Sri Lanka, dedicated to empowering the young minds in the Logistics & Transport industry, organized a field visit to the Finlay Cold Storage (Pvt) Ltd at Welisara recently.
Members of WiLAT, undergraduates and WiLAT friends joined this educational visit.
Founded in 2005, Finlay Cold Storage provides specialized cold chain management services, including refrigerated warehousing, storage, value added services and transport for perishable food, beverages and pharmaceutical products.
A part of the Swire Group in UK, Finlay Cold Storage is the largest temperature controlled 3PL service provider in Sri Lanka, with over 2.9 million cubic feet of refrigerated warehousing. The company caters to a niche market and has a client base of 120 customers.
During the short period spent at the cold storage, the attendees gained a thorough knowledge on the cold storage and services provided by the company.
It was very interesting to learn the importance of providing the highest quality of service to its customers as a cold store operator. Abiding by that oath, Finlay Cold Storage enjoys the investments made on the best of technologies, from warehouse management systems to GPS tracking of its vehicles.
The company also prides itself in its “Safety First” approach. Up to 26th July 2017 for 2,457 days it has been a record where not a single lost time incidents had occurred.
Finlay Cold Storage has recently invested in a state-of-the-art solar roofing system, the largest roof mounted solar project in Sri Lanka with a capacity of 1 MW.
The company also facilitated a visit to their freezer rooms and the WiLAT members got the opportunity to experience the extreme temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius! However, the brave women in Logistics overcame the extreme temperature with a fiery will.
WiLAT is extremely thankful to Finlay Cold Storage and its management, especially Gihan Jayasinghe, Executive Director, Finlays Colombo, Saveen Gunaratne, General Manager & SBU Head and Nimantha Hewagama, Business Development Manager, at Finlay Cold Storage (Pvt) Limited for giving the valuable occasion to learn and experience a cold store facility.
