Locomotive Engineering Operators’Union calls off strike

Locomotive Engineering Operators’ Union (LEOU) yesterday decided to call off their strike scheduled to be launched from today, following a meeting with Deputy Transport Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
According to LEOU Secretary Indika Dodangoda, the union had decided to launch a strike from today seeking several demands. The union had demanded to suspend the recruitment process of co-drivers too.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister has agreed to postpone the recruitment of co-drivers. Both parties have expressed their intent to discuss the issue further.
“The union gave an assurance that they would not resort to take Trade Union action and hold discussion with the government seeking a solution to the issue,” he said.
Dodangoda alleged that although the authorities were informed of technical problems in trains, especially with regard to the problems in the break systems, they did not take action to solve the problems.
