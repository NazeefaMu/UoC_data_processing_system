46th Annual Abdul Jabbar Shield Rugby clash : Isipathana goes out favourites against minnows Thurstan

 The 46th Annual Abdul Jabbar shield Rugby encounter between Division one unbeaten group leaders Isipathana College, Colombo and Division two participant Thurstan College, Colombo will be played today at the CR & FC grounds in Longden place. Kick off will be at 4.30pm.
It all started in 1967 when Isipathana - Thurstan match fixture was elevated to a big match status for the Abdul Jabbar Trophy. Since then Isipathana has never turned back going on winning the “Abdul Jabbar Trophy” for 36 consecutive years till 2005 where Thurstan won the trophy for the first time in their history by 15-6 due to a under the post try scored by Shane Aravinda after they had a slender lead of 8-6 up to that point. To Thurstanites young and old it was a more than a victory after 37 painful years.
The finish was yet another page from the fiction, no different to the ‘93 fixture where Isipathana’s Thuan Bohoran snatched a draw or a near victory away from Thurstan to score a blind side try to make them victorious in the last minute. Such was Isipathana’s invincibility for nearly four decades. Closest Thurstan achivement was a draw in 1975 under Tissa Wickramanayake and in ‘98 under Nuwan Kumara they beat Isipathana in the President’s Trophy but succumbed to defeat in the ‘Jabbar’.
Thurstan took up to rugby in 1958 and Isipathana in 1963 and the two schools met for the first time in 1963.
It was one of Thurstan’s finest years in rugby under the leadership of late Deepal de Zoysa having beaten many top teams and the score line read 6-3 in favour of Thurstan. Isipathana’s rugby revival came in 1965 under Ana Saranapala, in a team that was coached by Mike Davis where they beat Thurstan 17-0 at the CCC grounds. The 1966 match at CR was a thriller where Isipathana scored a close 6-3 win over Thurstan, captained by Sunil Jayakody.
In 1967 too it was a close game where Thurstan captained by Mangala Ratnayake lost narrowly to Isipathana. In 1968, the two captains were Upali Hewage (Thurstan) and Juranghan Savanghan (Isipathana) and the match was closely contested and won by Isipathana with Thurstan paying for sending two kickable penalties astray by their play maker Diyanesh Rajarathnam.
Isipathana after losing to Thurstan in 2005 came back to their winning ways from 2006 to 2009 and in 2010 the match was not played. Isipathana won in 2011 under the captaincy of Devinda Prasad by a stunning 70-6. In 2012 they won the match thrashing Thurstan 98-0. In 2013 the match was not played. 2014 they won 55-5 under Shenal Deelaka
They retained the Abdul Jabbar Trophy last year under the captaincy of number eight Omalka Gunarathna by beating Thurstan College by a smashing 105 points to nil victory. This score goes as the highest team score ever by any team in this prestige’s encounter.
Isipathanians lead the tally with 43 wins during the last 45 games played between these two schools against 1 by Thurstan while one match played in 1975 have ended in a tie and in 1972, 2010 and 2013 the match was not played. This year Isipathana College is led by centre kushan Indunil and their coaching staff comprised Nilfer Ibrahim as Head Coach and Terence Henry as Assistant Coach.
The Thurstan team is captained by Tisum Palihawadana while Achala Perera is the head coach and Chanaka Chandimal as assistant coach. Mohammed Akram is their trainer.
