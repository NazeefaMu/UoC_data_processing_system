Kandy schools rugby round-up

In last week’s Singer schools rugby second round matches played by Kandy schools in the Cup, Plate, Bowl and Shield competitions Trinity defeated St. Joseph's 17-15 last weekend to climb to the top in the Cup competition and keep their dreams of winning the title alive.
On Saturday Kingswood sealed victory over St. Anthony’s thanks to some good run and pass rugby, where the Kingswoodians took complete control of the game. On Sunday Dharmarajah fashioned a good win over the youthful Vidyartha side. St. Sylvester’s went down to Thurstan in their second match. Sri Sumangala was to play Lalith Athulathmudali MV but this match did not come off. Sri Rahula playing in Division II Cup competition on Monday beat President's College. Other than Trinity all other schools are badly affected without a venue to play their rugby games and this has become a major issue where the Sports Ministry nor the rugby controlling body the Sri Lanka Rugby Union has not taken any notice at all.
Today, most of the schoolboys enjoy playing rugby, and also they are sure of job opportunities after school. Today there is quite a difference between club and school rugby. Where the clubs get good coaches and tend to be well qualified and experienced in the game and the players are on contract basis. Children play voluntarily, give them the skills and keep them in the game. Schools have to pay a big packet for the coaches, and today a school has about four coaches. A school needs big money to play a match with all expenses being very high.
School level rugby is one of the most popular ball games, but today most of the schools are finding it difficult to keep the game going and the Schools Rugby Association has apparently no control.
Trinity who were smarting from the defeat they suffered at the hands of St. Peter's in the first second round game enjoyed a win against Joseph's after trailing in the first half. Their key game will be against Isipathana College on Saturday in Kandy. Isipathana are sure to pose a threat after their home victories, there is a real sense of momentum behind their Cup championship challenge and Trinity know that they will have to be at their best. The Trinitians need to put up a giant killing performance. Despite performing away from home they rallied around beautifully to turn the game against St Joseph’s in their favor. The game from the kick off was poised for an exciting finish with both teams making a determined effort to take the lead. Trinitians did a good job through their forwards, the back line was somewhat affected following the absence of regular fly half in the first half. The scrum half made the difference with a spectacular effort under tremendous pressure.
Kingswood who went down to their rivals in the first game in the Plate competition bounced back into recognition with an equally good performance at Bogambara. They pulled off a good 22-0 victory over high riding St. Anthony’s, while proving their true capabilities. In this game they performed to expectations with the forwards combining beautifully. They played with a real purpose and certainly with determination - they also enjoyed more possession. The Antonians never got their act together making several errors at vital stages. The three quarters also fumbled on a number of occasions. In the next game Kingswood play Lumbini MV away, most probably on Saturday and will be full of confidence. St. Anthony’s will play Prince of Wales at Pallekele on Sunday.
Dharmaraja maintained their impressive record while overcoming home town school Vidyartha by 36 points to 16 in their second match in the Plate competition. The Rajans playing with good understanding came back to the game in the second half. As usual Vidyartha who are playing in the top division after five long years did extremely well and fared creditably in the first half to lead. After the half time, with rain coming down after a long spell Rajans pressed strongly to win the match. Vidyartha ruggerites, failed to drive home their advantage in the second half. The next outing for Dharmaraja is with Science on Saturday at Nittawela and Vidayartha will play D.S. Senanayake away.
St. Sylvester’s in their second outing in the Bowl competition were beaten by Thurstan 35-10 at Pallekelle rugby grounds. Thurstan gave a good display of rugby. Sylvestrians tried hard to score but Thurstan held them down. In the next game Sylvestrians will play Richmond on Monday at Bogamabara.
Sri Sumangala in the Shield competition played their second game against Lalith Athulathmudali MV but this match did not come off due to the Wesak holiday. They will play CWW Kannangara on Saturday at Rajagiriya.
Sri Rahula the only school from Kandy playing in the Division II Cup Competition, are blessed with a good side. In their first match of the second round they beat President's College Maharagama 26-10. Their next game is with Vidyaloka in Galle.
