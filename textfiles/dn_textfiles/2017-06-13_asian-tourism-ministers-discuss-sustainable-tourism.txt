Asian Tourism Ministers discuss  sustainable tourism

The Second Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD) Tourism Ministers Meeting and the first UNESCO/UNWTO International Conference on Sustainable Tourism and Heritage Cities is currently taking place in Siem Reap, Cambodia.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga is representing Sri Lanka at the conference which has representation from 34 ACD member countries.
Minister Amaratunga held bilateral discussions relating to tourism development with the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, Hun Sen. Various ideas were exchanged in order to elevate the exchange of tourism between the two Asian countries which have many similarities including histories dating back to 2500 years.
The Minister also took the opportunity to discuss areas of mutual interest with the Tourism Ministers representing ACD member countries.
Asia has emerged as the driving force in the expansion of the global tourism market. It is now the second most visited region in the world next to Europe growing at an annual average of over 5 percent in recent years.
