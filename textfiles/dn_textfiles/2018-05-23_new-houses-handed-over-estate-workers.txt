New houses handed over to estate workers

The only thing ministers and Parliamentarians who crossed over to the opposition did while they were in the government was to inconvenience the government from within at every turn, Up Country New Villages, Estate Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaram said.
As such, the government was now better off without their presence, he said.
Minister Digambaram was addressing a meeting after handing over 20 new plantation houses built at Fulbank, Hatton to the beneficiary estate workers’ families on May 20. Each house had been built at a cost of Rs. 1 million.
Minister Digambaran said the President and Prime Minister should march forward together during the balance one and a half years of the government’s term of office. Unless they did so, all parties representing the government would fall into dire straits, he said.
He added that the government had now completed 6,000 houses under the plantation housing programme.
Nuwara Eliya District Parliamentarian Mylvaganam Thilakaraj was also present on the occasion.
