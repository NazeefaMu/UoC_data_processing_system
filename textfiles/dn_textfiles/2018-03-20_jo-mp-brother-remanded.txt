JO MP, brother remanded

Puttalam District Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha and his brother, former Arachchikattuwa Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Jagath Samantha were remanded till May 24 by Chilaw High Court Judge M.C.B.S. Moraes who withdrew their earlier bail order when the case regarding the alleged assault on former Arachchikattuwa Divisional Secretary Dhanasena Surasinghe came up for hearing on March 19.
The High Court Judge made this order when the Chilaw police informed court that both Sanath Nishantha and his brother Jagath Samanthe had flouted their bail conditions by failing to report to the Chilaw police every Sunday between 9 am and 12 noon.
In this case, Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha and his brother Jagath Samantha are charged with having assaulted former Arachchikattuwa Divisional Secretary Dhanasena Surasinghe, obstructing his official duties, exerting criminal force and being members of an unlawful assembly.
