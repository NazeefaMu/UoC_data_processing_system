New Year lessons back home

I go down the memory lane as far back as 1945, the period of post-World War II. We lived in the village named Bandiyamulla, Gampaha, which is now quite urbanised. That was my first encounter with the Sinhala and Hindu New Year events mainly linked to my maternal ancestral house where my grandmother, uncles and aunts lived. Our maternal house in Alavatupitiya, Seeduwa, was situated in a vast land full of plants.
My grandfather was an indigenous physician, dead at the time of my remembrance of New Year events. But he seems to have left a legacy, which was carried down the years. My mother used to visit the ancestral house to see the grandmother and bestow all the New Year greetings with presents. All events related to New Year take place in keeping with the auspicious moments.
I came to know that the head priest in the village temple has undertaken the duty of writing down all the auspicious times, Neket Vela, as a sheet of paper known as neket seeettuwa distributed to all the well known village heads. As my grandfather happened to be a village headman, it was customary to get the sheet of paper at the right time, even after his death.
Our mother wanted us to venerate kneeling down before the grandmother offering her with a bulat hurulla or a sheaf of betel leaves. As a child I came to know the significance of the betel or bulat, much more than from the books I happened to read later. Bulat is reckoned as the holy leaf that gives spirit in all the New Year activities.
The eldest is the ancestral houses happening to be my grandmother. As such she is the person who administered the auspicious moments, one by one. This is also known by the term ‘lit kramaya’ or the almanac system. As children, we were made to know that the celebration of the New Year is the oldest festival linked to Surya Mangalya or the festival of sun. It is the sun which gives both light and harvest to the entire agrarian community.
When the harvest is brought home and kept in barns (atu kotu), a glorious smile appears on the face of the community. The entire environment is full of joy. There is a belief that the sun god or hiru deviya with most powerful living force on the nature and humans. In fact all the moment of festivities linked with New Year are broadly termed as ‘Avurudu Sirit Virith’. Commencing with the utmost relaxed period known as nonagatha or the period we stop all the other work in order to concentrate on the inner life force. The concept of nonaketa comes from ‘no nekath’ or the period where there is no special auspicious period, astronomically. The elders wish to consider the period as a time specified for religious activities (punyakarma). Nonakatha or punyakalaya are synonymous. Most people prefer to go to the village temple, when there is no noise. It is also the time to relax by offering flowers at the foot of the Buddha statue. While adhering strictly to the auspicious moments the Sinhala village to seek companionship and pleasure through a series of living events during the period. On the major events it is marked by New Year games or avurudu kreeda where ankeliya a folk game which paves the way to gauge the intensity of the pattini cult where two sides are known as udupila and the yatipila. The former is the team of the character in the cult known as Kavalan and the latter the team of Pattini. The two characters and what befell on them leads to an age old legend recorded both in Pattini Hella a Sinhala short ballad and the counterpart in Tamil in the work titled as Silappadikaram. The legend has come a long way in the lives of both Sinhala and Tamil-speaking people in the world. Both works are honoured and paid homage by tradition. It is also believed by some traditionalists that the period of the New Year is marked honourable as it depicts certain episodes in the life of Pattini and Kannagi. She is also believed to have traversed seven directions.
As such she is known widely by the term Sat Pattini. In order to mark this, village elders believe that the food that should be partaken at the ancestral houses to be named as Hatmaluva. The legend says that seven types of herbal food goes to cook the hatmaluva. They include the following and we came to know from our grandmother. They are Vattakka Dalu or Vattakka creeper buds, kasata or the jak seeds, kadju (cashew), Mekaral, vambatu, alu kehel and ash plantains.
All these herbal ingredients are put together to partake with the main food being milk rice and kiribat. One main factor is the auvuru kema or the New Year Food is mainly a vegetarian preparation.
Followed by the New Year feast, partaken by all the members of the house, comes the ganu denu kirima or the auspicious moment to exchange greetings together with the exchange of money. The elders have the habit of giving more money to the children which is a delightful moment. My grandmother used to collect money throughout the year in order to distribute it among us in keeping with the tradition. The uncles and aunts get more money. Then comes the auspicious moment of veda allima or work time specified to engage in a particular function. It is said that my grandfather who was a veda mahattaya had the habit of growing a medicinal plant to cover the moment. Dairy keepers and cattle breeders engage in the function of treating their breed in order to honour them. Writers engage in either reading or writing as a visionary moment to upkeep their function determining to bring better results during the year to come.
The New Year day is also now to the villagers as Dolos Maha Yana Davasa or the day that dawns after passing 12 calendar months counting from Bak. The term Bak too is significant as taught to us by elders. The term denotes Bagya or glory and splendour. Anointing the herbal oil, especially by an elder or the head monk of the temple is denoted by the term hisa tel gana mangalya.
