SLIA holds beach cleaning program

An awareness program to mark the environment day was held by the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects (SLIA), through a beach cleaning program on June 3, at the Moratuwa Beach.
This initiative was well accepted and members of the Architects fraternity along with the Municipal Council Moratuwa, students from the University of Moratuwa, City School of Architecture, members of SLIA Sports Committee and Green Building Committee of SLIA were present.
This initiative generated adequate awareness of safeguarding the beach environment among the general public, since Sri Lanka was ranked as 5th in 2015 under world’s beach plastic offenders list. As an important concern to be addressed at a national level, this cleaning program was a strong step forward.
The organizers of the beach cleaning program requested and urged everyone to use natural resources wisely, reduce the damage caused to the environment and refrain from adding unsustainable substances to the environment.
The beach cleaning program was successful with the cordial and united support from different institutions to make it a very effective and successful initiative for the well being of the country.
