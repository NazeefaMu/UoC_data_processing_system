Club Med to manage LOLC Group’s Riverina Resort

Club Med SAS and LOLC has signed a management, sales and marketing agreements to brand, market, manage and operate Riverina Resort as the First Club Med Resort in Sri Lanka on July 28, 2017.
Club Med intends to transform the Riverina Resort property positioned along the Golden Mile of Beruwela to the most sought-after family holiday resort in the Indian Ocean.
Once completed, the 367-key Riverina Resort which is scheduled to open in 2019 will be the largest beach resort in Sri Lanka.
LOLC Group was looking for a reputed global leisure brand with a difference to infuse excitement and a new experience in Sri Lanka’s tourism sector. Club Med will bring a new and interesting flavour which will stand out as a unique club concept. As the world’s premier club resort operator, Club Med is patronized by affluent clients and the establishment of Club Med in a new location automatically elevates the profile of the destination. Bali, Cancun, Punta Cana, the Maldives and Phuket are perfect examples of destinations launched into the list of world-class destinations after Club Med’s first resort was established in those locations.
LOLC has forged strategic partnerships across its business sectors and this collaboration with yet another international brand reflects the strong investment potential of the group.
Sri Lanka, with its combination of culture, history, nature and people has many delightful experiences on offer and will benefit from the global marketing reach that Club Med possesses to transform the Sri Lankan property into a hot favourite with its upscale clientele.
By attracting an international brand such as Club Med as its partner, LOLC Group strengthens its leisure portfolio of properties in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
It has made significant investments in the Maldives, by securing some of the most sought after real estate in Male and in strategic locations among other Atolls. LOLC Group’s properties include ‘The Eden Resort & Spa, Beruwela’, ‘Dickwella Resort & Spa, Dickwella’, ‘The Paradise Resort & Spa, Dambulla’ and ‘The Calm Resort & Spa, Passikudah’.
