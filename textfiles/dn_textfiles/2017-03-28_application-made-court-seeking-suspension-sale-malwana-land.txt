Application made to Court seeking suspension of sale of Malwana land

An application was made to Court requesting a suspension of the earlier order to sell the 16 acre plot of land in Malwana allegedly belonging to former Minister Basil Rajapaksa in keeping with a Cabinet decision to consider whether it could be utilized for a public purpose, said Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC.
The Attorney General noted the above replying to a question raised by the Daily News.
He said the Pugoda Magistrate recently issued order suspending the sale of the said land by public auction because  the Cabinet had decided to consider using it for a public purpose.
Earlier, the Magistrate ordered the sale by public auction because the person whose name was mentioned in the deed pertaining to the land disclaimed ownership.
The Cabinet of Ministers held discussions over the possibility of using this land for a public purpose and Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said in a Cabinet memorandum that the Attorney General should consider this.
When the Cabinet decision was forwarded to the Attorney General, he ordered Police to seek an order from the Magistrate to suspend the auction. When Police informed the Cabinet decision to the Pugoda Magistrate on the orders of the Attorney General, the Magistrate thereafter issued order suspending the auction.
