Election Committee to conduct SLC election

The Secretary to the Ministry of Sports through the Attorney General yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that the Sports authorities have appointed an election committee to conduct the election to elect the office bearers of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Sumathi Dharmawardena appearing for the Secretary stated that the authorities will call for nominations in due course.
On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to vacate its Interim Order dated May 31, 2018 staying the holding of election that was to be held on last May 31.
Court of Appeal President Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara had made the order pursuant to a writ petition filed by Former Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga.
All parties in the petition had agreed to call for fresh nominations to conduct an election under the prevailing laws to elect the SLC office bearers. The case was fixed for argument on December 7.
Former SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga had filed the writ petition in the Court of Appeal seeking a writ order preventing SLC and its office bearers from permitting Thilanga Sumathipala to hold the post of SLC President in any manner after the SLC election to be held on May 31 this year.
All parties including former SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga agreed to annul the validity of the nominations called for the election of May 31. They also agreed to call for a fresh election. It will be conducted in accordance with the Sports laws. The calling of nominations would be opened enabling any party to raise objections regarding the nomination of the candidates. The authority conducting election must provide sufficient time to raise objections.
The petitioner cited 27 persons including incumbent SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala, Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha, SLC Election Committee members, SLC Executive Committee Members and several others as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the appointment of the Election Committee on May 19, 2018 violates the SLC constitution, the Sports Laws and regulations.
He alleged that the objections he raised for the disqualification of Sumathipala were not considered at the election committee.
The petitioner is seeking an order preventing the SLC from permitting Thilanga Sumathipala to contest for the post of SLC President.
