Even exchanges on first day of Battle of the Babes

The opening day’s play in the 59th Battle of the Babes encounter between Vidyartha College and St Sylvester’s College saw the exchanges even at the Pallekele international stadium yesterday.
Winning the toss and inviting St Sylvester’s to bat first Vidyartha bowlers ran through the batting to dismiss them 20 minutes before tea for 134.
Vidyartha in reply lost two wickets for 37 in 19 overs when bad light ended play 37 minutes before the scheduled close.
A solid bowling performance by the Vidyartha bowlers saw the Sylvestrians lose half their side for 73 by lunch. This was due to accurate bowling backed up by some tidy fielding which halted the Sylvestrians from making runs.
Top scorer for St Sylvester’s was Jayantha Rajapakse with a well compiled 40. The bowling honours were shared by Nimesh Ekanayake (3/23), Nipuna Kumarasiri (2/27) and Avishka Upananda (2/16).
The Sylvestrians hit back quickly to capture the first wicket for four runs.
Scores:
St. Sylvester’s College 134 in 63 overs (Jayakantha Rajapakse 40, Parinda de Silva 19, Nimesh Ekanayake 3/23, Nipuna Kumarasiri 2/27, Avishka Upananda 2/16)
Vidyartha College 37 for 2 at close in 19 overs (Kasun Karunatilake 12, Sahan Danawatte 16 n.o.)
