NEC receives JICA supported electricity master plan study

A presentation on the final report of ‘The Project on Electricity Sector Master Plan Study’ was held at the National Economic Council (NEC) chaired by President Maithripala Sirisena on July 10.
The key Cabinet Ministers including Finance and Mass Media Minister, Power and Renewable Energy Minister and the ministerial secretaries were present at the council meeting.
The presentation was made by Master Plan Study Team Leader Noboru Seki. Ambassador for Japan Kenichi Suganuma and JICA Sri Lanka Chief representative Fusato Tanaka were also present at the meeting held at the President’s Office in Colombo.
The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is responsible to develop, operate and maintain a stable, efficient and economical electricity supply system, prepares mid to long term investment plans. These plans which identify future investment projects, such as power generations, transmission lines, substations and distribution network to meet the future demand projections are formulated based on the Master Plan which covers 25 years and includes elaborated electricity demand modeling and power system analysis.
Any master plan needs to be reviewed and updated at least in every 10 years to meet such requirement. With this Master Plan completed in March 2018, the latest master plan which was also formulated through the support by JICA in year 2006 has been updated by considering development in the country and the latest technologies available in the field of power system for the next 25 years.
The JICA supported Master Plan has developed a comprehensive master plan of 25 years to generate, transmit and distribute development for the whole country. The Master Plan covers new technical challenges which the CEB as an implementing organization may face by 2040.
The JICA supported Master Plan recommends the best mix scenario which include various power sources in a balanced way. Similar scenarios have been endorsed in the recently approved energy policy by the Cabinet and the latest Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP) of the CEB.
