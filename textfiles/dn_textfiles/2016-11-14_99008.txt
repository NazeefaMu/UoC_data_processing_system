Howley hails ‘restored pride’ as Welsh edge Pumas

CARDIFF, United Kingdom, Sunday Interim coach Rob Howley insists Wales “restored pride” with their 24-20 victory over Argentina in Cardiff, a week after their 32-8 mauling at the hands of Australia. Liam Williams and Gareth Davies scored second-half tries as Wales dominated possession with a rejuvenated display following their heavy home defeat to the Wallabies.
“It has been a tough week so it's important that we celebrate a win,” said Howley.
“This game was all about putting some pride back in the national jersey. I never question the attitude of the players.
“Last week's first half display was something we had never experienced before but in fairness, the players rolled up their sleeves, had the right edge and deserve the accolades. “It was good to get a win against a side above us in the world rankings but more important to win at home because that's where we want to improve our success rate.”
Yet it was not until Leigh Halfpenny kicked two late penalties that victory was finally secured after Argentina twice came back to within a point through tries by Juan-Martin Hernandez and Martin Landajo.
However, Wales will care little if this was hardly a convincing display as they claimed their first victory since beating Italy in the Six Nations back in March.
Howley said: “A win gives you confidence that you are doing things right. There are moments in that game that we need to work on and learn from.
“It gives the players a lot of confidence and self-belief going forward because we have won against a very good Argentinian side. AFP
