CENTURY WILL BE SPECIAL ONE IF WE CAN WIN - ROOT

England captain Joe Root said that his century would be a special one if his team can go and win the second Test and with it the series.
“It was very pleasing to make a big contribution on that pitch,” said Root at the end of the day.
“I certainly enjoyed myself today. There were a few filthy hacks in there at times but the way you have to think about batting the mental approach, different strategies against different bowlers makes it really good fun,” said Root.
“That's what it should be. You shouldn’t feel pressure like the pressure is too much for you; you should enjoy the occasion and make the most of the opportunity in front of you.
“We said we were going to play a certain manner in these conditions. I think the temptation with a deficit like that going into the second innings is to play within your shell and be a bit insular but the guys went out and set the tone at top of the order.
“It was really pleasing to see inexperienced guys as Test cricketers really set the benchmark for the rest of the group, a really good platform for us.
“Guys have not been shy of experimenting. Trying to develop themselves and with that it gives the team a better opportunity to score on a wide range of circumstances.
Even when we lost wickets in a cluster we still managed to score at 4.5/5 an over at times. Felt at no point were we under real big amounts of pressure, we were exerting it back on to them. Hopefully we can still stretch the lead further and that should be a good chase on this surface.”
