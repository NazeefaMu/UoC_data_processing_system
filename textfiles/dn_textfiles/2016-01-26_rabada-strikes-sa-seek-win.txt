Rabada strikes as SA seek win

 
Centurion, Monday: First innings hero Kagiso Rabada struck two early blows as South Africa pushed for victory on the fourth day of the fourth and final Test against England at SuperSport on Monday.
England, set an unlikely target of 382 on a deteriorating pitch, were 52 for three at the close after South Africa declared their second innings on 248 for five.
Rabada, who took seven for 112 in the first innings, dismissed Alex Hales and Nick Compton, while new ball partner Morne Morkel claimed the wicket of England captain Alastair Cook for the second time in the match.
If South Africa are able to take the remaining seven wickets on Tuesday it would be a consolation victory, with England holding a winning 2-0 lead in the series.
Hales made only one run before he received a virtually unplayable ball from Rabada which shot through low and trapped the batsman in front of his stumps.
It finished a disappointing series for Cook's latest opening partner. Hales made 136 runs in eight innings at an average of 17.00.
Cook did not last much longer before pushing back a return catch to Morne Morkel after scoring five.
Compton was next to go, for six, edging a drive against Rabada to be caught behind by Quinton de Kock. Compton sought a review which showed a clear edge.
It could have been worse for England. With South Africa using two spin bowlers in fading light, Root, on ten, survived a stumping chance off Dane Piedt, with De Kock fumbling a ball which turned sharply.
