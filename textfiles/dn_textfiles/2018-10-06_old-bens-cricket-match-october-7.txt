Old Bens cricket match on October 7

After a busy significant year 2017 filled with two events namely Annual Cricket Carnival and a get together which ended at Jaic Hilton in October, 2017, Bens 2003 Batch has now planned to raise funds to help a batch-mate in need of money to have a kidney transplant.
When the committee heard the shocking news about the suffering batch-mate they had already made plans to host a Beach Party for batch-mates inviting the retired masters at College. Committee immediately called it off and made plans to hold a Cricket Tournament at St. Benedict’s College Cricket Grounds requesting all the College batches to participate.
The of 2003 Batch would take this opportunity to thank all the sponsors who came forward to help them in this worthy cause despite the decision to cancel it.
This Sunday (October 7), all the batches listed will gather at the College Grounds, Kotahena to Swing their cricket bats and Sway their moves to Papare music.
Old Bens are welcome!
