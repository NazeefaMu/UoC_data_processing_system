‘GMOA to continue protest against SAITM’

We will continue to protest against SAITM until our demands are met by the government. Threats are not going to stop the strike launched by GMOA, GMOA Spokesperson Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
The GMOA claimed that their strike was a success and said that the strike would end at 8 a.m. today. “The progress of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) cannot be hindered by threats and suppression,” GMOA Spokesperson Dr. Navin De Soysa said.
Dr. Soysa said that they have not complicated their demands with politics unlike some other trade unions and added that only the trade unions that have unbiased demands joined hands with the GMOA.
