Over 50 ex- LG members in Kurunegala say will contest under new front

 
A group of over 50 former SLFP local government members including former chairmen and vice chairmen of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Kurunegala district said they would contest the forthcoming local government elections under a new political front formed under the leadership of Kurunegala district Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. They made this announcement at a press conference in Kurunegala yesterday.
Ibbagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha former SLFP chairman U.K.Sumith Udukumbara addressing the press conference said all former SLFP Pradeshiya Sabha members in the Kurunegala district have decided to contest under a political front led by the former President because people supporting the SLFP at grassroots level were demanding them to do so.
He said the common man had no confidence in the present SLFP.
"As former people's representatives we could not go against the people's wish," he said.
Udukumbara said they would pressurise the government to hold the Local Government elections soon as there was no earthly reason to postpone the election.
Polgahawela Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Livera Gunatilleke said the SLFP which was formed with the grouping of the five fold forces had today become a party torn with jealousy, hatred and enmity and revenge.
"We would definitely contest the forthcoming elections under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa notwithstanding any possible disciplinary action taken against us by the SLFP General Secretary," he said.
Gunatilleke alleged that certain SLFPers who won the general election by riding on the back of Rajapaksa were today undermining SLFP supporters after obtaining ministerial and other posts in the government. Among those who attended the press conference were Dhammika Hettiarachchi, Ranjith Wijenayake, D.M.Sumansiri, Raj Sisira Kumara, Thushara Sanjewa and Abdul Sattar.
However, former Mayor of Kurunegala Gamini Peramunage, former chairman of Kurunegala Pradeshiya Sabha Patrick Kumarasinghe, Mawathagama Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Upul Perera, Ridigama Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Kumari Pallemulla, Panduwasnuwara Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Ananda Jayalath and Alawwa Pradeshiya Sabha former chairman Bandara Wettawa were conspicuous by their absence at the press conference.
