'UN assignment in Mali endorses SL Army’s international capabilities'

Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake addressing the landmark Mali-bound Combat Convoy Company (CCC) of the Sri Lanka Army at the Sri Lanka Light Infantry (SLLI) Regimental Headquarters in Panagoda on Wednesday morning (20), remarked that the opportunity the Sri Lanka Army had got in Mali would testify to the world that ours is a globally-recognized organisation, dedicated for world peace. He was the chief guest for the occasion.
“The Sri Lanka Army has a history of its overseas troop deployment since the 1960's, even before I was born. To our credit, more than 1,7000 Army peacekeepers, about 300 military observers, and staff officers have to-date served foreign UN assignments world-wide with the purpose of restoring global peace. In the future, we would definitely be able to multiply our numbers in overseas assignments including Mali. I expect that all of you proceeding to Mali in a couple of days would serve as a fully-pledged professional Army, maintaining the strict discipline and dignity of the organisation,” the Commander added.
The Commander also opined that he would like to get the numbers in Mali increased to be equal to a brigade in the future and show the world that the Sri Lanka Army, like any other Army in the world, has the full potential for undertaking any responsibility at an international level. “The assignment in Mali is not for any personal gains, but for the best interest of the country.
This international involvement is also an endorsement that recognises our professionalism at an international level,” the Commander underlined.
“Note that we are a different breed of soldiers who can be identified as a special community called the ‘Rata Rakina Jathiya’ (RRJ), a new concept defined by me, irrespective of ethnic differences,” he added.Defence Services Command and Staff College Commandant Major General Ruwan Kulantunga, on behalf of Regiment Colonel SLLI Major General Amal Karunasekara, welcomed the Army Commander on arrival at the SLLI Headquarters in Panagoda.
Towards the end of the day’s programme, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake left a few thoughts about this historic mission in the Visitors’ Book before CCC Commander Lieutenant Colonel Kalana Amunupure awarded a memento to the chief guest.
