Rajapaksa family behind tense situation in Hambantota: Sujeewa Senasinghe

The tense situation at created at Hambantota Port was the doings of rabble-rouses who are politically bankrupt, State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said at a media briefing held yesterday.
“If the call records of the Rajapaksas were checked, one could easily understand who were behind these violent protests,” Senasinghe said.
“The Rajapaksa family, other than former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa and members of the Joint opposition are behind these protests. There was a Court order against certain individuals who organized the protest. They were misleading innocent people for their own political gains,” Senasinghe said.
“We are not sure whether the bhikkhus who pelted stones at the police are really monks who were dressed as monks. These people are utterly misled by false allegations made by MR followers,” he said.
Minister Senasinghe further said the police should have been strict on the violent protesters.
“These protesters forcefully entered the premises where the ceremony for laying the foundation stone for the Hambantota Industrial Zone was taking place,” Senasinghe said.
Minister of Irrigation and Water Management Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa pointed out that the protesters forcefully entered a location where the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister were present.
“What else can the police do other than using minimum force against these violent protesters? What if they attacked the Prime Minister and the Chinese Ambassador?” Minister Vijayamuni Soysa,” questioned.
“It is unworthy of the JO to carry out such disgraceful antics and mislead the public and the Maha Sangha, Minister Vijayamuni Soysa,” further said.
Soysa further said that the government’s Yahapalana approach should not be misread as not being persistent. More than 20 people including security personnel were injured, 52 arrested and about 20 remanded due to the protest against the Sri Lanka - China Logistics and Industrial Zone.The briefing was held at the Department of Government Information.
