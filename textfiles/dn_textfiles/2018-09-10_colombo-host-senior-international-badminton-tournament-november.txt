Colombo to host Senior International Badminton Tournament in November

Veteran and masters badminton players in Sri Lanka will be up against international counterparts when the Senior International Badminton Tournament begins at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium in Colombo on November 26 .
The four-day event is organised by the Ceylon Masters Badminton Association (CMBA) and is endorsed by the Sports Ministry.
Speaking during a press conference held in Colombo, the tournament's Deputy Director, Trevor Reckerman, said: “Badminton is a sport loved by many sportsmen and women that has brought many accolades to the country playing on the international scene. But sad to say, players, after reaching their peak form, give up the game at competitive level and continue at it just to maintain their fitness.
“In other countries shuttlers who have gone past 35 years, get the opportunity to continue with the game at competitive level in their countries and also conduct Invitational Tournaments at which Sri Lankan senior shuttlers too participate and bring glory to the country. Considering these facts, the Ceylon Masters Badminton Association decided to conduct the Senior International Badminton Tournament which has received the approval of the Ministry of Sports,” Reckerman said.
“The tournament will also help to promote the sport among veterans while developing the interest at international level. With many foreign senior players in action in the local arena the young local players will get the opportunity to witness them and improve on their own standards. Already players from over 10 countries have made enquiries about the tournament and had stated that they are willing to come for the event,” Reckerman added.
Competitions will be held under eight age categories, namely over 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70 in men's and women's singles, doubles and mixed doubles.
The podium winners in each category will be awarded medals and certificates while a total of $7500 will be on offer for champions and runners up of each event.
Also, during the press briefing, CMBA President Rohan de Silva launched the Association's web site www.ceylonmasters.com, which will publish all relevant details regarding the event. Interested players can enroll online via the CMBA web site before November 12 and the draw will be held on November 19.
The CMBA will hold the players briefing at Hotel Galadari, Colombo 1 on November 25 at 5.00 pm, followed by the technical officials meeting.
The event will culminate with a farewell banquet dinner, hosted by the CMBA, on the final day of the event at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium. On court doctors will be on duty at the tournament venue and an ambulance services will also be available if necessary. Participants can also hire the services of a physiotherapist with prior appointment at the venue.
The organisers have teamed up with five of the star-class hotels in Colombo in providing hospitality and travel packages for participants and the plans include the tournament's entry fees, transport, accommodation and breakfast.
