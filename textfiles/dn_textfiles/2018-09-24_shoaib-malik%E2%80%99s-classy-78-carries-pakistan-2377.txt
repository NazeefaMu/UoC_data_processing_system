In high profile Asia Cup Super Four match against India
Shoaib Malik’s classy 78 carries Pakistan to 237/7

DUBAI, Sunday: Shoaib Malik once again displayed his value to the team at the age of 37 when he hit a flawless 78 off 90 balls (4 fours, 2 sixes) to take Pakistan to a total of 237-7 in their Asia Cup Super Four match against arch rivals India at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Winning the toss and batting first Pakistan were poised to get towards a total of around 270-280, but some excellent bowling at the death by India especially Jasprit Bumrah saw them score only 26 runs off the last five overs. It left Pakistan pondering whether they had put enough runs on the board to contain the strong Indian batting line up.
Malik once again proved a thorn in the opposition’s side when he defied his age to play another classy innings in hot conditions hitting fours fours and two sixes. Yuzvendra Chahal struck in his first over by breaking the opening partnership – trapping Imam ul Haq lbw for 10, a review that India won after the appeal was over turned by the umpire.
Kuldeep Yadav’s introduction in the 11th over brought the downfall of Fakhar Zaman who has so far had a rather lean tournament with the bat with scores of 24, 0 and 0. Yesterday he looked in good nick to get over that period when he hit a six and a four in his innings of 31 off 44 balls but got out in the most unusual manner – losing his balance on a sweep and being declared out lbw. Pakistan lost the in-form Babar Azam needlessly when skipper Sarfraz Ahmed misjudged a run and left his partner high and dry to be run out for 9. Sarfraz and Malik set about repairing the innings carrying the score from 59-3 to 165-4 being involved in a 107-run stand off 138 balls that was ended when Sarfraz (44) hit a tame catch to his vis-a-vis Rohit Sharma at cover when he failed to clear in the infield.
The Indian bowlers in particular were tight in their lines and lengths and hardly made run scoring easy for the Pakistanis. The Indian ground was also brilliant making Pakistan work hard for every run. They moved around the field like a well oiled machine reminiscent of Sri Lanka’s fielding when they won the World Cup in 1996. Pakistan decided to turn on the heat when the 42nd over bowled by Kumar produced 21 runs that included two sixes hit by Asif Ali who decided to take the fight to the bowlers, but India came back strongly when they picked up Malik’s wicket at a crucial stage of the game when he was caught down the leg side off Bumrah.
After Chahal had sent back Asif Ali bowled for 30, Bumrah picked up Shadab Khan’s wicket for 10 as India snuffed out any late attempt for a late surge by Pakistan with some excellent death bowling.
