Surf’s up!

They are engaged in a livelihood that involves saving people from strong swells and rough conditions at the risk of their own lives on the beaches. Often dubbed as ‘a dangerous job in paradise,’ surf lifesaving is a multifaceted movement that comprises key aspects of voluntary lifeguard services. It is also a competitive surf sport. Originating in the early 20th century Australia, the movement has expanded globally to other countries including New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Asia.
In Sri Lanka surf life saving is still a lesser known fact but surf life savers do exist. They save a countless number of lives from danger every year. Kalana Perera has taken up this challenge and is now a skilled voluntary surf life saver attached to the The Life Saving Association of Sri Lanka (LSASL). A student of Nalanda College, Colombo, Kalana has won many accolades for swimming, a passion which he put to good use by saving lives on the beach.
Q: How did you get into surf life saving?
A: I did swimming from grade one at Nalanda College. I joined life saving at grade eight in 2009 but I have been a member of the college swimming team since 2004. I obtained the bronze award as a surf life saver in 2010 from the LSASL. Nalanda College Life Saving Club is in charge of a certain area on Mount Lavinia beach.
Children who are above 15 are eligible to become surf life savers. Nalanda pioneered the life saving sport among schools in Sri Lanka. Apart from Nalanda College, Ananda College and Dharmapala College, Pannipitiya, have life saving clubs. The students have to pass a theory and practical exam before qualifying as a surf life saver. The theory exam comprises questions about the history and first aid methods linked with surf life saving while practicals encompass Simulated Emergency Response Competition (SERC) tests where we have to do demonstrations as well as swim about 400m in the sea.
The first step into become a surf life saver is to obtain the basic life saving certificate. That is the foundation. Next you have to get the intermediate certificate. If you have won the bronze medal that means that you are a globally accepted surf life saver. However this has to be renewed every two years because surf life savers have to be update on the information and methods linked with the field.
Q: Can anyone who can swim become a good life saver?
A: No. There are instances in which swimmers too can drown at times. A life saver should have a good stamina. Apart from good swimming skills he or she should have the ability to run fast as well as have the knowledge on how to act in certain situations.
Q: What should one possess to become a good surf life saver?
A: There is no special feature but you need to have at least the basic knowledge in swimming. There are many categories of life savings around the world like ice rescue, fire fighters etc. We have serf rescue in Sri Lanka. Possessing leadership qualities is an added bonus because the surf life saver can excel in his task. What really stands out is the person’s ability to act according to the situation.
Q: Is surf life saving a profession?
A: One can become a professional life guard but since we are still schooling, we are volunteers. Therefore we are known as life savers. This is something that is not quite recognized as a profession in Sri Lanka yet. We are in charge of the coastal areas in the sea rather than going deep into the sea. We mostly rescue swimmers.
Q: How is life saving categorized as a sport?
A: There are two categories in life saving. They are life saving as a duty and life saving as a sport. It has a humanitarian purpose as a sport with the purpose of training better life savers and life guards. The life saving sports’ primary intention is to encourage life savers to develop, maintain and improve the essential physical and mental skills needed to save lives in the aquatic environment. The sport consists of a series of competition disciplines intended to further develop and demonstrate lifesaving skills, fitness and motivation.
Q: Tell us about your experience at Rescue 2014.
A: The competition was held in Montpellier, France. Our team won ninth place at the man’s beachflags (youth category) event. Competitors start off from a prone starting position on the beach, rise, turn and race to obtain a beach flag buried upright in the sand 20m away. Since there are always fewer batons than competitors, those who fail to obtain a baton are eliminated in the game.
A team made up of 12 members represented Sri Lanka at Rescue 2014 in the open and youth (under 19) categories. I was part of the under 19 national youth team. There were six members in our team: Dilanka Shehan, Senal Hasintha, Rusiru Praveen, Dinith Pabasara, Dhanushka Hansaka and myself. More than 85 countries took part in the event.
Q: How is life saving accepted around the world?
A: t is a well recognized profession in most of the foreign countries. They are given a lot of facilities and have sponsors as well.
Q: What is your most memorable experience linked with surf life saving?
A: There are many unofficial incidents. Once around six swimmers clung onto me during a rescue. That was scary but we managed to pull them through. On several occasions we managed to save people who would have drowned if we had not gotten to them in the nick of time.
Every moment is a new experience in surf life saving. You have to be dedicated to the task because another person’s life is in your hands.
Q: Tell us a bit about your family.
A: My father is L G S Perera. He is a businessman. My mother, J W P Mangalika, is a housewife. I am the only child in my family.
Q: Would you choose to be a life saver even in the future?
A: I wish to continue with my sports activities even in the future. I was captain of the Nalanda Swimming Team for 2014/2015 and I have achieved many merits and colours for swimming as well as life saving. I am already selected for the national pool. We have two tours in South Africa and New Zealand planned for this year. The selections for the international competitions are in March.
Q: What is your advice to other youth who would like to become surf life savers?
A: I am a Buddhist so I believe that saving another’s life is a meritorious activity. Anyone who is a strong swimmer can undergo the examination to qualify as a surf life guard. You just have to have good swimming skills, the interest and dedication to enter this field.
