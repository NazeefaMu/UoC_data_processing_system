Gammanpila on how MR could regain power

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and UPFA parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila yesterday spoke about several ways how former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could regain power.
“If the office of the President shall become vacant, Parliament can re-appoint former President Rajapaksa to fill the vacancy.
“According to Article 31(2) of the constitution, people cannot re-elect a President who has held the post on two occasions. But nowhere in the constitution it says that Parliament cannot do so,” Gammanpila said.
He said it was the new government which brought the 19th Amendment which curtailed the maximum term of a President to hold office to two terms.
Gammanpila said this was done to keep out Rajapaksa from regaining Presidency and added they still left loopholes.
He said Rajapaksa could become the Prime Minister with majority consent in Parliament.
“If he has majority support in the legislature he can be appointed as the Premier,” Gammanpila added. Speaking to the media in Colombo, Gammanpila said the joint opposition will launch a mass agitation campaign if the government tries to postpone the next Presidential election.
Commenting on the 65th SLFP convention held at Kurunegala last Sunday, Gammanpila said the crowd present was below 10,000 and added that the comments made by some SLFP leaders it was the biggest ever was a mere rhetoric.
He said former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had not met the President recently as predicted in some newspaper reports.
Gammanpila identified himself as the unofficial spokesman for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
