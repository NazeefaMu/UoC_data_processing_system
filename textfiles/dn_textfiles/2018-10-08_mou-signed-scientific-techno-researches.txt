MoU signed for scientific, techno researches

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Ministry and the Chinese Academy of Science last week at the ministry office at Sethsiripaya.
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and the Chinese Academy of Science Vice Chairman signed it.
The MoU will pave the way to establish and expand scientific and technological research cooperation between the two parties. The ministry will cooperate with the Chinese academy through bilateral symposia, exchange of scientists, joint research, the operation of education centers, cooperative projects and technology transfer programs, and exchange of information and publications. A feasibility study will be carried out in this regard on receiving earth observation data from Chinese counterpart agencies. Experts and scientists on selected areas will be exchanged thereafter.
