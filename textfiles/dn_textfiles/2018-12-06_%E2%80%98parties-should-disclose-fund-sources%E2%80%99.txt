‘Parties should disclose fund sources’

Transparency International Sri Lanka Director General Asoka Obeyesekere yesterday said that political party representatives should file declarations as to where their campaign financing came from.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, he said his organisation had stressed that political parties must disclose where their funds came from for campaigning.
“There should be legal consequences too, if these declarations are made inaccurately,” he said.
Obeyesekere said that parties should also disclose the ways they receive support aside from monetary assistance.
He added that parties may receive assistance in form print media or TV commercials, and that there should be a mechanism to include them in the declarations.
He confirmed that the disclosure of assets of public representatives for scrutiny does not clash with privacy rights and data protection.
“Asset declarations of public representatives are a powerful tool to prevent corruption,” Obeyesekere said.
