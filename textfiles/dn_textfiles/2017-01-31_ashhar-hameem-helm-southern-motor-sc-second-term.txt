Ashhar Hameem at the helm of Southern Motor SC for second term

Ashhar Hameem has been elected to the presidency of the Southern Motor Sports Club (SMSC) for a second term during the club’s 21st Annual General Meeting held on January 22 at the Pearl Palace Hotel, Matara.
Hameem is a pioneering member of the SMSC and earlier served as the president from 2000 to 2003.
He has been a live wire for all SMSC activities since the club’s inception in 1997 and was a one of two vice presidents of the previous regime.
Hameem will have the services of rally maestro, Andrew Silva, better known as the ‘Rally Guru’ as his secretary who is also elected for a second term. Earlier Silva served as the SMSC secretary from 2004 to 2007. As all of the newly elected individuals are long standing committed members of the club, Hameem is confident of work towards a very successful tenure with the support of his fellow officials.
