JETWING VIL UYANA CELEBRATES WORLD ENVIRONMENT DAY

To celebrate World Environment Day Jetwing Vil Uyana organized a competition for Kimbissa Junior School, Digampathaha Junior School and Udawelayayagama Junior High School. The competition was based on themes surrounding current environmental issues and was categorized into Art, Poetry and Speech.
A total of 137 children participated in the competition.
Hiran Cooray, Chairman, Jetwing Hotels said: “We are dependent on the environment for everything, so it is our responsibility to make every effort to protect planet earth. Interactive competitions of this nature encourage the youth to step outdoors and appreciate nature’s beauty and importance. We believe bringing out the natural creativity embedded in these children helps generate new concepts and ideas for preserving the environment.”
“Through them their families would also understand the importance of being responsible so that our footprint as a community is positive. Sustainable tourism has been close to our hearts for over 45 years and apart from being responsible in our own activities we always want to guide the community towards conserving nature.”
Family owned and in the tourism industry for the past 45 years, Jetwing Hotels has surpassed expectation at every aspect. Building on their foundation of being passionate, as well as the experience of true, traditional Sri Lankan hospitality, constantly pioneering discoveries captures the essence of the brand. Such a strong statement and direction have enabled Jetwing Hotels to imagine, create and manage marvels and masterpieces, where distinctive design and elegant comfort complement each other and the environment.
In line with the Jetwing Hotels Sustainable Strategy, across all properties sustainable and responsible practices are given precedence with resource efficiency, community upliftment and education, and awareness being some of our key focus areas.
