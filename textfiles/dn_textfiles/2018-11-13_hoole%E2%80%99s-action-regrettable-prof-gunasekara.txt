Hoole’s action regrettable - Prof. Gunasekara

Although going before the Courts to challenge the dissolution of Parliament is a right of any citizen, one cannot condone a Member of the Elections Commission too challenging the President’s decision in Court, Prof. Dinesh Kesara Gunasekara of the Law Faculty of Canterbury University told the Daily News yesterday.
“When Parliament stands dissolved, all those who cherish democracy must make use of that opportunity to go before the people. By taking this kind of issue to the Supreme Court more important cases are being held up. This is part of the carnival being enacted at Temple Trees. It is time to give up these silly antics and face the coming election,” he added.
