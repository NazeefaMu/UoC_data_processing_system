Amaraweera calls for immediate investigation

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who has drawn immediate attention to allegations made by Indian fishermen regarding the death of an Indian fisherman, has written to the Defence Ministry Secretary to launch an immediate investigation into the matter to elicit true information.
It is alleged that one person died and two others were injured when some persons opened fire at a group of Indian fishermen in the Sri Lankan waters on March 6 night.
A Fisheries Ministry release said although Indian fishermen were blaming the Sri Lanka Navy regarding this alleged incident, the Sri Lanka Navy had denied any responsibility for it.
However, Minister Amaraweera has pressed for an immediate investigation into the whole issue to obtain correct information. Minister Amaraweera had also spoken to the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka over the phone yesterday and discussed the matter in length. The Minister has told the High Commissioner that Sri Lanka would not leave any room to disrupt the longstanding friendship and good neighbourly relations between Sri Lanka and India due to incidents of this nature.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Affairs Ministry stated in a release that the Government of Sri Lanka is deeply concerned about the alleged shooting of Indian fishermen, and the connected loss of life of one fisherman and injury caused to another.
“The safety of fishermen is of utmost importance and the Government of Sri Lanka is firm in its commitment to ensuring that all Government agencies treat all Indian fishermen in a humane manner at all times,” the release stated.
“Initial investigations indicate that the Sri Lanka Navy is not involved in this alleged incident.
Irrespective of the parties involved, if in fact a shooting has taken place, it is a matter of grave concern, and all possible action will be taken in cooperation with the relevant Indian authorities to investigate into this incident, utilizing GPS technology as well,” the release added.
