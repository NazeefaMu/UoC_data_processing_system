Jaffna had top cricketers in the 1960's – DIG Nimal Lewke

I like to congratulate young Vijayakanth Viyaskandan a fast bowler from Jaffna Central who was selected for the under 19 Sri Lanka squad. There are many talented cricketers in the Northern Province.
Speaking exclusively to the Daily News, former St. Sylvester’s Cricketer, national boxer as well as national rugby player, Senior DIG Nimal Lewke Said “My memories take me back to the 60s. There again if I am not mistaken, it was Donald Ganesh Kumar from Jaffna Central who got selected to the national school’s cricket team as an excellent all-rounder and as a Junior i still remember he scored a brilliant 175 against St. Sylvester’s at Police Ground Asgiriya in the mid 1960’s when St. Sylvester’s had bowlers of the calibre of S K Basnayake, Nihal Samarasekera, Lionel Perera etc. Ganesh Kumar later joined the Police as a Sub Inspector with some of the outstanding sportsmen like Jayakumar Thangavelu - Boxer, Ranjith Dharmaratne, Daya Jayasundara etc.
But, due to illness he died very young. When I saw this news item my memories took me back to the era where Jaffna schools produced some of the best cricketers like the days Donald Ganesh Kumar played for the Police team and the Police Inter Division.
Hope these youngsters and many more youngsters from the North of the calibre of Ganesh Kumar, Surendran, Devendran, Suriyakumar, Nadarajasingham, Muthu Thambi, Sothilingam, Anton Benedict, Pathkumaraja, Sathyadeva, Vipulanandan, Sothilingam, will be unearthed” concluded Lewke.
