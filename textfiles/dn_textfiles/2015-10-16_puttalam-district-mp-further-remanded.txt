Puttalam district MP further remanded

Puttalam District UPFA MP Sanath Nishantha was further remanded by Chilaw Magistrate and District Judge Heshantha De Mel, as he failed to fulfill bail conditions.
The Judge ordered the release of Parliamentarian Sanath Nishantha on a cash bail of Rs. 25,000 and two personal bails of Rs. 250,000 each. The Judge also sought the assets declaration of the sureties. As the sureties failed to produce their assets declarations in court , Parliamentarian Nishantha was ordered to be re-remanded.
The court had issued a warrant on him in connection with the alleged bombing and assaulting of several police officers attached to the Chilaw Police station on December 20, 1999.
The case was taken up in court for hearing on September 25 and as the MP had not reported to Court, the Magistrate had issued a warrant against him.
