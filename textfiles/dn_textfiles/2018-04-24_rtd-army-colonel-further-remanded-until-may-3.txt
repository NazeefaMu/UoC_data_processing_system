Avant Garde case
Rtd. Army Colonel further remanded until May 3

The Galle Chief Magistrate, rejecting a bail application submitted on behalf of retired Army Colonel Don Thomas Albert Wijethunga who was being held in remand custody in connection with the Avant Garde case, ordered him to be further remanded until May 3.
The suspect was allegedly the former storekeeper of the floating armoury on board the vessel MV Avant Garde.
The ship MV Avant Garde was seized by the Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015, for allegedly keeping a firearms depository on board and handed it over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for subsequent investigations.
The defense pointed out that in the B report, the submissions were made under the Public Property Act and subsequently, further suggestions were tendered regarding the origin of the firearms.
The Defense attorney further argued that although it was announced that a letter issued by the Defense Ministry regarding the details of the firearms was discovered at the time of the raid, no such details were reported to courts.
In response to the defense's submissions, the State Counselor representing the Attorney General stated that the Criminal Investigation Department had acted on fair grounds and that according to the Government Analysis Department, all armaments were automatic firearms. He added that charges against the suspects were criminal offences punishable with life-imprisonment and it was not a bailable offence at a Magistrate's Court.
Consequently, the magistrate rejected the application and further remanded the suspect until May 3.
Attorney-at-Law Harith Hettiarachchi appeared for the suspect, while the Criminal Investigation Department was represented by IP Lasantha Rathnayake and State Counsel Janaka Bandara represented the Attorney General.
