Money talks

Sri Lanka’s Government expenditure for 2017 will be around Rs 1,819 bn, nearly 18.8% of GDP. Taxes were increased steeply in the last budget to help pay for this expenditure.
Is this money being properly spent? Is the public receiving value for its money? How do we ensure that the money spent delivers benefits? How do we hold the Government accountable?
When a person is given the responsibility to hold, use or dispose of resources not belonging to him, he must be held fully answerable to the owner of the resources for what he does with them. This, in essence, is the principle of accountability. The Government is spending public money. We need to know if it is properly spent.
In the Westminster tradition, Sri Lanka has a Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) to scrutinise spending. Unfortunately, for multiple reasons, as currently structured it is weak.
The COPA is responsible for overseeing government expenditures, and to ensure they are effective and honest. The committee is seen as a crucial mechanism for ensuring transparency and accountability in government financial operations, having been described by Professor Peter Hennessy specialist in the history of government as "the queen of the select committees...[which] by its very existence exert[s] a cleansing effect in all government departments”.
As it is a key part of our accountability arrangements to safeguard public money some suggestions to strengthen its functions follow.
The suggestions may appear to be radical, but the holders of office should understand that they must act solely in the public interest and should be willing to submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their office.
COPA’s independence
The COPA must always be chaired by a member of the opposition. In Sri Lanka, It is currently chaired by a government MP, who also holds a Cabinet post, a double disqualification which raises serious questions about the COPA’s independence.
As a standard of good practice as well as by tradition, the COPA must be chaired by a member of the Opposition to promote independent scrutiny. For the same reason, Cabinet Ministers who form a part of Executive should not be appointed to the COPA, much less chair it.
Given the surfeit of Ministers there may be practical difficulties in finding ordinary MPs to appoint to the committee, but even if Ministers are appointed they should be expected to recuse themselves from meetings when matters under their purview are examined, a protocol that the Chair should strictly enforce.
It is also reported that attendance at COPA meetings is poor due to a large number of committees that MPs must attend.
A COPA whose independence is already compromised and whose meetings are poorly attended is unlikely to be an effective check on the executive.
A solution to both issues would be to appoint non-parliamentarians to the COPA. This is not without precedent and given the importance of the committee something that should be considered seriously.
Committee hearings
Given that the work of the committee is of a technical nature it is important that people with the necessary skills are appointed. It is suggested that the main accountancy bodies; the ICASL, CIMA, ACCA, AAT and the Chartered Financial Analysts be invited to recommend a member each to be appointed to the COPA.
The presence of non-parliamentarians would strengthen the independence of the COPA. Having a number of technically competent people to review finances would greatly enhance the degree of scrutiny possible.
To enhance this still further the COPA meetings should be open to the media and the public. In the UK even tourists are welcome to attend committee hearings.
The media have a crucial role in reporting the work of the COPA to the public. Media scrutiny and the public interest will make the Executive more alert and likely to respond positively to COPA recommendations in a timely manner.
The typical financial audit looks at the accuracy of the records; whether revenues have been collected and properly accounted for, expenditure has been incurred in accordance with the wishes of Parliament and that accounting for financial transactions is accurate, complete and in compliance with the relevant laws and financial rules.
The COPA and the Auditor General now need to expand this scope and scrutinise the value for money—the economy, efficiency and effectiveness—of public spending.
Three criteria are to assess the value for money of government spending i.e. the optimal use of resources to achieve the intended outcomes.
1. Economy: minimising the cost of resources used or required (inputs) – spending less.
2. Efficiency: the relationship between the output of goods or services and the resources to produce them – spending well.
3. Effectiveness: the relationship between the intended and actual results of public spending (outcomes) – spending wisely.
Public institutions may have spent money as approved by the Parliament and recorded the expenses correctly but have they achieved the purpose for which the money was allocated? If the purpose was achieved, was it done in the most efficient manner possible?
At a time when the public is suffering under a high burden of the tax, maintaining the level of public services, while at the same time freezing, or even reducing total public spending should be the goal. It sounds contrarian but is possible if the Government re-thinks the way in which public services are delivered.
There will, and should be, tussles in this committee but as the UK government admitted “… the Committee has thus helped the Government to secure financial savings, raise the standards of public services and improve the quality of delivery”.
Shouldn’t we expect the same?
