The Next Economic   Revolution   Just (re)Launched:   Congratulate   SpaceX, Thank NASA

Elon Musk and NASA have shifted the financial calculus of space and in doing so they have transformed America’s economic future. On Thursday, Musk’s SpaceX successfully relaunched the first previously flown orbital rocket. This reusable launch system, along with those in development by Musk’s entrepreneurial competitors will change our lives.
The development of a robust space economy promises growth, astounding new products and services, amazing high-tech jobs and a quantum leap in our national security capabilities. All of this was made possible by a series of visionary public-private partnerships initiated by NASA.
The Next Economic Revolution Has Arrived
Launch cost has always been the primary constraint in the space business. If access to space weren’t so expensive we’d have an astounding amount of entrepreneurial activity in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and beyond. Space tourism, materials development, pharmaceutical research, power generation, communications, earth imaging and national security all have “killer apps” just waiting for reliable and affordable access to space.
 In the past few years, commercial competition has driven down the price for a mid-sized (10 – 15 metric ton) orbital space launch from over $150million to under $65million. Reusability will quickly cut that price by another 30% or more. As serious competitors like ULA and Blue Origin enter the reusable market we could see launches for as low as $30million. This downward trend will continue as reusable rockets get simpler and higher demand drives economies of scale into the production of what are now very specialized materials and components. After all, the fuel costs for a space launch are very low – typically less than $1million.
The combination of continually falling costs and constantly increasing performance promises an economic environment analogous to the one we saw during the PC and software boom of the 80s and its follow-on, the Internet explosion of the 90s. In 1980, very few Americans foresaw that their world and fortunes were about to be transformed by affordable computing.
 Those that did see this coming made a lot of money during the PC/Internet boom. Several of them even became rich enough to start building rocket companies. Aspiring entrepreneurs and savvy investors should think seriously about why the founders of PayPal, Amazon, Google, Virgin and Microsoft are pouring $billions into space startups. This just might be 1980 all over again and time for sideline investors to start looking at which applications the space launch revolution will make affordable and profitable.
 A Pre-Flown Rocket is “Tested Safe” an Expendable One is . . .  Well, Not So Much
 So far, the reuse story has centered around the potential cost savings of “used” rockets, moderated by the concerns about the reliability of flying a payload or crew on a “used” vehicle. Thinking of this rocket as “used” is a completely backward way of viewing this monumental event. With any other vehicle, manufacturers assume that each individual unit must be operationally tested before it transports passengers or goods and the customer expects and desires that operational testing. Simply starting the engines and declaring a vehicle ready to go would be a frightening idea.
 As an air traveler, would you want to board a plane that had never been tested in flight? That will never happen, because Boeing and Airbus won’t (and can’t) deliver a plane that has not been flight tested. Each and every one of their commercial airliners goes through at least one pre-delivery flight and more if anomalies are detected. After that, the plane is flown to the paint facility to have the airline’s livery applied. With the colors on the new jet then takes a joint customer-manufacturer flight test. Finally, it is flown off to join the airline’s fleet somewhere. That’s at least four flights before a single paying passenger is wedged into a middle row coach seat.
 Wander around a new car lot and try to find a “new” car with zero miles on its odometer. You won’t. Every car on the lot has several miles on it, because the auto manufacturers test every vehicle, usually on a test track at the factory and sometimes in the real world.
 Iterative Improvement Based on Data
 Satellite operators don’t buy rockets, they purchase launch services. Service must be Reliable. Reliability depends on predictability. Predictability is based on data. An unflown rocket has no flight data. With flight data, anomalies in a particular vehicle can be identified and addressed. Designs for the entire model line are iteratively improved via analysis of returned vehicles. Reuse will make every rocket flight less expensive and safer.
The obvious, but often unexpected, conclusion is: customers will pay more to place their precious payloads on previously flown vehicles while the first flights of the shiny new ones will have to be discounted. Reuse will drive prices down, but reusable rockets will also command a competitive market advantage. Expendable rockets will cease to exist outside of niche markets on the low (venture class) and high (SLS) ends of the launch market.
An American Future, Again
 As with the PC and the Internet, American innovation in space will drive our economic growth for at least a generation. Dominance of the space business will ensure that the U.S. economy remains the most powerful on Earth.
Our global competitors in Russia, China and even Europe remain wedded to an antiquated socialist vision of space development. Their space “programs” are run by state-owned enterprises and quasi-governmental national champions. While they flirt with very small commercial endeavors and rebrand their government bureaucracies as “companies”, the political leaders of these nations are very unlikely to truly let go of a strategic national industry with military implications.
The current trend already suggest that it is time to put a fork in China’s Great Wall Industry Corp, Russia’s TsSKB Progress and Europe’s Arianespace. In 2011, the U.S. had surrendered the entire mid-sized commercial space launch business to subsidized global competition. Just four years later, SpaceX had recaptured half of that market. SpaceX’s success has motivated ULA to aggressively pursue commercial launches as well. Reuse and new competitors will restore 80% or more of this business to America over the next few years.
All of this aligns perfectly with the trade and job creation goals of the new White House. Support for commercial space goes back to Ronald Reagan’s signing of the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984 and the Trump team has stated that public-private partnership will form the cornerstone of American space policy.
 Thank You NASA
 The particular Falcon 9 rocket that SpaceX relaunched this week was originally built for NASA and flown on a mission to resupply the International Space Station (ISS). More significantly, the entire Falcon 9 program was made possible by support from NASA under its innovative Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) programme.
 Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, COTS solved NASA’s problem for ISS resupply. COTS competitors SpaceX and Orbital ATK filled this need faster and cheaper than a traditional government rocket program would have. NASA gained two new rocket and capsule systems for less than $1billion. Traditional, cost plus contracting for these systems would easily have exceeded $2billion per vehicle and they would not have been ready in time to keep the station supplied when Russia’s progress resupply rockets began to fail.
The agency’s follow-up program, Commercial Crew, promises to do the same for human spaceflight. SpaceX and Boeing are producing advanced capsules that will send NASA astronauts to the ISS using existing Falcon and Atlas rockets. Space tourists and astronauts from other nations will soon be paying these firms for rides, launching another American industry.
Throughout this process, NASA, along with the Airforce, have provided important launch and tracking infrastructure to commercial operators at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). KSC’s director Bob Cabana is running successful commercial partnerships with many firms. SpaceX is launching from historic Pad 39A while ULA is doing commercial launches just around the corner. Jeff Bezo’s Blue Origin has its own pad at KSC as well and a manufacturing plant for their New Glenn reusable rocket is rising just outside the gates.
NASA must also be commended for supporting SpaceX’s efforts to innovate and test reusability on NASA missions and other launches from their facilities. This was not a requirement and the space agency has gone the extra mile to help American industry gain this important leg up. NASA’s public-private partnerships offer a proven model for achieving President Trump’s goal of running government more like a business.
Cost Savings across Agencies
The benefits of the reuse revolution will extend beyond the commercial sector. Over the next few years reusable rockets will force costs down across the spectrum of space launch markets, benefiting all customers including government ones. While NASA will call on its flagship Space Launch System (SLS) for really big jobs (above metric 70 tons), reuse will allow NASA to save $billions on launches for the majority of the agency’s missions. We will get a lot more science out of the existing budget.
Redundant, disaggregated and highly responsive space systems are key to success on a 21st century battlefield. Reusable launch systems will allow the DOD to do a lot more for our warfighters with less of our tax dollars. Our global military rivals, dependent on their state-owned aerospace bureaucracies, will find they are once again unable to keep up with American innovation.
Funding Urgently Required to Support the Space Boom
All this commercial space activity presents a challenge to a couple of obscure and sadly underfunded government agencies that were established as part of Reagan’s commercial space initiative. The FAA’s Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST) regulates commercial spaceflights with the specific mandate of protecting the uninvolved public. While AST has been doing a truly commendable job, it’s current resources are entirely inadequate for the task it faces.
Congressman Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma, a member of the House Science and Technology Committee, has called for increasing the funding for AST from a paltry $19million to $23million. Bridenstine commented, “The agency must be properly resourced to allow the private sector to innovate and grow the space economy which affects every aspect of our lives.” Amen.
The Commerce Department’s Office of Space Commerce (OSC) is charged with advocating for U.S. commercial space in both domestic and foreign markets. The OSC, which is tasked with supporting a $246billion space industry, squeaks by on a budget of about $1million.
Seriously, you can’t buy a condo in D.C. for that. The tiny agency has been hidden inside of NOAA and left without a permanent director for the last eight years. This situation is simply ludicrous given America’s commercial opportunities in space.
AST, OSC and our commercial space firms must be fully supported if America is to dominate the economy of the 21st century.
Let’s take a moment to congratulate SpaceX and to thank NASA for creating this astounding opportunity. Our entrepreneurs, investors and government must work together to seize it!
