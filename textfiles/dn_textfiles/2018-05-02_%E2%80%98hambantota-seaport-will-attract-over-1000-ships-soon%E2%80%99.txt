‘Hambantota seaport will attract over 1000 ships soon’

Over 300 ships pass the Hambantota sea port daily to Singapore and European countries.
Therefore, it will be a highly important port in the region before long, a naval engineer said. He said 1,000 ships would arrive at the Hambantota port after its completion. Foreign vehicle manufacturers say that unloading vehicles at the Hambantota port is much cheaper when compared to the rate of other regional ports.
He said the Mattala Airport could provide thousands jobs to the youths in Southern Province.
