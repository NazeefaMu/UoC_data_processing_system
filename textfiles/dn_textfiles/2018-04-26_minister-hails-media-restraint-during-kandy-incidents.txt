Minister hails media restraint during Kandy incidents

There are inadequacies in the police force, but considering the huge tasks they are vested with, they are doing a great service to the country. Hence, they need the assistance of the media to give them feedback on their actions and the changes that need to be taken to improve themselves. The government increased the salaries of the police by 40 percent, said Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
Referring to the reports that there is tension between the police and the police commission, he said there are always differences of opinion, but there are specific functions that are assigned to each institution and despite the differences, these two institutions need to work together to provide the best service to the country.
He appealed to the media to report facts and refrain from reporting issues that cause friction and to refrain from sensationalising incidents. He appreciated the manner in which the media acted in connection with the incidents in Kandy recently. Therefore he called on the media to verify facts with the police prior to reporting, in order to take the right message to the people.
Joining the media briefing held last Tuesday, the Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara said the police and media alike are services to the nation. He said as such both need to work according to a national agenda and not our personal agendas. Similarly, he said if the media reports are based on the agendas of certain parties or groups, then we will not be able to meet this national duty.
He said that if a police officer commits an offence, then the media needs to point it out and criticise him, but it should not be done as a personal vendetta. “The media have a responsibility to report, having studied the whole story, rather than highlighting a certain section that creates issues and tarnishes the image of the police as a whole. Every member of the police is an individual and the institution as a whole should not be brought down due to the actions of a handful.”
The police force is a key institution that is responsible for the preservation of law and order in the country and it has a huge responsibility. “Today the police have a huge responsibility in dealing with crimes, especially drug rings and the underworld. It is not an easy task and police officers put their lives on the line every single day. Hence, yes, the media should highlight the wrongdoings of the police if it happens, but not in a manner that would bring the whole police department to disrepute,” he said.
However, he said there are certain weaknesses and failures of the police, but the police department is involved in every aspect of people’s lives from the birth certificate to the death certificate and every matter within. “However, whether the police meet all these expectations is a matter to be questioned and I do admit that the performance of the police is not up to expected standards. However, I intend to rectify these deficiencies and make the police force more efficient,” he assured. He said that in some areas the police officers have to work under very difficult conditions without even the most basic facilities. “Under these circumstances, how can you expect them to perform at their best? Hence, we have taken measures to provide the police officers with all facilities that are required in order to have them perform to their best by providing them training, facilities and measures needed for their personal development,” said the IGP.
