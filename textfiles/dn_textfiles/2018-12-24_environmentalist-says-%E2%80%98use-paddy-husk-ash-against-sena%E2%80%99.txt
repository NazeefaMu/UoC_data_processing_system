Environmentalist says ‘use paddy husk ash against Sena’

Farmers can control spreading ‘Sena’ caterpillar in two weeks by using Paddy husks (dhaiya) founder of the Sobadahama Farm, environmentalist Tilak Kandegama said.
He was addressing a press briefing in Sigiriya yesterday. Sena has been invading many cabbage and maize cultivations for two years now, he said. It now has become a menace since the relevant department has not taken steps to control the threat.
The department now attempts to destroy male species of Sena but it is futile, he said. It is allergic to the ash of paddy husks and farmers must spread the ash in the morning in their cultivations for about two weeks to make the caterpillar disappear from their lands, he said.
Kandegama said the Agriculture Minister should pay attention to this issue and encourage farmers to spread dahiya ash in their cultivations. The paddy husks are available from paddy mills as much as they need but the farmers must be provided with transportation, he said.
Kandegama said Agriculture Department officials are trying to control the menace with chemicals but indigenous methods are available to resolve the issue in a few days.
