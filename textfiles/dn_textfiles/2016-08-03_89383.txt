Protest march showcases government’s unpopularity: JO

The Joint Opposition yesterday said the ‘Jana Satana Paada Yatra’ protest march from Kandy to Colombo showcased the government’s unpopularity in a short period.
Mahindananda Aluthgamage MP told journalists in Colombo that the Paada Yatra was held against the government while overcoming many obstacles.
He said the march had attracted hundreds of thousands of people. The Lipton Circus and the Town Hall area were full of people on August 1, he said.
The MP said government leaders had worked to stop the march, but failed in the face of the people’s power.
He challenged the government and those who opposed the JO march to get at least half the crowd to Colombo which the Paada Yatra was able to attract on its final day.
He criticised the stand taken by the Police while adding that the law enforcement officers had tried to scuttle the march to please their political masters.
