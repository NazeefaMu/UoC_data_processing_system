World Bank lauds Sri Lanka’s healthcare system

Sri Lanka’s healthcare system has a good track record. For about 50 years, it had achieved positive outcomes in maternal and child health, and infectious disease control than predicted by its income level, Universal Health Coverage Study Series Number 38 published by the World Bank states.
The publication adds that the health financing indicators show that the healthcare system is both pro-poor and efficient. There are few, if any, other low or middle-income countries that had achieved strong health outcomes, good financial protection and low cost. Many countries are lauded for achieving two out of three, but a few can claim to have done as well as Sri Lanka on all fronts, especially considering that it is still classified as a lower middle-income country, the report states.
According to the publication, the objective of this case study is to describe the main features and achievements of Sri Lanka’s high-performing healthcare system and to provide lessons to the rest of the world.
“The cornerstone of Sri Lanka’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) agenda had been supply-side efforts to ensure strong service delivery. It had provided universal and free access to government healthcare services to its population since the 1930s. Preventive healthcare services are provided through a well-planned network of facilities across the country, each of which is led by a Medical Officer of Health. Their responsibilities include maternal and child health and infectious disease control. The separate curative care network offers comprehensive services but is less well-organized,” the report states.
“As there is no referral system, many patients bypass lower-level facilities in favor of secondary and tertiary care. The private sector also plays an important role in Sri Lanka’s healthcare system, especially in the context of outpatient curative care, where government doctors can supplement their salaries during off-duty hours and patients willing to pay out-of-pocket can receive more convenient and personalized care,” the publication states.
