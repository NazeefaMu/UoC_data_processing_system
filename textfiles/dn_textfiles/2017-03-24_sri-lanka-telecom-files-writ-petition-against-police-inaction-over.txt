Sri Lanka Telecom files writ petition against police inaction over manpower employees

 
Sri Lanka Telecom PLC has filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal against the inaction on the part of the police to take legal action to prevent the continuing unlawful activities by the employees of SLT Human Capital Solutions (Pvt) Ltd in front of the SLT headquarters.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah, the respondent including the Fort police were directed to give police complaints made by SLT.
The petitioner stated that from time to time, the employees of Human Capital Solutions (HCS) have purported to agitate to be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the petitioner.
On or about 26th December 2016, the All Ceylon Telecommunication Employees Union launched a purported trade union action demanding that the employees of HCS be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the petitioner.
The petitioner maintained that the demand made by the employees of HCS is inter alia unlawful and unreasonable or unjustified in law.
The petitioner stated that the protests were being done in a manner which was highly obstructive to the public, especially the users of the payments and the petitioner issued an order under section 106(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The petitioner has cited the OIC of the Fort Police Station, SSP Colombo Central Division, IGP Pujitha Jayasundara, SLT Human Capital and several others as respondents.
The respondents were noticed to appear in Court on April 4. President’s Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena, counsel Lakshana Perera instructed by Sudath Perera Associates appeared for the petitioner.
