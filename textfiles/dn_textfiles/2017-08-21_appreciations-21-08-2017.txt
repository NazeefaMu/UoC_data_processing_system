[APPRECIATIONS - (21-08-2017)]

Anandatissa De Alwis
A true godfather
Whenever my dear family friend Manel Abhayarathna calls me, she never fails to ask me why I don't write a piece on my uncle. In her own inimitable style, she would say “You were so close to him, so why don't you write about him? In today's world of politics and politicians, he stands out as a unique figure.” This refrain had been going on for many years whenever she meets me or speaks to me, but has always been an unfinished conversation. But now, with his 21st death anniversary approaching and with me getting older, I thought it is perhaps the right time to put pen to paper and write of my late uncle and godfather. I don't know if he would appreciate it, for he never sought publicity or media spotlight.
Maha Amarasinghege Anandatissa de Alwis—journalist, politician, advertising guru, Member of Parliament, Governor, Cabinet Minister and Speaker of the House—was a fitting example of a hard working self-made man who made a success of whatever he set his sights on, except for his own benefit.
As my uncle and also as my godfather, though he knew me from the day I was born, I got to know him only when I was a teenager, when he was known as ‘Chief’ by all who worked for him in the advertising industry and elsewhere.
Though he never once demanded any respect, the reference to ‘Chief’ seemed to have been created to describe his personality. He carried a certain aura which aptly suited a ‘Chief’ and though he displayed a stern facade, he was a softie inside.
Chief was a handsome man who carried a magnetic personality and one who was able to get the best of his charges by simply encouraging them to do things on their own. Although I have known him since I was a toddler, I really got to know him after he and his sons Anthony (Sandy) and Ranjith moved in with us to support my family following the sudden death of my father—the sole breadwinner in my family. Our family comprised my mother, Elmo, Helen, Frank and myself. He treated us all like his own children and at some stage, all of us played a role in his life. To my dear mother, one of the six sisters Chief helped bring up, the devastating blow of losing her husband at such a young age was somewhat softened by this move as she, much like the rest of the De Alwis girls, adored and hero-worshipped their brother. At times, Chief found this somewhat embarrassing, especially when he discovered that some of his brothers-in-law were not amused by their wives’ unfailing dedication and loyalty to him!
The Ad industry and JWT
Chief's career in Advertising began with his association with Reggie Candappa—a brilliant visualiser and artist who later took ‘Grants Advertising’ to great heights. With Chief's creative copywriting skills and Reggie Candappa's visualising and artistic skills, they made a formidable team in the local Ad industry. Chief left ‘Grants’ to take up an offer from J. Walter Thompson's (JWT) International.
My affection for the Advertising Industry took root at an early age when I used to eavesdrop on the discussions at home, some of which went on till late night. I later gathered that they were unofficial ‘plans board meeting’ and usually comprised a few senior executives form JWT to which Chief had been tasked to resurrect by its Regional Office then located in India.
JWT's head office had decided to wind up in Colombo and had its Regional Head based in India visit Colombo to mop up operations. The late Percy Colombage, who was Chief Advertising Manager of ‘Lake House’ newspapers, persuaded the man to give it one more try before winding up and introduced Chief to him. The first meeting at Galle Face Hotel had gone well, but to Percy's horror, the second was not promising. The Englishman had been rather curt and after turning up late for the initial twenty-minute interview, had indicated that he will get back to Chief with his decision. At the second, Chief had deliberately delayed in attending the meeting and when the Englishman voiced his displeasure, Chief had retorted that it was he who needed a Manager and that Chief did not need JWT! Much later, they became close friends. Chief was credited for having brought JWT back to leadership in the industry before quitting to take up the position of Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of State under J. R. Jayawardene in 1965.
My late brother Elmo, was also a keen participant at these ‘plans board meetings’ and assisted in the accounts dept in the early stages, as Chief refused to offer him employment because he was a nephew. Later, on the recommendation of the regional office, Elmo was absorbed to the permanent staff of JWT and was an Accounts Manager until he left to take up a higher posting at AJN Seneviratne and Sons, under Noel Seneviratne. Following the downfall of the then UNP government in 1970, Chief went back to the advertising industry and set up his own.
A nature lover
To Chief, benefits and privileges meant nothing. In fact, as a Cabinet Minister, he was not even aware that he was entitled to a duty-free car permit every once in three years.
Perhaps this lack of interest in material things may have been borne out of the hard life he had as a young man trying to look after six pretty sisters by himself. Struck by the unfortunate and premature commitment commitment of his wife (my father's sister) to a Nursing Home, Chief was quite content with the least in materialism but sought the most in his reading.
After decades in politics and public life, as a former MP, Governor, Speaker and Cabinet Minister, he had not owned a house and died in a rented flat in Colpetty. His wealth was his library which he guarded with unbelievable affection and would only lend to people he identified we 'literary minded.' His love for nature, in particular, flowers, could not be hidden. He began reading volumes about orchids and roses and consulted many experts in the country and the only opportunity he got to try his hand at it was when he was appointed Permanent Secretary and afforded a house with a garden. He wasted little time in developing his garden and spent hours, even at night, minding and even talking to the plants! He once told me that he visited an orchid garden in Thailand and the owner taught him to communicate with the plants; a practice he began in his garden too.
He also developed a liking for cockerels and was once gifted a beautiful pair from Thailand and had them taken care of by one of his sisters living some 10 miles out of Colombo. He would visit them whenever he could, and spend hours with them.
A fascinating conversationalist and orator
Chief held a soft spot for India and marveled at its culture and often quoted great Indian leaders. When the legendary philosopher Krishnamurthy visited Sri Lanka, it was Chief who was tasked to interview him on TV. Ravi Shankar and many other Indians of repute were among his favourites. In a stirring speech in Parliament. Chief once castigated the country for seeking markets in the western world when a huge Indian market was staring us in the face! This was more than 30 years ago and it is only today that we are realizing his vision, albeit slowly.
His ability to speak on virtually any subject was simply amazing. He delighted his audiences with his style of delivery and wit. He was comfortable with any subject, be it, Politics, Art, Literature, Religion, Culture, History and possessed deep insights to the subjects. His wit was observed on numerous occasions both in Parliament and outside.
When I introduced my prospective wife to him. She was visibly nervous and mentioned to him that she felt like been interviewed for a job. Chief responded by telling her not to worry too much as it would be one job interview at which he hoped the applicant would not possess experience!
Though born a Buddhist, he adored the Blessed Virgin Mother and never left his abode without worshiping her image. He could quote from the Dammapada as well as the Bible and also quote Prophet Mohammed and Hindu religious texts.
I also recall an occasion when he wanted to discuss some issues with me and not wanting to be late for a function at which he was the chief guest, asked me to ride with him in the car and discuss the matter during the drive. As we approached the venue, he asked me that the function was about! He had not brought his letter of invitation and was clueless of the occasion. Having reached the hotel where the function was, he was met by the organisers and the GM of the hotel and most reluctantly, I was dragged into an event which I was not even invited to! Though I was embarrassed by the turn of events, I was proud of his performance—no one realized that he did not know what the function was about when he left for it! He sat at the head table on the podium and all he had was a glance at a banner behind him and the one or two known people representing the organisers of the event. The manner in which he enthralled the audience on that occasion left me thanking the good Lord for giving me that opportunity to witness his skills. Many who knew him will vouch for his prowess as an orator of the highest calibre. He would often reminisce his days as a member of the YMCA and the exposure he received there and was proud of his alma mater—Ananda College, Colombo. There are so many instances which I can recount to illustrate this man and his character, but whoever deems it fit to publish this ‘piece’ will find it too lengthy.
The introduction of Television to Sri Lanka, the ground work to break the shackles of media monopoly by the State, the guidance to tourism in Sri Lanka, the respect and freedom of the Press and journalists are among the few areas which Chief was able to launch.
Unsung hero
Many in this generation are unaware of the achievements of this man who should surely go down as one of the most humble unsung heroes of this beautiful country which he loved so much and gave up so much for.
Though many friends persuaded him to write books, he never good down to it and would always give a philosophical response and bury the thought. Professor Thilak Ratnakara reiterates this fact when he refers to it in his foreword in the book ‘Collected Speeches of Dr. Anandatissa De Alwis’ thus, ‘Though this country loses from this extreme reticence on his part, it shows his lack of intellectual arrogance.”
This is the only published book I am aware of and that too produced at the initiative of Manel Abhayaratna.
Irwin Weerakkody, former journalist who also excelled in Sinhala copywriting and later establishing Phoenix Advertising, wrote a pamphlet on Chief for his election campaign.
As uncle and nephew, we were very close to each other and as a result, we also had our differences. Fortunately, saner counsel prevailed and I thank God for having given me the opportunity to be among the last to see him on the morning of his 75th birthday which unfortunately was the day before he passed away.
In Christian scripture, it is said that abstaining from food and drink is not the only sacrifice one can make; abstaining from the things you like to do to please yourself is even more meritorious. Chief made many such sacrifices throughout his life time and will have definitely pleased God.

Thilakasoma de Silva
Banker with a big heart
Born inAhangama, he had his early education at Mahinda College, Galle and thereafter graduated from Vidyodaya University. His banking career started with People's Bank immediately after his graduation in 1964. Thereafter, he worked at National Savings Bank, Commercial Bank and finally at Sampath Bank until his retirement. After his retirement, he had short stints with Seylan Bank and the Organisation of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka.
We came under his wings, when we joined Commercial Bank of Ceylon as junior clerks in 1979. He was the credit officer in charge of our department. As a Manger, he was a very professional banker. As a person, he was a modest gentleman and a humble human being. He worked with great devotion and positive commitment. Gaining popularity was not a concern for him. Gaining wealth was not what he cared for in life.
When Sampath Bank was started in 1987, he joined as the Credit Manager for retail businesses. His passion and commitment to serve small and medium entrepreneurs aligned well with Sampath Bank’s objective of helping and improving small ventures that may not fit into to the footprint of many other banks. His well-rounded advice and extended helping hand paved the way forward for many small businessmen who were struggling to get their ventures off the ground. The success story is that he was behind the growth of many ventures that are considered market leaders of today. His dream was to see small-timers becoming leading businessmen in Sri Lanka.As a credit manager, he carefully nurtured many junior officers. Although he was our Manager by rank, for us he was a dear friend. Whenever we were faced with a problem he was always there to help us. We vividly remember how he helped one of our junior officers who made a wrong move. It was Silva who came to his rescue. Silva offered to accompany that junior officer to see the chief manager. On behalf of his junior officer, he presented the case to the chief manager and the junior officer accepted the responsibility for the wrongdoing. The chief manager commended that junior officer for being truthful and praised his honesty. If not for Silva’s encouragement and guidance, that officer may not have had the courage to go up to the chief manager and would have had to pay heavily for his sins. Silva was always there for his staff members.
We have not seen him in confrontations; may it be with the senior management or with the junior officers of his department. He was a team player; he would stand by decisions of the majority, even though that may not be his preferred choice. Senior management respected him as a manager with a vision. Junior staff members at all levels loved him as a manager they could trust. There are many bankers (holding high positions today) who were trained and mentored by him when they were starting their professional careers. He enjoyed entertaining his friends, colleagues and even his junior staff members. The door of his residence was always open to all those whom he associated with.
With his demise, the country has not only lost the benefit of the depth of his knowledge, wealth of experience and mastery of proven skills in banking which he gained having served banks in various capacities for many years, but also a friend, a mentor and good human being.
He is survived by his loving and devoted wife who is a retired teacher, and his two loving daughters both of whom are now overseas.May he attain Nibbana!

Dr. Upali Mahanama
A friend indeed
In the Sunday Times of July 30, an appreciation was written about Dr. Upali Mahanama by one of his closest friends Mailk Cader, under the heading 'Service to humanity was the best of his work.' I could not agree with him more in his description of Upali.
In 1970, I too had the privilege of being introduced to this wonderful gentleman by the name of Upali. I was later informed that his surname was Mahanama. As we all know, 'maha' means big or great and true to his name, he remained a great friend of mine since that day onwards.
I say this knowing his achievements; some of which I would like to mention below.
He was a versatile cricketer, cricket adminstrator, umpire, MCA president, a vocalist, a speaker of no mean repute, entertainer, compere, cabaret artiste, social worker, director of several companies and truly a great friend!
He was founder president of the Colombo South Jaycees and won six out of nine national awards. He was awarded best Jaycee and his chapter Colombo South won an Asian award for a project called 'operation clean up.'
In 1972, at the JCI conference in Hong Kong, Upali was elected the chairman of the conference's bid committee.
In 1977, he was national president of the Sri Lanka JCs and was awarded the JCI Senatorship; the highest international honour. he was elected JCI World Vice President to Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland.
Some years later, I followed his footsteps in freemasonry and worked closely with him on several charity projects.
While working on various projects, what struck me most about Upali was that if a plan did not work out, he would change the plan, not the goal. The goal remained the same and was achieved. Merits performed throughout his life include helping friends at time of need, finding employment and shelter, settling family disputes, advising people who were going astray and being a strength to the poor, the weak and many others; too many to mention. Another trait in upali was his humour and wit. If laughter is the best medicine, then Upali was the best person in that field.
There is a Mexican saying: 'a man dies three times.'
The first is when his soul leaves his body.
The next is when he is cremated or buried and is now out of sight. The third is when his friends and relatives have forgotten him.
In the case of Upali, he will never have that third death as he is one unforgettable character.
He leaves behind his wife Swarna and two sons, Devaka and Roshan and their families, who loved him dearly.
