Korean loans for 190 garbage collecting compactors

The Korean government has agreed to provide two concessional loans of USD 14 million (approximately Rs. 2,240 million) to supply 190 garbage collecting compactors to local authorities in keeping with the Korean government’s target of strengthening local authorities with necessary equipment and technology to introduce modern solid waste management practices.
The signing of the loan agreement took place yesterday, at the Finance and Planning Ministry. The loan agreement was signed by Finance and Planning Ministry Secretary Dr. R H S Samarathunga and Chief Representative of the Export- Import Bank of Korea Jung Sung-soo.
The projects will be implemented by the Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Ministry.
An increasing volume of solid waste generated in the urban and suburban areas has become a nationwide problem and the rapid growth of population in urban areas, recent changes of consumption patterns and growing industrial and economic activities have directly associated with the problem.
Due to the present inadequate capacity for the collection and transportation of solid waste and outdated technology in handling solid waste by local authorities, various health and other hazardous situations have occurred in urban areas.
Currently, most of the garbage is being transported in open trailers attached to tractors. As a prerequisite to promote a sustainable solid waste management system, the capacity of waste collection and transportation of local authorities need to be improved.
In this context, the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of the Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) of Korea has agreed to provide two loans in Korean Won not exceeding the equivalent of US$ 14,000,000 to supply 190 garbage collecting compactors to improve the garbage collecting capacity of 84 local authorities in Sri Lanka.
The interest rate is 0 percent with a repayment period of 30 years, including a grace period of 10 years, according to a press release from the Korean Embassy.
