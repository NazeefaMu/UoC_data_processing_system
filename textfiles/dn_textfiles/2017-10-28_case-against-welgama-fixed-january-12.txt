Case against Welgama fixed for January 12

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday fixed for January 12, the corruption case filed against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama for allegedly causing an unlawful loss to the government after appointing an individual as a Deputy Chairman of Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) in contrary to the Transport Act. 
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artigala, the Court was informed that Kumara Welgama has filed a revision application in the High Court challenging the Magistrate’s Court decision to accept amended charge sheets filed against the former Minister by Bribery Commission. The High Court is yet to deliver a verdict in this regard.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against former Minister Welgama under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges. The Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had unlawfully appointed L. A. Wimalaratne as the Deputy Chairman of the SLTB on June 23, 2010, while he was serving as the Transport Minister.
The Bribery Commission further alleged that the Former Minister had paved the way to confer a payment of Rs.3.2 million to the Deputy Chairman as his salary and other benefits, causing an unlawful loss to the government.
