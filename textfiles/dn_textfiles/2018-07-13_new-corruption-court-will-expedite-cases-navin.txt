Financial misappropriations:
New Corruption Court will expedite cases: Navin

UNP National Organiser and Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said yesterday that court cases with regard to financial misappropriations would be expedited once the New Corruption Court convened next week.
Addressing a media briefing held at the United National Party (UNP) Headquarters, Sirikotha, yesterday, the minister said the present government was accused of not apprehending culprits responsible for financial frauds and corruption, and that the said action would be an answer to those allegations.
“We always abide by the law and we did not want to overstep the rule of law. That is why there was a delay in the process,” Minister Dissanayake said.
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who had obtained several interim injections on most of his cases, had requested that his cases should be taken up firstly by the Special Courts, he said, adding that it was a hypocritical statement. “The current government does not wish to interfere with the media’s freedom and the independence of the judiciary. We will not allow the white van culture to rise again, even if we were to be defeated at the next Presidential election,” he added.
