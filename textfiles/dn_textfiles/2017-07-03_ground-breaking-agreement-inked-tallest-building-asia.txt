Ground breaking agreement inked for tallest building in Asia

The much hyped and long awaited agreement of the tallest building in the Asian Region and the 9th tallest to be in the world, the World Capital Centre (WCC) has signed it’s USD 2 billion Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) investment agreement with the Board of Investment (BOI) on Friday .
The World Capital Centre also known as WCC is a globally renowned chain will be the center of multiple trading and service providing establishments will be having an astonishing twin tower with modern amenities of 117 floors, gracing a height of 625 meters with an estimated total project cost of USD 2 billion to be built in the heart of Colombo’s commercial area.
It will include 1,200 residential units, 2,000 hotel rooms, 3,000 retail outlets, 5,000 car parking spaces, the WCC 7-star hotel, 20 swimming pools, gold presidential suites with gold-plated interiors, world’s fastest double-decker elevators and the first Michelin starred restaurant in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka being centrally located in South Asia is perfectly poised to be the launch pad for the capital center owing to all the bi-lateral trade agreements, close ties with the developing nations and the long trade history with the rest of the world.
While many International Banks have been operating in Sri Lanka for decades, the ending of the war has seen the expat community blooming together with large multinational companies looking to invest in new businesses or to open up branches. Within the region Sri Lanka is very easy to do business with and eventually has the potential to become what Dubai is to the Middle East, what London is to Europe, what Singapore is to South-East Asia or what New York is to the Americas.
WCC intends to be the first Financial Center to offer an innovative vehicle for Investment Companies to have their South Asian base here in Sri Lanka giving an extraordinary boost to the economic development of the country. This proposed building would be the tallest in Asia and the 9th in the world as accepted by the Skyscraper Center of U.S.A., and will be largest tower in the world having a total built up area of 800,000 square meters first of its kind in Sri Lanka, which would be an ultimate tribute to Sri Lanka as well as in the Asian economy, expected to be completed by end of year 2022.
