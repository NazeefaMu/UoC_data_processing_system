Prizes, copter ride for winners of SLAF art competition

The prize giving of the SLAF’s Guwan Siththara all-island art competition was held at Air Force Headquarters on Saturday under the patronage of Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy.
Fifteen children who were adjudged winners in the Primary, Junior and Senior Student categories were chosen out of over 25,000 participants from all corners of the island.
The children received their prizes and certificates from the Commander and the first of each category received a cash prize of Rs. 100,000, while the second and third place winners received cash prizes of Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 25,000 respectively.
The winners were also treated to a helicopter ride on an Air Force MI-17 helicopter from Colombo to Ratmalana Air Base. On arrival in Ratmalana, the children were taken on a tour of the Air Force Museum.
This event was organized by SLAF Chief Recruiting Officer Air Commodore Janaka Amarasinghe, supported by the SLAF Command Development Project Officer Air Commodore Amal Wimalarathne and the Commanding Officer of SLAF Station Colombo, Air Commodore Waruna Gunawaradana.
