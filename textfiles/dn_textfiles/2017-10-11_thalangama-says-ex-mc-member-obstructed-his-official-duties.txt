Thalangama says ex-MC member obstructed his official duties

Kandy Deputy Elections Commissioner Namal Thalangama has lodged a complaint with the Kandy Police against a former member of the Kandy Municipal Council alleging that the latter abused him and obstructed his official duties.
The former Municipal Council member too has made a counter complaint with the police alleging that the Deputy Elections Commissioner abused and threatened him.
The Deputy Elections Commissioner in his complaint said the former Municipal Councillor, residing near Kandy Dharmaraja Vidyalaya premises, visited his office on October 3 to ascertain as to why his daughter’s name had not been included in the voters’ list. When he (Deputy Elections Commissioner) explained the reasons for the exclusion of the name, the Councillor who refused to accept the circumstance which led to the exclusion of the name was abused and threatened by the Councillor.
Namal Thalangama said all his staff would attend work wearing black bands this week to register their protest against attempts to influence and harm the independence of the Election Commission by acts of this nature.
