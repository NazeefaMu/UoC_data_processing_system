Cabinet reshuffle today

The much anticipated Cabinet reshuffle is to take place at the Presidential Secretariat today and all ministers are informed to be present by 9.30 am, a senior government Minister said yesterday.
This would be the second Cabinet reshuffle effected by the government since it took office in 2015. Highly placed political sources said there will be 32 United National Party Ministers and 10 United People’s Freedom Alliance Ministers in the new Cabinet.
Special Assignment Minister Sarath Amunugama is slated to get additional responsibilities, according to sources.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan when inquired said that ministers were informed by the Presidential Secretariat to arrive early, by 9:30 a.m..
“Other than that, I have no other information,” Minister Ganesan said.
President Maithripala Sirisena in April said he wanted further Cabinet changes, after new ministers were sworn-in at the end of February.
President Sirisena changed the portfolios of several UNP ministers on February 25, including six Cabinet Ministers, three State Ministers, and one Deputy Minister.
Six SLFP ministers resigned from the Cabinet recently after they voted for the Joint Opposition sponsored No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
