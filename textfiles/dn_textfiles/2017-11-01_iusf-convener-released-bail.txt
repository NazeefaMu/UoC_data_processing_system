IUSF convener released on bail

Inter University Student’s Federation convener Lahiru Weerasekara and Inter University Bhikkhu’s Federation Convener Ven Tanpitiye Sugathananda Thera have been released on bail. They were held in remand custody for violating court orders.
Two suspects were held in remand custody for allegedly violating a Court order while engaged in a protest held in Colombo on October 10 demanding the government to abolish SAITM. The suspects were ordered to adhere with bail conditions.
They were ordered to be released on two sureties of Rs. 200,000 each by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The Kollupitiya police had complained that several protestors including the suspects had disregarded the Court Order and attempted to proceed towards Temple Trees despite the Court order being read to them, urging not to proceed with the procession causing disturbance to public peace and obstructing the regular traffic flow.
