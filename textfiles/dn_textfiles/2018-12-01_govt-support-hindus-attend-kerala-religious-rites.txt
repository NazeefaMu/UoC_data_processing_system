Govt. support for Hindus to attend Kerala religious rites

The government will provide travelling facilities to proceed to India for Hindu devotees participating in the poojas held at Aiyappan Swarimalai Kovil in Kerala, India.
The religious festival held at Aiappan Kovil is deemed to be of special significance to Hindus.
Approval has been granted by the Cabinet of Ministers to the proposal submitted by Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister Douglas Devananda, after considering of the longstanding request made by Hindu devotees in this regard.
The festival takes place annually from November 15 to January 15 the following year.
A meeting was held at the Department of Hindu Religious Affairs to raise awareness among Hindu religious dignitaries and devotees recently in this regard, headed by Minister Devananda.
Now the opportunity is created for Hindu devotees to proceed to Kerala State in India to worship Aiyappan Swarimalai Kovil annually with government assistance similar to support extended to Buddhists to travel to Buddha Gaya and Muslims to Mecca.
Nearly 15,000 devotees are expected to participate in the religious ceremony held at Aiyappan Swarimalai Kovil this time. The Indian government is to grant visas free to all religious participants.
The minister said the attention of the government has been directed to set up a boat service between Talaimanar and Rameshwaran in the near future, as travel by air is too expensive for devotees.
Uma Maheshwaran, Director, Department of Hindu Religious Affairs, K. Dayananda, Private Secretary to the minister and Muttu Murugan, Coordinating Secretary to the minister participated.
