Emerging from ethnocentric cocoons!

The 30-year-civil war came to an end in Sri Lanka, and the Women’s Education and Research Centre (WERC) in Colombo thought to promote three-wheel taxi service providers among women in Jaffna. Their aim was to introduce non-traditional occupations and provide a safe mode of transportation for women in the area if they were to choose a taxi. Ten beneficiaries were chosen for the project. They were trained, helped get driving licences and were given brand new three-wheelers on lease in 2012. A year later, only a couple of women three wheeler drivers remained. The rest had either sold their vehicles or given them to male members of their family. What went wrong?
It was not ‘acceptable’ to have ‘Tamil women’ driving three-wheelers.
This is an example from the research paper carried out by Dr. Muttukrishna Sarvananthan, Jeyapraba Suresh, and Anushani Alagarajah titled “Feminism, Nationalism, and Labour in Post-Civil War Northern Province of Sri Lanka,” which speaks of the ethno-feminism, sub-nationalism and other cultural barriers which keep women out of the workforce despite their high education.
When it comes to social indicators such as the Gender–related Development Index (GDI), Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and Gender Inequality Index (GII, successor to GEM since 2010) prepared annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Global Gender Gap Index prepared annually by the World Economic Forum (since 2006), Sri Lanka ranks top of South Asian countries, but when it comes to female labour force participation rate, it continues to score a dismal 34-36 percent.
The Northern and the Eastern Provinces show no difference. While these provinces contribute minimum to the country’s GDP, they also have the lowest rate of women labour. The former beating the latter in terms of numbers.
The Department of Census and Statistics in 2012 showed that the Northern Province had the highest female unemployment rates; Kilinochchi 29.4, Mannar 21.6, and Mullaithivu 20.5 percent.
“In other districts of the North and East, women unemployment rates were over 10 percent in 2012. In contrast, unemployment rates among men of the North and East were less than 4 percent,” Dr. Sarvananthan’s team research paper points out.
Ironically, women make up the majority (51.5 percent) in the Northern Province. The Jaffna district alone accounted for the highest share of women among the 25 districts in the country.
According to the UN, close of the gender gap in employment could add $12 trillion to global GDP by 2025.
President Maithripala Sirisena on a recent visit to Jaffna to launch his ‘Tell the President’ hotline observed that the North needed a new strategy to fast track development in the area. As we celebrate Women’s Day today, it is important for the President to have the majority of the citizens in these provinces contribute to their labour force and in turn to their development. Hence it is important to study the factors that keep women out of the labour force.
What hold women back?
The research as highlighted in the taxi service example showed that some of the main barriers to engaging in work come from within the community or family/household itself or are self-imposed (by women themselves). In a way, ‘women’ are bound by what the community perceives to be their ‘appropriate role in society’ and what kind of work they ‘should be doing’.
“The self, family, or community imposed barriers could be due to societal norms, cultural practices, and/or discriminatory community-based customary laws,” the research paper points out and customary laws like the Thesawalamai inheritance laws, which restrict ownership of land to women, make it harder for women to access “institutional credit due to lack of collateral.”
In addition, women are seen and they themselves are keen on being ‘cultural bearers’ of their respective community and want to ‘uphold decency and respectability’ as a reflection of ethno- nationalism.
When it comes to external barriers, workplaces do not seem to promote female labour. The research highlights that sexual harassment and fear of rape stop women from travelling far in search of work; especially in sparsely populated jungle areas of the Vanni: the Kilinochchi, Mannar, Mullaitivu, and Vavuniya districts.
Private businesses are reluctant to hire women as many are seen to be coming with the added responsibilities of child and elderly care duties, “frequent absenteeism due to religious fasting negatively impacts the productivity of their business,” the research paper points out, is another obstacle for employment.
More importantly, the research brings out “ethno-feminism and sub-nationalism of a section of the northern Tamil people in the post-civil war period appear to have been inimical to the economic empowerment of women in the Northern Province. Tamil sub-nationalism argues that intra-community discrimination/marginalisation in terms of caste, class, and gender could not be addressed before the ‘national liberation’. Hence, the rights of the sub-groups are subsumed into the rights of the group,” the research states.
“Subtle sub-nationalism in terms of what jobs are appropriate for women expressed covertly and/or overtly by the local communities (by both men and women) has limited the demand for goods and services thereby dissuading women from continuing their non-traditional vocations,” it further explains.
Tamil army women
The best example of this sub-nationalism and ethno-feminism was exposed when the army decided to recruit Tamil women into its fold.
The army, which was mainly a mono-ethnic force, wished to rectify this situation in the aftermath of the civil war and embarked on a programme to recruit Tamil men and women to the Auxiliary Force as “a first minor step towards making it a multi-ethnic army”.
But the research paper which studied this programme observed, “Initially, the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) recruited little over 100 unmarried women in the Kilinochchi and the Mullaitivu districts of the Northern Province (the heartland of the Tamil Tigers) in late-2012,” but the programme faced much opposition from “A few individual women’s rights activists as well as an informal network of Muslim and Tamil women’s rights activists in particular and human rights activists in general in the Tamil-dominated Eastern and the Northern Provinces. These groups claimed that such recruitment was not voluntary, that the women were treated as “comfort women” or “sex slaves”, and that the families of the women were coerced to allow their daughters or sisters to join the army.”
Dr Sarvananthan’s team used Kanchana Ruwanpura’s (2008) observations to remark, “While women’s groups/networks ameliorate the impact of the high intensity civil war on women, ‘it also controls and monitors women’s behaviour’”.
Despite the vocal opposition, however, four years after the first recruitment, over 90 percent of recruits chose to remain with the army. In 2014, another round of recruitments took place with much less opposition this time around. “The foregoing uncorroborated accusations against the Sri Lankan army could have stigmatised the Tamil women (who overwhelmingly appear to have voluntarily joined) and their families more than the army. On the one hand, the Tamils have persistently complained that the Sri Lankan armed forces were deliberately keeping out the Tamils from joining the armed forces and accused them of racism. On the other hand, when Tamils are recruited, the armed forces are accused of using them as sex slaves without any evidence whatsoever. Even a retired Supreme Court Judge noted the research as the reason why a few women had dropped out of the army.
The case of Tamil women being recruited into the army, the research notes was certainly coated with a ‘gender dimension’ as the recruitment of Tamil men into the Civil Defence Force and the army after the war did not face as much opposition from the Tamil community, Tamil women’s rights groups, and Tamil politicians. This paradox, the state wants to have equal recruitment policies while it does not want to apply the policy to the women in the community has left development in the North at stagnation.
The research paper also notes, “The foregoing episode reveals the hypocrisy of Tamil ethno-feminism and Tamil sub-nationalism amidst high unemployment rates among women in former conflict-affected districts. Paradoxically, the feminist arguments for overcoming the historical stereotypical gender division of labour are undermined by the open and hidden sub-nationalist sentiments against Tamil women joining the SLA by women’s rights activists in the North and elsewhere (including in the Tamil Diaspora)”. In the end, “Women are doubly disadvantaged in conflict/post-conflict or disaster/post-disaster settings because women are used as pawns in the expression of nationalism/sub-nationalism.”
Overcoming cultural bias
The barriers found in this research paper, however, are not just limited to the Tamil community, but similar issues of cultural bias are found in all ethnic communities in the country.
UN Secretary General António Guterres in his statement on Women’s Day this year too observed, “Around the world, tradition, cultural values and religion are being misused to curtail women’s rights, to entrench sexism and defend misogynistic practices”.
“Despite some improvements, leadership positions across the board are still held by men, and the economic gender gap is widening thanks to outdated attitudes and entrenched male chauvinism. We must change this by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world,” Guterres added .
It is internationally accepted that when women participate fully in the labour force, it creates more opportunities and generates growth, but in Sri Lanka we will also have to have women first free themselves of the cultures that cocoon and bind their potential, so they can finally drive that three wheeler or fight to defend our motherland.
