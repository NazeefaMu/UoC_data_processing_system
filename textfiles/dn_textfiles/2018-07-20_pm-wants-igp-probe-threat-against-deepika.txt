PM wants IGP to probe  threat against Deepika

The Prime Minister’s Office has vehemently condemned the malicious statement made against Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission (SLHRC) Chairperson Dr. Mrs Deepika Udagama recently and directed the IGP to conduct an investigation about it. The Prime Minister’s Office in a press release issued yesterday said the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission is an independent institution appointed under the provisions of the Sri Lanka Constitution. Threats of this nature posed to the Chairperson of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and publication of such irresponsible statements through the print media is a matter of serious concern.
The Prime Minister’s Office has therefore instructed the IGP to ensure the security of the Chairperson and other members of the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and the staff of the Commission.
