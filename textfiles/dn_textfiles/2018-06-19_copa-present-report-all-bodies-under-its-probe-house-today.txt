COPA to present report on all bodies under its probe to House today

The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) will present a report on 837 institutions coming under its probe in Parliament today, COPA Chairman and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said.
The report is based on the Auditor General’s observations on annual accounts of public institutions for 2016. The evaluation has been done using five questionnaires prepared by the Committee.
The Chairman said a performance evaluation ceremony based on this report will be held in another two months with the participation of the President, Prime Minister and the Speaker.
He was addressing an awareness programme for Parliamentary Journalists organised by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, at Water’s Edge in Battaramulla yesterday morning.
A similar report of all public institutions coming under COPA based on annual reports of 2015 was presented to Parliament on November 13, 2017.
The Chairman said the evaluation of institutions for year 2017 has already begun.
“Our aim is to probe and present the reports on the previous year before the end of next year,” he said.
Speaking further, Alagiyawanna said that in future all institutions which are subjected to COPA investigation will have to present their cases with regards to any concerns raised within two months. In the COPA Chairman’s speech it was revealed that only 160 public institutions have been summoned before COPA during 2010-2015.
Three reports have been submitted during the said period of time. In contrast, during the two years of 2016 to 2018, COPA has investigated into 125 institutes and records six reports. Alagiyawanna said that COPA will make its probes, supervision and follow up process stronger to minimize the mismanagement of public funds. “Now there is an opinion built in our society that COPA and COPE exist to fight corruption, catch thieves and apply the law against them.
“I am not disassociating the fact that we are responsible to reveal such corruption and bring forth recommendations to put a stop to such acts.
“Strict supervision and follow up are important, but we know that we cannot recover the losses we have incurred due to these corruption.
“So, what is most important is to make sure that these institutes follow proper finance management. All MPs have an immense responsibility thrust upon them to make sure proper management of public funds is done.
“This is one of the main reasons why the general public sent us to Parliament,” Alagiyawanna said. Alagyawanna also said that the present COPA has understood that establishing continuous direct connections with the 837 institutions have decreased poor public finance management in them. “Summoning the institutions before COPA itself has been a very promising act.
