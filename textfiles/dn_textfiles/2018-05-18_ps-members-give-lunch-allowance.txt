PS members give up lunch allowance

All councillors of the Wennappuwa Pradeshiya Sabha unanimously agreed to use the money that is allocated for their mid-day meal during their monthly meetings, for development of the PS area.
There were about 22 councillors previously and that number has increased to 44. Considering the heavy public expenditure incurred for their lunch, all of the councillors agreed to donate the money for the common good of the people in that area. Each councillor is allocated Rs.600 for each meeting.
However, they decided to accept only the communication allowance granted to them. Each councillor is granted Rs.3,000 per monthly as communication allowance.
