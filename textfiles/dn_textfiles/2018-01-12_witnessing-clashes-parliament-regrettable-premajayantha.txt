Witnessing clashes in Parliament is regrettable: Premajayantha

It is regrettable to witness unnecessary clashes in Parliament, as the main task of the Parliament is law-making, Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said.
“Persons who are incapable of making laws, are fighting and quarrelling in Parliament, even though law-making is the main task of the Parliament,” he said.
The minister said so addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) weekly media briefing at its headquarters, yesterday.
The minister, while condemning the clash that erupted in Parliament on Wednesday, said it should have been avoidable, if the Speaker took necessary measures. Accordingly, the Speaker should have held a party leaders’ meeting prior to the summons.
“There should have been a party leaders’ meeting, at which all party leaders could decide the date when the bond commission report could be presented to Parliament. Considering the date, when the report would be available, the speaker could summon Parliament,” he said.
“The Special Presidential Commission on the treasury bond issue had been held for ten months. However, certain persons could not be patient for a week until the report could be submitted by January 17,” he said.
Speaking on the several allegations levelled against the bond commission by certain persons, Minister Premajayantha said that not only him, but also the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) could be satisfied with the conduct and the qualifications, experiences, capabilities, and relevance of three commissioners.
He further said that it is unfair to level allegations on the three commissioners of the bond commission, as they are among the most experienced and capable persons in their sectors.
He added that accusations related to the bond issue cannot be allowed to be heard through a civil case alone; there should be a criminal case as well.
