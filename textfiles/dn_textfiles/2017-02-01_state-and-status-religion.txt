State and the status of religion

The other day I was watching a panel discussion where an eminent scholar mentioned that Sri Lanka is a “Buddhist nation.” I do not treat his opinion as an “isolated” case because there is a segment of population, particularly within Buddhists, who wholeheartedly agree with him.
These Buddhists claim that we became a Buddhist nation when Arahant Mahinda arrived in Sri Lanka in 3rd century BC. According to their thinking, the status quo remained uninterrupted through centuries and even when we were colonised in 1815, the British gave a solemn undertaking to protect Buddhism, which was set out in Article 5 of the Kandyan Convention 1815.
Talking about the status to be accorded to Buddhism as the majority religion in our Constitution, Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera, the Lekhakadhikari of the Asgiriya Chapter, said recently that in their view the provisions of the present Constitution should be further strengthened. Ven. Thera also added that Sangha society recognises the rights of other religions which are guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution but Sri Lanka is and will be a country that protects Theravada Buddhism. Therefore, they will work for constitutional provisions to enable this task in the greater interest of generations to come.
Meanwhile, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Colombo’s Archbishop, had said that the status and respect reserved for Buddhism should remain intact in the Constitution. Justifying his contention, Cardinal Ranjith said that the teachings of Buddhism bring people relief whenever they are confronted with mental pain and discomfort. He emphasised there should be no change in the “foremost place” which it currently enjoys in the country’s Constitution.
Along with these thoughts, there are two opposing views pertaining to the status of Buddhism in our Constitution. Some claim that by proclaiming Buddhism to occupy the “foremost place” in Sri Lanka, Section 6 undermines commitments to state neutrality or non-discrimination. Others claim that Section 6 does not go far enough in its privileging of Buddhism, that it stops short of making Buddhism the official ‘State Religion,’ as it is in Cambodia and Bhutan.
Relationship
The relationship between state and religion differs from country to country. Different approaches often appear in the constitutions. Article 1 of the French Constitution determines the secular nature of the French state. The establishment clause in the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States prohibits not only the existence of an established church but has a wider meaning, as well. Article 140 of the German Constitution refers to some provisions of the Constitution of the Weimar Republic that, on the one hand, prohibit the existence of an established church but, on the other hand, lay down that religious denominations may be recognized by the state. In England, of course, the Anglican Church is the established church. In the Netherlands, the separation of church and state is assumed to be an unwritten principle of constitutional law, as the Basic Law keeps silent on this issue.
What does our own Constitution say about this? Article 9 says: “The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e).”
Article 10 indicates: “Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.” Article 14 (1) e indicates: “Every citizen is entitled to - the freedom, either by himself or in association with others, and either in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice or teaching.”
The Constitution contains no mention of Buddhism being state religion but says the State shall give to Buddhism the foremost place.
State religion
Now, let us briefly consider what is meant by a state religion.
A State Religion (or official religion, as it’s sometimes called) is a religious body officially endorsed by the state. However, a country with a state religion need not be under the control of the religion, nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the country.
State religions have been known throughout the history in almost all types of cultures. They were adopted by most ancient states, and observing them was a requirement made to all citizens, and especially public officials. For example, King Asoka in 3rd Century BC made Buddhism the state religion and provided royal patronage for its propagation both within and beyond his empire. He helped promote the metamorphosis of Buddhism into a world religion that spread peacefully across the face of Asia.
In the Near East and Middle East, many countries with Islamic population have Islam as their state religion (in its Shiite and Sunni variety). On the one hand, rulers of Saudi Arabia join secular and religious power in their hands, and Iran's secular presidents since the revolution of 1979 are supposed to follow decisions of religious authorities, Turkey, which also has mostly Muslim population, after its 1920s revolution became a secular country.
The degree to which a state religion is imposed upon citizens in contemporary society varies considerably; from absolute as in Saudi Arabia to minimal as in England, Denmark, Iceland, Greece and Norway. In SAARC countries, Bangladesh has Islam as the state religion, but other religions may be practiced in peace and harmony.
In Pakistan, the Constitution confirms Islam as the state religion. In Bhutan, Drukpa Kagyu (Mahayana) Buddhism is the state religion. In Afghanistan, the official religion is Islam. Constitution of the Maldives designates Islam as the official state religion. Nepal is a secular state and therefore there is no state religion. India does not have an official state religion.
Secularism
Secular laws would not permit particular religious doctrines to be dictated into law. A secular state has a justice system based on impartiality and not holy writ. It would not permit blasphemy laws that are so easily abused and misused. It would not contain privileges for one particular religion that put others at disadvantage. Although a secular constitution can make it illegal for the state to engage in religious persecution but it cannot stop religions going to war against each other.
Secularism, if to be successful, should have a mutual understanding between religion and state. They must each agree to respect the other's boundaries. Religions should respect each other's right to exist even if their doctrines are entirely contradictory.
Most of the countries (85%) allow citizens of any religious affiliation to be head of state. Pew Research analysis finds that 30 of the world’s countries (15%) belong to a unique group of nations that call for their heads of state to have a particular religious affiliation. In addition to the 30 countries in this analysis, another 19 nations have religious requirements for ceremonial monarchs who serve as their heads of state. Sixteen of these, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, are members of the Commonwealth of Nations with Queen Elizabeth II – also known as the Defender of the Faith – as their head of state. The other countries in this category are Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
Some analysts believe that Section 6 of our Constitution should be viewed as something of a compromise between secularism and Buddhist majoritarianism, if for no other reason, because it did not make Buddhism the “state religion.” In fact, it represents a milder version of the measures that the state would take to offer some privileges to Buddhism. On the other hand, it has not specified that the highest offices in Government (the President, Prime Ministers, etc.) should be held by Buddhists.
Indian experience
Asian countries today adhere to different models of religion-State relations, most of them recognizing one or another faith as the state religion, or otherwise privileged religion. Among those which do not, the most notable example is India.
The Indian Constitution does not recognize any of India's different faith traditions as the State or otherwise privileged religion. It describes and portrays the country as a secular State and yet there is no ‘wall of separation’ between the State and religion. No religion is banished from public life and State functions, nor is the State precluded from playing any role in matters of religion - only all religions are equal in the eyes of the State and all religious communities enjoy equal State patronage.
This is the Indian concept of secularism; and it constantly finds expression in the policies and practice of all three organs of the State - legislature, executive and judiciary.
The Indian Constitution contains some specific provisions relating to the religious practices of the Hindu majority. Of course, in general terms, it ensures for every religious denomination the right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion and for each religious minority the right to establish and administer educational institutions of its choice.
The exercise of these rights is not subjected to any formality of registration of religious communities for which there is no provision in the Indian law.
Legislative enactments in India regulate construction and use of religious places. There are laws separately controlling the management of shrines, both in general and of particular shrines of eminence, belonging to various communities and also to regulate inland and foreign pilgrimage.
Existence of a large number of statutory bodies for these purposes, all constituted and controlled by the State authorities, points out to an official establishment for various religions. The judiciary in India often decides religious issues and resolves disputes between various religious communities or sub-communities.
On the whole India is a unique Asian country legally swearing by the ideals of secularism and religious neutrality and yet preserving its age-old spirituality. How this is done, is something worth exploring.
