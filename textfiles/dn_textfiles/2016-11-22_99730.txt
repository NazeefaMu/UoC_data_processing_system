‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ is an all-new adventure returning us to the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling.
Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne (‘The Theory of Everything’) stars in the central role ofwizarding world magizoologist Newt Scamander, under the direction of David Yates, who helmed the last four ‘Harry Potter’ blockbusters.
‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident…were it not for a No-Maj(American for Muggle) named Jacob,a misplaced magicalcase, and the escape of some of Newt’s fantasticbeasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.
‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’ also stars Katherine Waterston (‘Steve Jobs,’ ‘Inherent Vice’) as Tina; Tony Award winner Dan Fogler (‘The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee’) as Jacob; Alison Sudol (‘Dig,’ ‘Transparent’) as Tina’s sister, Queenie; Ezra Miller (‘Trainwreck’) as Credence; two-time Oscar nominee Samantha Morton (‘In America,’ ‘Sweet and Lowdown’) as Mary Lou; Oscar winner Jon Voight (‘Coming Home,’ TV’s ‘Ray Donovan’) as Henry Shaw, Sr.; Ron Perlman(the ‘Hellboy”’ films) as Gnarlack; Carmen Ejogo (‘Selma’) as Seraphina; Jenn Murray (‘Brooklyn’) as Chastity; young newcomer Faith Wood-Blagrove as Modesty; and Colin Farrell ([‘True Detective’) as Percival Graves.
The film marks the screenwriting debut of J.K. Rowling, whose beloved ‘Harry Potter’ books were adapted into the top-grossing film franchise of all time.
