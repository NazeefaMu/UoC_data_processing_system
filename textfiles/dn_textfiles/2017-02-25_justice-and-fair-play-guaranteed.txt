Justice and fair play guaranteed

Bonapartism is the political ideology that arose from politics of Napoleon Bonaparte and his followers and successors. The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or authoritarian centralized state, with a strongman charismatic leader based on anti-elitist rhetoric, army support, and conservative religious support.
Marx used “Bonapartism” to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary elements seize power in an uprising undermining revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular masses.
Traditional dictatorships
Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class. Marx believed that such leaders in the end had corrupted revolutions in Europe. More generally, “Bonapartism” may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by pro military leadership within revolutionary movements. Recently -Bonapartism is used to refer to political movements focusing around a strong leader, who is often a hero to the people, and upholds the ideals of the people.
Thus Neo-Bonapartist philosophy is characterized by the leader. It is believed that a strong and capable leader is necessary for the ideals the Bonapartists support. The leader is usually a great hero of the people - in most historical cases being military in nature - who brings about reforms in their name. This philosophy by itself has never been popular, and thus is almost always used in conjunction with others. Neo-Bonapartists are often similar to enlightened despots who use their absolute power to advance liberalism, freedoms, and social welfare, though in many cases of supposed Bonapartism, the exact opposite is achieved; giving rise to regimes, more like traditional dictatorships.
Nationalism is also often a component of Bonapartism, though not a necessary one. In spite of theory, as Marx explained, Bonapartist leaders emerge to balance contending social pressures. Popular actions draw support from politically conscious middle class. Is that happening in our society too? Our democratic revolution has come to a crisis point with some conservative forces demanding not to change the executive presidency. They want Maithripala Sirisena to continue as an executive president to stand above corruption and injustice to become a spiritual leader.
Suffering masses
These people blindly believe that Mahinda Rajapaksa was dislodged, after a decade in power without serious challenge, by President Maithripala Sirisena because of latter’s ability to penetrate the suffering masses. They forget though, the result evoked surprise and only reluctantly accepted by Mahinda, the writing on the wall became evident in the course of the campaign. Desperate ruling alliance supporters became increasingly violent towards the end of the campaign. At the end, the common opposition comprising all sections of Lankan nationality groups won over the ruling Mahinda gang by a margin of more than 300,000 votes.
Actually, Mahinda decided to go for snap elections to avoid the risk of facing a much stronger anti-incumbency sentiment two years later. Mahinda observed the powerful growth of the Protest of the Opposition and the decline in his government’s popularity in the provincial council polls. To secure his position among the Sinhala masses, his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa allegedly cultivated radical Buddhist groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) which ran a fascistic anti-Muslim campaign in the garb of protecting the Sinhala people. Orchestrated violence against Muslims was unchecked by security forces lending credence to the allegations.
On the other hand, Mahinda regime neglected the Tamil national problem. They hardly took any sincere step to devolve power. Not that people expected after savage destruction of the Tamil civilization, any devolution of power from the Mahinda regime; yet he repeatedly promised substantial devolution power to the Tamil people but did nothing. Besides alienating the minorities, the government’s economic policies were unpopular. More than half the population felt they were worse off.
Many Chinese funded infrastructure projects were seen as white elephants, enriching the coffers of the ruling elite. In any case these did not result in tangible economic benefits. The ruling family was increasingly seen as corrupt and worse, autocratic. Journalistic freedom was restricted and there were attacks on media leading to killings and disappearances. Thus a powerful social and political power was developing to oust Mahinda.
Mahinda group
Now all these have gone and the defeat of the Mahinda group is obvious. People are expecting a new era with a new constitution that can create a powerful democratic society. The executive presidency, immensely strengthened by the 18th amendment, was expected to be diluted to restore parliamentary control. If that happened quickly, the prime minister, UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, would have been the effective head of government with the possibility of President Sirisena getting reduced to a titular head. 19th amendment gave a half way situation creating a dynamic equilibrium between Maithri and Ranil.
However the President and Prime Minister, at the beginning, have collectively worked to satisfy the hopeful masses. They issued the necessary instructions on the political stage to implement the law to the letter with regard to everyone alike and have openly canvassed that action be taken irrespective of individual position or party affiliation. But now citizens that supported the democratic change feel that corruption cases must proceed without discrimination.
President Sirisena revealed recently, that the first action he took using his executive powers was to remove former chief justice Mohan Peiris, when he came and begged him not to remove him from his post and expressed his willingness to do anything he wanted. This action and several such actions show that President Maithripala Sirisena is strongly committed to justice and fair play. Though not backed by the constitution such a style of work could build a tradition and power to the post of presidency which may lead to Bonapartism.
