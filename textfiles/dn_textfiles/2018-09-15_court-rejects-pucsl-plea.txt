Court rejects PUCSL plea

Colombo District Judge Jayakie De Alwis yesterday rejected the plea filed by the PUCSL seeking an order to confiscate assets belonging to the CEB for non-payment of taxes to the Commission amounting to Rs.162,069,600 (Rs.162 million).
The PUCSL cited that the CEB owes Rs. 162 million as taxes for generating, transmitting, and distributing of electricity.
The Judge rejected the plea saying that the court is not satisfied with the certificate issued by the PUCSL requesting the outstanding payment from the CEB as the relevant certificate does not seem to have been certified by an authorised Officer. The judge also issued notices to the CEB to appear before court on September 17. Chandana Liyanapatabendi PC cited that the Commission can recover the outstanding amount by confiscating the assets of the CEB according to the PUCSL and CEB Acts.
He also requested the court to issue a order in this regard.
The judge after taking into the submissions made by the Counsel into account, decided to make inquiries from the CEB before issuing an Order.Attorneys-at-Law Dushmantha Peiris and Wijaya Gamage appeared on behalf of the PUCSL.
The case will be recalled on September 17.
