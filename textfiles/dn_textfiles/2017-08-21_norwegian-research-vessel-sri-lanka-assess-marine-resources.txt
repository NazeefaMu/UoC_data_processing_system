Norwegian research vessel In Sri Lanka to assess marine resources

 
A planning seminar is due to take place in Colombo on the arrival of the Norwegian Research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen to Sri Lanka in 2018 to carry out a survey on the marine resources.
The arrival of the ship marks the technical and institutional cooperation on Fisheries between Norway and Sri Lanka, which was endorsed by top level political authorities of the two countries.
The aim of the planned survey is to know the current status of marine resources including fish stocks and to investigate stocks of unexploited/ underutilized fishery resources on the continental shelf and slope.
The last stock assessment for Sri Lanka has been carried out by the previous Dr. Fridtjof Nansen in 1978 to 1980.
The new marine research vessel RV Dr Fridtjof Nansen is owned by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) and is jointly operated by the Institute of Marine Research of Norway, and Food and Agriculture organization to help developing countries improve their fisheries management.
The Ambassador of Norway to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Thorbjørn Gaustadsæther addressing a gathering at an event to recognize the finalization of the planning schedules for the Vessel’s arrival to the Bay of Bengal, stated that the new research vessel will make it possible to significantly step up Norway’s assistance for ecosystem-based marine management in developing countries.
He further stated that this is part of the new Ocean strategy of Norway and Norway considers this as ‘creating partnerships for the oceans’ as it enhances sharing knowledge both across industries and across international borders.
