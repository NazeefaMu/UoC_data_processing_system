War veterans remembered at cenotaph

The annual Tri-Service ‘Remembrance Day’ at the cenotaph in Vihara Mahadevi Park, Colombo, organised by the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemen’s Association (SLESA) took place yesterday, to remember all servicemen who had laid down their lives for the country from colonial times.
Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando attended the event as the chief guest, together with Tri-Service chiefs and seniors. Floral tributes were paid at the cenotaph during the memorial ceremony. The commemorative event also saw several SLESA members being decorated with special medals in recognition of their volunteer service towards promotion of the welfare of local veterans, some of who are almost confined to bed or housed in elders’ homes.
Religious dignitaries of all major faiths, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra C. Wijegunaratne, Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, Navy Commander, Vice Admiral Sirimevan Ranasinghe, Chief of staff of the Sri Lanka Air Force representing the Air Force Commander, foreign diplomats, Chief of staff of the Sri Lanka Army, Deputy Chief of Staff, Commandant, Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force, senior military officers, state officials and Tri-Service officers, military veterans and a large number of service personnel attended the solemn ceremony.
Brigadier K.A. Gnanaweera (retd), President, SLESA, together with SLESA executive members welcomed the attendees. Sounding of the last post and other military traditions brought the ceremony to an end.
The cenotaph in Colombo was initially erected in November 7, 1921, at Galle Face, but was later dismantled and reassembled at its present location during the Second World War, as it was thought to be a prominent landmark for approaching enemy reconnaissance aircraft.
