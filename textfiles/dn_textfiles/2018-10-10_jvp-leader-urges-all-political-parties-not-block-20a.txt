JVP leader urges all political parties not to block 20A

JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake urged all political parties not to block the 20th Amendment to the Constitution (20A) in Parliament and let it be referred to the people at a referendum.
The MP, taking the floor after the announcement of the Supreme Court (SC) determination on the 20A, said that his party is confident that the 20A would muster the people’s support at a referendum.
“We welcome the SC decision that the 20A must be approved by the people at a referendum. Prior to going before the people, the Amendment needs the two thirds majority of Parliament. I request from all of you not to block the Amendment in Parliament. Let the people decide on it at a referendum,” he urged.
“There are groups led by President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in this Parliament. All of them had asked for the people’s mandate to abolish the Executive Presidency. They can lead their groups to support this Bill,” he noted.
He pointed out that neither the 1978 Constitution nor any of its 19 Amendments were approved by the people at a referendum and therefore the existing Constitution was not in any way in conformity with the people’s expectations.
