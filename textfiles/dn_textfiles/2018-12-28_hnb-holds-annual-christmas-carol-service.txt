HNB holds Annual Christmas Carol Service

Sri Lanka’s premier retail sector bank, HNB, hosted its long-awaited Annual Christmas Carols at the HNB Auditorium under the patronage of Rt Rev Vinston Fernando, Bishop of Kurunegala who graced the occasion as Chief Guest.
The evening was commenced with a Christmas message from Rt Rev Vinston Fernando, Bishop of Kurunegala, who set the tone for the rest of the event, creating a blessed atmosphere befitting the spirit of Christmas.
The HNB auditorium was filled with colour, festive cheer and songs celebrating the spirit of Christmas as HNB choristers dressed in elegant robes led their colleagues – from senior management down to the very newest members of the Hatna Family – in spirited renditions of ever green carols.
The vocal skills of the choristers presented both in English and the dialect of the original lyrics received accolades from a captivated audience comprised of HNB staff - past and present - their families, distinguished invitees and well-wishers were all present. Behind the success of this event was a group of talented HNB staff, a supportive management, a professional trainer and a discerning audience
