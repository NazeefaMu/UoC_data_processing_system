Teacher killed by falling tree

A female school teacher died on the spot and another person was injured and admitted to the Lindula hospital when an uprooted Tuna tree fell on the three wheeler they were travelling in at St. Clare on the Hatton - Nuwara Eliya road around noon yesterday.
Neighbours who rushed to the scene managed to extricate her body from the crushed three wheeler after great effort.
The injured person was the driver of the three wheeler.
Traffic on the Hatton - Nuwara Eliya road was disrupted for about an hour due to the tragedy.
Police said the tree had fallen due to the heavy gust of wind experienced in the hill country.
