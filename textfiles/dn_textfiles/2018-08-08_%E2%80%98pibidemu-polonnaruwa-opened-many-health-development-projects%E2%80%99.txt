‘Pibidemu Polonnaruwa opened many health development projects’

The Bakamuna Kidney Dialysis Unit was among the several health development projects opened recently in the Polonnaruwa district under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa Programme, the Health Ministry Spokesman said.
The programme has 180 development projects and several health development projects. The Hathareskotuwa Primary Health Care Unit and the Hingurakgoda Hospital doctors’ quarters are among them.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said after opening the Bakamuna Kidney Dialysis Unit that the media had not reported the accurate cost of development projects opened in the Polonnaruwa district and the Moragahakanda Kalu Ganga project cost Rs. 220 billion. Several billions of rupees will be spent on constructing the National Kidney Hospital, the Spokesman said. “If anyone says the development projects are not useful, they are fools. All should support the massive development drive launched by the Government, the Minister said.
