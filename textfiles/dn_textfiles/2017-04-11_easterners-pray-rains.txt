Easterners pray for rains

A pirith chanting and an offering to deities took place at the D.S. Senanayake statue near the Inginiyagala tank praying for rains in the drought-hit eastern province. The offering took place in the night of April 8 followed by the Pirith chanting until the next morning. An alms-giving was offered to the Maha Sangha in the morning of the following day.
Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, Ampara Government Agent Thusitha P. Wanigasinghe, state officials and members of the farming community participated.
