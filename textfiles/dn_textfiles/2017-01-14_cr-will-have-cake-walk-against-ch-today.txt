CR will have a cake walk against CH today

CR & FC will go out as favourites to overcome the hapless CH and FC side in their second round Dialog ‘A’ Division league rugby match at CR & FC grounds, Longden Place today commencing 4.00pm.
Both teams have not fared well in their matches which they have played to-date.
CR have managed to win five matches in this ongoing league tournament against Army SC (25-24) Air Force SC (57-20), Police (31-26) and CH & FC (83-3) and (34-21) against Airmen in the return leg, while losing to Navy SC (13-21), Havelock SC (6-10), Kandy(29-53) and went down fighting to Kandy SC (27-32) in the return leg last week after trailing 8-24 at half time in Colombo, while the CH and FC have lost all their nine matches played to-date and look a sorry outfit. They may try to give an improved performance through their master craftsman and former national captain cum flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa leading them from the front.
The red shirts will field the same team which did duty for them last week against Kandy with dynamic hooker cum rolling maul expert and former Royal College highest try scorer Supun Warnakulasooriya will hold the key for CR’s success today but they will miss the services of their dynamic national centre cum play maker Tarinda Ratwatte due a shoulder injury which he sustained during the Kandy game last week.
Last year CR & FC won both the first round as well as the return match at CR & FC grounds in Longden Place and Racecourse grounds respectively.
