Eureka I have found it!

MY inextinguishable search for a sustainable solution for some or all the bugbears of my native land got my head around and in spite of total immersion in it; this poor soul was unable to find it. I myself was, at the end, in big shoes which were too large for me!
Yet, thanks to Dickens and others for instilling a drop of their endurance into this poor soul to escape from not being able to make head nor tail of the current ordeal our paradise island is confronted with due to utopian thinking in the wake of prior tinkering.
No full-blooded patriot can keep cool under these circumstances and in other countries, the writers come to rescue with their quill, very poignantly our ones are seen at hustings and court premises to depend on their tribe.
John Dryden and Alexander Pope of the satirical age of poetry in England rendered a yeoman service in a situation akin to that of our motherland. Dryden was once severely attacked by some thugs for his writing, the literary history says. The tapestry of English literature is abundant with ample resources to find time-tested solutions to our chronic diseases which are pestering and bleeding the nation.
Hibernation
I plead mercy for digressing your attention from your invaluable time to another aspect why most of the intellectuals and the members of the intelligentsia do not pay their due heed to national problems. In my view, some lop-sided professors and pseudo-intellectuals predict election results which do not tally with the ground realities of the status quo.
Most of their predictions even do not come nigh. After doing it they go to hibernation. Some philosophers decipher this conundrum in this way, “Unquestionably a literary life is, for the most part, an unhappy life, because, if you have genius, you must suffer the penalty of genius; and if you have the only talent, there are so many cares and worries incidental to the circumstances of men of letters, as to make the life exceedingly miserable.”
Richard de Silva is no more with us. Yet, it is high time to make a pragmatic approach to eliminating or at least to mitigate the suffering of the poor. They deserve to be benefited by the vast literature written on their behalf by iconic writers.
In my perusal of the vast sphere of literature, the other day I found the solution which I was searching for. Even my spouse was flabbergasted to hear. She insisted on telling her when I began to run around my house with the panacea in my little head even though at times she loads it with unbearable kudos for my cognitions.
Luscious meal
Here I run the gauntlet. Yet, my honey persisted me to keep it within our walls, but I’m a little crow that caws others to enjoy a luscious meal.
Eureka!
This is how I explained it to my beloved spouse who saved my life at many an occasion when the parade isle was in flames and bleeding. Yet, I survived to do my duty by the nation even in the evening of my life when the country demands. I love my motherland. Once a sage said in Sanskrit, ‘’ Mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga.’ Now you may understand why our ministers are in such a foray to grab a ministry to serve their motherland.
Yet, the system is quite contradictory to the west -minister mode. My wavering mind delays me to come to the point at once, pardon.
My small home library is always waiting for offering solutions when I am in distress. It is very palpable to her. I quite understand her language. She invited me to a remote corner in her home and showed me a yellowish old book of stories, my beloved father had bought me with his hard earned money. This is the goldmine where I found the precious stone.
Some pages had been nibbled by insects, most probably by cockroaches which have invaded my immeasurable storehouse of knowledge. Even the publisher’s blurb they have eaten and also the front page with the author’s name. Could any sympathetic reader enlighten me on it? The book is old, yet my father invariably told me that there was no wear and tear in books.
Insofar as now I understand that he had told so just to satisfy my mind because as a member of the underdog for whom our old red brigade left no stone unturned to redress their grievances, had to work hard to keep the home fires burning and send us to school.
Scottish bagpipes
In this fine piece of writing, there is a pied-piper. He wears a funny cloth quite similar to that of a clown in a circus. The picture of the pied-piper is eye catching. He has a long musical instrument. It is called the bagpipes.
It is played by blowing air into a bag held by the arm and pressing it out through pipes. Scottish bagpipes are the world famous.
Once upon a time, in the township of Hamlin in Germany, there was a terrible situation created by rats. It was a sudden spate of rats, maybe due to their breeding pattern. They began to eat everything on their way and it reached a staggering proportion that the city-dwellers were unable to get rid of.
They duly complained the mayor without staging fasts unto death as they were not unruly naughty fellows.
The mayor sent round a tom- tom beater to declare that anyone who could solve the rat menace would be offered a prize of one thousand pounds.
There came the pied-piper and the challenging task was undertaken. The pied-piper went around the city playing his bagpipes and all the rats followed him. He went through a tunnel, left the rats somewhere and returned to the mayor in a most triumphant mood. The city-dwellers lived happily ever since.
Yet, lo and behold! The mayor did not honour the promise of thousand pounds. After a long heated exchange of words and an altercation, the pied-piper went out of the city hall and went around the city playing another tune. All the children, big and small, rich and poor, came out of their homes and followed the pied-piper.
The pied –piper did the same to the children too and the parents stormed the mayor’s chamber and troubled his life out to get back their children.
The rest of the story couldn’t be traced as the pages had been eaten by silverfish.
