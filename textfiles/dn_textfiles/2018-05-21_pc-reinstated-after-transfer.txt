PC reinstated after transfer

A police constable who was recently transferred from the Panadura Police Station was reinstated by the IGP.
It transpires that the constable had arrested the drivers of a tipper transporting sand with a forged licence and handed them over to the Wadduwa Police Station, on Friday. Thereafter, the Western Province South DIG had transferred the constable to the Dehiwala Police Station.
The police constable had complained about the matter to the IGP and to the Secretary of the National Police Commission stating that the transfer had taken place because he had followed the law. His complaint further stated that the sand contractor had called and threatened him. He was reinstated thereafter.
