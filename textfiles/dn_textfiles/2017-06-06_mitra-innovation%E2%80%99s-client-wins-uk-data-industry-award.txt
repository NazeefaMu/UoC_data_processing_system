Mitra Innovation’s client wins UK data industry award

A key client of Sri Lanka-UK based Mitra Innovation has recently won a prestigious data industry award.
The client is called Beyond Analysis and Mitra Innovation is proud to not only be one of their suppliers, but to also help the successful company with the technology for their award-winning product.
Mitra Innovation is a technology innovation company based in Sri Lanka, Australia, the USA and the UK. It was set up in 2012 by three co-founders – Ashok Suppiah (CEO), Derek Bell (COO) and Dammika Ganegama (MD), all visionaries with a passion for technology and innovation.
Mitra Innovation specialises in cloud systems integration, product and platform incubation, and digital innovation and transformation.
Since 2016 it has been helping UK-based Beyond Analysis which provides meaningful services to help their clients turn data into actionable insights that enable decision-making.
In late May, Beyond Analysis attended the Data 50 Awards in London where they were honoured to receive a ‘Best in Class’ award for ‘Marketing and Customer Insights’.
The Data 50 Awards honour the people at the forefront of data – those transforming organisations and enhancing decision-making through its use, managing and controlling its proliferating growth, and driving new business value.
Mitra Innovation was excited that Beyond Analysis won, as the company has a proprietary product called ‘Quick and Easy’ – a digital dashboard for retailers and the travel industry to see their operational performance daily – and it was this product that won the ‘Marketing and Customer Insights’ award.
Mitra Innovation was pleased as they have helped Beyond Analysis with the product’s technology. Beyond Analysis engaged Mitra Innovation in 2016 to enhance their platform, deploy it to Beyond Analysis’s Fortune 100 customers and to develop further products.
Ashok Suppiah, CEO of Mitra Innovation states: “Beyond Analysis won the ‘Marketing and Customers Insights’ award for ‘Quick and Easy.”
