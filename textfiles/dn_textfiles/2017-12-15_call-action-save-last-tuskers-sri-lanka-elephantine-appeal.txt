A Call for Action to Save the Last Tuskers of Sri Lanka: An elephantine appeal!

The issues surrounding Human Elephant Co-existence (HEC) have posed a constant thorn in the side of wildlife conservation. The conflict that arises in the communities that flank the wildlife and nature reserves more often than not result in either human or elephant casualties. Such conflict could easily be avoided with the development of appropriate policies and laws to protect not merely tuskers but all elephants in Sri Lanka. Awareness programs could also be utilized to educate the citizens of the neighbouring communities on the importance of peaceful co-existence.However such programs would be rendered ineffective without concrete laws and policies to support them. Thus it is clear that for maximum efficiency and sustainable development, legal frameworks and policies need to be devised.

The General Committee of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) conducted a Press Conference titled , “A Call for Action to Save the Last Tuskers of Sri Lanka”recently to publicize the need for implementation of a comprehensive policy to address the Human Elephant Conflict in Sri Lanka The press briefing was helmed by a panel of esteemed environmentalists including NayanakaRanwella and Dinesh Mallikaarachchi as well as environmental lawyer, Wardani Karunaratne along with the President of the WNPS, Rukshan Jayewardene.
Rukshan Jayewardene commenced the meeting with a brief introduction to the issues pertaining to elephant conservation explaining the historical movement of elephants from Southern India to Sri Lanka. He also discussed the Human Elephant Conflict and the unwillingness of either party to give up their ground. Nayanaka Ranwella discussed the destruction of habitats where elephant populations are dense and the unfortunate accumulation of garbage near wildlife reserves that are further polluting the habitats. He described elephants as an “umbrella species” whose preservation ensures the conservation of other wildlife species and habitats. Dinesh Mallikaarachchiadded to these concerns by using the development of the Mattala airport project as an example of the destruction of wildlife. These concerns expressed the importance of reaching a balance between conservation and urban development.
While stressing that there is no comprehensive official policy for the conservation of elephants, the panellists discussed the process by which the 2006 Human Elephant Conflict Policy was updated in June of 2016 to be the draft National Elephant Conservation Policy. However it was brought to light that the proposals and updates made have not yet been implemented or amended. After the uproar regarding the death of the Galgamuwa tusker it was learned that the Department of Wildlife Conservation is now revisiting this draft policy.
This draft policy particularly addresses the use of strategic fencing to take place aroundecological boundaries, rather than administrative boundaries and around villages and plantations so as to offer protection to villagers. This would also allow the elephants to peacefully utilize their traditional paths of movement and minimize human interference.
Ivory is a highly coveted good and is often used to indicate status and social prominence. Environmental lawyer, Wardani Karunaratne emphasized that “Blood ivory should not be held as an icon of prestige” in order to discourage social attitude that considers tusks and ivory to be valuable so as to decrease involvement in poaching of tuskers.
Elephant conservation requires collective effort. Political and religious leaders should be urged to use their influence to harness the masses and encourage them to protect the elephants and tuskers as well as other forms of wildlife.
It is a social responsibility to conserve such species and to ensure that the remaining elephants and tuskers are protected and not subjected to the plight of the Galgamuwa Dala Puttuwa. Social consciousness can be harnessed via social media participation by projecting emphasis of the economic benefits to the country inclusive of the added tourism and thus cultivate an interest and social responsibility in companies as well as individuals. Encroachment of protected wildlife reserves and areas which are known to be inhabited by elephants should be prevented in order to avoid situations such as in areas like Mattala which resulted in the disappearance of a vast area of wildlife.
Stringent laws and policies need to be drafted and strictly enforced to protect tuskers and elephants in order to support conservation.
A sad story
Sri Lanka thrives on tourism and one of the main attractions to tourists from around the world is Sri Lanka’s wildlife and nature reserves. In spite of evidence regarding the importance of sustaining such resources, it is unfortunate that neither the government nor the majority of the population of Sri Lanka afford the necessary efforts to maintain and protect the wildlife and natural resources in Sri Lanka.
Gradually however, the need for the development of a comprehensive policy pertaining to the protection of wildlife and natural resources has come to light. The brutal murder of the famed Galgamuwa crossed tusker, whose carcass was discovered on the 29th of November, 2017 in the Kahalla-Pallekele forest reserve has resulted in quite a stir in Lankan society as a whole and not merely among the wildlife and nature enthusiasts. Crossed tuskers are incredibly uncommon and as such the tusker more commonly referred to as the GalgamuwaDalaPuttuwa should not have been victim to such a ruthless end. It is important to note that this ‘murder’ cannot be attributed to issues pertaining to Human Elephant Co-existence but is a direct act of poaching. The tusker at Karuwalagaswewa near Tabbowa was a casualty of the Human Elephant conflict as he had possibly wandered into nearby fields and was shot. This contrasts the premeditated murder of the Galgamuwa tusker.
Sri Lanka is no stranger to poaching and the low 6% of tuskers that remain in Sri Lanka is not due to genetic causes but the persistent poaching and killing of these magnificent creatures that are historically venerated in Sri Lanka. Tuskers as well as elephants are hunted for their hide but tuskers are poached in excess for their valuable ivory tusks. Such was the case with the GalgamuwaDalaPuttuwa whose structurally uncommon tusks had been hacked off and the sawn tusks and some ivory trinkets (Gajamuthu) were found in the possession of two individuals who were promptly arrested. There were allegations that the crime was committed on the orders of a political figure and investigations on these grounds are currently underway.
Sadly, it is the Galgamuwa tusker’s prestige that has caused such immediate response to the situation. Had it been any other lesser known tusker, it is questionable as to whether there would have been any response at all. The carcass of the Galgamuwa crossed tusker itself bore the scars of many previous gunshot wounds which provide strong evidence of the lack of concern and protection for such creatures.
