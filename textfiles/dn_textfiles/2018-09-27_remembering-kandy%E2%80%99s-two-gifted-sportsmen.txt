Remembering Kandy’s two gifted sportsmen

Memories of the death of two gifted sportsmen - a Royalist and a Sylvestrian are still fresh in the minds of the local community in Kandy two decades after their passing away. Royal’s first Bradby captain, a fine cricketer and sports promoter Dr. C.D.L. Fernando passed away on 22nd September 1987 which marked his 31st death anniversary and the other M.E. Marikar, well known sportsmen, promoter and sportswriter and first Sylvestrian to play division I cricket died on 19th September 1996, 22 years ago.
DR. C.D.L. FERNANDO was a versatile sportsman, sports benefactor, philanthropist and above all a gentleman par excellence who left this world in 1987. CDL, as he was known by everyone, started his schooling at S. Thomas’ College, Mt. Lavinia and later crossed over to Royal College where he excelled in cricket, rugger, and athletics and also was in the ring as a fine boxer.
To think or write of ‘CDL’ is difficult as one does not know where to start and where to end for he had such a multifaceted character as a sportsman. Sports promoter, doctor and social worker and above all a trusted and loving friend of everyone. His devotion to sport needs no elaboration. He played cricket for Royal, later for Medial College, SSC, Health Department, Kandy United CC, Up-Country and Central Province. At Cricket, ‘CDL’ was an all-rounder. An aggressive batsman, a medium pace bowler and a brilliant close in fielder. He played cricket for Royal in 1944, 1945 and 1946. In his last game for his school in 1946, that was the “Battle of the Blues”, he had a match-bag of nine wickets for 54 runs, in 23.2 overs, out of which seven were maidens. He took five wickets in the first innings, and four in the second. His first year was under George Rajapakse’s captaincy, second under Vivian de Kretser and in 1946 under Mahes Rodrigo. He was also a Public Schools athlete, and was placed in the Putt-shot. He also boxed and was a cadet.
CDL was one time, president of the Kandy District Cricket Association and he did a wonderful job for number of years and some of the committee members during his time were Dr. M.S. Uduwella, Z.M. Jahuffer, D.H. de Silva, Raja Abeyanayake, Shaw Wilson, Deva Amunugama, Malcolm Perera, Aubrey Kuruppu and H Marikar. He was also manager of the Sri Lanka Cricket team against New Zealand in 1984.
‘CDL’ led the Medical and George Rajapakse the Law team at the annual Law-Medical game in 1949. ‘CDL’ played rugger for Royal from 1943 to 1945, and had the privilege of leading the side in 1945 in the first Bradby Shield match. Royal won the first leg 3-0, and lost the second 6-0 to Trinity. After leaving school, ‘CDL’ played as a front row forward for CR & FC and later for the University. CDL became president of the Kandy Sports Club in 1978.
M.E. MARIKAR was a senior journalist attached to the Times Group of newspapers while doing the rounds for the ‘Daily Mirror’, ‘Evening Times’ and ‘Sunday Times’. In Kandy, he was known as ‘Daily Mirror Sir’. He later worked for Wijaya Group of newspapers. ‘Mariks’ as he was popularly known was a well known personality in the country, he was known to everyone.
He began his education at St. Sylvester’s College where he excelled as a top class sportsman in boxing, hockey, football and Cadeting. He first worked at the Marketing department and later joined the Army before he took up to journalism and became a leading sports writer.
He was a fine pace bowler who played for Kandy United SC, Kandy Lake Club, Sinha Regiment, Up-Country, Kandy, Times of Ceylon, Government Services, Moors SC and Sri Lanka Press XI teams. Cricket fans will recall his fast “in-swing” bowling. He also delighted crowds, hitting the ball to all parts of the field batting as a middle order bat.
CDL and ME are no more, but their memories in the sporting and political field will remain forever etched in the minds of all those who knew them.
