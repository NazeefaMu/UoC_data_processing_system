SC dismisses JJP nomination rejection petition

The Supreme Court yesterday dismissed a writ petition filed by Jathika Janatha Pakshaya (JJP) seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from holding the Colombo Municipal Council election.
The Supreme Court in a three-judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice K.T. Chitrasiri dismissed the petition citing that there is no reason to grant relief pleaded by petitioners.
Three members of JJP including its secretary Srinath Perera PC filed this petition in the Supreme Court naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.
They sought an order of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Colombo Municipal Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the JJP for the election of members to the CMC.
Three petitioners Ruwan Wijesinghe, Shayama Damayanthi, Srinath Perera PC (Secretary) had filed this petition naming Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo District), Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.
The petitioners said the nomination papers of JJP were prepared in terms of the section 28(2) and in accordance with the format specified in the Local Authorities Election Ordinance for the election of the Colombo Municipal Council. Petitioners stated that on December 21, 2017 two original sets of the nomination papers were delivered to the first respondent by the third petitioner (Secretary) of the party.
They further said that at the conclusion of the period set apart for the purpose of the JJP, they have been rejected due to the fact that the requisite number of candidates had not been included in the nomination paper tendered.
They further stated that they were unaware whether any objections were tendered by any one in respect of the nomination papers tendered by the third petitioner.
The petitioners are unaware of the name of the individual candidates whose names were included in several nomination papers submitted by various political parties and independence groups.
President's Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioners.
Deputy Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena appeared for the Election Commission.
