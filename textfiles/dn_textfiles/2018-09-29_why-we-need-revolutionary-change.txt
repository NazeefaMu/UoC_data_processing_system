Why we need a revolutionary change

At the time of Russian revolution Lenin raises three sharp slogans demanding peace, bread and land.
These were lovely words at that stage in Moscow and Petrogard and have been bandied about in political circles over the couple of months before October, arousing workers and soldiers.
In Russia, peace meant both internal and external. Bread and food took secondary place, first came peace and unity of the country.
In Russia in addition there was needy conflict resolution due to the aggression against Jews; also need of a solution.
Unlike in Germany Russian people were not alienated from Jews; hence Reconciliation has displaced both hate and despise.
In general those who focus on constitutional reform, in particular those who are hell bent on devolution, like to use the word ‘united’ meaning that devolution does not mean separation. They are happy with ‘maximum devolution in a united country’). Now unity (unlike peace and reconciliation) can be legislated. The ‘United Nations’ for example is made of separate states; but in spite of that unity in that formidable body is largely absent, collective actions have put the world together.
Rule of law
The point here is that words are used in new context altering the meaning; getting the additional meaning concertized and operational on the ground, is tough and takes time. This is how even the word ‘justice’ should be clarified and understood.
Of course Justice is another lovely word for the oppressed. Obtaining it requires revolutionary systems where truth has a better chance; in other words, an institutional rearrangement as well as a set of procedures including recruitment, training and promotion.
Typically, in this bourgeoisie society those are running for political office and parties/coalitions aspiring to capture political power, only talk about ensuring justice and establishing the rule of law.
That’s a promise but one is under pressure, hence not an easy one. There’s compulsion to analysis of what’s wrong with the system; the focus is on the unpalatable outcome of these flaws.
Key stakeholders
It makes for one to move towards radical thinking. Then Beanie Saunders and Jeremy Corbyn emerge! Thus better candidates develop into the natty gritty of it all.
Then they would have to talk about the legal system, separation of powers, the judicial system, the legal profession, the Police and finally the very socio-economic system. This does not require a doctoral dissertation but with attentive study it is possible to point out glaring flaws.
Today there is informal but serious discussion on the merits and demerits of adversarial and inquisitorial systems of justice, the former being what we have whereas the latter was what we claim to had. Both target justice but whereas one does not care of social fallout, the other does.
The argument for retaining the current system is essentially reactionary conservatism and the need of capitalist exploitation- sorry! in fine words- it is remunerative to the key stakeholders in the system. So we have come to this: this is what we have and this is what we will always until the coming social revolution.
Till then, separation of legislative, judicial and executive powers is of course talked about. However, leftists who are not dependent on executive will continue the fight for independent judiciary.
Counter-terror laws
The present yahapalana Government promised to repeal this PTA more than three years ago. But it is still being used and there is no date announced for its repeal. Instead, the Government had engaged in alternate processes to draft laws that would replace the PTA.
Media reports about a draft counter – terror law approved by Cabinet indicates that problematic clauses such as admission of confessions made to Police and enabling the Defence Ministry to be the authority to implement the provisions of this bill as a piece of legislation dealing with national security will be introduced at the Parliamentary Committee stage, eliminating possibilities of judicial review of such amendments. However, a more fundamental question is whether Lanka need any counter–terror laws.
There are wide-ranging powers available under the Public Security Ordinance, the possibility of including new offences under ordinary law, powers of Magistrates to deny bail in a variety of situations etc. Counter-terror laws provides the executive and security establishment extraordinary powers with minimal checks and balances as well as discretion usually vested with the judiciary, negatively affecting life and liberty, rights and dignity of persons, often serving as a license for enforced disappearances and torture.
That is why revolutionary change in this country necessary. We must start with a new democratic constitution acceptable to all nationalities in the country. We are told such a constitution is ready. We must rally round the yahapalana regime to establish this democratic constitution.
