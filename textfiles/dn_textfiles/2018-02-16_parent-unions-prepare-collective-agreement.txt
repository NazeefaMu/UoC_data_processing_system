SAITM students’ degree issue:
Parent unions prepare collective agreement

The collective agreement reached by the parents of SAITM medical students and state medical students will be handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena next week, Parents' Union of Medical Students Media Coordinator Wasantha Alwis said.
Alwis said the final agreement is that all qualified SAITM students should be offered the MBBS degree from the KDU or a state medical faculty recognised by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
The other SAITM students they said should be offered a SLMC recognized foreign MBBS degree from a SLMC recognised foreign university.
Alwis said the joint Parents Associations of SAITM medical students and state medical students have joined hands to become one now and it is one of the most independent and unbiased organisations in the country.
They called on the Government to accept the common agreement of medical students' parents and desist promoting private medical education in any way.
