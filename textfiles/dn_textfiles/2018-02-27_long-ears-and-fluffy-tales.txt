Peter Rabbit
Long ears and fluffy tales

G et ready to meet the mischief maker who can be on par with Dennis the Menace in Colombia Pictures’ ‘Peter Rabbit’. Directed by Will Gluck the movie provides the perfect distraction for children.
Adapted from Beatrix Potter’s well loved tale ‘Peter Rabbit’ provides a new take on the beloved bunny. The story unfolds with a mixture of animation and live action.
The action starts with the mischievous and adventurous hero’s feud with Mr. McGregor escalates to greater heights. The event results in his death. Enter his nephew Thomas McGregor who does not having a liking for the wilderness. He kicks Peter and his friends out of the house but is forced to be kind to them later since he develops an affection for his next door neighbor, Bea, who is a painter and nature lover.
Things take a rough patch with both Peter and Thomas competing for Bea’s affection. When Thomas seem to be taking the lead Peter makes a comeback which costs the rabbits not only their home but also tears Thomas and Bea’s liaison apart.
James Corden voices the character of Peter with playful spirit and wild charm. Margot Robbie, Elizabeth Debicki, and Daisy Ridley have rendered their voices to the triplets: Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail.
The animations are superbly crafted. The rabbits are adorable, the pig is funny and all the rest of the animals who take a back bench are entertaining and detailed. The background settings are a feast for the eyes.
The downside of ‘Peter Rabbit’ is that its greatest strength also happens to be its greatest weakness. The adult audience might find the action boring at most times. Most of the jokes will go down well with the kids but not with those past their teens.
It is a family friendly movie but it squanders its potential wider appeal. You get a lot of slapstick comedy but only a little depth in this tale.
