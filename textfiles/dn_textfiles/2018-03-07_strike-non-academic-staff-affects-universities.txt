Strike by non-academic staff affects universities

It has been reported that academic activities and day-to-day functions of universities have been badly affected by the trade union action of non-academic staff of universities.
The strike launched by non-academic staff over several demands continued for the seventh consecutive day, yesterday. As a result of the strike, state universities postponed examinations until further notice, the University Grants Commission said.
According to the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) spokesman, UTUJC has been trying to get several issues relating to non-academic service solved in the last few years. But the relevant officers of the Higher Education Ministry and government failed to rectify those issues.
The UTUJC protested in front of the Higher Education Ministry yesterday demanding that authorities rectify these issues.
