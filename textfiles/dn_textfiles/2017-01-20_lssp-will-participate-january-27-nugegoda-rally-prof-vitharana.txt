LSSP will participate in January 27 Nugegoda rally: Prof. Vitharana

The LSSP has decided to participate in the Joint Opposition (JO) rally to be held at Nugegoda on January 27, LSSP General Secretary Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
He was addressing a press conference at the LSSP headquarters yesterday. He said all JO parties will attend and all party leaders would address the rally.
Kurunegala District MP and Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa will participate while ministers and MPs too may attend, he said. He said the government’s path had caused displeasure among its certain segments, and he would challenge the government to hold the long overdue local government elections if they professed democracy.
