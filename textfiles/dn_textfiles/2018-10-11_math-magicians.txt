Math magicians

Siluni Walakuluarachchige is quicker than a calculator. Ten two digit sums are hurled at her. She takes only two seconds to add them up. Saathvika Natarajan takes on numbers with equal ease.
Nine year old Siluni Walakuluarachchige and Saathvika Natarajan have acquired a rare mastery over numbers thanks to the Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System (UCMAS) Sri Lanka. The two proved their mettle recently, managing first and second positions in two categories at the UCMAS Mental Arithmetic Championship held as a part of the Second Eurasian Women’s Forum 2018 which was held in St Petersburg on September 19. Around 200 girls from across the world took part in the event. A new world record for the Longest Maths Relay Race among girls was also set at the Championship.
The Abacus method is more than Abacus. Coupled with what’s called “Mind Gym”, it “increases a child’s span of attention, enables multi-tasking and activates creative thinking”. It is about instilling and

boosting confidence at that early stage in life. Children start to realize that they can solve more complex problems easily, as compared to others in their age group and sometimes, much beyond their age group. Aimed at better right-and-left-brain coordination, it increases the power of concentration and awakens lateral thinking. It enables them to look at a mathematical problem in a different way and teaches them to look at all problems in a different way, giving them the foundation they need to be successful.
This is not the first time that the young lasses have been in the limelight. They have won many national and international accolades on their journey of calculations. Siluni is one of the youngest UCMAS graduates in the country, having obtained a Higher C in Malaysia last year. She also won first place in the Higher A category in the 21st Abacus and Mental Arithmetic and Listening Competition 2016 which was held at the Hamdan Sport Complex in Dubai in 2017. She bagged third place in the Intermediate B category in the UCMAS 20th International Competition in New Delhi. She won second place in the Basic category in the UCMAS National Competition in 2014 and was the champion in the Intermediate A in 2015 and the National Champion in the Higher A category in 2016. Siluni has won distinctions and credits at the UCMAS IGE International Grading Examinations and aced the Abacus Computation.
“Every child has to start off the process in the basic course. There is no age limit but many children stop when they have completed the elementary or basic course. We have to keep 36 formulas in mind when we engage in this process,” Siluni elaborated.
Siluni has completed her UCMAS basic course in two weeks. Her parents took her to the UCMAS head office in Sri Lanka which is in Wellawaththa when she was three and a half years old. This started the process of a long journey which brought her fame and fortune.
A premature baby who had been born in 26 weeks, Siluni showed signs of intelligence from an early age. When other children are either glued to the television or engaged in play, the young lass spent her free time reading books or occupied in creative activities. She has written quite a number of essays during her spare time which her parents later compiled into a book titled ‘Tiny Gems’.

“Doing sums is like engaging in meditation. It soothes you. You can be in one position without getting bored. You do not feel anger or frustration. Therefore you are able to excel in your studies as well. I love mathematics and I am among the first few to complete a paper at our school examinations,” the student of Colombo International School (CIS) said. Her next target is to reach the Grand Level in December 2019.
Similarly Saathvika too had made her mark and excelled in the numbers game. The grade five student of Asian International School said that the UCMAS Mental Arithmetic Championship was the fourth international competition she faced. She has won third place at the UCMAS 21st International Abacus and Mental Arithmetic Competition 2016.
“I got to know about UCMAS through a neighbor and was keen to check it out. Once I joined I realized my flair for calculating sums. This became a passion for me and helped me excel in the sector,” said Saathvika who vies to become a doctor in the future.

After winning first place
Speaking about the nature of the competition Saathvika noted that the girls were asked to solve 200 sums in eight minutes. The person who has solved the most number of sums during that period is named as the champion. Saathvika solved two digit sums in five rows in four seconds while Siluni had solved two digit sums in five rows in two seconds. Both are grateful to Chithra Ilamanathan, their trainer and UCMAS Country Coordinator for her guidance.
It is astonishing indeed to see these children visualise the problem and the route to the answer through mind and finger coordination. Even after graduating beyond the need for the Abacus, they feel the numbers in their hands.
“Everybody thinks that Abacus is just for maths but it develops confidence, concentration and memory power. It is very benefitial for your future. Do not be afraid to move forward. Only you know your own potential and what you are capable of. Make use of your gifts and polish up your talents. That is the path to success,” are Saathvika’s words of wisdom to other youth.
Sarmisda Sivarama Sharma, another student of UCMAS Sri Lanka also took part in the UCMAS Mental Arithmetic Championship and clinched second place in her category.
