Leave for employees  for upcoming polls

The Election Commission has recommended a structure for employers when granting leave for employees to vote in the upcoming local government elections.
They had asked that employers be granted leave without loss of pay or their private leave.
They recommend that if the employee has to travel 40km or less, he or she is to be given half a day of leave; 40-100km, be given one day; 100-150km, be given one and a half days of leave and those who have to travel over 150km, be given two days of leave.
According to Section 84 A (1) of the Local Authorities Election Ordinance, it is mandatory that employers grant leave to employees so that they can cast their vote on Election Day.
Paragraph 12.3 of the Chapter XII of the Establishment Code, regarding special leave for the public sector officers, also states that a public officer should be granted a special paid leave, minimum period of two hours or such a continuous period as he may deem necessary to enable him to cast his vote, stated the Election Commission, releasing a statement to the media, yesterday. They, however, noted that it was the responsibility of the employee to apply for leave in advance and in writing and that he does so without interrupting the functions of the institution.
