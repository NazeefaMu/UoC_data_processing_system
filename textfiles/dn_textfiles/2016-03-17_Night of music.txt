Night of music

 
Keiko Kobayashi
Keiko Kobayashi, the dynamic Japanese conductor who conducted the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka at a highly appreciated concert last month, returns to Sri Lanka to conduct the Colombo Wind Orchestra (CWO) at its annual Colombo concert, to be held on March 19, at the Lionel Wendt Theatre.
The CWO's programme this year focuses on works based on or inspired by folk music around the world.
The best known piece is probably Ralph Vaughan Williams' 'English Folk Song Suite'. England is also represented by the beautiful 'Yorkshire Ballad' where the American composer James Barnes was inspired by the "Beautiful green Yorkshire dales of Northern England, the rolling hills and the endless stretch of beautiful pasture land'.
The programme also includes two Norwegian folk tunes by Grieg as well as works inspired by Korean and Japanese folk music.
The CWO with Kobayashi will bring to the concert stage the glorious sounds produced by the combination of the whole range of wind instruments, from the piccolo flute down to the tuba. If you are looking for an out-of-the-ordinary aural experience, this is the concert to be at.
Tickets are available at the Lionel Wendt office. The concert is sponsored by the Earle de Fonseka Trust.
