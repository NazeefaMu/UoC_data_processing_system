Suwaseriya service to benefit Northerners

The 1990 Suwaseriya ambulance service will be initiated in the Northern Province on July 21, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
He pointed out that 1,061,315 million people in the North will receive pre-hospital care ambulance services and emergency response services free of charge with this move.
The State Minister said the service would also be extended to the Eastern Province before the end of this year.
The Suwaseriya Foundation was set up by way of a Parliamentary Act with the aim to expand the 1990 Suwaseriya service to cover the whole country.
Supported by India, the 1990 Suwaseriya service was launched in the Western Province in July 2016 and later expanded to the Southern Province. It provides immediate and effective pre-hospital care free of charge in a safe and clinical working environment until a person reaches the nearest healthcare provider.
The state minister addressing Parliament last month said the Suwaseriya ambulance service had received 584,520 emergency calls since its inception.
He said 88,599 ambulances had been dispatched in response to emergency calls received to the 1990 Hotline. On average, 12.58 minutes had been taken to transport a patient to hospital.
The State Minister said new staff is being recruited and trained to launch the Suwaseriya service island wide.
