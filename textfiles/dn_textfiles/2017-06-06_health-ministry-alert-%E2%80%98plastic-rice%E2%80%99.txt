Health Ministry on alert for ‘plastic rice’

 
Acting Director of Health Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said that Food and Drug Inspectors release rice from customs only after conducting three tests and issuing a certificate confirming the quality of rice.
 Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo today Director Bandara said that the three tests are soaking rice in water, crushing rice and heating rice. The samples of questionable rice are now with the Medical Research Institute.
The City Analyst R.M.G.B.Rajanayake  stated that the public can test the rice at home by burning the rice. Natural rice smells like `Roti' when burnt and plastic rice smells like plastic. Natural rice turns blue when Iodine added to the crushed rice.  Instead of Iodine, the medicine’ Betadine’ can be used.
Plastic rice dissolves in Thinner but natural rice does not dissolve, Rajanayake further stated.
