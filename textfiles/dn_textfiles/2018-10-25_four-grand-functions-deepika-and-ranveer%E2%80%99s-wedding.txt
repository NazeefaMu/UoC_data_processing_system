Four grand  functions for Deepika and  Ranveer’s  wedding

After Anushka Sharma-Virat Kohli's dreamy wedding in Italy and Sonam Kapoor-Anand Ahuja's big fat Indian wedding, the will-they-won't-they ball has now passed on to Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh's court. The couple just announced their wedding and also stated that it will take place on 14 and 15 November.
While it's reported earlier that they will get married at the picturesque Lake Como in Italy, a new report in Filmfare suggests that there will be four grand functions at the decided venue. While the functions will be private affairs with only close friends and family members in attendance, fans can expect a galore of inside photographs and videos to surface on the internet soon after their wedding.
A source has been quoted as saying, “Both Ranveer and Deepika are extremely private but that doesn’t stop them from having a lavish wedding. As per Hindu rituals, the two of them will have four festivities including the main wedding. All the ceremonies will be away from the media glare, keeping it a classy and intimate affair.”
