Citizens' Mail

An exemplary statesman
Another May Day has dawned, existed and vanished into oblivion. We shall not hear anything related to that historical day in another 360-odd days. Such is the fate when we have set days for important events.
The May Day of 2017, however, remains iconic.
It is completely owing to another benevolent act of President Maithripala Sirisena. Needless to state, President Sirisena’s august assembly at Getambe was well attended. The whole crowd attended the function. That crowd included no one who came to enjoy the holiday munching chickpeas.
On the day that followed May Day, President Sirisena ordered the premises to be cleaned. By that benevolent act, President Sirisena has proven the true statesman he is.
The game of politics is about favours and special interests, money exchanging hands, deals being made, sometimes under the table and other times in plain sight. Powerful people have always had an advantage in influencing the process. But when it comes to politics, people claim to not want competition; rather they demand fairness, equality, and virtue.
The primary reason people want money out of politics is a desire for each vote to be equally valuable. That makes sense. No average voter wants to have to compete against the political persuasion of wealthy constituents. But will removing money from politics provide that outcome? Sorry, but no. That is exactly why President Sirisena deserves applause from the common man. He performs what he promises.
