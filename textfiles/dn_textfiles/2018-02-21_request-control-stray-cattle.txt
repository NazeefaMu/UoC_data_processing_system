Request to control stray cattle

It has been reported that the increase in road accidents in the Ampara District coastal areas is due to stray cattle roaming the highways.
Cattle owners are not mindful of letting their cattle graze in allocated areas and not stray on public areas such as highways.
Some say that it is the duty of the Road Development Authority to arrest this problem, while others say that it is the function of the local authorities.
