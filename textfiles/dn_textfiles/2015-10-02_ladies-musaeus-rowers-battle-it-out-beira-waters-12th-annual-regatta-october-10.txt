Ladies-Musaeus rowers battle it out on Beira waters 12th Annual regatta on October 10

The 12th The Ladies' College - Musaeus College Regatta will be held at the Beira lake Colombo on October 10. The regatta is the brainchild of former principal of Ladies' College, Mrs. Nirmali Wikremesinghe, who had a vision to build friendships between two of the leading girls' schools in Colombo through a shared passion for the sport.
Ladies' College, the defending champions of the Marie Musaeus Higgins Trophy which is awarded at the regatta, is led by Tarea Karunaratne and the Musaeus Collegs crew is captained by Dilkie Wijesekera. Sharen Kannangara is the coach of the Ladies' College crew while Mark Morris coaches Musaeus College. The winners tally is weighted towards Ladies' College, having won 8 regattas to Musaeus' two wins with there being only one occasion where a tie was declared. The regatta is a much-anticipated event on the calendars of both schools and on the rowing circuit too as it is a display of both excellent talent and sportsmanship after months of tough training by the dedicated young women.
