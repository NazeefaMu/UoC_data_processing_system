Uva Province cattle owners in jeopardy

 The Uva Province cattle owners say their buffaloes are on the verge of extinction.
They say the main reasons for this is the use of modern machine for agriculture and the new generation's refusal to engage in animal husbandry.
The cattle owners further said they have very few lands for buffaloes for grazing as the lands were being filled up for constructions. Besides, some people sell buffaloes to slaughter houses, they said.
The remaining buffaloes are straying in jungles. If the curd production were started, it would help improve the situation, they said.
But still the Agriculture Department and the Uva Provincial Council have not taken any measures in helping the cattle owners.
