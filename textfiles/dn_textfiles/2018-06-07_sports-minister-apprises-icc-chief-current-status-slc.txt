Sports Minister  apprises ICC chief of  current status of SLC

A very productive meeting was held between Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Governments and Sports Faiszer Mustapha and chairman of ICC Shashank Manohar yesterday morning at the ICC head office in Dubai.
Amidst robust discussions about the overall development of Sri Lanka Cricket, both internationally and locally, the minister also took the opportunity to bring the ICC chief up-todate on the current administrative status of Sri Lanka Cricket.
He mentioned that due to a court order that the annual general meeting was not held, and in order to ensure smooth operation he took the initiative to appoint the current secretary of Ministry of Provincial Councils, Local Governments and Sports Kamal Pathmasiri as the competent authority. At this meeting the minister emphasized that his only goal is to ensure that none of the work processes are broken down, and that the sport continues to thrive, so that the cricket loving public, and all stake holders of SLC continue to enjoy and appreciate the game.
The ICC chief congratulated the Minister in his new role and said he was looking forward for progressive discussions and solutions directed towards Sri Lanka Cricket, in the future.
The Competent authority of SLC Kamal Pathmasiri, CEO of ICC Dave Richardson and CEO of SLC Ashley de Silva were also present at the meeting.
