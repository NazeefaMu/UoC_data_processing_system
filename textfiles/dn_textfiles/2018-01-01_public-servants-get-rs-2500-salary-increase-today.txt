Public servants get Rs. 2,500 salary increase from today

The third stage of the salary increase of Rs.10,000 granted to public servants will be effective from today, January 1, the Treasury announced yesterday.
The Good Governance government which assumed office on January 8, 2015, pledged to increase public servants’ salaries by Rs. 10,000 in four annual sages of Rs. 2,500 each from 2016 upto 2020. But initially Rs. 2,500 was added as an allowance to public servants salaries without incorporating it in the basic salary. The government took steps to incorporate the Rs. 2,500 increase with the basic salary from 2016.
