Increase in allowance for Nurses Training School lecturers

The allowance paid to lecturers teaching at the Nurses Training Schools (NTC) will be increased by Rs. 10,000, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing a ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo recently to mark the International Nurses Day, he said that the relevant circular to pay Rs. 10,000 was issued by the Finance Minister on May 13. The over-time payments of health employees will be paid with effect from January 1, 2016.
According to Minister Senaratne, the salaries of public sector employees had been increased by Rs. 10,000. At least another 10,000 more nurses are required for the service. But, adequate number of nurses are not being produced. The four year nurses training programme has been reduced to three years due to various pressures and this is very unfair, he said.
Currently, lecturers of NTCs receive only Rs. 10,000. There are about 168 lecturers in NTCs at present. The minister said the nursing profession will be made an eminent profession within the next two years.
