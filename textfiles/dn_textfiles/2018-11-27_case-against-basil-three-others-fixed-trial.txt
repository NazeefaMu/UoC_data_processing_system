Case against Basil, three others fixed for trial

The case filed against four accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 2.991 billion of funds belonging to the Divi Neguma Department, was yesterday fixed for further trial on January 15 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe, the prosecution sought a further date for trial since Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige was appearing in another court case.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 2.991 billion of funds belonging to the Divi Neguma Department while distributing roofing sheets among Divi Neguma beneficiaries during the 2015 Presidential Election.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, former Secretary to the Ministry of Economic Development Dr. Nihal Jayasinghe, former Director General of the Divi Neguma Department, Kithsiri Ranawaka and former Deputy Director General of Divi Neguma Department, Bandula Tilllekasiri in the Colombo High Court, for allegedly distributing roofing sheets and other materials costing Rs. 2.991 billion during the January 2015 presidential election.
The Attorney General initiated legal proceedings against the four accused under the Penal Code and Public Property Act for misappropriating a sum of R. 2.991 billion without Parliament’s approval.
