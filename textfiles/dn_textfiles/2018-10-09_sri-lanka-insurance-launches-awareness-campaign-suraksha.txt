Sri Lanka Insurance launches awareness campaign on Suraksha

Sri Lanka Insurance launched an islandwide campaign on October 1, commemorating World Children’s Day 2018.
Children’s day main program was launched at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children followed by series of programs conducted at the Pediatric Wards of the 20 main hospitals island wide.
SLIC Chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya, Chief Executive Officer Chandana L. Aluthgama, Chief Officer Business Development Rukman Weerarathna, DGM Marketing and Head of Marketing Namalee Silva and the members from corporate management participated at the awareness campaign.
The aim of the program was to create awareness about the Suraksha free health insurance policy launched together with Ministry of Education to ensure that the physical and mental well-being of all Sri Lankan children is maintained at an optimum. SLIC successfully educated thousands of parents about the benefits they can obtain from Suraksha free health insurance cover and the procedure to obtain their claims.
The Suraksha health insurance policy will ease the financial burden when students are faced with illnesses, accidents and disabilities in and out of the school. It will help students to continue with their education, overcoming any health-related obstacles they may encounter, irrespective of financial status.
