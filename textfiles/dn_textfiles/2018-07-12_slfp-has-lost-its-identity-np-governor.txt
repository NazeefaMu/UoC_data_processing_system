SLFP has lost its identity - NP Governor

For the first time in its 65-year-long history, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) faces political turmoil and the obligation of all party members is to restore the party to the position it previously held, Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray stated in Ambalangoda.
The Governor was speaking at the reorganising convention of the SLFP Ambalangoda Bala Mandala on Sunday.
“Today, we have launched the reorganising programme of the party islandwide in a context of political, economic and social transformation. Political hassles are evident in every aspect of society. The government is overwhelmed with political disputes. Every party manifests political crisis. Those who came to power chanting the mantra of yahapalana have become the kingpins of corruption, deceit and fraud,” Cooray said.
At every election, every party pledges to free the country of such political, economic and social evils. However, after coming into power, they simply ignore their election pledges and instead protect the corrupt people who exploit the national wealth. Hence corruption, deceit and fraud prevail as usual with no interruption, Cooray said.
“Only the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike initiated firm action against corruption. He expelled five Cabinet ministers of his government as they were proved to be guilty of corruption following the findings of the Thalagodapitiya Special Commission of Inquiry. After SWRD, no leader of the country could take any action against any corrupt politician.”
Cooray said that during the recent past, the SLFP was dominated by opportunistic crossovers of UNPers. Those who joined the SLFP in the guise of strengthening the hand of the then President held the all prominent Cabinet portfolios while the strong party leaders who dedicated their lives to the progress of the party had to be content with negligible positions in the government. However, those opportunists who joined the party during the era that it thrived left it at the time of its adversity.
“Our party gradually moved away from its original political mission and vision. The SLFP’s political approach is quite different to that of the UNP. The SLFP always advocated a philosophy which aligned neither to capitalism nor to socialism. We always took the middle road in politics. The present party reorganisation should be carried out in a manner that re-establishes a truthful and practical political philosophy.”
“Now the party is completely reorganised. All opportunists have left the party. We have to reorganise the party following the genuine middle-path political vision of our founder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike,” Cooray said.
State Minister Piyasena Gamage, Deputy Minister Nishantha Mutuhettigamage and Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva also spoke.
