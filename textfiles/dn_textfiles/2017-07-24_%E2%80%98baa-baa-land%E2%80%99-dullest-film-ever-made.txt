‘Baa Baa Land’: the dullest film ever made

This really could be the dullest film ever made - and the people behind it couldn’t be happier.
‘Baa Baa Land’ is an epic eight-hour, slow motion film about sheep. Yes, you read that correctly - it’s a film, with absolutely no dialogue, about sheep. ‘Baa Baa Land’ features no actors, talking and doesn’t even have a plotline to keep audiences hooked.
And the unconventional stars of this epic are nothing more than a flock of sheep.
‘Baa Baa Land’ even bills itself as the dullest film ever made and consists entirely of slow motion shots of sheep in a field. The film was shot in Essex and was produced by the founders of a digital meditation app, Calm. It is the latest example of the niche genre known as slow cinema, which is known for long takes and having little or no dialogue narrative.
In 2015, the BBC Four television channel broadcast, “All Aboard! The Sleigh Ride”, a two-hour, dialogue-free film, showing reindeer pulling a sleigh used by indigenous peoples in Northern Norway, shot from the view of the driver.
‘Baa Baa Land’ is scheduled to premiere on an as-yet unannounced date in September at London’s Prince Charles Cinema.
