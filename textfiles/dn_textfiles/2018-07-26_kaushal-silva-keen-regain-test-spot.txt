Emerging Series between Sri Lanka and South Africa commences today:
Kaushal Silva keen to regain Test spot

Kaushal Silva is keen to use the four-day two-match series between the Emerging teams of Sri Lanka and South Africa starting at Chilaw Marians grounds, Katunayake today to regain his Test spot.
“This is a great platform for players to perform well and get back in the national squad. I don’t see myself playing for the Emerging team as strange. It doesn’t matter what team I play for if I get those runs against my name, eventually I’ll be back in the national squad,” said Silva who will be leading the Sri Lanka Emerging team in the series.
Silva who has played in 37 Tests has been out of favour with the national selectors since October 2017 and made it clear that it’s a matter of getting those runs and that he would be using the occasion as a challenge to do so.
Avishka Gunawardene, coach of the Sri Lanka Emerging team said: “In these Emerging tours there are certain objectives that may concern senior players like Kaushal who is trying to get back into the national team. Whilst giving opportunities to youngsters it is also important to have seniors to guide them.”
Pathum Nissanka, Kamindu Mendis and Hasitha Boyagoda who played for the under 19 World Cup in New Zealand eary this year have been named in the Lankan squad.
South African coach Shukri Conrad said that the tour was a good opportunity to face local conditions and perform well against Sri Lanka.
“We expect wickets to turn and we also expect good wickets and get used to playing under all kind of conditions. We spent two months of preparation and hope our players will put up a fine performance in all departments,” Conrad said.
SRI LANKA EMERGING TEAM FOR TODAY’S MATCH: Kaushal Silva (captain), Madawa Warnapura, Pathum Nissanka, Charith Asalanka (vice-captain), Shammu Ashan, Manoj Sarathchandra, Kamindu Mendis, Chamika Karunaratne, Malinda Pushpakumara, Lahiru Gamage, Dilesh Gunaratne.
