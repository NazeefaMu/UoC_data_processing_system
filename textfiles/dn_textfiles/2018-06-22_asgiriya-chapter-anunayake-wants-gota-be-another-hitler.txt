Asgiriya Chapter Anunayake wants Gota to be another Hitler

The Most Ven. Wendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter yesterday called upon former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to come forward and rebuild the country even by assuming the position of another ‘Hitler'.
The Anunayake Thera made this request delivering an Anusasana at a Sanghika Dana held at Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's Mirihana residence to mark his 69th birthday. The Ven. Upali Thera said the Maha Sangha would like to call upon Rajapaksa to build this country even through a military takeover.
A large number of bhikkhus representing the three nikayas attended the sanghika dana. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Parliamentarians Chamal Rajapaksa, Basil Rajapaksa and a majority of the 16 SLFP Parliamentarians who left government ranks were also present on the occasion.
