Quirky candles

A candle is one of the easiest ways to add ambiance to your home. But just because they cast a soft glow in your living room, it doesn’t hide the fact that they can look a bit banal. Luckily, there have been some clever candle developments over the past several years and otherwise ordinary balls of wax have been shaped into statement-making pieces for your home.
The Kisa Candle by PyroPet (melting cat candle) was one of the first cool candles to usher in this new era of illumination. When you begin to burn this candle, it seems as though it’s a solid wax creature. But as it melts, a metal skeleton is slowly revealed. Once the candle is completely spent, you have the skeleton as a peculiar keepsake.
There have since been other candles that are quirkier than average, like a unicorn that cries rainbows or even one that smells and resembles a Froot Loop cereal bowl. So, why settle for your average tea light?
