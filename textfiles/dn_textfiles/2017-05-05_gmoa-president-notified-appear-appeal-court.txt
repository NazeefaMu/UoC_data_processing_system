GMOA President notified to appear before Appeal Court

 
The Court of Appeal has issued notice on Government Medical Officer’s Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya to appear before courts on charges of contempt of court.
Two civil society activists yesterday filed a contempt of court action in the Court of Appeal against Dr. Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya.
The civil activists are seeking the Court’s Constitutional jurisdiction against Dr. Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017, which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
