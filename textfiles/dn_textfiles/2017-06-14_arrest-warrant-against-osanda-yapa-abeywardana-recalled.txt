 Meanwhile, the Court was informed that the suspect Osanda Yapa Abeywardena had already paid a sum of Rs.125, 000 as a compensation to the victim Mohammed Riyas, a resident of Colombo 10.   
 The Cinnamon Gardens police had alleged that the suspect could be charged for several traffic offences including reckless driving, failing to avoid getting into a traffic accident and driving a vehicle without a valid license.
 Police had further informed Court that they were intending to take legal action against the victim as well for his reckless driving.
