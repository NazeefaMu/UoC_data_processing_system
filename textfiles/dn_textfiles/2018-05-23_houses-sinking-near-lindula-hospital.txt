Houses sinking near Lindula hospital

Following torrential rains, four houses have sunk and another six houses are on the verge of sinking in a land near the Thalawakelle, Lindula hospital.
With rains continuing, the threat of ground subsidence in the area is very much possible according to experts.
According to the Police families had been residing in these houses located within the Thalawakele-Lindula Urban Council since 1976. Residents have requested from authorities to provide them with new houses at a safe location.
Meanwhile a team from the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) is slated to visit the area to investigate the matter.
