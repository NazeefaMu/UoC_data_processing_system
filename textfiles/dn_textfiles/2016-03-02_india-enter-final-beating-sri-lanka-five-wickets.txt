India enter final by beating Sri Lanka by five wickets

India played themselves into the final defeating the reigning Asia Cuo champions Sri Lanka by five wickets at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka.
India in pursuit of a realatively easy target of 139 lost five wickets in the process for 142 in 19.2 overs. Virat Kohli top scored with 56 n.o.
Sri Lanka’s slim chances of entering the final will now squarely wrest on the outcome of the Pakistan versus Bangladesh game today and the result of the Sri Lanka – Pakistan encounter.
Sri Lanka had won only one match in the tournament beating the lowly rated UAE and defeating India to keep their hopes alive to get into the next stage of the contest is a herculean task for a team still struggling to find their bearings to match the Indian mechanism.
After restricting the Lankans for 138 for 6 in their 20 overs, Nuwan Kulasekera struck twice to get rid of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma cheaply at 16 for 2 in 3.2 overs.
But the indomitable Indian batting line up was unshaken as Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina carried on relentlessly without further mishaps.
The third wicket pair added 54 runs and when Raina drove Shanaka Danushka to Kulasekra when he had reached 21 .
Yuvraj Singh kept company with Kohli scoring 35 . Virat Kohli remained unbeaten on 56 facing 47deliveries with seven fours as India romped home by 5 wickets.
Mathews lost the toss in this all important game for Sri Lanka, both captains preferred to bowl first on a pitch which showed signs good for the fast bowlers. Dinesh Chandimal took the role as the opener joining Dilshan.
The Lankans have been experimenting the opening slot, it was Shehan Jayasuriya in the match against Bangladesh. Left armer Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah justified their captain’s decision of bowling first. Both Nehra and Bumrah made the ball to hurry through. Jasprit Bumrah was able to purchase some lift and create some doubts in the batsmen’s mind.. But it was Ashish Nehra who drew first blood having Chandimal caught behind on the leg side.
Then Jasprit Bumrah got one to rise sharply and Shehan Jayasuriya promoted to number three in the order hung his bat to give Dhoni his second catch.Sri Lanka’s batting was not convincing at all.
Tillekeratn Dilshan had lost his extravagance and looked a shadow of his past heroics and trying desperately to find his fluency. Dilshan after facing sixteen deliveries and striking two boundaries, trying to swing first change bowler Hardik Pandya was caught by Ashwin in the deep. Sri Lanka were 31 for 3 in 6.1 overs in Pandyan’s first ball in his first over. Mathews joined Kapugedera who was promoted in the batting order may be to give him more overs to face.
Mathews after adding 24 runs with Kapugedera was beaten and bowled off Hardik Pandya who is turning out to be a fine all-rounder. Boundaries were hard to get , Milinda Siriwardene struck Ravindra Jadeja for a sixand glided one past wicket keeper Dhoni to the fence. Kapugedera and Milinda Siriwardene added 43 runs and posted the 100 run mark. The lower middle order of Thisara Perera with few lusty blows 17 off six deliveries and Nuwan Kulasekera 13 gave some respite to the total while ending the 20 overs at 138 for 9.
