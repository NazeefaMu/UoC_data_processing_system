144 Years at  Wesley

Wesley College is named after John Wesley (1703-1791) the founder of the Methodist Church. An Oxford graduate, he was one of the greatest evangelists in the history of the Christian Church. A preacher of great power and an organizer of genius, he founded Methodism in the face of intense opposition and laid the foundations of future world-wide expansion.
Wesley College began its existence in the Dam street Pettah and was founded by Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira on March 2, 1874. He became its first Vice-Principal during the Principalship of Rev. Samuel Rowse Wilkin. During the early days, Pettah was a respectable residential area and its streets were lined with tall trees. The school had its beginnings on the verandahs of the old Methodist Church at Dam Street, Pettah. The Pettah merchants of mixed races and religions educated their children at this school Wesley. Daniel Henry Pereira was much loved by the people and his pupils. He laboured thus for years in the dust and the heat of Pettah.
Keen interest
When Rev. Highfield arrived in 1895 Pettah was rapidly becoming a busy area and he saw the need for peaceful surroundings for his school, with space to expand. He was the person who moved Wesley College to its present site in 1905. Young Daniel Henry Highfield was keenly interested in teaching. He was a specialist in Biology and also a keen scientist. He was also proficient in English, Sinhala and Portuguese languages. In his parish work, he served in many stations for over 25 years. When he fell ill, his work was taken over by Rev. Robert Hardy. Wesley commemorates the memory of her founder, Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira annually on Founder’s Day March 2. This is the most important event in the Schools calendar. A three-storied imposing building dedicated to his memory, ‘D H Pereira Memorial Building’ to accommodate the junior school, was constructed during the Principalship of Dunstan Fernando. No doubt the labours of Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira servant of God, has nurtured a rich crop of students who have served our Motherland; no doubt this harvest will be reaped by generations yet unborn.
Rev. Henry Highfield is to Wesley what Theseus is to Greece. His legend is everywhere spurred on by his missionary zeal and love for humanity. He collected the money to build the school in its present site. Today as we recall and honour these two great personalities of Wesley we bring into focus the school which they dreamt of-where the motto is “PRAY AND LABOUR ON”, truly they have laboured Sri Lanka one of its best and greatest schools.
The College Crest
Crest which has adorned student record books, uniforms and blazers of Wesley College, consist of the cross and the shells derived from the coat of arms of John Wesley, on the other hand the origin of the shield on the crest is not known, as it is not featured even in any of the designs of the college .
The motto “ORA ET LABORA” which is an integral part of the crest was inserted by Rev. Arthur Shipham (1880-1883) and John Dalby. The 12 shells are symbolic of the journeying pilgrim, seeking and searching ahead. One could even compare it to the twelve wandering tribes of Israel. Within the shield of faith is placed the rugged cross of sacrifice.
College Song
The college song has been composed by a renowned old Wesleyite, H J V I Ekanayake. “Boys of Wesley Through the Land” was first sung after a farewell dinner to a junior master held at the college hall in Dam Street, the first location of Wesley College. To mention with pride this was the 1st college song to be composed and sung in a school in Sri Lanka.
The great hall of Wesley College is a perfect tribute to Rev Henry Highfield. The hall has survived 2 world wars. The ion beam of the hall is made of the finest Burma Teak and is the only one of its kind in Sri Lanka. The majestic English Victorian stained glass windows are of the finest.
College Chapel
14th February 1993 Rev. Dr Kinsley Muttiah the President of the Methodist Church Sri Lanka who had laid the foundation stone declared it open and blessed while the Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. Kenneth Fernando preached the 1st sermon.
The college library is part of this extension and was named after Rev. Cartman. It now stands as a monument of honour for his selfless and determined work at Wesley. The library was declared open by the then Prime Minister D S Senanayake on 8th July 1949. In 1955 a full-time senior librarian was appointed for the 1st time to work during school hours.
On March 2, 2011, Principal Dr Shanthi Mclelland announced at the founder’s day assembly that “on Founders’ Day 2012 Wesley will have a Swimming Pool”. Many wesleyites thought that this was an unrealistic and impossible task. The Principal led the old boys and teachers to the pool site, which was the existing playground for the younger kids adjacent to Karlshue Gardens.
Old Boys Union
Tradition has it that the Old Boys Union of the school was inaugurated on the 1st December 1874, which is the year as that in which the school was founded. This may appear strange, but it can be explained by the fact that when Wesley College was opened, it took students from Pettah Methodist School. The Methodist church is well known as pioneers in the idea of involving all its members in church activities, and it is possible that this idea was extended to students in relation to school activities, it could surmise that the principal, Rev S R Wilkin who was the first principal of Wesley college would have conceived the idea of summoning a meeting of the students who left in the first year to form an Old Boys Union
WESLEY COLLEGE OBU CELEBRATES FOUNDER’S DAY WEEK

HERBERT PERERA
Wesley commemorates the memory of her Founder, the Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira, annually on Founder’s Day. This is the most important event in the School’s calendar. During the School’s 144 years history, thousands have passed through the hallowed portals of this great institution, which has produced many Distinguished Alumni, who have contributed invaluable service to Society, Nation and the world. Among them are Sir Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke (the first Ceylonese Governor General), Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka, Sir Claude Corea (Member of Parliament), Walisinghe Harischandra (Social Reformer, Historian and Author), Sir Mohamed Macan Markar (Member Legislative Council of Ceylon), Sir Gerard Wijeyekoon (Member Legislative Council of Ceylon), Mahadevan Sathasivam (International Cricket Player), P de S Kularatne (Principal of Ananda College), E F C Ludowyk (first Professor of English at University of Ceylon), M H Mohamed (Speaker of Sri Lanka Parliament and Mayor of Colombo) and Farveez Maharoof (International Cricket Player).
The examples set by many brilliant Old Boys as Role Models who have lived up to the ideals and values of the Founders, bringing honour and glory to their Alma Mater through their respective professions, will continue to inspire Wesleyites in the years to come. The Current Committee of the Wesley College OBU Colombo, under the leadership of the Incumbent President Wilhelm Van Dort, is striving to uphold the Traditions and Values of the great Christian Methodist Legacy - which they inherited from preceding generations, and see that it is passed down to the future generations of Wesleyites.
