[APPRECIATIONS - (25-12-2017)]

Maya Senanayake
Woman for all seasons
Mothers come in all shapes and sizes, and mine came as a package of innumerable talents and ideals.
She combined the tenacity of her father who, from a village boy, became arguably one of Sri Lanka’s foremost mathematical minds and the adventurism of an English mother who made this country her home due to her life-long commitment to education.
Living with educationist parents meant she moved with them, and her life was built around schools. Starting with Ananda College—where she was, at the time of her passing, the oldest old girl—to a myriad other institutions that her parents chose to establish or uplift. I remember her constant complaint that they would mark her papers down purposely to show there was no favouritism.
What was most impressive was how she threw herself into her interests with huge commitment—sewing like a professional, knitting all our so-called ‘Nuwaera Eliya clothes,’ crocheting her own designs and even mastering the complex lace pillow. When it came to batik, she taught herself enough to make her own clothes, and during her pottery stage, pieces of unique design would appear in her whatnot duly-signed and dated at the bottom.
In sports, she was equal to any task: she played a mean game of tennis often with the love of her life, my father, and rode horses and competed in swimming with equal aplomb.
Badminton, Table tennis? Bring it on, she would say, and would display her fierce competitiveness with no quarter given. Being a police officer’s wife immediately made her a fan of all the force’s teams, and her particular favourite was rugby. Here, she would cast aside the polite reserve of an IGP’s wife to boisterously cheer the team from the front-row seats.
Her four boys and husband would cower when she would loudly question the referee’s decision and look to us for support.
Pragmatism and multi-tasking were words invented for her: all decisions had to be well-thought out, practical and self-sustaining. So it seemed the natural thing to do when she launched a factory to tailor police uniforms that employed only policemen’s children and wives. Such was also the case when she embarked on building a three-storey building as president of the All Ceylon Women’s Buddhist Congress and a training bakery, accommodation for its female trainees and a retail outlet to cover the relevant expenses.
These and many other positions she held in benevolent organisation came at a price as her no-nonsense approach was not appreciated by all—though in hindsight, they all agree she had the best interest of those bodies at heart. Then there was Maya, the businesswomen. Accepting the challenge to manage the printing press that was producing my grandfather’s standard-issue school books at the time, she managed a team of sixty employees whilst balancing the care of her four boys and a husband whose career was progressing rapidly.
As the self-reliant person she was, she drove her trusted Morris station wagon herself, not hesitating to admonish any motorist who crossed her path.
Amidst all this, we saw a mother to whom family meant everything—not in a spoiling or passive sense, but one who encouraged and guided. She taught us to be practical, but at the same time, hugs and kisses were there in plenty. Every birthday cake, every big match outfit, every cricket match my brothers played were considered personal duties by her; the quintessential daughter, wife and mother.
As her 91st birth anniversary draws near, it is hard to accept that she is gone, but in her own words, her work here is done.

Alec Robertson
Propagator of the Dhamma
It has been 15 years since Alec Robertson—preacher, writer and broadcaster of the Dhamma and one-time Member of Parliament—passed away.
Alec Robertson was born in Gampola on October 30, 1928, and died on the last day of 2002, at the age of 74. His working life was dedicated mainly to the Buddhist cause—propagating the Dhamma through talks, discussions, books, and articles to Buddhist journals and newspapers. One of his most significant contributions was the popularisation of the weekly Dhamma discussions in English at Maitri Hall, Lauries’ Road, Bambalapitiya. He was closely associated with the Servants of the Buddha Society, which has conducted Buddhist discussions on Saturday evenings for almost half a century. He started taking part in these meetings while he was still at school. He became the society’s Assistant Secretary when he was just 21 years. Later, he became secretary, and served as president for an uninterrupted 30 years, from 1969.
He relinquished this office only when he realised that declining health would not permit him to discharge the duties of this office effectively. But he continued to be associated with the society as its adviser until his demise.
His voice and personality reverberated in the Maitri Hall, where he chaired the society’s meetings and gave a Dhamma talk every first Saturday of the month. When the scheduled speaker could not turn up, Alec Robertson would give the talk himself, often asking the audience to suggest a topic.
Robertson had a prodigious memory. His knowledge of the Dhamma was extensive, based on his studies of Pali, the Dhamma, the Abhidhamma, and commentaries, as well as through his association with Buddhist scholars, monks, and laymen. Robertson was also for many years associated with broadcasting, giving Dhamma talks on the radio and participating in Dhamma radio discussions. For several decades he participated in one of the most popular Buddhist radio programmes at that time, namely, the Buddhist Forum. In this forum, a number of Buddhist scholars discuss various aspects of the Dhammaand entertain subjects for discussions from listeners. Participants in this forum apart from Robertson included at that time the late S. R. Wijayatilake, a former Judge of the Supreme Court and the late Austin De Silva, a dedicated Buddhist worker. Robertson became the chairman of the Buddhist Forum later and continued to perform the task, except for brief intervals, until his death, a period of two and half a decades.
As a writer, Robertson had many Buddhist publications to his credit. These include the
Buddhist Attitude To Christianity,
Nibbana – Happiness Supreme,
The Triple Gem and the Uposatha, and
Buddha, the Healer Incomparable. He also regularly contributed articles to the newspapers, Buddhist journals and the Buddhist annual, Vesak Sirisara.
Although known largely as a promoter of the Dhamma among English-speaking people, Alec Robertson also had a good command of the Sinhala language. As a young man he travelled to different parts of the country giving talks, usually in Sinhala, at the invitation of Buddhist organisations in the outstations. He strived at all times to share his knowledge about the latent power held within the human mind. His messages were directed at awakening people to recognize this great untapped and unseen capacity within them and to introduce the teachings of the Dharma as the path to greater self-awareness. Robertson pursued his mission in life with determination, courage, and commitment. May his onward journey in Samsara be smooth and brief, and may he realise early the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
