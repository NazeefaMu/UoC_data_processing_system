Govt will never advocate federalism or division of country: President

The government will never advocate federalism or division of the country on federal lines. It will also never allow the outright sale of land to foreign companies as alleged by certain disgruntled political elements, President Maithripala Sirisena said in Galle.
He said these elements were trying to seek vengence from the government by uttering falsehoods to mislead the masses.
The President was addressing a gathering at the concluding ceremony of the Nila Mehewara presidential official services national programme in the Galle district on Saturday.
President Sirisena also recalled that a certain print media institution too misinterpreted the GSP + facility regained by the country alleging that the GSP + was given as an incentive to create a federal system of government.
“This is a completely baseless allegation as the government would never condone federalism. Such misleading news items were quite regrettable,” he said.
The President said he would request such media institutions to check the truth and authenticity of the news before publishing them without misusing the media freedom restored by the government.
The President said the government which earned world opinion in Sri Lanka’s favour by restoring its international image, desired to create lasting peace and communal amity and harmony in the country.
President Sirisena said the government’s objective was to strengthen the Provincial Council system by sharing powers with them.
The President said it was quite natural for new ventures and undertakings of the government to face opposition and and objections at the beginning.
“But such opposition systematically died down when people began to realise the benefits accruing to them by such ventures. This was evident when the Free Trade Zone scheme was first introduced to the country. The same was true with the gigantic Mahaweli scheme,” he said.
President Sirisena said Buddhism and Buddhist culture hold a supreme place in the country.
“On the other hand we are responsible to uphold peaceful coexistence among nations. We have established unity among the Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Malays. In this noble attempt, the Maha Sangha and other religious dignitaries can render a significant service,” he said.
