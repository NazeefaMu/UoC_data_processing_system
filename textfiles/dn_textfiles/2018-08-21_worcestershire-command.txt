Worcestershire in command

LONDON, Sunday: Division One strugglers Worcestershire finished day one of their match against Yorkshire on top after bowling out the hosts at Scarborough in the English County Championships on Sunday as red-ball cricket returned after a four-week break.
Andrew Gale’s side were 63-4 before Kane Williamson (87) and Jonathan Tattersall (27) led a fightback. But Yorkshire lost four wickets for as many runs to slump to 155-8, but Jack Brooks added a useful 38 as the Tykes eventually posted 216.
Worcs reached 39-0 in reply before play was suspended for bad light.
County Championship leaders Surrey fought back strongly after being bowled out for 211 by Lancashire. The hosts lost wickets at a consistent rate, Aaron Finch top scoring with 43, and were all out by tea.
Lancashire’s reply got off to a terrible start when they lost Alex Davies to a duck in the first over. After slumping to 43-3, a half century from Dane Vilas (61) steadied the ship before three late wickets swung the game back in Surrey’s favour.
Vilas’ partnership with Shiv Chanderpaul (25 not out) looked set to guide Lancashire to a good score before some late-evening drama under the Oval floodlights.
Marcus Trescothick hit 95 as Somerset frustrated the Essex attack on day one of their County Championship clash at Taunton.
The former England opener was denied a second Championship ton of the season when he was caught off Australian international Peter Siddle (3-71). He shared a fourth-wicket stand of 77 with skipper Tom Abell (70) who then added 64 with Steve Davies (45). Lewis Gregory was unbeaten on 42 as the hosts reached 308-7 by stumps.
A third century of the season for Will Rhodes helped Warwickshire to a 43-run lead over Gloucestershire on day one.
Rhodes (101 not out) put on 161 for the first wicket with Dominic Sibley (65) as the hosts closed on 170-2. Earlier, the visitors were dismissed for 127 with Chris Wright taking 5-32, including two wickets in three balls.
Keith Barker (2-22) and Jeetan Patel (2-28) took two wickets each, while Chris Dent (35) was one of only five players to reach double figures. Liam Dawson and Kyle Abbott rescued Hampshire from a difficult position on day one against Nottinghamshire.
The hosts were 57-1 at lunch but Steven Mullaney (3-43) took three wickets in five balls, and off-spinner Matt Carter (3-34) got rid of James Vince for 74.
Dawson (72) and Abbott (60 not out) shared a stand of 133 to help Hampshire from 137-7 to 277 all out.
Notts then slumped to 39-4, 238 behind, as West Indies international Kraigg Brathwaite made only five on his debut. Brathwaite was one of three victims for his compatriot Fidel Edwards (3-9), while Gareth Berg got rid of Chris Nash for one.
Promotion-chasing Sussex put themselves in a good position against Derbyshire as skipper Ben Brown scored a century on day one of their Division Two clash.
After electing to bowl at Hove, the visitors made a decent start and reduced Sussex to 65-3. Harry Finch (82) and Brown helped the hosts recover after coming together at 111-4, and Brown was eventually trapped lbw by Lockie Ferguson for 116.
All-rounder David Wiese finished on 89 not out as Sussex closed on 400-7. Derbyshire will have concerns over bowler Ravi Rampaul, who went to hospital for a precautionary check-up after leaving the field with breathing problems during the evening session.
Durham finished day one in Cardiff on top as they reached 79-0 in reply to Glamorgan’s 154 all out.
The visitors’ seamers were nearly always in control with Chris Rushworth (3-36) the pick of the attack backed up by Matt Salisbury (3-34).
Kiran Carlson, David Lloyd and Ruaidhri Smith all passed 30 but no-one managed a substantial contribution in gloomy conditions. Debutant Alex Lees then hit 53 not out as Durham showed more application.
Ricardo Vasconcelos equalled his career-best first-class score of 140 before Northants were pegged back by Middlesex on day one at Wantage Road.
Vasconcelos shared stands of 77 with Richard Levi (41) and 63 with Steven Crook (31) to put the hosts on top. But having claimed both openers, James Harris (5-81) returned after tea to remove Rory Kleinveldt and Nathan Buck in successive balls.
The hosts, who lie second-bottom of Division Two, reached stumps at 332-8.
Leicestershire have a slight advantage going into day two of their game against Kent.
The hosts were restricted to 220 all out, with skipper Paul Horton (49) the only man to score more than 40 runs as Ivan Thomas ended with figures of 4-35. However, Kent openers Daniel Bell-Drummond (10) and Sean Dickson (15) went in the opening 10 overs.
Heino Kuhn (12) fell to Mohammad Abbas (2-22) before play was suspended for bad light with the visitors on 53-3.
