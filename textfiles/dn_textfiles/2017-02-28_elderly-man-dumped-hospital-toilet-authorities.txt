Elderly man dumped in hospital toilet by authorities

An old man was destined to spend the last month of his life in a toilet in ward 4 of the Kamburupitiya Base Hospital.
No one had come to collect him after he was discharged from the hospital. The hospital authorities had dumped him in the toilet and provided him with food.
However, he died on the day a popular TV channel broadcast his plight.
