Welikada Prison Superintendent ordered to give statement

The Welikada Prison Superintendent was yesterday ordered to give a statement to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in connection with a plan of five convicts on death row in the Bharatha Lakshman murder case, including former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva, to flee the prison.
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara made this order after the CID had informed court that five convicts, including former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva and underworld gangster Dematagoda Chaminda were planning to flee the prison.
The Chief Magistrate also ordered the chief jailor in charge of their cells to give a statement to the CID.
The CID started investigations on the advice of the Attorney General, after news was aired on electronic media that these convicts were planning to flee the prison.
The CID has sought court order to record statements from them on security put in place inside the prison for them.
