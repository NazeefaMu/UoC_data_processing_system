Pitch  perfect

She came, she he sang and she conquered hearts. 23 year old Luksimi Sivaneswaralingam is now a well known voice in the South Indian music industry.
The gifted vocalist of Sri Lankan Tamil origin got the opportunity to debut as a playback singer in the South Indian music industry in 2016. She became the first Sri Lankan Tamil to sing a full film song for the music director D. Imman in the upcoming Tamil supernatural thriller movie Bogan directed by Lakshman. The film is produced by Prabhu Deva on behalf of Prabhu Deva Studios and stars popular actors like Jayam Ravi, Hansika, and Aravid Swami. The song has crossed 4 million views in such a short span, and has reached the number one slot on the iTunes India.
“Social media has played an immense role in my opportunity of singing for Bogan. I never imagined that uploading a few clips of myself singing on Instagram would bring me such an opportunity! Since ‘Senthoora’ was my debut song for this project I was very nervous going into my recording but I was excited as well because I got a gift of an opportunity. Imman sir was very encouraging throughout the recording process and gave me the space to add my own western flavour and touches to best embellish the song. My favourite moments were working with sir and lyricist Thamarai in my recording, and being at the audio launch. I was also very happy to have heard lyricist Madhan Karky say that ‘Senthoora’ was his favourite song from the movie soundtrack,” Luksimi recalled with a smile.

However ‘Senthoora’ was not her debut film song. She had sung her first film song, ‘Valimeethu’, the title song for the Tamil Canadian movie Appa in 2008.
Luksimi began her music journey as a Carnatic vocal student at the age of three, performing and taking part in Carnatic vocal competitions. She also took up lessons in bharathanatyam, veena and the piano, and later Western classical vocals and other popular genres of singing. She completed her Bharathanatyam Arangetram in 2013. Since then she has performed and competed at several events in Canada and on the international scale. Luksimi has had the opportunity to sing for albums, and radio jingles.
“My mom had introduced me to my guru Smt. Kamaladevy Shanmugalingam, who had not only taught me music but also discipline and many other skills that have shaped me into who I am today. When I was in high school, I knew I wanted to pursue full-time and professionally, so I began training with a private vocal coach. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto, with a Bachelor of Music - Voice Performance. I was quite fortunate to have several professionals and my private voice teacher guided me through the intricate techniques to use when singing and how to maintain a healthy voice. My voice teacher at the university was great, because she helped me find a common bridge between western and eastern styles of singing,” Luksimi explained.

The versatile vocalist was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. She completed her undergraduate degree at the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Music – Voice Performance (Western classical), where she also took courses relevant to music education and vocal pedagogy. She completed her post graduate degree in music education at Wilfrid Laurier University recently.
“Every singer has unique and distinctive qualities to their voice that make them unique. This helps them create their own identity. My style of singing and voice links the western and Indian styles of music. Though I’ve been formally trained in Carnatic and Western classical vocals, I like to explore my ability in various genres of singing as I believe it’s important to be a versatile singer,” Luksimi expressed adding that she can sing fluently in Tamil, English, Hindi, German, Italian, French and Latin.
She has received several awards for her achievements in the fine arts, academics, and community service. She won the first place at the international Innisai Kural 2006 competition in Canada and UK. She was also one of the Top five finalists in both Tvi Super Star Season 2, and Super Star Challenge, an international vocal competition in Singapore where she competed against India, Malaysia, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. Renowned singers and music directors like K J Yesudas, S Janaki, Chinamayi, T L Maharajan, German Kannan, and many others have comprised the jury at such events. She was also the vocal coach for TVi Super Star Junior Season 4.

She has bagged the Ontario Volunteer Service Award, Tamils Information Award (Thamizhar Valikaati), and several other accolades. She was given the title ‘Natya Kala Jyothi’ in 2013 for her achievements in Bharathanatyam. Recently, she won the Youth Icon Award at the Ninaivukal Night 2017, and was chosen to be featured on the Ninaivukal Magazine Cover. She has also been featured on albums produced by Steve Cliff Valentine and Kapileshwer Kathir and has performed on stage with many accomplished international artistes.
“There are several people who have inspired me over the years, and continue to inspire me every day. I enjoy following their music, their experiences, and values as a guide to my own journey in music. I am quite fortunate to have supportive and encouraging parents who have been by my side through all the ups and downs throughout my journey. My parents, especially my mom, have a deep passion and interest for the fine arts,” she noted adding that as a child she had been surrounded by music in her home. Her family would always listen to classical and film songs, and watch music related shows and videos of concerts. Over the years and even now, Luksimi has grown up watching great musicians and legends that have been great inspirations to her, musically. She says that she admires their uniqueness, values and humble personalities, and their drive, mindset and focus to achieving their goals and dreams.

Luksimi has worked independent tracks post Bogan, and has recorded for songs that can be pitched for films.
Her ambition is to continue playback singing and performing while balancing her career as an educator. She wishes to become a professor in music and practice music therapy. She hopes to use music as a tool to assist child with special needs.
Her advice to those who wish to excel in singing is to strive to learn because music is similar to an ongoing ocean with lots to explore. There is so much to learn from fellow artistes and musicians that will only allow budding young vocalists to grow.

“Dream big and work hard to achieve it. Anything is possible if you put your mind and heart to it! Stay true to yourself and use the failures as a stepping stone to reach success. Perseverance, time management skills, and a strong support system are essential. Choosing to follow an undefined path is a challenging feat. No matter what obstacles you face, they teach you valuable lessons along the way. Do not stop believing in yourself and your passion for your trade. The sky will always be the limit,” she opined.
Luksimi will be performing at Imman’s live concert in London in September. Several other projects are also under way.
