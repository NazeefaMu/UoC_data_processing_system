Colours that flatter your skin tone

The colours we wear play a crucial role in whether we look bright and fresh or dull and washed-out. Indian girls have a particularly hard time choosing clothes that 'match' their skin tone.
Considering the changing weather, the harsh sun and a general variation in complexion, there isn't one sure-shot formula for all women.
Here are a few points to make sure you get it right.
Skin tone: As a general categorisation, your skin is either light, medium or dark. Luckily, there are some colours that flatter each one.
Light: Pastel hues and softer tones such as lilac and baby blue work in most situations. Avoid cream and beige as they might make you appear tired and dull.
Medium: Think tropical colours such as teal, saffron and dusty rose. Avoid neons.
Dark: Earthy tones like peach, coral and jewel tones of blue, olive and purple work best. Avoid extremely bright tones especially during the day.
Undertones: Don't be intimidated by the fact that the term 'undertone' is thrown around by fashion specialists. There's an easy way to figure out whether you have a cool or a warm undertone. If your inner wrist is more yellow than blue, you have a warm undertone and if not, a cool undertone. Warm, earthy tones complement those with warm undertones whereas lighter, softer colours bring out cooler undertones better.
The mirror test: Don't just pick up items from the rack and decide to bring them home. When buying new clothes, stand in front of a mirror, hold them up against your neck, and look at them with respect to your own colour. A beautiful colour may not look as good on you as it will on someone else. Ideally, it should make your skin look brighter and more luminous (not to be confused with fairer). If not, try a shade you might not usually pick up. It may actually surprise you.
 
When in doubt: Navy blue, black, white, plum and olive green suit most people irrespective of skin tone, so clothes in these colours can be staples in your wardrobe. Neutral colours are another safe option.
 
Go the natural way: Colours closer to your skin tone will look better on you. For example, dark brown or magenta will suit dark-skinned girls while rose pink will suit very fair girls.
 
Comfort is key: No matter what giudes say, the ultimate confidence comes from feeling comfortable in your own skin. If you hate bright colours, no amount of coaxing will make you feel beautiful in them. So always pay regard to your personal preferences as well. -Times of India.com
