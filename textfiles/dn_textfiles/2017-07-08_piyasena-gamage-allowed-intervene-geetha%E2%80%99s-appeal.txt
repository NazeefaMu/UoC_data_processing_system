The Supreme Court yesterday allowed former Minister Piyasena Gamage to intervene into the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep also decided to name Piyasena Gamage as the fifth respondent in the Appeal.

Counsel Suren Fernando appearing for the intervenient petitioner, informed court that no interim relief could have been obtained insofar as it affect the intevenient petitioner’s rights, in the absence of his having been named as a respondent.
“He should have been appointed as a Parliamentarian. He is an aggrieved party of the case,” Fernando added. Delivering its judgement on the writ petition filed by five residents of the Galle district, the Court of Appeal on March 3 held that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the Constitution, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship in Switzerland and Sri Lanka. Subsequently, MP Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an Appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgment.
