Meticulous raid on iguana theft

Around midnight on January 6 when all shops in Dickwella town had closed, Dickwella police rushed to a stationery and cigarettes shop in the town and surrounded it following a tip off that thieves had entered it.
The shop owner awakened by police was also at hand to assist in the raid and witness the thieves being caught red handed by the police.
A large crowd assembled at the spot heard goods rattling inside the shop and thought the thieves were collecting everything possible to make a quick getaway.
Police on full alert ordered the shop owner to unlock the door waiting to pounce on the men inside and catch them with the loot.
But when the door was opened, they were all astonished to see two iguanas that had been locked inside.
They were making the loud noises slithering away from the shop toppling goods on their way unconcerned about the commotion.
In the end, the police officers, shop owner and crowd had a hearty laugh and left the spot to recover their lost sleep.
However, the shop owner and the crowd were thankful for the police officers for showing quick response to the public alert despite the inconvenience caused.
