Champions Essex defeat Lancashire

LONDON, Sunday: Defending champions Essex claimed their first success of the new season by bowling out Lancashire for 288 to win by 31 runs on day three of the English County Championship match played at Chelmsford on Sunday.
Chasing a target of 320, the visitors lost openers Haseeb Hameed and Keaton Jennings with only 32 on the board.
Alex Davies (71) and Jordan Clark (59) batted well, but both were leg-before to pace bowler Jamie Porter. And he ended the game by removing Joe Mennie for 56 to finish with 4-54 and match figures of 9-80.
Somerset made a winning start to their County Championship campaign by beating Worcestershire by 83 runs at Taunton.
They failed to add to their overnight 255-9 as Ed Barnard (6-37) bowled Tim Groenewald, leaving James Hildreth unbeaten on 111.
Set 279 to win, Worcestershire lost early wickets and despite Tom Fell’s 41, they went into lunch on 85-6.
The tailenders added 74 for the last two wickets, with Barnard making 45 not out, but they were all out for 195.
A run-out ended the game with more than four sessions to spare as Barnard called Steve Magoffin for a second run and he was beaten by Matt Renshaw’s throw to the bowler’s end.
Worcestershire have begun the summer with back-to-back defeats following promotion from Division Two last season.
Yorkshire impressed with the bat and ball to put themselves on course to beat Nottinghamshire at Headingley.
After rain wiped out much of the first session, Harry Gurney took three quick wickets, including Gary Ballance (82), as Yorkshire fell from 189-4 to 204-7.
But Tim Bresnan (68 not out) and Ben Coad (33) put on 77 for the final wicket to set a target of 403.
Coad (4-55) was the pick of Yorkshire’s bowlers as Nottinghamshire struggled to 181-8 at stumps.
Ollie Pope struck a wonderful 145 as Surrey pushed on to set Hampshire 472 runs to win on day three at the Oval.
Pope hit 18 fours and one six in his 191-ball innings as Surrey progressed from 217-4 to declare on 407-9.
The 20-year-old shared a 131-run stand with Ben Foakes (81) as the hosts piled on the runs before declaring when Pope was caught five runs shy of 150. Off-spinner Amar Virdi (2-26) took two wickets in an over as Hampshire closed on 116-4, still 355 runs behind.
Surrey will return on day four needing six wickets to wrap up a victory in their first Division One match of the season.
Warwickshire gave an early indication of their promotion potential by beating Northamptonshire by an innings and 48 runs on day three at Wantage Road.
Australian pace bowler Ryan Sidebottom took 4-61 for match figures of 10-96 as the home side were bowled out for 218. It is the first time the 28-year-old has taken 10 wickets in a game in his relatively short first-class career. Adam Rossington made 58 for Northants, whose batting is a cause for concern after a second successive defeat. Their total was the highest they have achieved in four Championship innings so far this summer, having been dismissed for only 71 and 142 by Middlesex last week.
Derbyshire closed on victory against Middlesex after a dominant performance with the bat on day three.
The hosts made easy progress after resuming on 118-0 against a Middlesex attack minus Toby Roland-Jones (sore back) and James Harris (side). Ben Slater was caught off Ollie Rayner for 99, but Luis Reece’s unbeaten 157 helped his side declare on 333-3.
Having set their opponents 442 to win, paceman Duanne Olivier took two wickets as Middlesex closed on on 86-3.
David Lloyd’s career-best 119 helped put Glamorgan in control, with Gloucestershire still 157 short of avoiding an innings defeat on 133-5.
Lloyd started cautiously, but accelerated strongly, striking 18 fours and a six as he put on 117 with Marchant de Lange. De Lange hit a first county 50 before the declaration at 526-9. Gloucestershire lost their top order to Lukas Carey and de Lange, and still face a struggle to survive.
Colin Ackermann’s superb 186 led Leicestershire to 422-9 before declaring as their game with Sussex headed towards a draw on day three.
Beginning the day on 61 not out, Ackermann was one run short of his career-best first-class score as he hit 24 fours in a 458-minute innings.
Mark Cosgrove made 64 in a 141 third-wicket stand with the South African. Spinner Luke Wells had figures of 4-81 for Sussex, who replied with 11-0 in the final few overs - they lead by 27.
