Olympic bronze  medallist dropped  from Rio Games

 
Pradeep Sanjaya, bronze medalist at 2012 London Paralympic has been unfairly dropped from the Sri Lanka team for the Rio Paralympics.
Pradeep who won the 400m T-46 event clocking 49.28 sec. at the 2012 Paralympic games is understood to have been overlooked as a result of a personal dispute between his coach and an official of the Sri Lanka Disabled Athletic Sports Association.
Pradeep earlier served in the Sri Lanka Army and he was disabled following the war. He turned to sport and became the first Sri Lankan Paralympic medallist.
Pradeep was a member of the 4x100 metre relay event in Asia Oceania Disabled Athletic Meet held at UAE last year where Sri Lanka finished sixth in the world ranking.
He also won at the selection trials held at Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Diyagama last month.
Pradeep’s coach has reported the matter to Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and hopes justice will prevail.
The last date for team selections is August 14.
