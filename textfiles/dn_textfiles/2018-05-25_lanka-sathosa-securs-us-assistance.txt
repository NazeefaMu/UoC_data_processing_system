Lanka Sathosa securs US assistance

Lanka Sathosa, the country’s largest state owned retail chain, has clinched committed support from the people of the United States thereby recording the institution’s first ever inward global assistance flow on 24 May.
“The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been working with USAID since 2005 on various initiatives to enhance the Ministry’s mandate” said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on 24 May. Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the MoU signing event between Lanka Sathosa and YouLead, a US Agency for International Development (USAID) funded project, on 24 May in Colombo. YouLead, a US Agency for International Development (USAID) funded project, is designed to help ensure it achieves those ambitious targets.
Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen said, “The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been working with USAID since 2005 on various initiatives to enhance the Ministry’s mandate. We thank USAID and YouLead for their continued support Sri Lanka.”
“We have launched many initiatives to develop Lanka Sathosa and make it competitive. We have seven categories of stores and this proposed expansion includes all of them. We need to train a lot of bright young people and give them long-term career options, particularly those in rural areas where Lanka Sathosa is expanding rapidly.”
“We are embarking on a program to dramatically expand the number of stores across the country. This will require hiring and training more than 1,000 new employees,” said Dr. S.H.M. Faraaz, CEO of Lanka Sathosa. Major General (Rtd.) Piyal Abeysekera, Director of Human Resources and Administration said.
The partnership focuses on training Master Trainers so that they will be able to train the newly hired employees and the existing staff of Lanka Sathosa. Additionally, a skill gap analysis will help evaluate the existing skills of the workforce through a training needs analysis which will inform the design of the overall training and allow it to be tailored specifically to the culture and employment needs of Lanka Sathosa.
YouLead is a four-year (2017-2021) project supporting youth employment, vocational skills development, and youth entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka.
Lanka Sathosa, under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is the largest state owned retail shop network in the country.
