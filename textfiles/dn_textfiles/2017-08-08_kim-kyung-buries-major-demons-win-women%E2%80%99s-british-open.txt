Kim In-Kyung buries major demons to win Women’s British Open

St Andrews: Kim In-Kyung finally put her major heartbreak behind her with a final round 71 and a two-shot victory in the Women’s British Open at Kingsbarns on Sunday.
The South Korean famously threw away the 2012 ANA Inspiration when she missed a one-foot putt at the final hole.
But that is now all forgotten for the newest major champion.
“I cannot describe my feelings,” she said. “I just tried to have some fun, but it wasn’t fun on the back nine.
“I got really inspired playing in Scotland. So many people come here just to play golf and I feel so lucky. I didn’t have too much fear and just gave my best.”
She added: “It’s been a long process to get over 2012. A lot of people helped me. Now I enjoy playing golf again. What it did teach me is to to give the same effort to every shot, even the shortest of putts.”
Six ahead at the start of the day, the 29-year-old Kim looked to be in easy street when she moved seven in front after a tap-in birdie at the par three opening hole.
But she then had to fend off the chasing pack. AFP
