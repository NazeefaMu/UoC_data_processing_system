Bitter rivals come together to revitalize cricket

One-time bitter rivals Thilanga Sumathipala and Jayantha Dharmadasa have teamed up together to take Sri Lanka Cricket forward when they announced their intentions to contest next month’s Sri Lanka Cricket elections.
While Sumathipala is contesting for the post of president, Dharmadasa is contesting for one of the two vice-presidency slots. K Mathivanan, a former vice-president is contesting again for the same post.
Mohan de Silva (secretary), Shammi Silva (treasurer) and Ravin Wickramaratne (assistant secretary) are the others contesting for positions.
The post of assistant treasurer is to be filled later.
Chairing a media conference at the SSC pavilion yesterday to announce their nominations for the elections Sumathipala and his team revealed a six-point plan they hope to implement if they are elected to office on January 4. Nominations close today.
Spelling out the plan Sumathipala, a three-time former president of SLC and presently deputy speaker of Parliament said that they had categorised six main pillars which they hope to transform Sri Lanka Cricket:
International Cricket Domestic Cricket Development Administration Finance, and Communication
“It is a four-year plan which we hope to implement and complete by 2020. Sri Lanka Cricket needs a big transformation and we have come in partnership so that cricket will be the ultimate beneficiary,” said Sumathipala. “We have a very good team and we have a quality team of people that includes three past presidents in Jayantha Dharmadasa, Mohan de Silva and myself along with people who have served Sri Lanka cricket in the past.
Sumathipala stated that he plans to have a strong financial advisory committee with a number of reputed qualified people and hopes to use the experience of Nuski Mohamed, a past secretary and treasurer to head this committee.
He also revealed that they were bringing in Thushan Amarasuriya, son of former SLC interim chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya as a member of the sponsorship committee. “Thushan is a former cricket captain of Royal College and is presently the treasurer of MCA. He comes from good stock,” said Sumathipala.
The former president said that two former Sri Lanka captains Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara would be given big roles to play.
“They are two of the most recent players involved in the current trend of international cricket. We should make maximum use of their experience and expertise in this field,” Sumathipala said.
Stating reasons for coming forward to contest the elections Sumathipala stated, “First and foremost there is an interim regime at the moment. Time and time again there have been allegations against various people at various times for the past 20 years and for about 8-9 years Sri Lanka Cricket has been run by interim committees and democratically elected bodies have come in.
“When the membership approached me and wanted me to come and put the house in order, I spoke to the people who mattered and important for the game. When I discussed with the people especially past presidents and administrators, past cricketers and stake holders they wanted me to lead this side and assured me they would give me the support to put the house in order. That’s why I decided to hand over my nominations today.”
Twice before Sumathipala had tried to contest the presidency of Sri Lanka Cricket and failed.
“Once former president Mahinda Rajapaksa asked me not to contest at the eleventh hour so I did not give my nominations,” said Sumathipala.
“The other occasion when I wanted to contest they said my wife was involved with a sports good company. However she resigned but her resignation stamp duty was accepted two days after I had given my nomination.
“They used that technical point and refused me permission to contest during Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage’s time. You can very clearly see they have taken a very thin line to stop me from contesting. I don’t think it was a valid reason and a reason was not given,” he said.
Sumathipala said that he had the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena to come forward and contest the election for the SLC presidency and that he had no issues related to the gambling industry as he has a letter from the ICC clearing him of any misdemeanor.
