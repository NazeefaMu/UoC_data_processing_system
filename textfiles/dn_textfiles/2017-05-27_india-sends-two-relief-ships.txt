Indian Government yesterday dispatched a ship with relief material to assist flood affected victims in Sri Lanka. Indian High Commission in Colombo Second Secretary Niteen Subhash Yeola told the Daily News yesterday night that this ship is expected to arrive in Colombo by morning today and another ship with relief supplies will arrive in Colombo tomorrow morning.
Yeola said the High Commission is in close contact with the Sri Lankan authorities to provide additional relief to the affected people as required.
India was the first country to respond Sri Lanka’s plea for assistance after flash floods and landslides claimed over 90 lives and rendered thousands homeless.
