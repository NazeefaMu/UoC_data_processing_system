Wilson shines as Bournemouth beat West Ham 2-1

LONDON, Saturday - Striker Callum Wilson scored a stunning goal which helped Bournemouth come from behind in a 2-1 victory at West Ham United on Saturday and stretched their fine Premier League start to two wins in as many games.
West Ham, in contrast, slipped to the bottom of the table after a second successive defeat following a 4-0 drubbing by Liverpool in the opening round, piling early pressure on their new manager Manuel Pellegrini.
The Hammers looked set to claim their first win of the season after Marko Arnautovic drilled in a 33rd-minute penalty, awarded by referee Stuart Wilson after the linesman confirmed that Nathan Ake tripped Javier Hernandez.
But the tide turned in the second half after Austria striker Arnautovic wasted an excellent chance to double West Ham’s lead on the stroke of halftime, as keeper Asmir Begovic did well to save his fizzing low shot.
Wilson, who also missed a sitter in the opening half with the score 0-0, produced a breathtaking equaliser on the hour.
The striker powered his way past four defenders after picking the ball up at the halfway line and threaded it through the legs of West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski.
West Ham were reeling and defender Steve Cook completed Bournemouth’s comeback six minutes later, stooping to head a close-range header into the roof of the net off the ground after Ryan Fraser floated in a free kick from the right.
West Ham face an uphill task in the next round when they visit city rivals Arsenal and if their early form is anything to go by, the Hammers are in for a tough season.
A nightmare afternoon for Newcastle United’s loan signing Kenedy ended with the Brazilian having a penalty saved with almost the final kick of a dismal and goalless Premier League stalemate at Cardiff City.
With Newcastle down to 10 men after a straight red card for Isaac Hayden, Kenedy spurned a golden and unlikely chance to steal all three points, putting a seal on one of the most inauspicious individual displays seen in the Premier League.
The on-loan Chelsea winger, whose poor 96th minute spot kick was kept out by Neil Etheridge, should not even have been on the pitch after his wild kick out at Victor Camarasa went unseen by referee Craig Pawson in the first half.
Kenedy did not even complete a single pass during the first 45 minutes, the first time that indignity has befallen a Premier League outfield player since Blackburn Rovers’ Nikola Kalinic against Birmingham City in March 2010.
