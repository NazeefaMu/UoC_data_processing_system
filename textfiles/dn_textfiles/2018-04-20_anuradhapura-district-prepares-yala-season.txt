Anuradhapura district prepares for Yala season

Around 78,514 hectares of paddy will be cultivated in the Yala season, said Anuradhapura Government Agent RM Wanninayake. According to the decisionstaken at the kanna meeting, the fields not cultivated with paddy will be used to grow additional food crops due to the scarcity of water.
The fertilizer subsidy will not be paid in cash; instead farmers could buy their fertilizer requirements from the 42 agrarian development centres in the Anuradhapura district. A 50 kg bag of fertilizer is sold at Rs. 500 which is a subsidised price. A farmer could buy urea, TSP, or MOP fertilizer under this programme on the recommendations of the agriculture research and production assistants. The government pays an enhanced price to buy fertilizer in order to offer the fertilizer at the subsidised rate of Rs. 500 per bag. It costs the government Rs. 3,400 per bag of urea, Rs. 3,300 per bag of MOP and Rs. 3,800 for one bag of TSP.
Farmers could purchase extra fertilizer from the open market at the rate of Rs. 1,500 per bag, which is also a subsidised price, Wanninayake emphasised further. He said that it has been estimated that 16,140 metric tons of urea, 3,919 mt of TSP and 4,314 mt of MOP are required during Yala 2018 in the Anuradhapura district.
The total commercial value of this consignment of fertilizer is Rs. 1,680 million. Anuradhapura fertilizer secretariat's assistant director Ajith Kumara said there are storage facilities for around 30,000 metric tons in Seeppukulama, Galenbindunuwewa, Negama, Nochchiyagama, Horowpothana, Medawachchiya and Kiralogama.
Speaking about the fertilizer subsidy paid in cash during the last two years, Kumara said that in Maha season 2016/17 for cultivating 50,665 hectares, Rs. 634 million was paid to 70,993 farmers and during 2017/18 Maha season, fertilizer subsidy worth Rs. 965 million was paid to 77,177 farmers.
He said further in Yala 2017 for 24,639 farmers, for cultivating 35,344 hectares, Rs. 313 million was paid in cash as the fertilizer subsidy.
