Priyanka Chopra makes it to Forbes' World's Most Powerful Women List 2017

The Quantico star has made it to Forbes' World's Most Powerful Women List 2017. Priyanka came #97 on the list, which featured Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, on the first spot and also included names like British PM Theresa May; American philanthropist Melinda Gates of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg; media personality Oprah Winfrey; Queen Elizabeth II; Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina Wajed; American politician Hillary Clinton; philanthropist and pediatrician Priscilla Chan; and The Huffington Post co-founder and editor-in-chief Ariana Huffington.
This is the first time Priyanka has made it to the list. Another first-timer is Ivanka Trump, who secured the 19th position.
Other entertainment personages on the list include singers Beyonce and Taylor Swift, J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame, who were all named in the 15 Most Powerful Women In Entertainment And Media list, released recently. Priyanka secured the last spot on this list.
In addition to Priyanka's recent strides in American movies — after making her Hollywood debut with Baywatch, she is set to star in two more movies, A Kid Like Jake and Isn't It Romantic? — she is currently featured in the third season of her American TV show Quantico, for which she's won two People's Choice Awards. She is also going to produce an American show based on the life of Madhuri Dixit.
Priyanka is also well known for her contributions as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.
Earlier this year, Forbes listed Bollywood's Top 10 Highest Paid Stars, and Priyanka was ranked #7. Priyanka, with earnings of $10 million, was the only other female star along with Deepika Padukone to have made it to the list.
