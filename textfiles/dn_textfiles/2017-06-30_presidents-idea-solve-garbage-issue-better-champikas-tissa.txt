President's idea to solve garbage issue better than Champika's: Tissa

 
Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Tissa Vitharana said that they request President Maithripala Sirisena to go ahead with his plan to solve the garbage issue in the country without giving in to Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Champika Ranawaka’s idea.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the President planned to use the bio-technical method to solve the garbage issue while Megapolis Minister planed to solve the issue by transporting garbage to Puttalam and dumping in pits.
According to Prof. Vitharana, the president's method saves money while offering several benefits to the country.
‘There is no need to transport garbage from one place to another but Minister Ranawaka’s plan will create another environmental issue with the time being. Transporting garbage to Puttalam is costly’ he said.
The Minister says that those who oppose President Sirisena’s idea will be traitors of the country and his plan will be implemented from 2019.
