Bar Association condemns aspersions cast on AG’s Department

 
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) today strongly condemned accusations levelled against the Attorney General’s Department in relation to its role at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond issue.
BASL President U.R. de Silva told a press conference in Colombo that accusations should come with evidence and materials through a proper forum, without causing damage to the Attorney General Department's reputation. 
“The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bond issue is vested with power to control the behaviour of any officials during the hearing. If anyone criticizes the Commission and Attorney General Department from outside, it would undermine the authoritative power of the Commission and public could lost their trust in the Attorney General Department,” he said. 
It is alleged that the officials of Attorney General Department aggressively questioned former Minister Ravi Karunanayake but were reluctant to prosecute large scale frauds committed during the previous regime.
BASL President U.R. de Silva however accepted the fact that there is a delay in the disposal of cases by the Attorney General.
