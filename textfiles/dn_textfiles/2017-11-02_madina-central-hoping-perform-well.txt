Madina Central hoping to perform well

Madina Central College Madawella is a school from Kandy District, housed at Bambarella Road, Madawala. It is 82 years old and gives a big hand for sports, mainly cricket, followed by athletics and football. They play their cricket big match against Al Azhar College Akurana, which is known as the “Battle of the Double Maroons”. It is the only big match between two Muslim schools in the country, which took off in the year 2008. It was stopped for a while due to a fight which occurred at the stadium when the match was in progress, and last year it was revived.
This school was founded by a revolutionary concept and a social worker, Abubakkar Lebbai Sayyadhu Mohammed on 2 December 1935, with 3 teachers and 36 students. A.K.Subramaniyam was the first principal and their first sport was athletics. It was a few years back they took to cricket.
Last year they gave their best despite playing in the lower division. This time they are all out to turn in a good performance.
This school has produced a top cricketer in M Siraj Sahab who won the Mobitel schoolboy cricketer in the silver division in 2014.
He is a right-arm speedster who played for Colts Cricket Club. In an under 23 inter provincial tournament, he was the fastest bowler putting fear into all the best batters, and had two five-wicket hauls and ended as the joint leading wicket taker in the tournament with 26 wickets from five games for Central Province XI helping the side to win U23 Champions trophy.
Once again the coaching department is handled by former Trinity College cricketer E. Mohammed Najime who is a qualified level I coach. He played for Kandy Youth SC, Madawela SC and Old Madina SC as a top all-rounder. He teaches the skills of cricket to individuals who have different abilities. He has the reputation of helping cricketers to reach their full potential. The school authorities, old boys of the school and parents of the cricketers believe he will be able to deliver this season. The MIC is Pasupathy Ganeshkumar who counts years of experience.
They are playing in the lower division and are all out to turn in a good performance, both with the bat and the ball.
This season promises to be an action packed season. However, it’s sad to say that last season they played only few games. Young cricketers after months of training had to be satisfied with few games.
This time they are pooled in the Division III. They are still to get the match schedule. This is how cricket is treated at the lower division. Who is to blame? Cricket is a popular sport here in Kandy, especially at school level it is a great team sport and players do get popular.
This time the side is led by M.R.M. Thareef (captain), left-arm pace bowler and right-handed batsman. He played for Central Province team for two seasons. He was considered as the best bowler of the Prima Cup championship two years back. He says, the boys are really working hard for the coming season, there are four pace bowlers and same number of spinners, the batting line-up is also good. All players are in good form and the coach is giving his best along with the MIC. His deputy is M.I.M Munshif, an off-spinner and left hand batsman.
The rest of the players at practices are M.F.M. Fazal, M.F.I. Inshaf, N.M. Yazer, Z.M. Zaharan, I.M. Shafir, M.F.M. Munshif, M.F.M. Sahl, M.K. Haridh, I.M. Imas, F.M. Musharaf, A.J.M. Ajmal, N.M.
