Police Headquarters on our lead story says...

Referring to our lead story yesterday, titled “IGP ordered to pay compensation to two JVPers”, Police Headquarters said that IGP N. K. Ilangakoon was not the head of the Police when the incident occurred in 2009.
As our lead story carrying a picture of the current IGP, the Police headquarters say it may convey a wrong message that IGP Illangakoon is personally responsible.
A statement from the Police adds that the court order refers to the designation (Inspector General of Police) and not any individual.
