The wait is over !

Murder, intrigue and lust are the potent ingredients in the film ‘According to Matthew’ directed by seasoned cinematic personality Chandran Rutnam.
The murder in the vicarage gripped the nation in the seventies when a priest of the Anglican faith, Father Matthew Peiris and his lover Dalrene Ingram were accused of murdering their respective spouses in their attempts to get together. The Vicarage of St. Paul’s Church in Punchi Borella was the venue where the double murder was systematically carried out by Father Matthew Peries with his mistress.
Father Peiris was a well known religious personality who not only dealt with matters of divinity but also those concerning the dark world of the occult.
Starring globally renowned personalities like Alston Koch and Jacqueline Fernandez, ‘According to Matthew’ English version and the Sinhala dubbed version will be screened at the CEL circuit centers including Regal, Majestic, Lido etc soon. It is a Taprobane Pictures production in association with Ceylon Theaters (Pvt) Limited.
