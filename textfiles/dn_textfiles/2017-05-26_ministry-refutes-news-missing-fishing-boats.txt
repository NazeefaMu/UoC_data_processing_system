Ministry refutes news on missing fishing boats

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry yesterday refuted news reports that 10 fishing boats which set out on a fishing expedition from Eravur had gone missing due to extreme weather conditions and said all fishing boats except two boats had returned to base.
This had been confirmed by fisheries officials on inquiry by the ministry.
However, there had been no reports about loss of lives following the two boats gone missing.
As soon as this incident was reported to Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, he directed officials to take action to rescue the fishermen in the missing boats. The Navy had swung into action to look for the missing persons. The minister has also thanked the Navy for deploying Dovra boats and Navy personnel for the rescue mission.
