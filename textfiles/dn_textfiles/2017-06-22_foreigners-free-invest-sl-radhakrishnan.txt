Foreigners free to invest in SL: Radhakrishnan

Foreigners need not be afraid to invest in Sri Lanka to uplift the livelihood of the flood-affected people and travel around Sri Lanka without any restrictions, said Education State Minister V. Radhakrishnan.
He said so speaking at the unveiling ceremony of the eight-foot Thiruvalluvar statue at Pillaiyarady at the Batticaloa Tamil Sangam premises, entrance of the Batticaloa town along the Batticaloa-Trincomalee highway, Tuesday evening.
Sixteen such statues were gifted to Sri Lanka by the VGP World Tamil Sangam President Dr. V.G.Santhosam. The ceremony was organized by Batticaloa Tamil Sangam and was presided over by M. Ganesharaja. He further said that to prove that foreigners could go about anywhere without any hindrance, he was taking the Indian Delegation around to various parts of the island where similar statues were unveiled.
This is a further step to promoting Indo-Sri Lankan relationship; by these there is enough potential for Indian culture, fine arts, music, theatre, dance and drama to influence Sri Lanka. The relationship between the Tamils of South India and Sri Lanka will be strengthened.
I appeal to investors to visit Sri Lanka and start ventures that will increase the livelihood facilities of the affected people in North and East. Replicas of the eight-foot statue were handed over to the Batticaloa District TNA Parliamentarians S. Srinesan, S. Yogeswaran, S. Viyalendran, Ampara District TNA Parliamentarian K. Kodeeswaran and Batticaloa District Government Agent P.S.M. Charles by Dr. Santhosam.
The organizers honoured the donor with a golden shall and mementos.
