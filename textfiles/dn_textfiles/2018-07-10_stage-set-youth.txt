Stage set for youth

Amal International School had the Annual Inter-House Drama Competition on a grand scale on June 21 at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort in the presence of the Principal M M Shazuli.
It was a wonderful experience for all concerned. All the four houses put outstanding performances. The three judges, Kaushalya Fernando (The veteran actress and director of several award winning theatrical productions), Shanuki De Alwis (A dramatist and also a leading animal rights activist), Pasan Ranaweera (A dramatist and also a popular comedian) were highly impressed with the performances.
Fernando appreciated the initiative taken by the school to enhance children's theatrical skills and abilities. She said that some schools focus mainly on book learning. The theme of this year's competition was 'Social Issues'. Azeez House emerged Champions for their drama on 'Street Children'. The Script was written by W M S Wickrama.
Tharangi and Ashini Wickramasinghe guided the team. Aadhil Osman was adjudged the Best Actor. Mushtaq, Ishaq, Asjad and Shabeer played key roles in the drama.
