Vallibel Finance upgrades Kalutara branch

Vallibel Finance, the trend-setting financial institution and the name-bearer of the Vallibel Group, relocated its branch in Kalutara to an upgraded customer-friendly centre.
Jayantha Rangamuwa, Managing Director of Vallibel Finance said that the company recognises the exponential potential of the Kalutara district which gives rise to a multi-faceted economy that constantly opens up opportunity from tourism to trade and manufacturing to agriculture. Even as he declared open the new operational hub, Rangamuwa said that the fully-integrated and modernized Kalutara branch was just the beginning of an era of renewed commitment to an area that demands financial products tailor-made to its ground realities.
We pride ourselves in being a finance company that truly understands the pulse of people and the important thing is, even in a small country, business culture and ways of people can be quite diverse from one area to another. That’s why we have our ear to the ground, offering exactly what people demand, Rangamuwa said.
Vallibel Finance continues to take firm roots across the country and its forays on the pinnacle of success have ensured its place in LMD’s top 100 companies in Sri Lanka.
