NCM against Ravi meant to send strong signal to Govt. - Dinesh

The main purpose of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was meant to send a strong warning signal to the government and that purpose was achieved successfully, MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday. He said the Joint Opposition (JO) had no hope of winning it, but, used the debate to expose the the government’s financial mismanagement.
“Forty eight NCM’s had been presented to the Sri Lankan Parliament, but only two had been successful. However, during the debate of the NCM, some of the Government ministers were also on the same page with us on some of the issues we pointed out. The Government did not receive the support of the JVP and TNA.
“Eventhough the Government defeated the motion, they did not go home with a relaxed mind,” he said. He also pointed out that the Government failed to find the two-thirds majority in Parliament to defeat the motion.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said the JO could accomplish four main purposes from the NCM. They were exposing the corruption, fraud and inefficiency of the Finance Minister, exposing the dual role of the SLFPers supporting the Government, exposing the TNA for nor performing the role of the main Opposition and creating a new culture where the JO and JVP can work together.
MP Bandula Gunawardena said the Government had so far released over USD 4 billion to the market to maintain the value of the rupee at 148 compared to the dollar.
“The total amount of the IMF loan was USD 1.5 billion. This is nothing compared to the seriousness of the foreign exchange issue. The foreigners who invested in state treasury bills are withdrawing their money. Over the past one and half years the foreigners had withdrawn Rs 153 billion,” he said.
The MP further said there was information that the data on the Central Bank computers was going to be deleted to conceal the Treasury Bond scam. He said CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran should be responsible for these issues, adding that many in the Government itself including the President are of the view that Mahendran should be removed.
