Appreciations

M. H. M. Ashraff:
Awakened the East
Ashraff did a yeoman service to elevate the Colombo Port as one of the best in Asia. He rapidly started reforms in the harbour once he took charge of the ministry. The minister established a marine training institution at Oluvil and planned to construct a harbour. His gift of a lighthouse at Oluvil majestically stands to give a ray of hope to the unemployed youth of the region. No Muslim leader will be cherished and remembered as Ashraff due to his achievements at the South Eastern University
It is almost 18 years since the late Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader M. H. M. Ashraff left us never to return.
Leaders are born everywhere in the world and the services rendered by them for the good of their community are many. Although such services are remembered by the people now and then, all their names would not forever become historical as that of the late SLMC Founder Leader Minister Ashraff, whose 18th commemoration was held on September 16.
Ashraff’s qualities of leadership and respect for bureaucracy developed loyalty and team spirit. He was a kindhearted, sensitive and highly emotional personality, always with a ready smile and kind word, never failing to greet his staff, colleagues and his people at least with a smile.
At the same time, he was a leader who wanted things to be done correctly and was a stickler for accurate details. Ashraff was a deeply religious man and would commence nothing without remembering the Almighty and seeking his guidance and blessings.
He played a constructive role to install former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga. Ashraff became a minister. The late SLMC Leader will be long remembered by every citizen as he strengthened the hands of the former President in her efforts to find a meaningful solution to the ethnic conflict.
Ashraff saw as nobody did before him, the political potential of the Eastern province with its predominantly Muslim population. Before his advent, Muslim politicians aligned themselves with the two major political parties - the UNP and the SLFP. He was no doubt permitted by the waves of radicalism then sweeping across the Islamic world and the growing power of the Arab States.
Late M. H. M. Ashraff, LLM P.C, Cabinet Minister of Ports, Shipping, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, Member of Parliament and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and National Unity Alliance Founder Leader, died on September 2000 while on his way to Ampara in an Air Force helicopter which crashed in a blaze of flames in Aranayake. It is almost 18 years since he left us never to return.
Ashraff was a man with a golden heart. A great and worthy son of the Eastern province, he was born in Sammanthurai. He was indeed not born with the proverbial silver spoon but at the time of his untimely death, he had established himself as a silver lining in the political establishment of this country.
He was the only son of Mohamed Hussain, a highly respected village headman, and Matheena Ummah whom he loved dearly. Being a son of the Eastern soil, he had his primary education at Kalmunai Weley High School and thus in his formative years, developed a strong bond with the Tamils. He had to leave his home region to pursue further studies at the metropolis.
In 1970, he joined the Law College where he excelled and manifested prowess in the field of Constitutional Law by writing the first book on Constitutional Law in Tamil with particular reference to 1972 Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka. At the Ceylon Law College, the natural nursery of many a political leader, he was the President of the Law Students Muslim Majils and of the Tamil Mantram and was an influential member of the student community, nearly missing the coveted position of President of the Law Students Union.
In 1974, he joined the Attorney General’s Department as a State Counsel and worked there to get himself acquainted with the law to become an eminent lawyer. He practiced in Kalumai and Batticaloa. He completed the Master’s Degree in Law prior to becoming a senior minister. He was honoured with title President's Counsel.
People, particularly in the Eastern province, reaped the whirlwind Ashraff for he gave them what no other leader has given them in such a short period. The late Minister Ashraff was first and foremost a humane person. But he had a strong will and sense of justice which spurred him to give his people their just in the political, social and economic firmament. The Late Minister Ashraff entered Parliament in 1989. He formed the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. As the leader of the party, he extended his cooperation to the Late President R. Premadasa, although he was in the opposition. He maintained a cordial relationship with the President to win back the rights of the Muslim community. Ashraff never tolerated injustice and discrimination meted out to minorities.
His dedicated efforts have transformed his home district of Ampara from a backward, rural district into a fairly developed area, moving rapidly towards modernism. He single-handedly dedicated to establishing the South Eastern University, which will be recorded in letters of gold. His struggle to obtain the rights of Muslims had much success during the last six years.
He had a vast following among the Muslim people who appreciated his vision, the immense sacrifices he made for their cause and his sincerity of purpose. A good administrator should be a good human being. Despite all the knowledge and techniques of administration and management, one cannot be a good administrator unless one has good qualities coupled with attractive talents in ample measure. He did not cultivate these qualities but they were part of his nature. His experience in the political field enriched his administrative acumen and came in handy. The Eastern Province saw development through the late Leader Ashraff in a short period of six years.
Ashraff did a yeoman service to elevate the Colombo Port as one of the best in Asia. He rapidly started reforms in the harbour once he took charge of the ministry. The minister established a marine training institution at Oluvil and planned to construct a harbour. His gift of a lighthouse at Oluvil majestically stands to give a ray of hope to the unemployed youth of the region. No Muslim leader will be cherished and remembered as Ashraff due to his achievements at the South Eastern University.
Ferial Ashraff, his spouse and former Minister of Housing Construction was always in the background. Then suddenly with his tragic death, she was pushed into that same arena of politics and now she had retired from politics. Aman Ashraff is their only son who follows in his father’s footsteps.
May Allah bless him! Jennathul Firdhouse Ameen!
Ashraff A. Samad

Rev. Fr. Dr. J. Alex Ranasinghe 
Guiding light
He was a man of learning, proficient in Asian history and imbibed with high principles and lofty ideals. He always had a deep sense of the dignity of his vocation. He had a knack  for making friends, cultured always, bright and cheerful. He was indeed one of the delightful companions who kept company with his ready wit and humour
It is 32 years since Rev. Dr. J. Alex Ranasinghe entered eternal glory to be with his maker. September 21 was his death anniversary.
He was at the Priest Residence, St. Joseph Church Uyana, Moratuwa. He was a former resident of the church from 1981 to 1985. Rev. Fr. was a dedicated pastor, erudite scholar and educationist - all of which have harmoniously blended admirably in the life of Rev. Fr. Dr. Ranasinghe. Cherished memories of this lovable personality linger in my mind as I contribute these lines in appreciation of him.
He was a man of learning, proficient in Asian history and imbibed with high principles and lofty ideals. He always had a deep sense of the dignity of his vocation. He had a knack for making friends, cultured always, bright and cheerful. He was indeed one of the delightful companions who kept company with his ready wit and humour.
The poor and needy, within and outside his parish, benefited from his munificence, irrespective of caste, creed or race. He was always at the service of the people, regardless of time. From my personal knowledge of him, I am aware that he was a source of comfort and solace for the sick, the possessed and the bereaved.
Every Wednesday and Friday, crowds gathered at his Mission House to seek his prayers and blessing. He prayed for the sick, exorcised the possessed and obtained for them relief and solace.
Father Alex held a double doctorate in education and anthropology from the Catholic University of Washington DC. He also served as a delegate at the UNO and UNESCO, bringing credit to Sri Lanka.
He also served as a lecturer for Asian students in the graduate school of the University of Santo Thomas in Manila. While in the USA, he served as a Professor and Chaplain at the Ohio University in Athena, Ohio. Later, he served as a priest at the immaculate conception church in Yuma, Arizona. He was also the prime cover of the Yuma area Greater Ministerial Association.
In appreciation of his laudable services in Yuma Arizona, James P. Dayo, the Mayor proclaimed July 22, 1971, as 'Father Alex Day'.
Let me wind up my tribute to dear pastor and guide with these lines:
“ln faithful service at Duty's call
He shepherds his flock one and all,
A guiding light, a helping hand,
A mind that ever did understand,
Making life's path easy always in his inimitable way.”

Carina Antoinette Maryanne Corea: 
Caring hostess
She was initially employed as an assistant in the Economics Research Unit of the Daily News and was later appointed a Sub-Editor of the Ceylon Observer
Carina Antoinette Maryanne Corea was the only child of the late Dr. and Mrs. de Sampayo. She was popularly known as ‘Toni’ by all.
Toni was born on October 23, 1934. She had her early education in several government schools because her father was a transferable government servant. She completed her education at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya and entered the Ceylon University where she studied for two years.
She was initially employed as an assistant in the Economics Research Unit of the Daily News and was later appointed a Sub-Editor of the Ceylon Observer.
She subsequently went on vacation to the United Kingdom, where she met and married her husband Malcolm Corea in the early sixties. She followed a course in textile designing in the UK. They returned to Sri Lanka in 1969 and Mr. Corea passed away in 2006.
For many years, Malcolm and Toni were cared for by a long and caring couple. Since Malcolm and Toni had no children, they adopted two boys, Suresh and Prakash, whom they cared for like their own children, and had them educated at St. Peter’s College, Colombo.
Toni was a soft-spoken, gentle, compassionate, caring and loving person. She was always meticulously dressed and visitors were always welcomed to her home at Lucky Plaza.
On the morning of her demise, we were summoned to her home as she had been quite restless and in pain from the early hours of the morning. However, by the time we rushed to see her, Toni had already breathed her last and had passed away peacefully. We at Lucky Plaza are going to miss Toni very much indeed.
May her soul rest in peace and rise in glory!

Dr. Shanmuganathan: 
Brilliant doctor
Dr. Shanmuganathan was awarded B.Sc (Special Degree) with First Class Honours in 1950 from the University of Ceylon.
He was a recipient of the Bhikaji Framji Khan Gold Medal for the best performance at the Special Degree examination in Chemistry, University of Ceylon. He joined the Medical Research Institute (MRI) in 1951 and proceeded to Sheffield University U.K. for his Ph.D. He returned to Sri Lanka and assumed duties at the Biochemistry Section of the MRI.
It was felt that middle-level technical personnel in many institutions do not have opportunities for further education and training. Dr. Shanmuganathan recognized this gap and pioneered the initiation of the Laboratory Technician Certificate Course (LTTC) in 1972. Subsequently, this was upgraded to a Diploma in Laboratory Technology in Chemistry (DLTC). This course was conducted at Aquinas College of Higher Education until it was moved to the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon building, “Adamantane House” at Rajagiriya.
As a tribute to Dr. Shanmuganathan, I am pleased that the annual intake for this course is over 100. The course assists private sector laboratory personnel to obtain training and qualification for accreditation of the respective laboratory for accreditation under ISO/IEC 17025.
Dr. Shanmuganathan was a visiting lecturer in Biochemistry at the University of Ceylon. In the academic year 1969/1970, he supervised my seminar topic which was on “Colorimetry”. At that time, this was a new topic because the laboratory courses were on gravimetry and titrimetry only. He requested me to carry out references at the library of MRI. After the seminar presentation, I was inspired by Dr. Shanmuganathan and interested in practicing colorimetry with my colleague Dr. S. Hettiarachchi. We found an old Hilger machine at the Physical Chemistry Laboratory. We tried to obtain colorimetric results but failed. We went to CISIR and mentioned our failure to Dr. M. A. V. Devanathan and he said the machine is a fluorimeter and not a colorimeter!
May lord rest his soul in peace!
