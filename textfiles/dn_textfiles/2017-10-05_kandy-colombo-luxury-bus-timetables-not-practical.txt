Kandy-Colombo luxury bus timetables not practical

It is not practical to operate buses according to the timetables given by the Chairman of the National Transport Commission. Both bus owners and commuters will fall into difficulties if buses are operated according to them, Chairman Kandy-Colombo Luxury Bus Services Company Newton Pieris said.
Addressing a press conference held at Devon Rest, Kandy, Peiris said, timetables were prepared by obtaining the services of a group of people devoid of practical knowledge on bus operations and buses could not be operated according to such impractical timetables. He said, according to the new timetable, a luxury bus leaving Colombo at 5.15 am should reach Kandy at 8.30 am and it should be parked in the bus terminal at 9 am to start the return journey to Colombo at 9.20 am.
Accordingly, a bus should cover the Colombo-Kandy trip in 3 hours and 13 minutes and only half an hour is available for the bus crew to have breakfast and morning ablutions. This was quite impractical and the Commission Chairman tried to dodge questions after introducing impractical timetables.
Although an appointment was sought from the Chairman through Higher Education and Highways Minister to discuss matters, there had been no response from him on two such occasions.
Even though finally an opportunity for a discussion was given last week, the Chairman ended up avoiding it too saying he had no time.
Pieris alleged that the Commission Chairman had been so vicious as to lodge a false complaint of assault against bus owners to Police and take them to Court. Pieris said, the Commission Chairman should take responsibility if commuters faced any accident when drivers operated under pressure according to the present timetable.
