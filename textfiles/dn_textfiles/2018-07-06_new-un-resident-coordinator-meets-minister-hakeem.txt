New UN Resident Coordinator meets Minister Hakeem

Newly-appointed United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator Terence D. Jones met with Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem at his ministerial office on Wednesday. Minister Hakeem congratulated Jones on assuming his office and expressed his views on the post-war Transitional Justice process in Sri Lanka during the discussion.
He also made special reference to the recent spate of violence against the Muslims in Ampara and Digana, the weak law and order measures that encourage impunity in such instances and the legislative measures on curbing hate speech.
UN Reconciliation and Development Adviser Gita Sabharwal was also present at the meeting.
