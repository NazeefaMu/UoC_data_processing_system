PM says he will not reject referendum

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would inform the Mahanayakes and leaders of other religions that he could not reject a referendum.
The Premier also said that Buddhism would be prioritized and the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), including President Maithripala Sirisena, had unanimously decided not to make any changes to the Constitution that would adversely affect Buddhism.
Wickremesinghe was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the Eluthur Water Supply Project yesterday (7).
