Schools Big-Matches 2016

Most of this year's big matches that commence in the latter part of February and go on till the beginning of April will no doubt be fiercely contested due to the high quality of cricket played in the ongoing U19 tournaments.This season's U19 inter-school tournaments, preliminary league rounds of which, are already completed will be a yardstick to measure the strengths of teams involved in this year's big-matches.
Bat and ball equally dominated in this year's U19 competition with three batsmen completing 1000 runs though no bowler is reported to have completed 100 wickets. In the group matches played in U19 D1, D11 and D111 tournaments this year, four double hundreds,124 centuries, 392 five to seven-wicket hauls and 13 eight or more-wicket hauls recorded, after the completion of the first rounds of such tournaments.The strength of key teams mostly in Colombo and suburbs will be higher with the advent of the SL youth world cup squad back into their respective big-match teams.
