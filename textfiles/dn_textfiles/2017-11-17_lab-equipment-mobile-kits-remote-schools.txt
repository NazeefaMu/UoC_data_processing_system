Lab equipment mobile kits for remote schools

Ministry of Education has made arrangements to provide mobile kits of laboratory equipment to 3,000 remote schools in the country to assist rural students to study science and technology subjects conveniently.
These selected schools are not yet provided with well-equipped labs for their students’ studies at present. Hence, when Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was contacted yesterday, he told Daily News that for Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala a sum of Rs. 450 million has been allocated for this project by the government. These kits of lab equipment would assist students to do their practical tests and study the subjects properly to sit for their G.C.E. O/L and A/L Examinations with confidence.
As a result, 448 remote schools in the Western Province, 440 schools in the Central Province, 306 schools in the Southern Province, 249 schools in the Northern Province, 322 schools in the Eastern Province, 403 schools in the North Western Province, 173 schools in the North Central Province, 249 schools in the Uva Province, and 410 schools in the Sabaragamuwa Province are to get these kits of studies, Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
