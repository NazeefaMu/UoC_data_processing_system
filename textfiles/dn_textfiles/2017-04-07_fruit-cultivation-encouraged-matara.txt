Fruit cultivation encouraged in Matara

A programme is underway in the Matara district to encourage farmers to engage in fruit cultivation.
Weligama,Welipitiya, Marlimbada, Akuressa, Pasgoda, and Devinuwara were identified for the purpose.
Pineapple, papaw, passion fruit, cashew, rambutan, durian, banana, citrus and yam will be grown under the programme. Coconut trees infected with leaf withering disease and abandoned rubber plantation will be cut down and those land will be taken for the new fruit plantation, sources said.
The Matara District Secretariat Planning Division leads the project, the sources said.
Regional fruit farmers will be supported with relevant knowledge, equipment and financial aid for them to carry out the project without obstructions, the sources said.
