Court rejects former Litro Gas Chairman’s request to go overseas

The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday rejected a request made by Litro Gas former Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe, to travel Canada for medical purpose.
The CID had filed a B report in the Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court regarding four suspects including Litro Gas former Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to their personal account in Sri Lanka.
While turning down the request made by Shalil Munasinghe, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne observed that the suspect's request cannot be considered at this juncture.
On October 6, the CID had arrested the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni of Rajagiriya regarding the incident when he was attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account. The second suspect Shalila Moonasinghe was arrested on October 9, on the charge of misappropriating Rs.30 million. He is currently out on bail.
According to CID reports, the Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.
