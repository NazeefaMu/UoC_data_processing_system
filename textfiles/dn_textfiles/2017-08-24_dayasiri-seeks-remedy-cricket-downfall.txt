Dayasiri seeks remedy for cricket downfall

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has invited all those involved in cricket to a seminar on ways to improve the future of Sri Lanka cricket.
As Sri Lanka cricket stumbles, the minster addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing said it is time for all stakeholders to put aside their personal differences and come together to rebuild the team.
A committee consisting of National Sports Council chairman - Milton Amarasinghe (Chair), Prof. Ranjith Bandara (Colombo University), Saman Bandara (DG - Sports Development Department) and Dr. Lakshman Edirisinghe (DG - Sports Medicine Institute) are to precede over the discussion. The seminar is expected to be organized within the next two weeks.
The minister has invited former SLC chairman, former SLC Interim Committee chairman, former national cricket captains, senior sports journalists, national selectors, national coaches, and some renown sports personalities such as; Daya Ratnayake, Dayan Gomez, Manilal Fernando, Palitha Fernando, Hemasiri Fernando and heads of district and provincial cricket associations to take part in the discussion.
"We hope to have discussions on 10 main themes and we will also discuss reasons for the recent downfall and possible solutions. At the end of it a report of all suggestions will be compiled and presented to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, said the Sports Minister.
He asked all those involved to attend the discussion instead of airing out their personal opinions through the media or in other forms.
"I do not interfere with cricket but as the final decision maker, I too have certain responsibilities to resolve the issue. So lets all get together and talk about the issue," said Jayasekara as he made clear that the invitation is not from the Sri Lanka Cricket Board chairman but from the Sports Minister.
