MullenLowe, Quantum to reveal Top 10 consumer  trends for 2018 at CIM Talking Point

Leading integrated communications agency MullenLowe Sri Lanka and premier consumer behaviour specialists company Quantum Consumer Services are set to present a list of key consumer trends that marketers should look out for in 2018 at the CIM “Talking Point” forum to be held on January 29 at the Hilton Colombo Residences (JAIC Hilton).
Abhishek Hariharan, Associate Vice President and Head of Strategic Planning, MullenLowe Sri Lanka and Chitrangani Herat Gunaratne, Senior Consultant, Quantum Consumer Services will be elaborating on these trends which highlight some expected shifts in consumer behaviour that are set to have an impact on how brands interact with their consumers in the year ahead.
The research was born from MullenLowe Sri Lanka’s acute understanding of market and consumer trends and Quantum’s extensive experience in researching human behaviour. MullenLowe works across multiple categories giving them the width and knowledge they need to plot trends and converting them into communications that engage consumers in a unique and exciting way.
Quantum has extensive experience in the identification of deep human truths and its translation into brand strategy.
The collective expertise and the collaborative nature of these two organizations have made this release possible which can immensely help brands and organizations in 2018.
These trends are the result of hours of work by the two organizations analysing data and arriving at predictive summaries. The continued rise of technology, a changing consumer culture and priorities that occurred through 2017 will influence the way consumers make choices this year and these trends reflect those possible changes.
Commenting on the release of the 10 trends for 2018, Thayalan Bartlett, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MullenLowe Sri Lanka, said, “The process of intrinsic understanding of people's behaviours, their values, including the way they think and eventually act in engaging with products and services is an integral part of our communication process. The subtlest of shifts could impact brands, positively and negatively by the millions in a very short time. We are pleased to be working with Quantum on these predictive trends for 2018 which will benefit brands through this year.”
Roshani Fernando, Partner, Quantum Consumer Solutions said, “All trends have two sides to it, we see its manifestation in terms of particular behaviours. It is important to realise that these behaviours are rooted in deeper anxieties, where the behaviour is a coping mechanism or is a means of realizing an aspiration. We at Quantum are committed to enabling brands build genuine empathy triggers.”
