Thabbowa sluice gates opened

Since the water level of the Thabbowa Reservoir has exceeded 17 feet, six of its sluice gates have been opened to discharge excess water into the Puttalam lagoon through the Mee Oya, a spokesman for the Irrigation Department said. He said water is gushing out of the sluice gates at 1,328 cubic feet per second.
If more sluice gates were opened, villages around the banks of the Mee Oya lower reaches would be inundated. As such, they had taken precautions to release water from the reservoir in a manner that would not inconvenience the people.
