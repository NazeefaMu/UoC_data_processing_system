Bill empowering crime witnesses living abroad

The Government presented a Bill to amend the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witness Act to enable a victim or witness to give evidence or make a statement from any location outside Sri Lanka.
The Bill was presented for the first reading by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
According to the bill, “if any evidence or statement of any victim of crime or witness is to be recorded from any remote location outside Sri Lanka, it shall be recorded at the Sri Lankan diplomatic mission in the country from where such victim of crime or witness seeks to testify or make the statement”.
This is the first amendment brought to the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witness Act which the Government enforced in March 2015.
