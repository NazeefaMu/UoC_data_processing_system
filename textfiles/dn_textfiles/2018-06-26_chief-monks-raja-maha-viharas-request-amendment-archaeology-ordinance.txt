The purpose of this meeting was to discuss issues relating to the conservation of elements of archaeological value in these temples, as well as development activities in them. The Minister stressed that conservation of the ancient archaeological elements of these temples must take place systematically and expeditiously. The Minister gave necessary directions to the relevant officials in this regard. He stressed that these activities must take place under the supervision of the Archaeological Department and said that the necessary funds will be made available without delay.
