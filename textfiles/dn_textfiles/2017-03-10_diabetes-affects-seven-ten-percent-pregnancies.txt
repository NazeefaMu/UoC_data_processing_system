Diabetes affects seven to ten percent of pregnancies

Sri Lanka has excellent health indicators, but diabetes has affected seven to ten percent of pregnancies. Around 70 percent of them are gestational diabetes, Health Services acting Director General Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing the media at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said the marriageable age of Sri Lankan women has come down to 23, but women who expect to become pregnant should get themselves screened for diabetes and other Non Communicable Diseases.
According to Dr. Bandara, the maternal death rate in Sri Lanka has come down to 33 deaths per every 100,000, but infants with congenital defects can be born to mothers with uncontrolled diabetes.
Meanwhile, Health Education Bureau sources said the prevalence of diabetes in Sri lanka is around 10.3 percent. When a pregnant mother gets diabetes, the chance of developing the disease in her in next five to 10 years is 50 percent, the sources said.
