Hooch dealers nabbed

Twelve suspects who pleaded guilty to the charges of possessing hooch, illegally manufactured liquor and spirits were fined Rs. 72,000 by Matara Chief Magistrate and Additional District Judge Uresha de Silva. Illegal liquor, equipment utilized for the manufacture of illicit brew and spirits seized during the raids were produced in Court as case productions by excise sleuths.
The Magistrate ordered them to be destroyed. Excise officials made these arrests during mobile operations and sudden raids carried out in Weligama, Ibbawala, Kananke and Malimbada areas in the excise division of Matara.
