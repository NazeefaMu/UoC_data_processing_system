President’s measures to mitigate fraud and corruption praised

United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera praised the measures taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to mitigate fraud and corruption, especially to end monetary irregularities by appointing the Special Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue.
“People in the country may not place their trust in Commissions unless the President appointed the Presidential Commission,” he said.
Amaraweera was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
Apart from Minister Amaraweera, several other senior SLFPers including Ministers Sarath Amunugama, Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Faizer Musthapa and Northern Provincial Governor Reginold Cooray also praised the measures taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a special Presidential Commission to look into the Treasury Bond issue.
Minister Amaraweera added that a proper mechanism should be implemented aiming to protect the Treasury.
He further said the report on the Treasury Bond issue, indirectly signifies that there should be such a mechanism so as to protect the Treasury and moreover not allowing anyone to misuse the Treasury and public assets.
“They all added that appointing the special Presidential Commission is a novel feature in the country’s political arena. Moreover, it can be considered as a forward and fruitful measure to end corruption,” he said.
“It is significant that people are not familier with such a powerful and impartial Presidential Commission, which investigates into allegations without considering the positions of anyone.
“For the first time in the country’s history, the Commission has suggested that any losses be claimed from the responsible parties,” Amaraweera said.
As per the directives of the Commission further action will be taken by the relevant parties. However, the progress of the process will be monitored by a panel lead by the Secretary to the President.
Minister Amaraweera further said financial malpractices and fraud that had taken place from 2008 should be investigated.
“Considering this situation, the commission has given directives on how the Central Bank Governor should be appointed in future,” he said.
“Another Commission to inquire into Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Airlines will be appointed by the President in future,” Amaraweera noted.
Minister Sarath Amunugama said it is needed to inquire into financial irregularities that had taken place from 2008 in relating to the Treasury.
