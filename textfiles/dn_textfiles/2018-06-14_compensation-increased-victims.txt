Communal clashes in  Aluthgama and Beruwela
Compensation increased for victims

The government has decided to increase the compensation provided to those affected during the communal clashes in Aluthgama and Beruwela in 2014.
An additional Rs. 185.9 million was approved in principle by the Cabinet for this purpose.
A Cabinet paper submitted by Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan pointed out that while the government had provided the affected families with the maximum amount of compensation under existing regulations, a Special Assessment Committee appointed by the District Secretary has recommended that household and other equipment which were not covered by the previous schemes be also covered.
