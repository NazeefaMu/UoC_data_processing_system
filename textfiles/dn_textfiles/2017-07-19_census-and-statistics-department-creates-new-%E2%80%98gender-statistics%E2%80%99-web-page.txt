Census and Statistics Department creates new ‘Gender Statistics’ web page

Considering the current demand for gender disaggregated data and the convenience of date users, the Department of Census and Statistics has created a new web page named 'Gender Statistics' in the departmental website www.statistics.gov.lk. This enables data users to access publications containing gender disaggregated data that had been published by the department so far.
Gender disaggregated data on the six main themes, Population, Education, Health and Nutrition, Economic Contribution and Public Life and Special Concerns, can be accessed from this web page.
The main sources of data for this web site are Censuses and Surveys conducted by the department. In addition, data collected by external institutions, administrative data of external institutions and data published by those institutions are also made available in this web page. The objective of the Department in creating this new web page is to provide data users easy access to data disaggregated by gender pertaining to various sectors since the year 1995.
