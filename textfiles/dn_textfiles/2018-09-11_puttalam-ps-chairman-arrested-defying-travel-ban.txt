Puttalam PS Chairman arrested for defying travel ban

Puttalam Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman Anjana Sandaruwan was arrested by the Immigration Officers at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday while attempting to travel overseas despite a travel ban being imposed on him by court.
Speaking to the Daily News the Police Media Spokesman’s office said that the Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman had been handed over to the CID and was questioned by them and later released. However, as the travel ban was imposed by Court, he was not allowed to travel abroad and had been asked to obtain court permission prior to leaving the country.
The travel ban had been imposed against the PS Chairman by the Puttalam High Court over a case pertaining to the murder of a person in 2010.
The incident had occurred on January 16, 2010 where a person had been shot dead in the Madurankulama area in Puttalam.
