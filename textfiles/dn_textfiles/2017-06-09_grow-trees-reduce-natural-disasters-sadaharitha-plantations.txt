Grow trees to reduce natural disasters - Sadaharitha Plantations

Sri Lanka is desperately trying to find solutions to prevent floods and drought that have had catastrophic consequences for the people living in the affected areas.
However, the answer is actually quite simple. Commercial Forestry will significantly help to reduce natural disasters that come in the wake of torrential monsoon rains.
The green canopy will also prevent the ground from becoming dry and arid when the rains cease and there is a long dry spell.
BBC recently announced that according to new research, planting trees around rivers would reduce flooding by at least 20%.
Planting trees round a feeder stream can slow the rush of rainwater and save properties from flooding. The report - from the universities of Birmingham and Southampton - says that with increased building on flood plains and climate change increasing the risk of heavy rain, many places cannot be completely protected by walls of concrete.
While this research finding does not have direct relevance to Sri Lanka, Sadaharitha Plantations, the leaders in commercial forestry in the country, would encourage landowners to invest in growing forests as a means of investment that will prove to be lucrative in many years to come while helping to safeguard the environment.
The company recently invited landowners in the low country wet zone area where the climate is conducive to commercial forestry to team up with it, if they have over five acres to invest, in areas such as Kandy, Kurunegala, Kegalle, Ratnapura, Galle, Matara, Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara.
In return, Sadaharitha Plantations will provide free plants, technical support and advisory services including the company’s patented ‘CA Kit’ that helps agarwood trees to develop the sought-after resin required by perfume manufacturers in the world.
Once a landowner signs a memorandum of understanding and enters into a joint venture with Sadaharitha Plantations, the advantages that are in store for the investor includes the value of the land increasing considerably, together with a high return on the investment in a period of eight years as the company will help to harvest the forest as well as utilise the export potential of the harvested resin to the maximum.
“This unusual opportunity is offered at the request of several investors of agarwood forests who see the potential commercial forestry has for Sri Lanka. At Sadaharitha, we have our own forestry lands; yet the production is not enough to cater to the demand in the international market.
Therefore we are confident that landowners with lands in the low country wet zone areas will welcome this lucrative opportunity that helps to promote a clean and healthy country in an environmentally friendly manner while boosting Sri Lanka’s economy,” said the Chairman of Sadaharitha, Sathish Navarathna.
Sadaharitha Plantations is the only company in the country with expertise and passion to promote commercial forestry. It has over 2,000 acres of forestry with over 26,000 customers and will soon be celebrating 15 years of establishing the business of commercial forestry in Sri Lanka.
