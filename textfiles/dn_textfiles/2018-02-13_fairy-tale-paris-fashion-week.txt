A fairy tale from  Paris Fashion Week

The aesthetic of Ralph and Russo, the only extant British haute couture house, can be summed up as dresses in which to marry a prince. So while Kylie Minogue sat front row between the supermodels Karlie Kloss and Natalia Vodianova, and despite the actors Lupita Nyong’o, Tracee Ellis Ross and Allison Williams wearing the label on the red carpet at the Screen Actors Guild on Sunday evening, the most significant name currently linked with the brand belonged to a certain Meghan Markle, who was nowhere to be seen. Perhaps Markle, who sparked rumours of a Ralph and Russo wedding dress when she chose the brand for her official engagement photo, is one of the brand’s 1.7 million social media followers. If so, she will have seen the show’s finale, an off-white duchess satin gown with a draped bodice, long train encrusted with leaves of Swarovski crystals and lace veil embroidered with silk petals.
Ralph and Russo is sole heir to the grand British couture tradition of Hardy Amies and Norman Hartnell. The designers Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo moved from their native Australia to London, where the business has been one of British fashion’s biggest success stories since it opened in 2007. They now employ more than 400 people, with a townhouse in Mayfair for client fittings and a large atelier where the embroidery department alone is 30-strong. Angelina Jolie wore a Ralph and Russo suit to Buckingham Palace when she was presented with her honorary damehood by the Queen.
Its many devoted clients desire fairytale, so that was exactly what the Paris show delivered: dreamy fantasies in frothy mint organza, blush pink silk gazar and ice blue Chantilly lace, and bombshell gowns in black velvet and metallic satin. There is no pandering to practical details at Ralph & Russo. Sleeves are largely absent, unless made from fine-spun silk fringing, and the few coats to be found are fashioned from ostrich feathers, or sheer tulle.
