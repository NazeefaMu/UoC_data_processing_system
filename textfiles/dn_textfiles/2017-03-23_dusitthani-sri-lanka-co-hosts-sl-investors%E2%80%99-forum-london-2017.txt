DusitThani Sri Lanka co-hosts  SL Investors’ Forum London 2017

DusitThani Sri Lanka co-hosted “DusitThani Sri Lanka Investors’ Forum London 2017” at the Grange City Hotel, London along with Real Estate Intelligence Unit (RIU) the premier research and consultancy firm for many of the top corporations in the U.K, Sri Lanka and in many of the major cities in Asia.
Roshan Madawela, CEO and Director from RIU opened the event giving an overview of the Sri Lankan economy which was backed-up by extensive research and evidence provided in a Power Point presentation.
Ajit Wijesinghe, Director of Indola Group, the Developers for the DusitThani project addressed the audience of 80 plus people, mentioning how he was inspired to start this project and the benefits it gives for investors.
Declan McNaughton, CEO of Indola Group drilled down into the project details further, presenting why this new concept of investment apartments in Sri Lanka is such a good opportunity.
Many Sri Lankan expatriates liked the idea of investing in their Mother Country and especially in a luxury brand, 5-star project that gives them a Freehold Title.
The opportunity to own a beachfront apartment, whilst earning a guaranteed 6% nett per annum that is paid in US$ seemed an opportunity not to be missed. Added to that, the fact that the apartment Owners can enjoy 21 days free stay per annum, appealed to all as they could use it during the time to visit family back home.
“With the unique investment opportunity DusitThani Sri Lanka provides, we have come across a large amount of interest from foreign buyers giving them the best investment option. The Beachfront takes Sri Lanka's luxury five-star living," said Ajit Wijesinghe.
DusitThani Sri Lanka is the one and only, luxury, high-rise beachfront apartments located on the West Coast of Sri Lanka that foreigners can legally buy.
It is a perfect combination of opportunity, location, luxury and return on investment.
The Beachfront is located on 500 meters of absolute pristine beachfront and every apartment will feature a large private balcony, five-star designer interiors and stunning, uninterrupted ocean views. Apartments are priced from US$244,000.
There are three Stages of construction and Stage one has just started and will be completed by the first quarter of 2019.
Tower B of Stage 1 has already sold and sales for Tower A are flourishing. Stage two will consist of 15 international restaurants, cafes, bars, luxury spa, sauna and gymnasium and Stage three will be another two Towers of investment apartments. The Directors and staff of Indola have been very active promoting their project to interested investors in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Russia. DusitThani will hold its next forum in Toronto, Canada on April 2, 2017.
