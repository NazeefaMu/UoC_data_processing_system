Kataragama trishaw drivers to protest on Sept 26

Twelve three wheeler drivers’ associations in Kataragama will stage a protest against the Kataragama Police in front of the Kataragama YMBA on September 26.
They said that around 300 three wheeler owners will participate in the protest against the ban imposed by police preventing them from transporting pilgrims from Kataragama to Kirivehera.
Kirivehera Chief Incumbent Ven. Kobawaka Damminda Thera was shot at a couple of months ago and police banned the three wheeler drivers entering the Kirivehera since then.
Three wheeler drivers said the Thera did not oppose their transport of pilgrims to Kirivehera but Kataragama police banned them which is unjust.
