COUNTRY ROADS taking its 27th turn

“Let the children come to me. Don’t stop them. For the Kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” – Matthew 19:14
“Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf is welcoming me……” – Matthew 18:5
“In the same way it is not my heavenly father’s will that even one of these little ones should perish” – Matthew 18:14
Jesus was one of the greatest spiritual leaders and teachers who walked this earth. Yes, children are the future of our world. But they are important for a greater reason that this. And Jesus knew this. And that reason is that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them and all in heaven look upon them with adoration and love.
This is why Country Roads is travelling down that path for the 27th year. It is South Asia’s longest running concert for children. A very worthy endeavor, the country roads concert series has to date raised many millions of rupees for children’s charities. Country Roads 2015 will provide only the highest quality family friendly entertainment featuring high caliber, fan-favorite international and local acts such as Mavericks from Germany and Astrid Brooks from the UK as well as Sri Lanka’s very popular Flame, Cosmic Rays and Mariazelle.
“The Country Roads concert for children, now in its 27th year, is undoubtedly a worthy cause with all proceeds going towards local children’s charities. However it is also an enjoyable evening. It is a fun and entertaining Country, Western and Folk Music show with its own unique style of fun and family- friendly entertainment”, President of the Country Music Foundation and Organizer of the Country Roads Concert for children, Feizal Samath said.
It also raised a further Rs. 100,000 for the Oxonian Heart Foundation which helps to treat the impoverished and destitute with heart disease and another Rs. 100,000 for a poor family with a special needs child. On its 25th Anniversary in 2013, since the concert series began in 1988, the CMF raised a million rupees for a special project with UNICEF.
In 2002 CMF and the Chamber of Commerce organized a CEO breakfast for 200 CEOs. It was an event discussing children and raising awareness among these CEOs and what was interesting is that it was held the morning after the country roads concert and the breakfast event started off with a band from Germany playing a song.
In 2014, the concert donated Rs. 500,000 to Save the Children Sri Lanka to support its mother and child programs on Sri Lankan plantations. It was an interesting event, because what they did was, on the day of the concert at 4pm they had a roundtable with CEO’s of plantation companies. The meeting was coordinated by CMF and Save the Children to discuss the needs of the mother and child in the plantation sector.
Another unique funding initiative this year is the exclusive special dinner for 50 guests organized by the CMF on the eve of the show where Dirk of the Mavericks and Astrid Brook will talk about their experiences over the past 10 years of raising funds for the Foundation through music in an elegant evening of conversation, dinner and music at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Country Roads Concert for Children will be held on Sunday, October 11, 2015 from 6.30pm at the Main Ballroom of the Mount Lavinia Hotel. Tickets for the concert can be purchased on www.tickets.lk
