Pathum and Ashen’s tons headline in Second Youth Test

Isipathana batsman, Pathum Nissanka’s rampant 172 with 22 fours and a six; and Aloysius all-rounder Ashen Bandara’s patient 121 from 310 balls with 16 fours and a six elaborated the Sri Lanka Youth’s first innings score of 378 for seven declared after a dominant bowling performance led by Maliyadewa all-rounder, Damitha Silva capturing four wickets restricted SA U19’s first innings to a total of 244 all out when visitors won the toss and opted to bat on a lively pitch at Welagedara Stadium.
South Africans were in a strong position when they reached 201 for three, but after Thilan Prasan broke a threatening partnership removing SA’s top scorer Van Heerden for a patiently compiled 81, Damitha Silva and Ashen Bandara ripped through the remainder of the SA innings in no time as South Africa lost their last seven wickets for a meagre 43 runs giving SL youth a useful first innings lead of 134 runs.
South Africa in their second innings batted well till the close of play on the final day scoring 133 for one as this three-day high-scoring Test ended in a tame draw adding one more draw to the three-match series.
