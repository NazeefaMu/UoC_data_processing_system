SLFP disciplined under President: Weerakkody

The internal discipline of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has been strengthened and properly established under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
The minister was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday along with Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha and Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanadhan.
“Unlike during the previous government, no one was tied to a tree by a minister or no minister assaulted individuals. This indicates that the party discipline has been protected and the party has become a more disciplined political force,” he said.
The commencement of a new political academy of the SLFP is the extension of this process of strengthening party discipline.
Minister Weerakkody speaking on the future plans of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation said a large-scale infrastructure development project is being carried out to streamline the airplane fuel supply to the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA).
It has been estimated to increase the income generated by airplane fuel selling. Under this project, a new fuel transporting pipeline will be laid through Muthurajawela up to BIA.
He added that more airplane fuel will be produced by Sapugaskanda refinery. Steps are being taken to minimize misconducts at filling stations by linking all filling stations to a network.
The Cabinet paper in this regard will be forwarded to the Cabinet next week, he added.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha addressing the media said Sri Lanka is widely accepted by the international community at the United Nations Human Right Commission unlike during the previous regime.
“During Rajapaksa’s regime, the country acted like a frog in a well. But now the vision is wider. Due to an outcome of the non-aligned foreign policy, the country receives better support from other countries,” he said.
Both ministers stressed that there is no room for foreign judges to investigate into alleged human rights violations.
“The President has clearly stated that no foreign judges will be allowed. Moreover, there is no room for that under the Constitution,” he said.
Parliamentarian Angajan Ramanadhan said people in Jaffna are satisfied with the way the government is moving forward. Displaced people are being settled, he added.
