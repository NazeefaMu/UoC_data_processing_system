Off course

Driving in a car is much more dangerous than flying in a plane, we have heard. Yet a single plane crash will suffice to hit headlines. Which is why the airline crews are paid well. But does that give us a guarantee of a safe flight?
Duncan Jayawardane, with decades of expertise in civil aviation, entertains doubts about it.
“A student of mine, who scored 96% for the subject Aero Engines, was asked by her flight instructor to show him where the oil tank of a Cessna 152 is. Her short and simple reply was ‘does the aircraft have an oil tank?” By this answer we can arrive at a conclusion, which is, of course, disturbing – it shows that we make sure the students achieve the short term objective (the pass mark of 75%) but completely ignore the long term objectives of training, which is to understand and fly the aeroplane from A to B safely. Not just a Cessna 152 or similar type of light aircraft, which would only be a stepping-stone in a pilot’s career, but the real long term objective, which is of course flying an Airbus A320, or an aeroplane of similar type someday.”

Titled as ‘Broken Compass’, the book contains many such anecdotes ultimately summing up the tragedy of flying schools. Any aeroplane with a broken compass will not head in the right direction, Jayawardena notes.
The book is not about laws of aviation. But it will be a good manual for anyone interested in aviation to work under the banner of a flying training school.
“Most flight instructors choose that career because they have no option. Then may claim to have flown quite a few planes. But a proper flight instructor should have expertise in flying numerous types of flights.”
The tragic offshoot is that the aero students lose their track. That said, the ‘Broken Compass’ offers motivational tips to make all those who work under the banner of a flying training school become better - better human beings, better company employees, better instructors and better students. It ultimately leads to a better company headed in the right direction.
Handing over a copy of the book to Civil Aviation Authority Chief Executive Officer H M C Nimalsiri.
“My personal experience in aviation training and the experience of many other stalwarts in the field of aviation is dove-tailed to give the reader a better, if not a perfect, understanding of one’s own commitments toward the field we love and cherish. I have cried, laughed, talked, listened, learned, taught, condemned, admired and even been confused many a time during my career of 45 years in aviation. But I have enjoyed and loved every moment of my life as an aviator. I still do!”
Adds he: “All of us owe something to aviation for treating us well and giving us the opportunity to meet and associate so many wonderful people within the aviation family. There is no doubt each and every one of us have to repay a debt to aviation, although I am not too sure whether I would be able to do it in full in this lifetime.”
Jayawardane considers the book as a genuine effort to repay his debt. He has spoken to his colleagues and quite a few stalwarts in aviation, inclusive of airline captains, to obtain advice when compiling this book.
“The ideas and opinions published here are not only mine but a few other ‘greats’ as well. In the pages to follow, I may have missed out on certain important areas I should have mentioned in the book. That is unintentional in one aspect. The other is that I do not believe that anyone could do a one hundred percent accurate or complete job of writing on any topic in aviation for that matter.”
Although Jayawardane wants to mention certain names, he has intentionally abstained from doing so, as there are too many important names to be mentioned. The book includes some tips to the flying school administrators, instructors and students on how to better their performances from how they perform now in their respective disciplines.
“I do not in any way attempt to tarnish the good name of individuals or organisations. On the contrary, this is an honest effort to pave the way for everyone to walk hand in hand and to tow the line together in harmony, to uplift an industry we love,” Jayawardane notes.
An excerpt
Aviation is a fast-moving industry with an extremely rapid rate of development.
I really do not know whether the Wright brothers ever imagined that within the life- span of a human being, just 66 years after their historic flight which took place on 17th December 1903 and which lasted only 12 seconds in the air, a Boeing 747 carrying over 500 passengers would fly non-stop for 12 hours.
The rate of growth is unimaginable. We shall never know what the world may see in the skies in another 50 years.
In my opinion, training in aviation is greatly affected by the three main factors of hindrance: complexity, time and money – all of which the flying schools are compelled to tackle methodically and wisely.
Complexity: the modern aeroplane is full of complicated and complex systems which require a constant updating of knowledge, especially on the part of the instructors who they have to impart this knowledge.
Time: time is money, they say. This, to a great extent, is true of aviation, more so than any other industry I would guess.
An instructor unfortunately is not given all the time in the world to impart the knowledge or skills to students, and the time available for teaching or learning is therefore very limited, especially considering training expenses.
To students, this is a great challenge, which is to learn many new things in a comparatively short time. Although they say failures are the pillars of success, failures are not tolerated in aviation. The problem can be mitigated by choosing skilful and knowledgeable instructors.
A school therefore, cannot be satisfied with just good instructors but, only excellent ones. The traits of an excellent instructor are many.
