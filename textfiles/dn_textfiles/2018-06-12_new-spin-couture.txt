Presenter Anita Dorai and Indian designer Kavita Thulasidas, owner of Stylemart, Singapore have worked to present the designes which will be adorned by models on the ramp on September 2 at the Hilton Colombo ballroom.
Describing the designs as “exquisite designer wear that is cutting edge, breathtaking and unique , yet wearable and affordable” Anita noted that Kavita embodies everything that is a hallmark of a truly great designer.
Singapore based Kavita is the Creative and Managing Director of Stylemart Bridal Collection Pvt Ltd since 1999.
She noted that she is eager to present her designs to Sri Lankan women whom she branded as “beautiful” and “stylish”.
Over 80 outfits will be showcased on ‘Threads of Time’. Pure silks and laces, tulles, georgettes, net and Chantilly laces worked with swarovski, in black, navy/ midnight blues and pastel hues will comprise the collection. Brian Kerkoven will choreograph the show and the hair and make up being handled by Ramani Fernando salons. Porsche, the luxury automobile brand, is the Main Sponsor. The proceeds of the show will go for charity.
The show is being presented by Anita Dorai who has long been an ardent fashionista and a lover of all things beautiful. Anita who now calls Sri Lanka home, has plans to stage many fashion and other spectacular productions on a regular basis in Sri Lanka
Most of the embroideries for Kavita’s pieces are done in India. She had worked closely with hand embroiderers from around 10 states across the country for her collection.
Saying true to her Asian roots Kavita elaborated that her goal is to design styles which never gets outdated.
“I am mostly into formal wear because I find it luxurious, detailing and glamourous. People get excited when they see bling. I get my inspirations from people and culture. This collection is inspired by Sri Lanka,” she expressed.
She adds, “Fashion is something that is constantly evolving. It is something that always comes from the past to the future. Nothing is ever new. It is always reinvented. I take my inspiration from the past from amazing designers from all over the world like Christian Dior and Chanel.
They are all inspirations to all designers from all over the world. Therefore styles are always about reinventing something that has already been out there.”
