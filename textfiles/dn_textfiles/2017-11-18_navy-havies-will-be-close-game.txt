Navy-Havies will be a close game

The confrontation between Navy Sports Club and Havelock Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division interclub league rugby first round match at Navy grounds in Welisara today should turn out to be a close game. The match will kick off at 3:45pm.
The Havies team who had a spectacular victory against the formidable Air Force SC in their first round game last week by 46 points to 23 came back to their normal pattern of play from the very first game that they played against Police SC this season where they registered a thumping (36 nil) victory. Havelock’s have been training hard during the last few days and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win while the Navy SC after winning the first game lost to a formidable CR and FC team last week, hence they will have to get their act together and be at their very best if they have to topple the high riding unbeaten table leaders Havies in their own den in Welisara.
The forte of Havelock’s team has been their power-packed forwards.The Havies ‘eight’ spearheaded by burly last year’s skipper Dushmantha Priyadarshana ”Bodhi” ably supported by this year captain Jason Melder, Prasath Madushanka, Sharo Fernando, Shenal Deeelaka, and Shehan Dias have given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be up against the
Navy forwards of the caliber of Lanky Supun Peiris, Adeesha Weeratunga, last year’s skipper Roshan Ranasinghe, Kasun De Silva, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Janith Laksara and omnipresent captain Danushka “ Gertha” Perera. In the set scrums the experienced Navy hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe should get the better of his vis-a-vis Prasath Madusanka while in the line outs Sailors will have the edge in securing the ball position through their line out jumpers in Supun Peiris and Adeesha Weeratunga over the Havies duo of Sharo Fernando and Shehan Dias.
Navy SC won their first game against Army SC by (20-14) but lost the second game unexpectedly to the sensational CR & FC side by (23-38) last week. Even though they lost to CR their halves combination of Richie Darmapala and new comer Mohamad Abzal having clicked well in the last few matches,
the Navy outfit will hope that Richie will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in experienced Musheen Faleel and young Lahiru Herath in addition to their young speedy wingers Buddhima Piyaratne and Supun Dilshan who has stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Thilina Weerasinghe often joining the
line to form the overlap. Going by the two team’s performance so far a close tussle for supremacy can be expected today at Navy grounds.
