Citizen's Mail [02.08.2017]

SCHOOL DROPOUTS IN plantation sector
The school dropout rate is high especially in plantation sector schools. The average primary school dropout rate in Sri Lanka is about 1.4 percent.
Around 10 to 25 percent students dropout in plantation sector. Government and social organisations should look into this problem and take early corrective action.
Only about 7 percent of students in plantation sector who pass their Ordinary Level exam continue to the GCE A/LEVEL and less than one percent of them complete their GCE A/LEVEL and enter university.
In Estate Sector, there are 830 schools with about 199,200 students.
Following are the reasons for the low educational achievements in the plantation sector schools:
Lack of transport facilities.
Unsafe school buildings.
Poor condition of classrooms.
Lack of desks, chairs, blackboards and textbooks.
Lack of drinking water and sanitation.
Main reasons for high dropout rate in schools is poverty, and lack of parent support. Very often the mother is working in Middle East as a housemaid. Many social ills such as alcoholism, fatalism, low self-value and low awareness of rights are some of the reasons.
We are spending our time, money and other resources to fight against SAITM and other private educational institutions. This is all nonsense.
We must spend our time and other resources to look into the problem of school dropouts and other problems related to extreme poverty.
