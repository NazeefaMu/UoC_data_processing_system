Death of the ‘Smiling Miler’

The local athletics world yesterday mourned the death of Ahmed Sher Mohamed Khan, more famously known as ASM Khan who was dubbed the ‘Smiling Miler’ by the local media and the ‘Wonder boy of Ceylon’ by India.
Khan passed away on the 27th night of Ramadan (Saturday) at age of 77 at his residence in Dehiwela and his funeral was held at the Dehiwela Muslim Burial grounds yesterday.
Khan was also referred to as the ‘Local Zatopek of Asia’ and the ‘Iron Athlete of Ceylon’ names that were coined to describe his extraordinary running talents.
Khan was the first athlete in Ceylon to run the metric mile under four minutes (3mts, 59.5 secs) in 1960 while still representing his school St Joseph’s College, Bandarawela. He later joined the CT&FC and Ace AC. He was first selected to represent his country in 1958 in the dual meet between Ceylon and Indian states Madras, Mysore and Bangalore. The meet was held in Bangalore and Khan won the 1500m and 5000m in one day beating some of India’s top athletes. It was at this meet that he got the title “the wonder boy of Ceylon” from the governor of Bangalore.
More success was to follow when Khan broke the Asian Games record in 1960 in Indonesia running at another international meet clocking 3 mts, 54 secs in the 1500m. He then went to Malaysia and broke their 25-year-old record clocking 4 mts, 19 secs beating athletes from 21 states.
Khan, a middle and long distance athlete was never coached but learnt to run all by himself. He ran for the pleasure of taking part in competition and to be with the best. Unfortunately for an athlete of his talent and calibre his participation was restricted only to Sri Lanka and Asian countries like India, Malaysia and Indonesia. Khan once said that he was denied the opportunity of taking part in the Olympic Games or the Empire Games by the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA) and the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of that time.
He represented his alma mater at athletics, boxing and soccer before pursuing a career in athletics that was to make him famous. For three years he was unbeaten ABA champion in the pin weight class and earned the name “the tiger fighter from the mountain area”. He was also very good at soccer playing for his school as well as for Municipality B team where he was a playground instructor.
Khan quit competitive athletics in 1966 and took off to Jeddah where he worked for the Saudi Arabian Airlines for 27 years. He was the first Sri Lankan to join the Airlines.
“At that time our country was known as Ceylon. They didn’t know where Ceylon was in the map,” Khan said in an interview.
He worked in the head office as secretary to the manager flight operations and quit as senior secretary.
At the time of his death Khan was a successful gem merchant travelling to Saudi Arabia often to advise the prince and princesses and sheikhs who sort his expertise and consulted him before they purchased a gem stone.
Khan bestrode the local and Asian athletic world like a colossus taking everything before him in an era where sportsmen and women took part for glory and pride. Khan is survived by his wife and two sons.
