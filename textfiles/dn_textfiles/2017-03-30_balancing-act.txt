Balancing act

Breaking away from the traditions of professional circus, Dileepa Dinush left his audience awestruck. His acrobatic performances were out of this world and left all those around him gasping in wonder. Little did one guess that the youth has learnt the art through rigorous training.
The 28-year-old’s amazing talent was brought before the world through ‘Youth With Talent’, a reality program which showcased the extraordinary skills of Sri Lankan youth. It was organized by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the National Youth Services Council and the Independent Television Network. Dileepa beat around 53, 657 competitors to emerge as the winner of the competition.
“My skills are mostly self taught. I stopped attending school at the age of 15 years. I worked at a garage in Bulathsinhala to earn a few bucks, assisting the workers to repair three wheelers. The Pacifia Circus visited the area during that time. Everyone was excited by the prospect of seeing some amazing acts. The excitement around me aroused my curiosity. I bought a ticket and took my seat. I found the whole experience enchanting! I watched the show over and over again for about five days more. That was the beginning of a journey which kindled passion for the art and brought me on a long, tiring and hard won journey to fame,” Dileepa said.
Dileepa was so smitten by the circus that he wished to become a part of it. He spoke to the relevant parties and was finally given the green light to join in. The next hurdle was getting his parents’ permission. This too proved to be difficult especially because he was the only child in the family.
“They finally gave in and I was elated. I knew that I could venture far in this field. They gave me a lot of labour work but I was able to train my balancing act during my free time. I was able to teach myself to ride the unicycle in around six months,” he explained.
His next challenge was to master the hand balance which he says in no walk in the park. A person needs a lot of determination and will power to achieve this goal. His training starts at 6 am and ends around 8.30 am. After breakfast the circus acts go on full swing. He had to satisfy his hunger with a glass of water till it was time for curtain call for many days.
Dileepa had earned around Rs 20 to Rs 30 for his work. This was not enough to cover his expenses. He had his parent’s welfare to think of as well. He bid farewell to the circus and engaged in various other professions like sand mining, carpentry and selling lottery tickets for short spans. His talent for acrobatics was well known among all those who were close to him and before long he got another opportunity engage in his passion.
“Ranjan uncle brought the news about a circus from Katana. They offered to pay Rs 250 per month. I worked there for a short period. Then the owner decided to quit. I joined a circus from Mathugama next and worked there for about six months. I had to quit because of the insufficient pay. I did several other jobs next. I worked as a bus conductor for a few months. Then I became a mason for a while. I have even contributed towards laying concrete on roads as a labourer.
But destiny came calling again – this time in the form of Pacifia Circus - the oldest running circus in Sri Lanka. Dileepa joined them and it was during this time that that he got the news of ITN’s ‘Youth With Talent’ competition and decided to try his luck at the event.
“I am so grateful that I gave it a shot because everyone knows about my talents now. My goal was to get recognition for my skills rather than become the winner. Winning the competition was an added bonus. There were many talented youth at the show. I chose to showcase different acts which highlighted the diverse things I could do in each round. Maybe that is what helped me clinch this win,” he opined.
Dilpeepa is something of a mini celebrity today. He says people recognize him on the streets and come up to talk to him.
“They say that they have sent SMSes so that I could win, putting their faith on me and believing that I am the best. They also say that they admire my skills. It is very encouraging to get such feedback. I had a hard time getting ready for the competition because I had no sponsorship. However as I reached the finals many helping hands were extended to me. I am grateful to all of them for helping me reach success,” he added.
Speaking about the scope for local circuses to thrive in the entertainment field in Sri Lanka Dileepa laments that it has been put aside, ignored, by the authorities.
“There is no recognition for circus as an art form in Sri Lanka. They bring down circus troupes from China to perform in some of the hotspots in Colombo and speak highly about their talents. Our local talent goes unnoticed. The Chinese acrobats perform with safety gear and nets but our acrobats do not use such items because they have no money to purchase them. They gamble with their life daily to enchant the viewers,” Dileepa mused adding that while tickets are priced high for international circus shows, local circuses charge only about Rs 150 per show. He says that local circuses do not perform in the city because they are charged a large sum as tax for using a particular land. The amount that they are charged for using the land in rural areas is less. Therefore local circuses stick by the villages rather than venture to the towns.
“We generally stay for about six or seven days in one location but if we get a very good response then we stay for about 10 days. Animals like dogs, porcupines, goats and monkeys perform at our shows,” he noted.
Recalling one of his most memorable experiences during a performance Dileepa said that during a show in Adiambalama he had taken a fall but had been unhurt because he has fallen right into his mother’s lap!
“That was a miracle. My parents and family came that day to see me performing and were among the audience. We were all amazed that I landed right on her lap when I slipped. Nobody got hurt,” he reflected with a smile.
Dileepa has been working with the Sakura Circus for nearly a year now. His father Kapuwage Malla is bedridden. His mother Moradudalige Suweenitha Lalani works at the neighbourhood bakery once in a while.
“My ambition is to build our house and cultivate in our land. I have been through a lot to reach this level. However I was very punctual. I made it on time for all the auditions and shooting schedules. Circus has become a dying art today. I request the authorities to take the necessary steps to save this art for the future generations,” he concluded.
