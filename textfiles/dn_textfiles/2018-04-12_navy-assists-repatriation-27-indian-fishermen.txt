Navy assists repatriation of 27 Indian fishermen

The Sri Lanka Navy assisted in the repatriation of 27 Indian fishermen who had been apprehended while poaching in Sri Lankan waters, yesterday (11).
The 27 Indian fishermen who were released from Sri Lankan custody, had been apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy in January and February this year in the seas off Karainagar and Mannar. They were handed over to the Indian Coast Guard Ship “Rani Gaidinliu” on the International Maritime Boundary Line North of Kankesanthurai at mid noon today. Sri Lanka Coast Guard’s Fast Attack Craft “CG 401” and “CG 402” were deployed for the mission.
