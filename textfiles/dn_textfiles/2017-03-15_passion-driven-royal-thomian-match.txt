Passion driven Royal-Thomian match

Hilmy Cader of MTI Consulting has been generous in a piece in the Sunday Observer on the subject 138 years of cricket between Royal and S. Thomas and what businesses could learn from it. He says. “profit is the only driver of a business, here is an exception where passion is the driver of the business, a cult brand status for their brands, strong sub-brands, efforts of the different Brand Evangelists”.
This piece turns the light inward and asks what Royal and S. Thomas could learn from business in this series. Giving media dignity and respect pays. Media are our access to the wider world and means to portray the brand. Twenty eight media institutions and publications sought access with seventy nine provided access passes. All without tickets at the match had photo ID passes.
What I would term as rudimentary comforts were enhanced with a mid-morning snack provisioned but used on two of three days along with the lunch, tea and soft drinks, a dedicated steward to serve the media in attendance and a cooler from which water could be picked up. Beer was to be kept in the cooler.
The space allocated was inadequate. A request is pending with a sponsor to send out mementos to those who took the trouble to use their passes. The visual monitors provided for the SLBC commentators packed up.
We need to invest on convincing the media that they are important to us.
The importance of business integrity
The misconduct of a few can undermine efforts of the many and erode trust in markets and institutions. This entails those who operate in such markets to play by the rules. A wider range of tools to induce meaningful behaviour change.
The challenges of corporate misbehaviour are not new, but the potential scope of their impact is, particularly in terms of lost trust. What is needed is to understand the distance between what expectations for responsible business behaviour recommend and how they are implemented. Given the stakes, for many continuing with “business as usual” is not an option.
Integrity as a question of long-term success.
Just pointing to whatever the leaders are doing is no longer good enough. The Royal Thomian brand must become one of those leaders. We have to define what we stand for and what behaviours are no longer appropriate, regardless of whether the majority of the industry follows those practices.
Match officials
We had on-field, reserve and a third umpire with a match referee. They were served with camera technology for referrals. Known only to a handful, the system providing camera technology was protected and kept independent from bias or influence for use by the third Umpire. It required discrete monitoring throughout the match.
A few were passionate in calling for a match officiating system which was truly independent and free of partisan pressures.
What is a conflict of interest?
A “situation where an individual or the entity for which they work, whether a government, business, media outlet or civil society organisation, is confronted with choosing between the duties and demands of their position and their own private interests.”
Going forward the Joint Committee will have to codify areas where conflicts of interest arise to prevent negative outcomes.
CSR
The four categories of Case for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) – economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic – address the motivations for initiatives in the category and are also useful in identifying specific kinds of benefits that flow back to companies, as well as society, in their fulfillment.
A 138 year brand must ask of itself its CSR. Sure there is a revenue dividend to the brand with both schools becoming beneficiaries in equal measure. Can though economics of revenue supersede the cricket? What is the cost of ear shattering, deafening noise masking all cricket related sounds at the centre where bowling and batting is undertaken?
The brand is influential and can place enormous pressure on those officiating. All the more reason why cricketing laws must unflinchingly be respected. For the same reasons, since stakes are high cricketing ethics must be our first priority. Results must not be at the expense of ethics.
What of philanthropy? The combined physical assets of both schools is unmatched. The cricketing talent and brains considerable. Have we thought it fit to share and or apply these assets in a rational manner to benefit talented but less well-endowed schools, rural but budding talent and left behind for cricket in this country the sheer breadth and volume of cricketing talent leaving at the end of every cricketing season from senior teams?
The two schools have been blessed with cricket programmes which are sustainable. What is our give back to cricket in this country for the fortunes which have come our way? It is my view some in the upper echelons running cricket in this country see Royalists and Thomians with a jaundiced view due to perceptions of elitism and privilege on our part. It is for us to show our generosity and heart to serve the larger interest of cricket in this country.
The history of the brand is replete with cricketing greatness in the past. Others have come along and shone not only in school cricket but also on the national stage more recently. It’s a lesson to both schools. Nevertheless if ours is the second longest cricketing school encounter in the world, we possess some historical greatness. It must translate into unparalleled social investments unsurpassed by any other with comparable contexts.
