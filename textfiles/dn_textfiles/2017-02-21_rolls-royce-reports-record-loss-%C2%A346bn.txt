Rolls-Royce reports record loss of £4.6bn

A bribery settlement and the fall in the pound have pushed engineering giant Rolls-Royce to a record loss.
The jet engine maker reported a loss before tax of £4.6bn for 2016.
However, once one-off costs have been stripped out, the company's underlying profit was better than many experts had predicted.
Rolls-Royce agreed to pay £671m to settle corruption cases with UK and US authorities and it has written off £4.4bn from currency related contracts.
Protection
Like many international businesses, Rolls-Royce usually "hedges" its bets to protect itself from fluctuating currency markets.
Most international aerospace contracts are priced in dollars, but, as a UK company, much of Rolls-Royce's costs are in pounds.
It takes out long-term currency trades. These were designed to protect the firm against what seemed the most likely risk- the fall in the dollar - and many of them were put in place before the EU referendum was even announced. (BBC)
