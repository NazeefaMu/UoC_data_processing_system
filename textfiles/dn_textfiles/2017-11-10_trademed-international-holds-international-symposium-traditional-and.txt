Trademed International holds international symposium  on traditional and complementary medicine

Tradmed International 2017, a diverse platform to share and discuss the inherent values, developments and novelties in evidenced based practice of Traditional and Complementary medicine will commence on November 22 at the Waters Edge.
Jointly organized by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Sri Lanka, World Health Organization and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Sri Lanka, Trademed International 2017 will create space for an International Symposium on Traditional and Complementary Medicine as well as an Educational Exhibition and Trade Fair on Traditional and Complementary medicine as two parallel events.
The international symposium will focus on combining modern science and technology with the Traditional and Complementary Medicine systems for disease prevention, diagnosis as well as safe and effective product development with core emphasis on quality and standard.
The event will provide excellent opportunities for networking, collaboration and to formulate private-public partnerships in traditional and complementary medicine research and development.
“The rapidly expanding demand for herbal medicine worldwide is expected to touch US$ 107 billion by 2017. Mindful of these global developments, we hope to develop the traditional medical systems in the country and beyond.
The indigenous traditional medical systems of Sri Lanka called “deshiyachikitsa” are based on the rich assortment of medicinal plants in the country and from time immemorial have helped to create a physically and mentally strong, healthy nation. Hence it is imperative that the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine take steps to further strengthen our national health system by incorporating proven, evidence based traditional indigenous treatment methods,” commented Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of Minister of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Sri Lanka.
Tradmed International 2017 will provide an arena for industrialists, academia, researchers, health care practitioners, students etc. to communicate, interact, share experiences, knowledge and technology in realizing this goal.
In addition to discussing Traditional and Complementary medicine systems, Tradmed International 2017 is expected to be a forum to promote strategies for healthy life style.
The symposium and trade fair will be held under the patronage of Minister Rajiatha Senaratne and Deputy Minister of Health Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Sri Lanka, Faizal Cassim.
