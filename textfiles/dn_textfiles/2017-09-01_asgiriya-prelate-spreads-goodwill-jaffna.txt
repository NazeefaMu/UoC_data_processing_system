A six-member delegation of Buddhist monks, headed by Most Ven Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Maha Nayake Thera of Asgiriya Chapter during a tour to the Jaffna peninsula interacted with religious leaders, state officials, school authorities, administrators and members of Security Forces, and visited places of historic and religious importance during August 28 - 30.
The invitation to Ven Mahanayake Thera to visit the north and interact with its people was made several months ago by the Commander of the Army during his tenures as the Chief of Staff and the Jaffna Commander to show goodwill and concern towards the well-being of the northerners to be in line with the ongoing reconciliation moves.
Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna (SFHQ-J), commanded by Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi, accordingly coordinated the Maha Nayake’s programme in the north on the instructions of the Commander of the Army.
During the three-day itinerary, Ven Maha Nayake Thera and his delegation freely moved about in the Jaffna town and visited historical places, such as the Jaffna Fort, Nallur Kovil temple, Dambakola Patuna, Kanda Rodai Buddhist Temple, Naga Viharaya and Nagadeepa Temple in the peninsula. Ven Maha Nayake Thera during a separate special meeting on the date of his arrival organized at the SFHQ-J auditorium enabled him to receive an update on the present security situation, development efforts and other concerns in the peninsula from Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi.
The interaction was attended by the Commander Northern Naval Area Command, Senior DIG for the Northern Province, Second in Command at Palaly Air Base and a few others.The visiting prelate commended the services rendered by members of the armed forces in Jaffna and thanked them for facilitation of the tour, enabling them to experience existing ground realities in the peninsula.
During the delegation’s visit to the Nallur Hindu temple, the Kurukkal (clergies) respectfully welcomed the Maha Nayake Thera and thanked him for visiting them in the peninsula. A separate meeting at the District Secretariat, Jaffna enabled the prelate to talk to several leading Hindu and Catholic priests, administrators and state officials where the Maha Nayake blessed them.
As the final part of the itinerary, the visiting Buddhist delegation went to Ven Madihe Pangnaseeha Maha Vidyalaya in Jaffna this afternoon (30) and distributed a large stock of school accessories to the students. The Army coordinated the distribution of those gifts among the students. The delegation also had a look at the newly constructed Nallinakapuram housing complex which was completed during the tenure of the present Commander when he was serving Jaffna.
