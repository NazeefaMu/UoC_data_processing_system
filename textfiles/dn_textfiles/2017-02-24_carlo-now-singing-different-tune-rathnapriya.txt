Carlo now singing different tune: Rathnapriya

When former President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed Prof. Carlo Fonseka as the President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) during his tenure, Prof. Fonseka had agreed to resolve all issues pertaining to SAITM although he is now singing a different tune, Movement for Free Education and Freedom to Education Co-convener Saman Rathnapriya said.
Addressing a media briefing held yesterday, he said, that Prof. Fonseka had accepted that SAITM was a good idea those days. But, now he is against it under this government. During his observation tour to the SAITM sometime ago, he has told that he can vouch for its standards with his own blood. Now, he has forgotten all these things.
Nine out of ten professors who recently inspected SAITM have said that SAITM mets the all required standards.
Although, the SLMC is supposed to stipulate the minimum standards of Medical faculties in Sri Lanka, it has not done so this far from its inception. So, it has neglected its responsibilities. The SLMC is also empowered to register foreign universities which award medical degrees. But it has been registering those universities without any investigation. We ask the SLMC, if they can allow KDU medical students to do clinical studies at Kalubowila Teaching hospital, why cannot
they allow SAITM students to do the same as both institutions offer degrees by charging money. “Those who got through the GCE Advanced Level Exam cannot enter to the university. Only 26000 students enter the universities and around 55,000 students follow higher educational courses at private institutes and universities. But, around 66000 students have no way to go because they can not find a job because of lack of skills.
