Liberalism Vs Neo-Liberalism

The term neo-liberalism is widely used in Sri Lanka by left politicians and left intellectuals mainly, Dr Wickramabahu Karunarathne, Dr Dayan Jayathilake, Dr Kumudu Kusum Kumara, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Pubudu Jagoda to describe the economic pattern and policies followed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinge’s administration.
With the widespread coining of the word “neo-liberalism” in economics circles, many enthusiasts pose a question in order to find an answer for the difference between liberalism and neo-liberalism. This article attempts to distinguish the difference between two concepts.
First World War
Early stages liberalism was classical and early liberals emphasized mainly on laissez faire (free trade) and limited government. Thus from early stages liberalism never lost its correct meaning in most of the time in its history. In Spanish-speaking countries, the word “liberalismo” denotes, an ideology of free trade and free markets rather than a limited government. However thinkers in the calibre of T.H. Green and L.T. Hobhouse (reformist liberals) reformed the classical liberal ideology specially in sphere of concept of limited government and professed that there was a role for the government to enhance activity and authority to promote ideals of distributive justice and social harmony in socio-economic activities which was later regarded as a progressive opinion by the liberals though it was not essentially a socialist or social democratic outlook.
The catastrophe of the First World War shattered the liberal world that had existed from 1815 to 1914. In England the Liberal Party governments under Prime Ministers H.H. Asquith and Lloyd George largely abandoned the classical liberal positions and successive governments applied views of reformist liberals to control excesses of free market. The Second World War changed the cause of the history with one party dominant system in Germany and Soviet Russia killed the aspirations of a liberal world order.
John Maynard Keynes who was instrumental for the “Keynesian school” of economics, also differed from classical liberalism, developed a modern liberal view in the aftermath of the 1930s with failure of the free-market system known as the Great Depression. His views are described and known as Modern Liberalism.
Keynesian theory
Keynesian paradigm disintegrated in late 1970s and new thinkers emerged to settle theoretical issues in economics. Two such schools of thought were Chicago School and Austrian school. Milton Friedman of the Chicago school advocated monetary control as the means for stable growth. Austrians maintained the principal cause of economic stagnation was the non-coordination of relative prices induced by government intervention.
Milton Friedman became the main advocate opposing Keynesian theory and said that there existed a natural rate of unemployment and argued that employment above this rate would cause acceleration of inflation. Friedman promoted an alternative macro-economic policy known as monetarism and argued that small expansion of money supply was the preferred policy. His ideas concerning monetary policy, taxation, privatization and deregulation influenced government policies in both USA and UK from early 1980s.
Friedrich Von Hayek of the Austrian School was a true liberal and he advocated implementing classical liberal economic views with high level of democracy, rule of law, representative and constitutional government with a party system. He predicted socialism would definitely fall. He emphasized those dictatorships whether they are right or left would not enhance freedom of people and that will have a direct bearing on economic growth. For him competition between producers and also between and among consumers is another essential part of the market process. He was also a promoter of micro-economic policies and predicted that the socialist economic system soon or later would definitely be collapsed. He promoted the idea of individual liberty, and advocated against central planning.
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank had borrowed the ideas of Friedman and Hayek especially in late 1970s and influenced sectors of respective governments to implement what they thought would be beneficial for economic growth.
Conservative political parties
Understanding, that the IMF and World Bank were professing old classical liberal views for economic development in a new form and character, leftists and left academics ‘criticized that IMF, World Bank and respective rulers and bureaucrats as introducing old policies of classical liberalism in a new form and branded them as neo liberals.
However so called neo-liberals or politicians mainly from conservative political parties only borrowed the ideas of economic development professed by Freidman and Hayek but not their democratic views. Therefore liberals are also criticizing the workings of so called neo-liberals as they are essentially conservative elements and represent conservative political parties.
Ronald Reagan and Margret Thatcher were the best examples in this regard. They followed the economic theories of Friedman and Hayek but not their democratic views and ideals. United National Party (UNP) government under J.R. Jayewardene was first to introduce “open economy” in the South Asian region yet UNP is not a liberal party but a conservative party. When a conservative party attempting to introduce economic policies of Friedman and Hayek, the left, left academics brand those conservatives as neo-liberals. So, from the liberal point of view Ranil Wickremesinghe could not be considered a liberal in ideological sense, could be branded as a neo-liberal by the left politicians and academics.
