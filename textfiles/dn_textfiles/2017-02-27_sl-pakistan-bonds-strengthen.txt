SL-Pakistan bonds strengthen

Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Major General (R) Jayanath Lokuketagodage highlighted the cordial and warm relations between Sri Lanka and Pakistan during Sri Lanka’s 69th Independence celebrations in Islamabad, Pakistan, recently.
He said the unity government is working hard to ensure good governance, transparency, accountability and the promotion of pluralism.
He said the political, trade and economic relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka are solid and longstanding. Pakistan is the second largest trading partner of Sri Lanka in the SAARC region. Sri Lanka was the first country to sign a Free Trade Agreement with Pakistan. A substantial growth is seen in bilateral trade, particularly after the implementation of the Pakistan–Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) in 2005.
The value of total trade between the two countries has increased from US $ 158 million in 2005 to over US $ 337 million (up to November) in 2016. The balance of trade (BOT) has always been in favor of Pakistan and the trade gap has increased at a considerable rate over the years. Pakistan and Sri Lanka are determined to boost the bilateral trade to reach at US$ 1 billion mark. Therefore, authorities of both the countries are regularly monitoring, reviewing and addressing issues that are being encountered by the business community in order to further strengthen the existing trade and economic relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
The celebration began with the hoisting of the National Flag by the High Commissioner. Following the lightning of the oil lamp by the dignitaries, two minutes’ silence was observed for the National War Heroes as a mark of respect for their sacrifices for peace, independence and sovereignty of the motherland. This was followed by religious observances performed by members of the clergy representing Buddhist, Hindu, Christianity and Islam religions. The special messages of the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister were read out on the occasion.
Visitors were served with Sri Lankan tea and traditional kavum, kiribath and other Lankan sweetmeats.On the evening of February 6, a formal reception was held with a special cultural show presented by a group of 14 members from the Sri Lanka Navy dance troupe. A gathering of 500 people comprising over 200 diplomats, ministers and dignitaries of Pakistan, and Sri Lankans living in Pakistan participated.
