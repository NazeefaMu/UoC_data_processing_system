Master Farrier visits RTC

The Royal Turf Club in Nuwara Eliya played host to an international celebrity on November 3 when Bernard Duvernay, the Master Farrier who lives in Geneva paid a visit to the RTC .
Just as shoes play such a vital role in the performance of athletes all over the world, so too shoeing of Racehorses is an art which can make or break a thoroughbred’s chances.
Bernard Duvernay heads the Flying Anvil Foundation formed with the objective of promoting the professional competance of farriery across the globe. He came across to the Royal Turf Club in Nuwara Eliya and held a workshop where he shared his expertise and knowledge with local Farriers based there.
It was an incredible learning experience for all horsemen as Bernard explained the finer points of what shoeing and farriery were all about. He’s a man who has travelled the world from his native homestead in Geneva and visited a conglomerate of countries which include Russia, the Honduras, India, Tehran, Muscat and Lahore just to mention a few.
In India his Flying Anvil Foundation has established a School of Farriery in Rajasthan. Work began in 2013 and today it is a testimonial to the dedication of Bernard Duvernay being only one of two Farriery Schools that function in Asia.
