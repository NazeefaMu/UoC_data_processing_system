‘Supermarkets should promote reusable bags’

He said authorities should take action in this regard and encourage super markets to promote environmentally friendly reusable bags such as cotton bags and other similar reusable bags.
He said even officials at supermarkets should motivate their staff in this regard as bags are issued to customers by cashiers at counters unnecessarily.
“To minimize using more polythene bags, customers should use one bag to put groceries and another bag to put cleaning stuff like soap, toothpaste etc.
Chairman Dias said in addition, super markets could also charge money for additional bags to discourage customers who are asking for more bags.
He said customers should also be informed that polythene papers take over 500 years to degrade in the environment and causing a severe destruction to living beings.
He further said this message could be displayed at the counters and even the staff should request customer to bring reusable bags.
Chairman Dias highlighted that super markets are the most identified places in the country that issue large quantity of polythene bags to customers.
He said reusable bags are currently used by many leading textile shops, hoteliers and traders in the country.
“Even food manufacturers still using non- degradable bags to pack food items including vegetable, meat products, sausages, spices, sugar, tea leaves, dhal etc. and authorities should focus attention towards this,” he said.
“It is pathetic to say that using of polythene bags by super markets will be increased to the maximum when expanding the existing super market chain.”
He said in major countries including UK, USA and Singapore, almost all super markets there promote reusable shopping bags.
Chairman Dias said he is prepared to extend any organization about the know- how of reducing polythene bags as he has done similar operations abroad.
