Ahmed Shehzad fails dope test

Pakistan opener Ahmed Shehzad has failed a dope test and may face a minimum three-month-long suspension.
The 26-year-old was tested during the Pakistan Cup, the country's domestic five-team one-day tournament, held from April 19 to May 1.
Shehzad, who played for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that went on to win the tournament, was the highest run-getter - scoring 372 runs at a towering average of 74.40. He struck three fifties and a century. In a tweet, which was retweeted by the board chairman Najam Sethi, the PCB confirmed that a player had failed a dope test. "A player has reportedly tested positive for a prohibited substance," the tweet said.
"But under ICC rules, PCB cannot name the player or charge sheet him until the chemical report is confirmed by the Anti-Dope Agency of the government. We should have an answer in a day or two."
