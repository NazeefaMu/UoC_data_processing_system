Selection policies or selection politics?

So Sri Lanka has lost another series in South Africa when they conceded a 3-0 lead to the host in the five-match One-Day International series with two to play. The way things are panning out Sri Lanka are in danger of being whitewashed 5-0 an ignominy which they have suffered only once in their entire history - against India in 2014. It would follow their 3-0 drubbing in the Test series.
The current team is in the process of rebuilding and too much criticism cannot be leveled against the players who are trying their best to find their feet on the international stage against a team that is on a role and playing on their own backyard are proving to be unbeatable, except perhaps in the shortest of formats – T20 where Sri Lanka managed to even the odds by winning the series 2-1 – a rare feat for them in South Africa.
What is most galling than the losses is the composition of the squad picked and the teams selected for the matches that has also contributed greatly to the defeats apart from the inexperience.
It is clear as daylight that Sri Lanka are woefully short in their batting especially the middle order which has left a gaping hole after the retirements of legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. It is blatantly clear that the squad is short of a specialist batsman. Knowing where the weakness laid the national selection committee picked only six specialist batsmen and included three all-rounders – Asela Gunaratne, Chaturanga de Silva and Sachith Pathirana at nos. 6, 7 and 8. Thereby not only was the composition of the team unbalanced but it severely weakened the batting. So when a specialist batsman was out of form (or injured) there was no proper substitute for him. It is elementary in team selection that you have power hitters occupying these slots with the capability to clear the ground and raise the tempo when needed. The irony is that there are proven players in the caliber of Milinda Siriwardena, Chamara Kapugedera, Thisara Perera and Dasun Chanaka etc who are sadly lamenting on the sidelines.
This is clearly evident from the totals Sri Lanka has come up with so far in the series – 181, 186 and 163. On all three occasions they have failed to bat out their quota of 50 overs which is a cardinal sin in one-day cricket. One has only to make a cursory glance at the composition of the South African team where it comprises of specialist batsmen and specialist bowlers with one all-rounder in Chris Morris.
Even the bowling line-up selected also looks pretty lopsided with the team comprising three left-arm spinners with only one having he skill to complete 10 overs, the other two only bowled four overs each. The only leg-spinner in the side Jeffrey Vandersay is dropped after one game in spite of the conditions favouring his style of bowling. It is a known fact that wrist spinners are at their best when there is scoreboard pressure and in the first game they were defending only a paltry 181 runs.
When the conditions in South Africa demands for express bowlers it is unimaginable that players in the caliber of Dushmantha Chameera and Kasun Rajitha who hits the deck are not automatic choices on those wickets. Instead Sri Lanka continues to persist with two fast bowlers conceding at the rate of 7 runs an over with bowling speeds of mid/high 120 kmph. Both these bowlers are going to be in their mid-thirties in when the next World Cup comes around in 2019. It would be more beneficial for the team to groom the young brood of fast bowlers in preparation for the world event. The absence of there being a policy of grooming youngsters for the next World Cup challenge is quite a worrying factor.
A worrying trend in recent selections is where young players are chucked out of the side after just one game. A case in point is the dropping of Sandun Weerakkody after just one game when it was blatantly clear that the squad was short of a specialist batsman. It is being grossly unfair on the part of these youngsters when such decisions are taken. The weakness clearly lies in poor player identification where players are thrown into the deep end hoping they live up to their promise.
A brief analysis of our recent successes would reveal that the future of our cricket lies with the youth. Kusal Mendis and Niroshan Dickwella scored an aggregate of 346 runs in the recently concluded Tri-Series in Zimbabwe which Sri Lanka won beating West Indies in the final. Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva scored an aggregate of 621 runs in the Test series against Australia which Sri Lanka posted their most significant success in Test cricket.
So with such a vast quantity of young talent flourishing the pride of this proud cricketing nation need not be compromised due to unfair and manipulated selection policies to satisfy the whims and fancies of administrators who are only interested in fortifying their power base in the circuit. By doing so they are only abusing the slogan they have come up with ‘One Team One Nation’.
