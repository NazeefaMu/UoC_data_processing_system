Executive promise!

Politics is sometimes all about timing and being in the right place at the right time, even if it is unintentional. The leaders of the present government, President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will certainly agree.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe happened to be at the right place at the right time when he first assumed that office. That was way back in May 1993, when then President Ranasinghe Premadasa was assassinated by a Tamil Tiger suicide bomber. Then as Industries, Science and Technology Minister Wickremesinghe was also Leader of the House. That is how he came to be chosen as Prime Minister by the incoming President, D. B. Wijetunge.
President Maithripala Sirisena chose to be at the right place at the right time in November 2014, by defecting from the ruling United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) defying President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The rest, as they say, is history: he achieved an election victory that few believed was possible, against all odds as the Rajapaksas had established a stranglehold on most state agencies by being in power for a decade.
Presidential election
In recent weeks, there has been much speculation about the presidential election, supposedly due in 2020. Who will be at the right place at the right time in 2020?
The speculation was triggered initially by Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake. Addressing a meeting at his home turf in Anuradhapura several days ago, Dissanayake said that President Sirisena would be the best candidate for the next Presidential election in 2020 to represent the SLFP.
Dissanayake posed the question as to whether Rajapaksa could contest and provided the answer that he could not. He then argued that the only person from the SLFP who was eminently suitable was none other than President Sirisena. To be fair to Dissanayake, he did say that the President has said that he would contest the Presidency only once.
Dissnayake’s statement fuelled speculation in political circles that President Sirisena might be reviewing his options in view of his public pledges not to run for President again. This is because Dissanayake is known as a strong Sirisena loyalist and one of a handful of parliamentarians who defected along with Sirisena when he left the Rajapaksa government in November 2015 to contest the Presidency.
Controversial statements
Duminda Dissanayake’s statement was followed a few days later by the ‘other’ Dissanayake in the SLFP making a similar statement. S B Dissanayake who himself is a former General Secretary of the SLFP said that a majority of party members were requesting that the President should run again.
“As leader of the SLFP he cannot disregard a request by party members; I hope he will agree to contest,” Dissanayake, who is well known for his controversial statements, said. This statement only added to the rumour mill that the President was keen to contest presidential elections again.
Of course, S B Dissanayake is not a Sirisena loyalist in the calibre of Duminda Dissanayake. The former minister, who had held the portfolios of Sports, Samurdhi and Higher Education, has served under Chandrika Kumaratunga, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena and even in a United National Party (UNP) government headed by Ranil Wickremesinghe. Nevertheless, as a senior SLFPer, his comments were noted with concern.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne, fronting the media for the Cabinet briefing a few days later, was grilled on the issue. He provided an entirely different response. He put a dampener on all speculation, asking “what election?”
His argument was that the government had come to power on a strong pledge to abolish the Executive Presidency and that this would be achieved by 2020. Hence the question of who would be candidate at that time would not arise, Senaratne said.
Senaratne too is known to be a strong Sirisena loyalist. He too left the Rajapaksa Cabinet along with Sirisena in November 2015. Whatever his detractors say, Senaratne has been consistent in demanding the abolition of the Executive Presidency for decades, ever since he was a young leftist in the health sector trade unions, bearing the brunt of the J R Jayewardene Presidency.
As such, it is apparent that even loyalists of President Sirisena are sending mixed messages. Although there was some confusion as to whether the SLFP had formally taken up the position that the President should run again in 2020, this was not so. The matter had apparently been discussed at meetings of SLFP ministers in President Sirisena’s presence but the President had been noncommittal. It certainly hasn’t been endorsed by the party’s highest decision making body, the Central Committee.
It is interesting that this issue is coming to the fore now, three years before any potential election. It is also noteworthy that the SLFP’s would-be rival at any such election, the UNP, has been maintaining a dignified silence on the matter. These two factors may, in fact, provide an understanding about the political undercurrents related to the controversy.
It is no secret that there is a cold war in the SLFP between the Sirisena and the Rajapaksa factions for control of the party. Moves are afoot for the Joint Opposition (JO) to function as a separate political party in the form of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). However, Mahinda Rajapaksa remains a member of the SLFP. The JO does command the support of a majority of members elected under the UPFA banner at the last elections.
Rajapaksa himself has thrown down the gauntlet, saying that 2017 will be the year in which the government is toppled. However, as long as the Constitution remains what it is and an Executive Presidency is in place, he will not be able to return to power as he is now debarred from running for President under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
If, on the other hand, the Constitution reverts to a system of government headed by an executive Prime Minister, Rajapaksa’s political life will receive the oxygen it desperately needs. The statements by the SLFP ministers who want President Sirisena to contest again must be viewed in this context.
Some sections of the SLFP who are keen to see the party kept away from the clutches of the Rajapaksas see the continuation of the Executive Presidency as a means of achieving this. Therefore, they are proposing that President Sirisena should run again, despite the public pledges he has made saying he would not do so. This is also why the UNP is silent on the issue, letting the SLFP fight its own internal battles. To be fair by the President, he has not yet publicly expressed any desire to run again for the Presidency. What he has said in public is that he will not contest the highest political office in the country again.
Election campaign
Abolition of the Executive Presidency was a key aspect of his campaign and that endeared him to the masses and won him the election. After his election victory, he has reiterated his pledge several times: at his inauguration at Independence Square, a few days later at the Dalada Maligawa in Kandy and again a few months later, at the funeral of Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Thera who provided the spiritual inspiration for President Sirisena’s election campaign. However, President Sirisena has also not denounced or dismissed outright the comments made by some of his ministers and that sustains the speculation that he too might be weighing the pros and cons of the suggestion made to him by colleagues in the SLFP.
As a politician, he is entitled to do so but he could also choose to be a statesman instead, and keep his promises to the nation by abolition the Executive Presidency and restoring a system of government that reinstates the supremacy of Parliament. History is usually kinder to leaders who are remembered for what they did, compared to leaders who are remembered for what they did not do.
