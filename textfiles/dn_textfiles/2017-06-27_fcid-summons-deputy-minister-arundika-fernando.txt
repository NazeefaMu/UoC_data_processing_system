FCID summons Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando

 
Deputy Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Arundika Fernando arrived at the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) today to make a statement about his meeting with former ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weerathunga in Japan.
On October 20 last year, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued a warrant written in English through the Interpol for the arrest of Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force.
