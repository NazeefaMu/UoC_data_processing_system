Mitsi's brings real Mediterranean taste

With Sri Lanka’s gastronomy landscape evolving at a phenomenal rate, the country's first-ever Balkan restaurant – Mitsi’s Delicacies – is set to reveal more of its latest culinary secrets at the inaugural Mediterranean Food Festival specializing in Serbian cuisine.
“This Mediterranean Food Festival will be unique as it would be the very first gastronomic experience focusing purely on Serbian culinary delights. We invite all food-lovers to visit our hiding spot in the heart of Colombo, at Bagatalle Road, Colombo 03. We are thankful to our strategic partner – East West Marketing (Pvt.) Ltd., for partnering in this first-ever Mediterranean Food Festival,” said M Mitsi, who founded Mitsi’s Delicacies way back in 2012.
A celebration of fine Mediterranean taste will be open for the general public for a week starting from Saturday, September 9, onwards.
Dejan Paunkovi, the Executive Chef of Mitsi’s Delicacies who leads the culinary team, eagerly awaits to indulge the discerning Sri Lankan restaurant-goer with an array of scrumptious delicacies led by its signature national dish of Serbia - Pljeskavica.
From the very beginning, Mitsi’s goal was to make its customers happy, both through its amazing dishes and family-friendly, personalized service. Through the years, Mitsi’s scaled up from only doing catering and cakes to a full-service restaurant in Colombo city specializing in Serbian cuisine.
“We are proud to supply many of Colombo’s finest cafés with our cakes and dishes, such as Barista, Tea Avenue, Heladiv Tea Club, Odel, Macchiato, Cup Café, London House, Café La Défense, Shanghai Terrace, Chapter One, Double Cheese and we even export our pastries to the Maldives,” said Mitsi.
