No SAITM representation in the new committee

Chairman of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine, Dr. Neville Fernando has pointed out that SAITM representation has been omitted from the new committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena and chaired by Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva to implement the recommendations of the committee previously appointed on the SAITM issue and to consider other issues which have been highlighted.
“We have noted that in the newly formed committee to implement the proposals submitted by Dr. Harsha de Silva, . Among the matters of concern arising from the said proposals are issues concerning graduates, students, staff and the parents of SAITM. In order to ensure that justice to concerned parties at SAITM are met, we urge Your Excellency to cownsider having SAITM representation in this Committee,” noted Dr. Neville Fernando.
“We understand that all other stakeholders in this matter have been given an audience with Your Excellency on Friday November 03. As a main stake holder in the matter, we wish to express our views especially with regards to our graduates and students. Therefore we kindly request Your Excellency to include SAITM Academics and Administration in the said Committee. Since State Medical Parents have been included in the Committee as Observers, we kindly request you to reciprocate the same gesture towards the official parents association of SAITM, which is the Private Medical College Parents Society Ltd. (PMCPSL),” he said in his letter.
“We are in agreement that if standardized private medical education is to prevail in this country, the state should impose regulations and very closely supervise, monitor and support such institutions,” he said adding that all they request is that SAITM be part of the negotiations to look after the interests of graduates, students staff and parents.
