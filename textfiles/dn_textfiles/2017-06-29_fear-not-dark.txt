FEAR not the Dark!

Throughout history mankind has been plagued with many fears. Fear of humiliation, fear of the future and fear of the unknown. The unknown can take many faces. From that fear of the dark and fear of thievery are some of its faces. This fear of the dark has given rise to myths and legends and popular entertainment like X-Files. Arch World speaks to Archt. Manjula Wijeyaratne who believes good architecture can confront and defeat these fears.
“People have insecurities and anxieties. Some are afraid of the dark. Some of them are afraid of thieves. These are all insecurities. When the client is afraid of the dark, we have to analyze - why are they afraid of the dark? Because they cannot see beyond. So what we do is, we make our design in such a way, that there is no hidden corner or hidden area. If he can see, he does not need to be afraid. That is how architecture works.
Then there is fear of thieves - people jumping into the houses. My houses are all open houses. So I try to convince them that a professional thief will come through the front door. So it does not make a difference. Some of my clients want theft proof but you literally can’t. So I tell them it does not work like that. In the houses I have done, only in one instance has there been a problem with a drug addict jumping into the house and taking the hose away. So nobody has told me that there has been an instance of thievery. So you convince the client their insecurity feeling is not as bad as they think it is,” explained Wijeyaratne

Architecture deals with personalities; in fact that is the key to everything in architecture.
“My ability to read my client is what I have uncovered in my practice as well as understanding the site. Reading the site is easy -such as the weather patterns and the sun-path. But reading a human being is difficult.
That is the critical part. Personalizing a three-bedroom for two different clients is the challenge. The place might be the same, but what I would design for one person may be different from what I would design for another person. The site may be the same, but the personality is different. So again it is the talent of the designer,” pointed out Wijeyaratne
Colors and lines bring out the individual.
“When it comes to colors and lines, I use straight, clear cut lines. I use pastel to white colors. Random feature walls come in color - those colors are strong. They are not pastel. Why I use white is, I want the personality of the client to come out. So the vibrancy of the personality should come out. The moment you use fancy colors, the background overpowers the individual. It should be the other way around. The individual should overpower the background - he should be on the pedestal. The talent of the designer is to take all of that, those essences into the design. What one person likes is not what another person likes. You have to get all of it into one design. And that is the talent of the designer. The designer creates the space. The subtle differences in each of their solutions, will be contextual and according to the different personality,” informed Wijeyaratne.

The greatest lesson that he can teach a student is to build a sense of place and a sense of space.
“In each project there is a relationship between the inside and the outside. There are relationships in each of those spaces. You need to make sure those relationships are enjoyable for the design to work,” added Wijeyaratne.
Making a house that feels different at all times of the day, a house that a person will fall in love with and interact with depends on the talent of the designer.
“The context as where the site is, matters a lot. So the sunlight, Sun-path, wind patterns, wind-path and rain pattern, all that comes into play. In addition you have to take into consideration the clients wants and personality. The client’s personality is the key. Making spaces a client will fall in love with in colder climates and in the tropics we live in depends on the designer. So what the designer does for the client is not country specific. So the solutions are relative. So you create architecture which is excellent spaces, excellent light and excellent ventilation that the human enjoys and is highlighted,” said Wijeyaratne
In European countries people try to get natural light as much as possible.
“Natural ventilation is of course a question mark because of the seasons. So especially in the winters in colder climates they try to keep the cold out. In that aspect that cannot get natural ventilation. So, they work with what we called a ‘control climate’ - a ‘conditioned environment’. So they use air conditioning or heating. Natural light, they manage to a great extent in the summers, but the flip side is, in the summers it can get too warm,” stated Wijeyaratne
Timeless beauty is something subjective. What is beauty to one, may not be what is beautiful to another person.
“It is again the talent of the designer. How a designer makes it timeless. It is the person’s ability. Certain designer names have stood the test of time, while other designers fade away. The place and the person are very important. Then I use the appropriate materials - they may be brick, concrete or wood. I have worked with all - brick and cement walls. This is to get the right design. So it is the client and context put together,” summed up Wijeyaratne.
