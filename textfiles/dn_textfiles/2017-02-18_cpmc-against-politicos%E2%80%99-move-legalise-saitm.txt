CPMC against politicos’ move to legalise SAITM

The Centre Against Private Medical Colleges (CPMC) said yesterday that they are against the attempts by certain government politicians to make the SAITM a legitimate institution which is illegal and corrupt in operation.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, CPMC's Co-Convener Dr. Jayantha Bandara said Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella is trying to use his powers to get Deans of Medical faculties on his side.
The Minister has no powers to summon Medical Faculty Deans to get their consent for the SAITM. Deans in eight Medical Faculties have been appointed not to look after the SAITM, but to work for the progress of their faculties. It is revealed that only four of the eight Deans have attended the discussions.
"Although the minister said that deans have agreed to submit proposals on the SAITM, it is wrong. Deans and lecturers have called for the closure of the SAITM," Bandara said.
"Those who supported the SAITM say it has a qualified teaching staff. This is wrong. According to law, state university lecturers and government doctors cannot teach in private medical colleges. However, we learn that there are several such people in the SAITM, including some who have been banished from foreign countries. We will take legal action against them,” he said.
