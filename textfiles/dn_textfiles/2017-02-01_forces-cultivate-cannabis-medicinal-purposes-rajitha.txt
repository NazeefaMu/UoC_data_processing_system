Forces to cultivate cannabis for medicinal purposes: Rajitha

Armed Forces personnel will be deployed to cultivate cannabis in the future. Several local Ayurveda drugs are imported from India which includes Opium, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Dr. Senaratne said the Maha Sangha did not oppose cultivating cannabis and therefore it can be done in the future. “There is no issue in using cannabis as an Ayurveda drug. Problems occur when it is used for smoking like cigarettes,” the minister said at the launch of 12 Pranajeewa Ayurveda products produced by Dr. Sujeewa Vithanage.
The ceremony was held at the BMICH, Colombo. Dr. Senaratne said annually herbal products worth US$ 54 billion are sold in the world market.
“Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa supported the programme to export local Ayurveda products. Bottles containing Pranajeewa still carry photos of him and myself,” he said.
“Twenty Ayurveda products produced by Seth Suwa institution are exported to 20 countries. This helps promote Sri Lankan indigenous products in the world market,” the minister said.
The minister said an international Ayurveda Trade Fair will be held in November while a summit of Alternative Medicines will be held in Colombo. The WHO has granted US $ 50,000 for this. India has produced drugs using papaya juice. The drugs will be imported to Sri Lanka soon and distributed through the Ayurveda Department, he added.
