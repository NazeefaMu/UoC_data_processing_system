[Parliament– (25-01-2017)]

Speaker to probe information leak
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said he would look into as to how public officers provide documents pertaining to bond issues without providing them to the Finance Minister, despite his repeated requests for several months.
The Speaker made this observation yesterday in Parliament in response to demands of government members during the adjournment debate moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the treasury bond issue, following the revelations by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Minister Karunanayake said the Auditor General had provided some documents to JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake, which he had failed to procure, despite his repeated requests for four months.
MP Bimal Rathnayake placed the document in Parliament stating that it was given to him by the Auditor General as a copy of what the Auditor General provided the Finance Minister. “But I was not given such a document,” the Finance Minister said.
MP Hector Appuhami and Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said an investigation should be held in this regard to which the Speaker responded positively.
“I had asked the Auditor General in writing on October 19, 2016 for details as to what was the total loss incurred by the government owing to private placements since 2009 to 2015,” Minister Karunanayake said.
“But he said he could not answer since the Central Bank had not provided the details to him, he said.
The minister said the Auditor General had given these details to a Weekend newspaper.
Arjuna Mahendran not adviser to PM
Former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran has not been appointed as an adviser to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said.
He made this observation yesterday in response to JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake.
When MP Rathnayake said former Central Bank Governor had been appointed as an adviser to the Prime Minister, Minister Samarawickrama said Mahendran has not been appointed to any government position after he was removed from the position of the Central Bank Governor.
Treasury Bond issue a fiction: Kiriella
The calculation of loss incurred from the Central Bank Treasury Bonds sales was imaginary, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister, participating in the adjournment motion in Parliament on the COPE report on the CB Treasury Bonds investigation yesterday, said the Supreme Court dismissed a petition on the matter ruling that the alleged loss was based on an assumption.
The minister argued the purpose of COPE is “naming and shaming” and not to institute legal action. “Today, the role of the COPE has been misunderstood. Last year there was a four day seminar conducted by four senior UK Parliamentarians on oversight committees. I asked them whether they have any experience on filling a case against a person based on a revelation before the COPE. They said court cases are never filed for any issue exposed at the COPE,” he said.
However, the minister said the COPE report has been forwarded to the Attorney General (AG), adding that his advice on the matter would be respected. “We have nothing to hide. About 40 COPE reports came out during the previous government, but none of them was referred to the AG. We referred the first COPE report under our government to the AG,” he said.
The minister said the government opted to public auctions instead of the private placement system, adding that bond deals were made “under the table” during the previous regime.
“Wrong doers should be punished, but Parliament cannot do it. It is the duty of the Judiciary. The Supreme Court in its ruling stated the petitioners were ‘unable to point out any violation of the rules’ when it comes to the bond issue,” he said.
‘Treasury bond scam’ should not be concealed: Amaraweera
No body should attempt to conceal what seems to be a fraud at the Treasury bond issue, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said in Parliament yesterday.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena is seeking possibilities to acquire money or assets of Perpetual Treasuries if it is found guilty by the Presidential Commission appointed to probe into the bond issue.
He said that if the allegations were proved, possibilities would be sought to confiscate any assets of the Perpetual Treasuries that had bought with the money gained allegedly by way of the fraud.
Minister Amaraweera made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the Treasury Bond Issue.
Minister Amaraweera said he went before the Bribery Commission as he was of the opinion that there had been a fraud committed in the treasury bond issue. He said as a public opinion was created over the issue, the President cancelled the extension of the Central Bank Governor’s term. “The President will closely monitor the shortcomings of the government just as he was alert on the bond issue,” the minister said.
He said whoever in the previous government or the incumbent government does a fraud, it is a crime. He said the country is indebted around Rs. 90,000 billion. The UNP, SLFP and the JVP have been in power and all are responsible for them.
“The previous regime engaged in large scale frauds. The present government is also engaged in some corruption. Both are equally wrong,” the minister said.
“The Opposition has the right to highlight the shortcomings of the government, but it should not put the development of the country in jeopardy.” The minister said the Opposition has said that the Country was becoming a colony of India, then a Colony of China.
He said when the ambulances were granted, the Opposition said the RAW was coming to Sri Lanka and the Hanuman bridge was to be reconstructed. However, the Opposition creates lies one after the other when one is proved otherwise. They hold press conferences to tell lies.
JVP overlooked Rajapaksa regime’s corruptions: Kabir Hashim
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) should inquire their own conscience as to why they did not move a motion when the COPE report by Wijedasa Rajapaksa during the previous regime revealed that Rs. 15,500 million had been misappropriated by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said.
The minister said he did not know if the JVP had deals with Mahinda Rajapaksa or was afraid of the dictatorship of the then President that they did not speak about it or did not move a motion on the revelations of the COPE reports.
“But today they speak without fear,” Minister Hashim said. “The biggest fraud of the Provident Fund was committed in 2014 by the Entrust Securities Company. It should be investigated,” he said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the treasury bond issue.
Minister Hashim said the point of the JVP was that there could have been a conflict of interests as the treasury bonds had been issued through a relative of former Central bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran.
“This is not a novel situation. Former Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Kabral’s sister was a director of the Perpetual Treasuries Company during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime,” Minister Hashim said.
“If an investigation is held on this matter, all those transactions during the previous regime should be investigated,” he said.
The minister said the government issued treasury bonds on February 27, 2015.
The process had been operated transparently at an open auction following the law. But some Opposition members speak like infants, he said.
The minister said this was the first time that a government allowed a COPE report being debated in Parliament. He said the COPE report would be directed to the Attorney General without delay.
“If the President appoints a Presidential Commission on the issue, we agree with it. The report of the commission would be directed to the Attorney General too,” Minister Hashim said.
“The government did not object when it was proposed to present the COPE report to Parliament.”
He said the UNP government brought the Financial Management Act in 2002 bringing about financial discipline. But former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Nivaard Kabral acted in violation of the Act and many frauds had been committed during that period. “Those incidents have to be investigated too,” Minister Hashim said.
“The first COPE report of Wijedasa Rajapaksa revealed many frauds, including acting against the tender procedures too. His second COPE report revealed that the loss incurred by the SriLankan Airlines in 2009 was Rs 9,300 million whereas the profit earned by it in 2004 was Rs 4,400 million.
The SriLankan Air Lines Chairman during the period was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s brother-in-law Nishantha Wickramasinghe,” he said.
Minister Hashim said the JVP spoke of the loss of the Provident Fund, but what were the corruptions committed during the previous regime.
“During that period, the Provident Fund had to buy shares of companies at a high rate through the Perpetual Company and sell them at a low rate. Presidential Commissions should be appointed on these incidents too,” Hashim said.
“The biggest financial fraud was committed in 2014. During the period, the directors of the Entrust Securities Company were Isira Dasanayake and Chanuka Ratwatte. It was taken over by the Monetary Board as a massive scale fraud of Rs. 1,200 billion out of the provident fund was committed. The same Company fraudulently obtained Rs. 250 million from Central Bank pensioners. Rs. 600 million was obtained from the Multi Purpose Cooperative Society,” he said.
The minister said it was the responsibility of COPE chairman Sunil Handunnetti to investigate into the issues and direct the reports to the CID and a Presidential Commission.
“The Entrust Company supported the Rugby Sport. It sponsored one team of the Carlton Rugby Tournament,” Minister Hashim said.
“Team captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa was bought at an auction at a rate of Rs 1.1 million. Wasn’t it the money that was robbed from government, while Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Finance Minister. There should be an investigation into the incident,” he said.
‘Some Central Bankers disrupt govt’s progressive path’
A few senior officers in the Central Bank who were henchmen of the former Governor, who don’t need corruption being terminated have provided false details on the treasury bond matter to the Opposition to move an adjournment motion against the government, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said a few officers, including one Deputy Governor and a Board Secretary of the Central Bank and henchmen of former Governor Ajith Nivaard Cabral had provided these baseless details to the Opposition concealing the positive points of the new changes and corruptions of the losses incurred during the previous government.
He said he would reveal the names of those officers who attempt to disrupt the government’s programmes to reveal the previous government’s corruptions and those attempt to damage the image of the President, Prime Minister and the Finance Minister and the government.
The minister said those officers attempt to prevent investments ready to come to the country.
He said those officers, including the Auditor General are independent not to provide the details to others, but to Parliament and the government.
UNP and SLFP on equal footing on corruption: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday in Parliament accused that both the UNP and SLFP are hand in glove when it comes to matters of corruption.
The Opposition Leader making a case against corruption said he fears that if corruption continues at the present rate, it might be the cause for the end of democracy.
He was taking part in the adjournment debate on the COPE report on the Central Bank Treasury Bonds investigation.
“For many decades, we have been talking about corruption, but not a single person has been convicted in the court for corruption. You are fooling the people and this House. The people are getting sick of you all. People feel all of you should be packed off,” he said.
“I am not saying either Ranil Wickremesinghe or Maithripala Sirisena is corrupt, but corruption is rampant. There were many talks about corruptions of the previous government, but what have you done for the last two years with regard to those charges? Nobody has been indicted or convicted by the court. Is it because you are protecting them or is it because your charges are unfounded that you cannot substantiate?” he questioned.
“Corruption is endemic in the country. Every successive government has to be held responsible for this. When elections are held, one party attacks the other on the base of corruption, yet after that, corruption continues as usual,” he said.
Sampanthan called on the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to go into the question of bond sales and ascertain the truth.
“The country has suffered immensely from the bond sales issue. You have no right to swindle the public money,” he said.
“The Central Bank has lost its prestige and status. The CB’s misconduct did not start yesterday or day before. It started a long time ago. During the last regime, the CB was accused for engaging in political propaganda on behalf of the government,” he said.
Action needed if alleged fraud proven: Patali
Action should be taken against those responsible for the treasury bond issue if a fraud has been committed, Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister said the Perpetual Treasuries Company has amassed profits unheard in a short period.
He said a large amount of profits gained that no other company of the same industry could earn, leads to suspicions in a short period.
“It is advisable to investigate the issue,” Minister Ranawaka said. “This government came to power not to protect thieves, but to punish them,”he said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the COPE report on the treasury bond issue.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakim appreciated the appointment of the Presidential Commission on the issue.
“The move to appoint a Presidential Commission should be appreciated,” Minister Hakeem said. “That commission could look into all the deals in detail. If there is anything wrong, those responsible should be punished,”he said.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva joining the debate on the adjournment motion said SLFP members are of the opinion that the wrong doers of the treasury bond issue should be brought to book. “We agree with the findings of the COPE,” Minister Silva said.
“We do not challenge the content of the COPE report. Some officials of the Central Bank have been accused of working against the interests of the country by the COPE report. It is the opinion of the SLFP that if found guilty for the treasury bond sale, anyone should be punished irrespective of their positions,” he said.
Handunnetti thanks MPs
COPE Committee Chairman and JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti yesterday thanked Parliamentarians stating that none denied the fact that a fraud had been committed in the treasury bond issue. MP Handunnetti thanked the members joining the adjournment debate moved by MP Anura Jumara Dissanayake.
“None of the members in the Parliament said the government had not incurred a loss through the questioned treasury bond issue or a fraud had not been committed,” Dissanayake said.
“All had come to a common view over the treasury bond issue. They said that culprits should be punished. Such crimes should not be allowed to repeat,” he said.
Supplementary estimate on President’s expenses
A supplementary estimate was presented in Parliament yesterday seeking the approval of the House to provide additional Rs. 1.8 billion to cover the expenses of the President.
The estimate was presented to Parliament by Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Affairs and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
Rs. 200,000,000 has been sought to implement the Pubudamu Polonnaruwa programme, Rs. 1,540,000,000 to make accounting records of the loans disbursed with regard to the construction of the Nelum Pokuna National Performing Art Theatre, Rs. 100,000,000 to meet the shortfall of provision for rents and local taxes and others, Rs. 250,000 to meet the expenditure for the newly established Delimitation Commission, Rs. 3,000,000 to meet the recurrent expenditure of the newly established Right to Information Commission and Rs. 30,000,000 to meet the shortfall of provision for acquisition of capital assets plant and machinery and equipment.
A note submitted along with the estimate said the supplementary provision does not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate by Parliament. The allocation of such purposes has been been made under the Project of Budgetary Support Services and Contingent Liabilities of the Department of National Budget. It is under the limit of the Approved Annual Budget. Either the borrowing limit or the maximum limit of total expenditure will not be increased due to granting of these supplementary provisions. The purpose of the provision is to facilitate the smooth conduct of public finance management in a more efficient and effective manner.
‘Govt. should hold majority stake of Colombo Port East Container Terminal’
The majority stake of the Colombo Port East Container Terminal should be retained by the government, Port and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday in Parliament.
He was responding to a question raised by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa. The minister said the government called for Expressions of Interests to invest in the East Terminal, but added the mechanism for that has not been decided.
He said even though a Cabinet paper was presented to lease out the East Terminal retaining a minimum of 15 percent to the Ports Authority, the government can increase its stake by negotiating with the investor.
Responding to a supplementary question by JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake, the minister said he stands by his initial position that 51 percent of the stake of the East Terminal should be held by the government.
“The East Terminal is important to the Ports Authority as it is a deep water terminal to which deep-draught ships can enter. We presented a Cabinet paper last week to purchase cranes to it. The proposal was referred to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Management. We hope to start operations in the first 400m in the terminal using these cranes,” Minister Ranatunga said.
MP Dissanayake said Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) handle 34 percent of container operations of the Colombo Harbour, while South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT) handle 28 percent.
He said the share of container operations of the Ports Authority has dropped from 86 percent in 2001 to 38 percent.
