PARLIAMENT

Audit Commission inactive due to delay in passing legislation:COPE
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti yesterday, said if the Government did not intend to present the National Audit Bill(NAB) in Parliament any sooner, to temporarily dissolve the Audit Commission.
The JVP MP opening the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday when the Finance Heads of Independent Commissions were taken up, pointed out that the Audit Commission had been inactive for two long years due to the delay in passing legislation.
“Monthly, Rs 2 million is spent to pay salaries and maintain the 21-member office of the Audit Commission. It was set up under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, with the aim to broaden the powers of the AG to audit public institutions. In contrary, the amendments proposed to the Audit Bill on October 3 by the Cabinet appointed sub-committee, had scrapped the AG’s powers and restricted his purview only to funds taken from the Consolidated Fund, while the AG’s powers would be lesser than what he enjoyed before the 19th Amendment,” he said.
The MP pointed out the work of the Auditor General’s Department had been hampered due to the inordinate delay of the Bill. “The AG’s Department has been paralyzed, but still is working on critical matters such as the hedging deal and Sri Lankan Airlines. In recent times, it had produced full reports on the rice importation scam and coal procurement controversy. The Government has to empower the AG, not weaken him. The Audit Bill saves the the Government’s finances. This legislation was a priority task included in the 100-day work-programme, but it is a bill that had been held for the longest period by the Government,” he added.
Handunnetti urged the Government to explicitly state a date when it would present the National Audit Bill to Parliament.
Commenting on the National Procurement Commission set up under the 19th Amendment, Handunnetti questioned as to how the country could experience a fuel shortage if the Commission had been working properly. “What is the Commission doing? If the procurement is being done properly, could there be a fuel shortage for the CPC?” he questioned.
 
Privileges of MPs blatantly violated:Bandula Gunawardena
Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in the country due a background where even local investors are backing off when many eminent figures in this country and also MPs are being dragged to the FCID and treated as criminals, said Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena.
He made these observations, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018 under 24 financial heads including the President, Prime Minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers, which was taken up last morning in Parliament.
He said that privileges today of Members of Parliament were being blatantly violated. “Parliament is being used to defame and tarnish the image of MPs. This is not a good sign of democracy.”
Gunawardena said when certain MPs are chasing behind and attacking the former President who won the war and made this country safe for its people by not allowing the country to be divided and if they are taking revenge on him, we would never be able to usher in a new era for this country.
 
UNP not agreUNP not agreeable to another 20th Amendment to Constitution:Ajith P Perera
The UNP does not agree with another 20th Amendment to the Constitution that would merely change the election system through Constitutional Reforms process, said Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera in Parliament yesterday.
He said that a president who was answerable to Parliament could be elected, while granting executive powers to Parliament in tern, strengthening the people of the country. He further said that President Maithripala Sirisena was ready to grant all powers to Parliament if not for the Court Order. He added that executive powers should be granted to the Cabinet of Ministers. “There is no such thing as an executive Prime Minister,” said Deputy Minister Perera.
He also said that such a proposal should be tested at a referendum. He added that such a change should be made to solve the ethnic issue. He also added that the rights of the people in the North and South should be protected equally.
He made these observations, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018 under 24 financial heads, including the President, Prime minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers, which was taken up last morning in Parliament.
The Deputy Minister also said that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution had balanced the powers of the Executive Presidency and Parliament to a certain extent.
“Although Minister Samarasinghe said that the Executive Presidency should be retained, there is room for both sides to meet each other halfway,” said Deputy Minister Perera.
He also said that there was no point in investigations if it delayed to take the suspects before Court or cases not being heard. He added that the issue of delay could be solved with an introduction of a new Act in January for hearing of corruption cases.

‘No knowledge of Arjun’s involvement in Bond issue’
UNP MP and COPE Committee member Hector Appuhamy said that he had no objections to an investigation being launched with regard to the telephone conversations with Arjun Aloysius and those conversations being released.
“In fact I had no knowledge of his involvement in the bond scam until I joined the COPE Committee,” he said.
However, it was revealed at the Bond Commission yesterday, that PTL Owner Arjun Aloysius had spoken to to several members of the COPE Committee during the period January 2015, including to Hector Appuhamy on 73 occasions.
Convening a press briefing at the Committee Room 4 in Parliament yesterday, he said Arjun Aloysius was a personal and business friend and he had spoken to him on many occasions. However, he said Aloysius had never asked him for favours and their relationship was strictly personal. “Although we are politicians, we too are entitled to have a personal life and that should not be infringed upon. However, although I might have spoken to Aloysius on many occasions, I have never discussed the bond issue,” he added.
However, responding to a media query on whether he had never spoken of the bond issue, he said, “We may have touched on the topic, but we have not specifically spoken about it.
I am in full agreement with Minister Dayasiri’s request to the CID to reveal these conversations and determine who the perpetrators are. In fact we as the COPE Committee, have signed the COPE report that was handed over to the Commission Investigating the Bond Scam that enabled the investigation.
Hence, no one can point a finger at us. But investigations need to be carried out on all telephone conversations to determine who had been in contact with Arjun Aloysius,” Appuhamy added.
 
Bond issue, network of corrupt persons:Chief Opp. Whip
A group of persons including a number of Parliamentarians are behind the Bond issue, but not a single person, as there is a network of corrupt persons in it, said Chief opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018, under 24 financial heads, including the President, the Prime Minister, Supreme Court Judges and Cabinet of Ministers, which was taken up last morning in Parliament.
“There are other members who have dealt with Perpetual Treasuries chief Arjun Aloysious, as there is a whole network of persons involved in corruption,” Anura Kumara Dissanayake said. “There are Central Bank officials, Business Community members and Politicians involved in this scam. All information on this corrupt network would be divulged without delay,” he said.
He also said that those who were involved with Perpetual Treasuries chief attempted to create havoc at COPE meetings. He added that some of the COPE members attempted to threaten the Auditor General.
He said penalizing such culprits would be in the same manner the government would deal with for those found guilty of other financial frauds. He added that the Presidential Commission Investigating Serious Frauds have completed inquiries on 17 cases, such as the ITN, on the frauds involved in the opening ceremony of the Hambantota Port and on Avant Garde, where investigations are completed and yet what happens to them is anybody’s guess.
Phone calls with Aloysius made before January 2015:Rajakaruna
UNP Parliamentarian Harshana Rajakaruna stated that the questioned telephone conversation with Perpetual Treasuries Chief Arjun Aloysius had been made even before being elected to Parliament.
MP Rajakaruna said that all his telephone conversations with Aloysius were made before January 2015.
He also said Aloysius has been a friend to him as well as to his family. Arjun Aloysius’s grandfather had been a close friend of his father,” MP Rajakaruna said. “They became friends before I was born. Aloycious was known to me since my childhood.
He made these observations yesterday, raising a privilege matter in Parliament during the Committee Stage debate on Budget proposal for the financial year 2018 on a media report on the telephone calls that several members of the COPE had with Arjun Aloycious.
MP Rajakaruna said further that he as a member of the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE), had not discussed matters on the investigations carried out by the same committee with Aloysius. “One has to forget friendships and other relationships when he is a member of COPE,” MP Rajakaruna said. “That was the reason why we all signed the report of the COPE headed by MP Handunnetti and agreed with the recommendations made on it.”
“There is a malicious attempt to sling mud at COPE members,” Harshana Rajakaruna, said. “These types of allegations could be made even against the members of the government, because of the new political culture created by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe.”
‘SLFP has not requested for delay of LG polls’
 As a party, the SLFP had not made any request to delay LG elections, while they intend appealing to the judiciary to permit the elections to he held, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He made these comments in Parliament yesterday, joining the Committee Stage debate on the Budget proposal for the fiscal year 2018.
He said that there is a debate concerning the position the President. With the decentralisation of powers, the President that had been elected into office by the people, should be retained.
The powers that are found to be harmful to the executive presidency, had been revised to a great extent, but it is the stand of the SLFP that the presidency should be retained as the people voted for it,” he said.
Minister de Silva said the danger in handing over powers to Parliament, especially, considering what was happening around the world, we could face a situation where in the case of a weak parliament, a majority would end up being controlled by the minority. “That is why the SLFP has pondered on this issue deeply and taken this decision.”
Commenting on the numerous investigations that are currently underway, he said the Attorney General’s Department, despite not having adequate officers to conduct these investigations, was carrying out a huge task of work.
