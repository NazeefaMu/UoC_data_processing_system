Beach romance  for Salman and Jacqueline

Salman Khan and Jacqueline Fernandez are all set to light the screen on fire with their sizzling chemistry in a romantic beach song in ‘Race 3’.
Recently director Remo D’Souza gave a glimpse of the crackling chemistry of the lead pair of the film marking the occasion of the Mumbai schedule wrap. Just a sneak peek into it caused a roar amongst the audience raising their interest. Now the makers are all set to treat the audience with a beach song set in Pattaya, Bangkok.
The star cast Salman, Jacqueline, Daisy Shah and Saqib Saleem will be heading to the international destination for the upcoming schedule of the film, while Anil Kapoor will join the team for the UAE schedule in March. The sizzling number scheduled to be shot on the beaches of Pattaya will be at par with the hot numbers ‘Jumme Ki Raat’ and ‘Hangover’ from ‘Kick’.
Remo will be choreographing the song during a 20-day schedule, which will also include action sequences. Confirming the details of the song, Producer Ramesh Taurani said, “Yes Salman and Jacqueline will be shooting a romantic number during the Bangkok schedule. We have shortlisted two songs and are yet to decide which one we will finally go with”.
Starring an ensemble cast of Salman, Jacqueline, Anil, Bobby Deol, Saquib Saleem and Daisy, the action thriller is undoubtedly one of the most awaited films. ‘Race 3’ will hit theatres on Eid 2018. TNN
