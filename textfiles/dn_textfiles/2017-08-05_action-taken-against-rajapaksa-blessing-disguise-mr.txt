Action taken against Rajapaksa, a blessing in disguise: MR

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that action taken against the Rajapaksas had turned into a blessing.
Addressing the media at the Dharmapalaramaya in Mount Lavinia on Tuesday (01), he said the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime was inefficient in managing the country and addressing the issues of the general public and also immensely contributed to the failure of the Government.
Rajapaksa said, “Everyone has a weakness. But what makes our regime stand out from the crowd is that we know how to handle our weaknesses better.”
He also questioned the Government about relations between the sale of the Shangrila Hotel and the lands of the Hambantota Port.
The Former President said that he had introduced an act which prohibits the sale of country’s lands to foreign nations, while the ‘Yahapalanaya’ regime had eliminated the practising of the act when they had established a government of their own.
Rajapaksa further said that the Shangrila Hotel was the first investment which had been made in Sri Lanka after the end of the war. He said, “Actions taken against the Rajapaksas will be a blessing for us and it would help the general public in finding the truth.”
