Holder gives Windies hope in delayed England ODI opener

MANCHESTER: West Indies captain Jason Holder led from the front with 41 not out in his side's 204 for nine against England in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
Holder's men have to win this five-match series 5-0 or 4-0 with a tie or no-result if they are to qualify directly for the 2019 World Cup in England.
The no-result part of that equation started to look a possibility when, despite bright sunshine, a wet outfield saw the umpires delay the scheduled start by two hours even though the sun was shining.
In a match reduced to 42 overs per side,West Indies slumped to 160 for seven and were in danger of being dismissed for a lower score than the 176 the World Twenty20 champions managed in their T20 victory against England in Durham on Saturday.
But Holder, who won the toss, at least gave his bowlers some sort of a target to defend in a 33-ball innings featuring five fours.
Rival all-rounder Ben Stokes led England's attack with three for 43 but his nine overs also included two no-balls -- one for height smashed by Holder for four in the last over -- and four wides. AFP
