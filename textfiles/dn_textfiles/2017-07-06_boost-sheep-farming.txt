Boost for sheep farming

The government has taken a decision to import 125 sheep spending Rs.10 million to encourage sheep farming in Sri Lanka. The sheep include 25 male and 100 female sheep.
Cabinet approval was given to the proposal made by Rural Economic Affairs Minister P.Harrison, sources said.
Currently, sheep farming is done at farms of National Livestock Development Board and privately owned farms in the Northern and North-Western Provinces.
