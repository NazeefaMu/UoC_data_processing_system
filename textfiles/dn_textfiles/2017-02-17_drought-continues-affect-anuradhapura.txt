Drought continues to affect Anuradhapura

The drought in Anuradhapura is continuing in spite of few showers experienced in certain areas.
District Secretary R.B Wanninayaka told the Daily News that Divisional Secretaries are engaged in gathering data on drought hit families to grant drought relief. A World Food Programme (WFP) delegation toured in drought hit areas such as Mihinthale, Wilachchiya, Padaviya and Galnewa to collect first hand information on the drought. Wanninayaka said the WFP will decide the mode of granting aid to the victims based on the report of the delegation.
Farmers who have lost their cultivations due to the drought and those who have not cultivated can receive the drought relief. Victimized families can work a few hours in work sites.
"Once we have submitted the data, the Disaster Management Ministry will provide funds to cover the expenses," Wanninayaka said.
He said a fleet of bowsers has been detailed to provide drinking water to nearly a population of 15,000 in Padaviya, Nochchiyagama, Vilachchiya and Thirappane.
NCP WSDB Assistant General Manager S.C Rathnayaka told the Daily News that they were getting additional Mahavali water via Kalawewa to Nuwarawewa, Tisawewa and Thuruvial tanks which Provide filtered drinking water to 300,000 people in Anuradhapura, Mihinthale and Slaiyapura.
