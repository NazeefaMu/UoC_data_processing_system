Reviving tourism

One of the biggest casualties of the 51-day political crisis was tourism, which was booming on a series of high-profile recommendations including the coveted top spot in the hot destinations of 2019 by Lonely Planet. The Australia-based Lonely Planet cited better transport links, new hotels and a growing number of activities as the reason the South Asian Island was chosen for the top spot in its annual “Best in Travel” Awards.
But the political crisis erupted just a couple of days after Sri Lanka gained this ultimate recognition, leaving the tourism sector in the lurch. The crisis also coincided, rather unfortunately, with the launch of Sri Lanka Tourism’s new slogan “So Sri Lanka”. As Sri Lanka’s political developments hogged the headlines in a manner unseen since the days of the conflict, many countries officially asked their nationals to stay away from Sri Lanka, unless travel was essential. This was a huge blow, as tourists cancelled their trips in droves since no one likes to visit countries that are politically unstable.
The loss to the tourism industry per se is not known yet, but the total loss to the economy has been roughly calculated at Rs.220 billion. Even if the tourism sector accounted for just one tenth of this sum, it is still a big amount for an emerging economy such as Sri Lanka. Now we must lose no time in assuring our tourism source markets that Sri Lanka is once again stable politically. There were rumblings that some of our missions were not more proactive in informing Western capitals that the political developments would not have a very big impact on the tourism sector. But now is not the time for crying over spilled milk.
The onus is now on Sri Lanka Tourism, our envoys and embassies/High Commissions and travel/hotel operators to drive home the message that Sri Lanka has regained the status quo and tourists should have absolutely no reason to keep away from Sri Lanka. They must capitalize on the Lonely Planet recognition and other similar accolades that we have gained recently. Yes, this must be a relentless global campaign because we are not the only pebble on the tourism beach. Several other countries have already filled in the vacuum created by Sri Lanka during the last 51 days – now our tourism pundits must try to win back those tourists at least in the next year. There is continuity from the ministerial side of things as well, with John Amaratunga once again donning the tourism hat.
With travel booming in the Asia-Pacific sector, we must look to Asia to give us more tourists. There clearly are gaps in this regard. For example, more Sri Lankans travel to Singapore than the other way around. There is almost a total lack of promotions for Sri Lanka in Singapore and many Asian countries. There are such lacunae in many regions. These must be rectified. Moreover, our tourism authorities must look for more direct air links to key Asian capitals.
Wirth the withdrawal of SriLankan flights from key markets such as Frankfurt and Paris, there is a dearth of direct connections to Colombo from Western Europe. We have to woo more airlines such as KLM, SWISS and Aeroflot, which recently resumed their services to Colombo after a decade or so. That still leaves legacy carriers such as Air France, Lufthansa/Condor, British Airways, Iberia, Air Italy and SAS which have still not resumed or started flights to Colombo. In fact, BIA officials must actively promote the airport at World Route Fairs. The only silver lining here is that many more Asian airlines are literally waiting in the wings to start flying to Colombo including Biman (Bangladesh), US-Bangla (Bangladesh), Thai Lion Air, Indonesia Lion Air, Vistara (India) and Tibet Airlines (China). There are some airlines such as Go Air, Hong Kong Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Scoot, Lufthansa and Air France that bypass Colombo and fly to Male. Our authorities must negotiate with these airlines to do a Colombo-Male rotation like many other airlines do.
Along with the planned expansion of the BIA, we can easily target four million tourists in the next few years. Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka have increased dramatically since the end of the 30-year conflict, from 447,890 in 2009 to an all time high of 2.1 million last year, a figure the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority hopes to double by 2020.
This will naturally call for more hotel rooms. There has been a huge investment in new visitor accommodation. Major international hotel chains, including Shangri-La, Mövenpick, Sheraton, Next, Radisson SAS, Grand Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, Hilton, The Address, JW Marriott, Inter-Continental and ITC have either opened or are opening brand new properties. However, Sri Lanka must also be on guard against over-tourism of certain religious and cultural sites.
At a time when the Sri Lanka Rupee is under pressure, the tourism industry which is a huge foreign exchange earner can be a major economic lifeline. The industry should be given all necessary incentives and concessions to bounce back from the recent upheaval and realise its long-term goals.
