‘PM obtained wider representation  of women in local govt’

For the first time in Sri Lanka, at least 2,000 women will take their seats as members of local government institutions following the forthcoming local council elections, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said recently, addressing an election rally in Kandy.
The honour for this accomplishment should go to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, for the decision to increase women’s representation in governance was taken on a proposal made by the Prime Minister, the Minister said.
He said under the new electoral system, 25 percent representation by women would be mandatory in all local government institutions.
The Minister said during the last Presidential election, the UNP was able to win the Kandy electorate despite the Prime Minister, Chief Minister and four Provincial Ministers and all Pradeshiya Sabhas in Central Province supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This showed that the UNP was destined to win all local councils in Kandy at the forthcoming elections.
