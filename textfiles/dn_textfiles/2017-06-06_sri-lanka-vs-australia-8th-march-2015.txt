Sri Lanka vs Australia- 8th March, 2015

Australia was in a spot of bother as they lost openers David Warner 9 and Aaron Finch17 by the 9th over to be at 41 for 2. Lasith Malinga’s slower ball did the trick to get Warner out, who played too early and scooped a simple catch to the cover fielder, the marauding Warner walked back to the pavilion and the Sri Lankans were cock a hoop. Seekkuge Prasanna who was playing Division 1 cricket back in Sri Lanka, at that time was summoned to Sydney as a replacement to an injured player, he was selected to play in this match, as Sydney was the only ground in Australia which favored spinners. Mathews brought him to the attack with his leg spin and googly and Prasanna bowled two flighted deliveries to Finch who defensively pushed out, the next ball was a googly pitched on the leg stump and Finch was beaten all ends up down the leg side and Sangakkara did the rest behind the stumps. Smith and Clarke started to repair the damage, Smith as usual took his time to settle playing in the V, Clarke was more adventurous and they put on a 134 run partnership for the third wicket, by now the Australians had got the measure of the Lankan bowlers, Sachitra Senanayake with his remodeled action was a shadow of his former self, he was slower through the air and Clarke with his quick silver footwork was severe on him.
A solid foundation was laid by Smith (72) and Clarke (68) and Australia was 175 for 2 in the 31st over.From then on it was sheer mayhem and the Sydney cricket ground was set a light by Maxwell and Watson who was out of form and favour, but was back in his grove quickly.
Glenn Maxwell at that time was the most ferocious hitter of a cricket ball, and he showed his mettle to the Sydney crowd. He brought up his hundred in fifty balls, it was sad that the Sri Lankan bowlers were at the receiving end. It was significant to note that he was spotting the gaps at will and manufacturing the strokes accordingly to yield the maximum results, his strokes were innovative, cheeky and daring to say the least and had the hall mark of Maxwell at his maximum; his forearms, wrists, shoulders and ankles were rotating in unision to give the ball a thumping whack which catapulted the ball to all corners of the Sydney cricket ground. His balance was akin to a ballet dancer. Watson although over shadowed by Maxwell hammered 67 off 41 deliveries.His innings was studded with 7 fours and 3 sixes. The pair went, “hell for leather” in the death overs to smash a 160 run fifth wicket partnership to boost the run rate.The carnage was completed by the evergreen Haddin who struck 25 from 9 balls. The Australians clocked 369 for 7 in their 50 overs.
Sri Lanka had the humongous task of scoring that total.
They started their innings as it was a T20 match, Thirimanne was an early casualty, caught behind fending a rising delivery from Johnson. Sri Lanka of course was the masters of that format, they being the current T20 champions then. Dilshan laid into Johnson from the outset, hammering him for four consecutive fours, two past the bowler and two pulled through mid-wicket, the huge contingent of Sri Lankan fans were jubilant. Dilshan was calling the shots and going at a rapid gallop, making the Australian fielders anxious and nervous, there were some misfields around the circle but their boundary riders were outstanding, saving the run bleed by stopping the boundaries.
All of a sudden Sangakkara joined the party, gathered momentum and was thudding the mid-wicket boundary, picking the boundaries with audacious strokeplay and was outpacing Dilshan who was pegged down by Faulkner’s change of pace, ultimately Dilshan was lbw trying to break the shackles and hitting across the line.
He got 62 sparkling runs. Sangakkara the master batsman that he is showed scant respect to the bowlers by stroking the ball to all corners of the park, to reach his hundred judiciously.
That was his third hundred one after the other however fatigue got the better of him and gave a catch to Finch off the bowling of persevering Faulkner. Mahela Jayawardene did not last long trying to rotate the strike too often went for a suicidal run and paid the price.
Mathews was joined by Dinesh Chandimal who was given the green light at long last by the selectors, after getting some shabby treatment from them, by relieving him of his T20 captaincy for no reason at all.
Chandimal let the bat do the talking by getting a quick fire 50 in a mere 22 balls, his innings was studded with well-placed and well-timed boundaries. Doherty was at the receiving end of Chandimal, an exquisite drive of him was a peach of a shot which whistled to the boundary like the whispering wind. However he was hampered by a hamstring injury, and an eager run chase was cut short, it was the 42nd over. When Chandimal and Mathews who was muscling his shots were going great guns, the light at the end of the tunnel was not far away, but it faded away when Tissara Perera could not keep up the momentum getting out caught by Johnson bowled Doherty for 8.
Mathews was left with the tail and knew it was too tall an order and threw the towel, when he was 35. Sri Lanka ended up at 312 for 9 in the 46th over which was a pity.
There was no point in sending Upul Tharanga at the death because he did not have the big shots, finishing and playing the full quota of overs should have been a good lesson for the Sri Lankan late order batsmen.
Sri Lanka in the final analysis gave as good as they got and thrilled the huge Sri Lankan contingent who were witnessing the proceedings with glee.
The Man of the match was that man Glen Maxwell.
