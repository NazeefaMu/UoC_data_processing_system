Loss calculation imaginary: Kiriella

Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday maintained that the calculation of the loss incurred from the Central Bank Treasury Bonds sales was imaginary. The minister, participating in the adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday on the COPE report on the CB Treasury Bonds investigation said the Supreme Court dismissed a petition on this matter ruling that the alleged loss in this instance was based on assumption.
The minister also argued the purpose of COPE is “naming and shaming” and not to institute legal action. “Today the role of the COPE has been misunderstood. Last year there was a four day seminar conducted by four senior UK Parliamentarians on oversight committees. I asked them whether they have any experience on filling a case against a person based on a revelation before the COPE. They said court cases are never filed for any issue exposed at the COPE” he said. However, the Minister said the COPE report had been forwarded to the Attorney General adding that his advice on this matter would be respected. “We have nothing to hide. About 40 COPE reports came out during the time of the previous Government, but none of them was referred to the AG. We referred the first COPE report under our Government to the AG,” he said.
The minister also said the Government, after it took office ,opted for public auctions instead of private placement system, adding that bond deals were made “under the table” during the previous regime. “The wrong doers should be punished, but Parliament cannot do it. It is the duty of the judiciary. The Supreme Court in its ruling stated the petitioners were ‘unable to point out any violation of the rules’ when it comes to the bond issue,” he added.
