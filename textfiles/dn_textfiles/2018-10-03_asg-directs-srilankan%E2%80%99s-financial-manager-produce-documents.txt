PCoI probing alleged malpractices at SriLankan,  SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka
ASG directs SriLankan’s Financial  Manager to produce documents

Additional Solicitor General Niel Unamboowe PC yesterday directed the Financial Manager of SriLankan Airline Yasantha Dissanayake to produce the documents, emails and receipts in relation to a deal that SriLankan Airlines had entered into with Via Capital company to vet a business plan in 2010.
The ASG told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) probing alleged malpractices at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka that the airline had signed a deal with this company allegedly devouring public money running into millions and important documents with regard to this deal have not been maintained properly.
He also directed the SriLankan’s Financial Manager to inform the Commission as to how tax concessions were granted to this company in question and how air tickets worth over Rs.6 million were issued to European, Asian and Middle East destinations.
It was disclosed at the Commission through the evidence given by the SriLankan Airlines Financial Manager Yasantha Dissanayake that the airline had signed a deal with Via Capital which did not have any experience in vetting the business plan.
Dissanayake said that he did not approve the selection of this company and he was not involved in selecting this company for this purpose.
Dissanayake added that the company has signed a contract with the airline for US$ 450,000 in violation of all conditions.
