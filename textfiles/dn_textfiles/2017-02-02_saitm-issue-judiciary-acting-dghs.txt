SAITM issue is with judiciary: Acting DGHS

The SAITM issue is with the judiciary and nothing can be done about that from the side of Acting Director General of Health Services, Acting DGHS Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said that whatever can be done and should be done for the SAITM issue is with the judiciary. "Anyone can express their ideas freely," he said.
According to Dr. Bandara, if doctors commit any wrongdoing or violate any rule or regulation, the Sri Lanka Medical Council has powers to investigate them and cancel their registration.
No matter whether the doctors were passed out from a state or a private university, investigations are carried out whenever an issue arises.
The law is equal to all, he added.
