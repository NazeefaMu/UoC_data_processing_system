KingTut’s wife finally found?

The life of Tutankhamun has always been shrouded in mystery making for legendary tales and stories. Now it turns out that the wife of Ancient Egypt’s most famous ruler may have been uncovered in the Valley of The Kings.
Egyptologists believe that they have discovered the burial chamber of Ankhesenamum, Tutankhamun’s wife and if confirmed it could also help unravel the final fate of the boy kings’ wife who suddenly disappeared from historical records after her second marriage.
The burial plot was discovered by world renowned archaeologist Zahi Hawass near the tomb of the pharaoh Ay.
Ankhesenamum was married to King Tut and wed Ay after the boy kings’ death.
King Tut became pharaoh at the age of ten in around 1332 BC and ruled for just nine years until his death.
In the same year he became pharaoh he married Ankhesenpaaten, his half-sister.
