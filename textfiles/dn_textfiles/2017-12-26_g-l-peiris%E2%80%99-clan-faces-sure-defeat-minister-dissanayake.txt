G. L. Peiris’ clan faces sure defeat: Minister Dissanayake

The G. L. Peiris clan is facing a sure defeat at the forthcoming local government elections. They don't have any stable political future. I with other SLFP members invite them to join hands with us - the true SLFP - before it is too late to achieve a bright and promising political future, said SLFP General Secretary and Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said so addressing the Anuradhapura district SLFP candidates contesting the local government elections.
The Minister said he was optimistic that the SLFP would win the 18 Pradeshiya Sabhas and Anuradhapura Municipal Council at the polls. The nomination papers of G.L. Peiris' party for Mihintale, Thirappane Pradeshiya Sabha was rejected, thus making it a good omen for us to ensure victory, Dissanayake pointed out.
“The SLFP candidates of the local government elections have been selected carefully, having looked into their history, conduct, discipline and proficiency along with professional aspects acceptable to all in the village. We are determined to win all local government bodies under the leadership of President Mathripala Sirisena,” he said.
He said it is observed that a large number of UNP and JVP supporters are joining hands with the SLFP at village level along with SLFP supporters who were in a dilemma for whom they should work at the elections due to the unwarranted conflicts within the SLFP due to the actions of some hypocrite political elements hoping for the destruction of the long-existing party. “We have a clear vision, political ideology and a promising future as far as we remain intact in the SLFP,” he emphasized.
He said it is a pride to be a true SLFPer to get an opportunity to work hand in hand with the President who will continue to be the leader of the country and the party for years to come. To become an SLFP member of a local government body at this juncture is exciting as such grassroots level politicians are those who will be future leaders and guardians of the party. Therefore, work hard and move closely with the village community whole-heartedly to create a prosperous country, Dissanayake said.
