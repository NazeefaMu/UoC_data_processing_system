DFCC re-launches credit cards

DFCC Bank re-launched their Credit Card range at a special event on March 28 at the Cinnamon Grand, Colombo amidst a large gathering of clients, prominent personalities, Directors, CEOs, top Executives and Business Leaders of the industry.
Adding a nice twist to the event, a fashion show was staged depicting the variety of cards the Bank offers. In a symbolic gesture recognising that DFCC Bank’s current success is based on the vision and efforts of those who have gone before, the first set of Credit Cards were handed over to former Chairman, Rajan Brito, and former CEOs of DFCC Bank Moksevi Prelis, Nihal Fonseka and Arjun Fernando and L.G Perera, former CEO of DFCC Vardhana Bank by DFCC Chairman, Royle Jansz, CEO, Lakshman Silva and DCEO, Thimal Perera. The re-launched range of DFCC credit cards offer 1% cash back on every swipe – a first in the banking sector in Sri Lanka. DFCC Credit Cards reward Cardholders by giving them a chance to experience double the happiness as every swipe gives them a 1% cash back into their account.
In addition to the amazing cash back benefit, the DFCC Credit Cards - Gold, Platinum, Signature and DFCC Premier Visa Infinite Credit Cards have all been given a sleek, new look and have been enabled with Visa Paywave contactless technology and an EMV chip.

We strive to meet these needs and expectations and to leave our customers feeling fulfilled and delighted as every swipe gives them 1% cash back to enjoy their life to the fullest.”
