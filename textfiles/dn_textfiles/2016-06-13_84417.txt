S. Thomas’ enjoy a remarkable season

S. Thomas’ College - Mt.Lavinia, a school maintained their superiority in cricket more often than not ever since they entered into the mainstream of school cricket way back in the eighteenth century whilst producing prominent figures at international level, once again proved their past glory especially in games of longer duration when they finished this year’s Under 19 Division One league tournament quite positively.
S. Thomas’ became one of the two schools out of 36 schools competed in U19 D1 Tournament to remain unbeaten in the two-day league round winning all 8 matches they played (2 innings-wins, 1 outright-win and 5 first-innings wins) within their group. After they were qualified to play in the knock-out second round as the leader of group D with 134.56 points, they beat De Mazenod in pre-quarters and Richmond in quarters before they were knocked out by St. Sebastian’s in one of the semifinals.
Right-handed top-order batsman, Lahiru Opatha scoring 656 runs at 36.44 with two centuries and 124 against Richmond being his highest topped the school’s batting list followed by Sachitha Jayathilake (603 runs), Yohan Mendis (589 runs with a century) and Ravindu Kodituwakku (553 runs with a century).
In the bowling department, Sachitha Jayatilleke completing a good all-round performance claimed 57 wickets at 12.16 including 4 five-wicket hauls. His economy of 1.92 was one of the best in the tournament.
Left-arm Chinaman bowler, Ravindu Thilakarathne with 44 wickets to his credit and Senal de Silva with 30 wickets also did well with the ball in this season.
