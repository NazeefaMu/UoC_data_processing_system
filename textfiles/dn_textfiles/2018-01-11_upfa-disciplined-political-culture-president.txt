UPFA for a disciplined political culture - President

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stated that the SLFP led UPFA will spearhead efforts to create a political culture with high moral qualities and discipline in the country following its victory at the upcoming Local Government polls.
President Sirisena was addressing the inaugural rally of the series of public election rallies organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at Salgado Grounds in Anuradhapura yesterday afternoon.
“I will not allow political representatives who get elected at the forthcoming election to plunder public money, engage in corruption or malpractices and become rich while forgetting the needs of the people” he stressed.
The President said that one of the major reasons which contributed to the defeat of the former Rajapaksa regime in 2015 was the fraud, corruption and injustices committed by some of the members who served in the local authorities at the time.
“No elected political representative has the right to misuse public money. I will always stand firm and take whatever action necessary to stop such acts,” the President said.
Commenting on the clashes that took place in Parliament yesterday morning, the President said although two groups accused each other of thievery the public knew who the real thieves were.
While identifying the opening of the country’s largest multi-purpose reservoir at Moragahakanda as a victory of the people, he said it was sad to see those who did not allocate even a single cent for its development for five years, trying to take ownership.
“Although various governments have promised to complete Moragahakanda during election campaigns, it was the present government which was able to make that promise a reality” he added.
SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, SLFP Vice President Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Anura Yapa and other UPFA leaders attended.
