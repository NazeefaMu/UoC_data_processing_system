AG trying to prevent GMOA from presenting Govt’s stand on SAITM to judiciary

GMOA states in letter to President:
The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to President Mahinda Rajapaksa stating that the Attorney General is trying his best to prevent the GMOA from presenting the Government’s stand on SAITM to the judiciary, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Aluthge said in the letter, the GMOA requested the President to intervene to prevent Sri Lanka from violating norms, ethics and traditions.
Such a violation is a black mark on Sri Lanka at international level.
According to Dr.Aluthge, the Supreme Court judgement given allowing the GMOA to present facts on the SAITM issue is a victory for all who stand for justice and ethics. The judgement also confirmed the GMOA’s right to intervene in the SAITM issue and the GMOA is connected to the issue. The Secretaries of relevant Ministries had not informed the Attorney General about the Government’s stand on SAITM.
“The political fury which acts against all parties which stand for protecting world order,world accepted ethics etc should be defeated and the GMOA will take all possible steps to present the truth about SAITM to the judiciary,” he added.
