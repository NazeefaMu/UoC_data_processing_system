England 9-1 at 2nd day close,  Kohli, hits first ton in England

Birmingham, Thursday: England were nine for one in their second innings, a lead of 22 runs, at stumps on the second day of the first Test against India at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Alastair Cook was out for a duck to what became the last ball of the day when England’s all-time leading Test run-scorer, for the second time in the match, was drawn forward and bowled by a superb delivery from off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin that pitched on middle and hit off stump.
Keaton Jennings was five not out.
India were facing a large first-innings deficit at 182 for eight but skipper Virat Kohli, dropped twice, made a superb 149 his maiden Test century in England in a total of 274.
He was eventually last man out, with India just 13 runs adrift of England’s first innings 287.
This is England’s 1,000th Test and the first of a five-match series.
Kohli, one of the outstanding batsmen of his generation, managed just 134 runs in five Tests at an average of 13.4 on his maiden tour of England four years ago.
But the now 29-year-old India skipper surpassed that total in one innings with a knock of 149 during the second day’s play of the series opener at Edgbaston.
Kohli was on 97 when No 11 Umesh Yadav walked out to bat, with India 217 for nine in reply to England’s first innings 287.
But a late cut four off all-rounder Ben Stokes, his 14th boundary in 172 balls, saw Kohli to a 22nd Test hundred in what is the first of a five-match series.
However, England slip fielder Dawid Malan dropped Kohli twice, on 21 and 51, with James Anderson and Stokes the unlucky bowlers.
Kohli then topped his 2014 series total in the one knock with a two off leg-spinner Adil Rashid.
He was last man out when, cutting at Rashid, he was caught at backward point by Stuart Broad.
In total, Kohli batted for nearly five hours, faced 225 balls, including 22 fours and a six.
He dominated a last-wicket stand of 57 with Umesh Yadav, who made just one, with India just 13 runs adrift at 274 all out. AFP
