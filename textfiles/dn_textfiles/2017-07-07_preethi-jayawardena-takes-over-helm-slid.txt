Preethi Jayawardena takes over helm of SLID

The Sri Lanka Institute of Directors (SLID) held their Annual Membership Meeting (AMM) with over 85 members present at this momentous evening when the leadership of the Institute changed hands.
Shiromal Cooray completed her term as Chairperson and at the AMM Preethi Jayawardena was elected unanimously as the new Chairman of SLID for the year 2017/18.
The other officials elected to the Council of members for the year 2017/18 were Rasakantha Rasiah as Senior Vice Chairman, Faizal Salieh as Vice Chairman and Dilani Alagaratnam, Aroshi Nanayakkara, Dinesh Weerakkody, Prakash Schaffter and Vish Govindasamy as Council Members. Dilshan Rodrigo was elected to fill the vacancy created by Council Member Nilanthi Sivapragasagam.
The Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ending 31st March 2017 were presented and approved by the membership.
In his first address as Chairman of SLID, Preethi Jayawardena acknowledged the many contributions made by past Council Members to the development of SLID.
Seed capital to establish and develop SLID as an independent body was provided by the Carsons Group, Chemanex, Hatton National Bank, Jetwing Group and John Keells Group.
The new Chairman said the promotion of gender diversity within SLID has helped bring the organization even further with more drive and fresh ideas.
Speaking of the economy of Sri Lanka, Jayawardena stressed on the importance of foreign direct investment and how it is essential for the expansion of the country’s economic growth.
He said, “The abundance of resources present in Sri Lanka and the converse lack of foreign funding do not match up well, given the potential for growth displayed by our private sector.”
Chief Guest for the evening, Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama thanked SLID for the contributions it had made in the improvement of the economy of Sri Lanka. He asserted that the prevailing government strongly believes that 'the private sector is the motor of growth'. He urged the members of SLID to continue the growth in their companies which would help the country as a whole.
Dr. Amunugama explained that Sri Lanka’s unique social structure makes way for a different structure of ownership which is different from the known structure of where the rich and powerful run all of the private sector, to one where many invest and participate at the top level of the private sector and collectively reap the benefits of its growth, moving the private sector regime of Sri Lanka from capitalistic moguls to that of modern corporations.
He further said that the prevailing government is looking into ways to further push this model on the population to encourage collective growth. The issue faced however is how to keep the returns from investment at a more attractive rate than offered by the prevailing savings system offered by banks.
Speaking on the opportunities opening up for the growth of trade and industry in the Asian region, the Minister pointed to the regional growth in population, especially in India which has an rapidly increasing middle class. This of course, opens many doors in terms of markets to enter and profit from for the private sector of Sri Lanka.
Dr. Amunugama made it a salient and recurring point in his speech to emphasize Sri Lanka’s strategic positioning in the midst of the Indian Ocean which is the country’s prized asset that needs to be better utilized.
In order to take advantage of its strategic position, Dr. Amunugama spoke of the free trade agreement between Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh.
Even more importantly, he said that the Government is currently in the process of negotiating free trade agreements with Pakistan, the remainder of the SAARC region and China, as well as a conditional trade agreement with Japan.
