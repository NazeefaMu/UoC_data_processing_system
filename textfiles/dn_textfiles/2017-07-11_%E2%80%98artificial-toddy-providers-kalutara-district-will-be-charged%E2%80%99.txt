‘Artificial toddy providers to Kalutara district will be charged’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed law enforcement officers to take legal actions against artificial toddy transporters to the Kalutara district from the North Western Province, Health Ministry spokesman said.
Minister Senaratne said several politicians in the previous regime received around Rs. 250,000 per day from liquor manufacturers for assisting them to transport the artificial toddy without any problem from law enforcement officers.
The Minister was speaking at the District Development Committee Meeting held in the Kalutara district recently.
Minister Senaratne said a new programme will be commenced next week covering the entire Kalutara district to raid illegal liquor and drugs. “An investigation is now being held into transportation of artificial toddy. Law enforcement officers connected to the racket will be revealed and punished them,” he said.
Minister Senaratne said he informed about the racket to the Cabinet.
