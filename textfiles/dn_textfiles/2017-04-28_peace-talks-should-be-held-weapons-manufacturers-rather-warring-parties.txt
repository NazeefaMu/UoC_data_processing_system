Peace talks should be held with weapons manufacturers rather than warring parties: President

Discussions on peace making should be held with the people who manufacture weapons but on the contrary, it has always been between the parties involved in the conflict, observed President Maithripala Sirisena.
“I believe that for lasting peace and harmony in the world, rather than having discussions with the parties involved in the conflict, the attention should be given to the weapon manufacturers,”he said.
The President was addressing the inauguration ceremony of an international conference titled “Islamic Reality and Contemporary Challenges” organised by the Sri Lanka Islamic Centre in collaboration with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs D’awah and guidance of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
President Sirisena said there would not have been much of a conflict in the world if the people who manufacture weapons focus on an alternative mechanism to earn profits.
“Peace can be prolonged and strengthened if every state leader bans weapons and stop manufacturing them in their own countries,” the President said.
He further said that the topic of the conference was relevant to the prevailing situation in the world.
“There are a plethora of challenges among human beings for survival such as cultural, administration, religion, education and language. All religions expect their followers to move forward as good persons with esteemed character. All the religions and religious leaders preach peace and harmony among the people,”President Sirisena said.
The President further said that people today fight for power and wealth. As a result, conflicts and issues erupt between them. The world always focuses on who did it rather than looking for ways how the conflict was initiated.
President Sirisena also noted that we need to build a society where every person would respect each other and spread peace and harmony not violence and extremism.
