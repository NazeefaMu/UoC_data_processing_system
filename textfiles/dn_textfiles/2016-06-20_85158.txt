ODI series against England on Rupavahini

Indian company Sporty Solutionz has sublicensed the media rights in Sri Lanka for the Sri Lanka cricket team’s limited overs series in England.
Rupavahini Corporation, the state-owned national broadcaster, has acquired the free-to-air broadcast rights for the territory. Multiplatform operator Dialog has secured the pay-TV rights to broadcast the series on various platforms for the sub-continent island.
“Sri Lanka, like India, is a country crazy about cricket. We take pride in bringing in the best cricketing action to the sports lovers in the Emerald Island,” Ashish Chadha the chief executive of Sporty Solutionz, said. “The young Sri Lankan side is going through a transitional phase after the Jayawardene-Sangakkara era.
“The nation has a good talent pool and the series in England has generated tremendous interest in Sri Lanka.”
Sri Lanka’s summer tour of England comprises three Tests matches, five one-day internationals, and a one-off Twenty 20 international.
Hosts England won the Test series 2-0 in an emphatic manner, with their dynamic wicketkeeper-batsman Jonny Bairstow winning the man of the series. The one-day series begins on the 21 June.
