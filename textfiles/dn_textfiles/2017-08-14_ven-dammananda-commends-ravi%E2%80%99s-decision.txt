Ven. Dammananda commends Ravi’s decision

Asgiriya Chapter Chief Secretary Ven. Medagama Dammananda Thera yesterday commended the decision of former Foreign Ravi Karunanayake to step down even though he was not found guilty of any wrongdoing.
Dammananda Thera told MP Karunanayake that the decision he made was an example and added that an independent investigation would finally reveal who was right and who was wrong. Former Minister MP Karunanayake called on the Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya chapter at Kandy yesterday.
Dammananda Thera said it was important to allow the investigation into the bond issue to continue without any interference. The Thera said that if politicians were taken to task due to personal animosities and petty political agendas, it could not be condoned.
MP Karunanayake said he hoped his decision would pave way for a new political culture in the country. The former minister said he made the decision to ensure the unhindered progress of the unity government under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister. He said the truth would be revealed in the near future.
