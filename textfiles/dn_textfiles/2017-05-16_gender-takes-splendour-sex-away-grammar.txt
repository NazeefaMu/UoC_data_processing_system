Gender takes splendour of sex away from grammar!

Woo-hoo hoo, grammar has sex! I mean a sex. You know, more than one sex. Meaning the sexes. Few traces of gender remain in modern English. Are we surprised? “No sex please, we’re Sri Lankan.” Well, but we are talking English here. I’m not British, but I am speaking their language. And just to show off I am exaggerating their awesome, plummy accent.
I am sure you must have noticed an interesting trend. Many writers, conscious of sexist language, are now using ridiculously invented gender-neutral pronouns. ‘Hir’ is now used in place of ‘his/her,’ and ‘zie’ is now used in place of ‘he/she.’ This is intended to show sensitivity for people who are transgendered as well as people of either gender.
Clearly, there have to be gender-neutral or socially conscious insults available to use when dealing with the ‘jack-assery’ of day-to-day living. Other than pronouns ‘he/she, his/hers,’ much of the genderization on the English language is being wiped out in the name of political correctness. Journalists call it a conspiracy by liberation grammarians ‘Benders of Gender.’
Sexism is a political issue today. It affects the language we choose to use. Many people speaking or writing English today wish to avoid using language which supports unfair or untrue attitudes to a particular sex, usually women. Speakers of English are slowly adjusting to the pressures for a more neutral language. Fortunately, this change is being accompanied by a measure of humour, which, fortunately, is common to both sexes!
Questions and criticisms of sexist language have emerged because of a concern that language is a powerful medium through which the world is both reflected and constructed. Some have claimed that the use of generics - such as the word 'mankind' to refer to both men and women - reinforces a binary that sees the male and masculine as the norm and the female and feminine as the 'non-norm.'
The women libbers, sorry I mean the feminists or liberationists, insist that certain language can help to reinforce the idea of male superiority and female inferiority. What is now termed ‘sexist’ language often suggests an inherent male dominance and superiority in many fields of life. Male pronouns, he, his and him are used automatically even though the sex of the person is not known. "A student may wish to ask his tutor about his course". Or we say: "Who's manning the office today?"
Do you know all actresses are now actors. When grouping the sexes I refer to the whole shebang as ‘thespian.’ A stewardess is a flight attendant. An heiress is, well, damn lucky. In the old days everyone referred to ‘postmasters’ and ‘toastmasters.’ Just imagine introducing Aunty Fifi to the wedding guests as the ‘toastmistress.’
Now I ask, is a woman cricketer going in to wield the willow a batswoman, a batter or a batterer? Also will the name of the fielding position ‘Third Man’ have to be changed because of feminist pressure?
Little kids still drop a few sex bombs – fireman, policeman and cowgirl. They’ll grow up and homogenize their language choices soon enough. ‘Firefighter’ seems a pretty effective alternative. So would ‘Police Officer’. But ‘cowgirl’ would have to find a more suitable term than ‘cowpoke.’ Imagine a crowd cheering a woman bronco rider yelling in unison: “Ride ‘em cowpoke!”
How far will the ‘de-sexification’ of the English language go? What will we fall into when we cross the road if not an open manhole? Will schools stop breaking the year down into semesters? Switch to ovesters? Or just ‘esters?’ There could be three per year and they’d have trimesters. Apt, since getting through high school can be as painful as childbirth.
And someone will have to tell the world that certain Sri Lankan colloquialisms are ideally non-sexist such as ‘oyar’ (you) and ‘meya’ (this person). And for heaven’s sake and for your own health never refer to a woman as ‘araki’ or ‘meyki’.
No you don’t say ‘mankind’ anymore so it’s humanity. Or man-made which is ‘manufactured’ and ‘manpower’ which is workforce or personnel. There are also work-hours and no-man hours. And we have no founding fathers, only pioneers and forbears.
While the English language is as devoid of sex as a Vestal Virgin’s life, French and Spanish are rife with it. The French distinguish between feminine and masculine words with ‘la’ and ‘le’ and the Spanish ‘el’ and ‘la’ among others. As the French say, there are three sexes – men, women and clergymen.
Particular word endings also determine gender, and many languages add a third non-male, non-female gender called ‘neuter.’ But all of this is far beyond my knowledge.
Sexist language also presents stereotypes of both females and males, sometimes to the disadvantage of males, but more often to the disadvantage of females. This sexism is seen universally in all languages. All right, take the example of ‘master’ vs ‘mistress’ to make the point. There are unequal connotations that surround these two matching terms, and to the detriment of those born female. ‘Master’ has strong and powerful connotations, while ‘mistress’ decidedly does not.
For example, when you switch gender while describing ‘Headmaster,’ you must concede that calling a top honcho schoolmarm a ‘Headmistress,’ might very well be likening her to the chief concubine of Sheikh Ali Labjar. Headmistress! Ha, ha! Come to think it, for those with dirty mindsets it does have some suggestively slang sexual undertone about it as well.
Maybe the English language has less sex – or maybe it has an elevated view. It has neutered the masculine, eliminated the feminine. We’re inching closer to gender subjugation-free language. To illustrate the point there is the story of a local women's lib speaker who while addressing a large group said: "Where would man be today if it were not for woman?" From the back of the hall came a male voice: "He'd be in the Garden of Eden, eating rambuttan."
The libber shot back: “When God made man, SHE was having one of her off days.” See? Who needs sex?
