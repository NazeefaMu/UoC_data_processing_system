Death threat on SLTB driver

A private bus owner along with several of his thugs had allegedly threatened a Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) bus driver with death at the 6th mile post in Minipe, warning him to run his bus much later than the private buses.
The Hasalaka Police arrested the suspects yesterday. They were to be produced before the Mahiyangana Magistrate. The Police arrested the suspects based on a video footage recorded by a commuter in the SLTB bus.
The private bus owner with several of his thugs had levelled the threats armed with clubs around 6 am last Friday.
The SLTB bus was bound to Hasalaka Kolongoda from Randenigala. The SLTB bus which is operated by the Hasalaka Bus Depot, operates as a school bus during the morning hours. However, the Police said that there were many complaints against the thugs who level threats against public servants hindering their service.
According to the people of the area, the private bus owner owns several buses, while two buses operates on the Randenigala road without route permits.
