Govt. awaiting positive response from Saudi Arabia

The government is awaiting for a positive response from Saudi Arabia in relation to the Sri Lankan woman who is to be stoned to death, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said in Parliament today.
She said that the government has intervened in this matter to get a favorable response from the Saudi Arabia via the Foreign Ministry. She made these observations in parliament today in response to a question raised by UNP parliamentarian Budhika Pathirana. On an early occasion the Parliament was told the Foreign Ministry, its staff and the Embassy in Saudi Arabia were working hard to get the Sri Lankan woman free from the death sentence. Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake speaking during the committee stage debate on the budget under financial heads of Women and Child Affairs Ministry said the offence which the woman concerned has to be confirmed by four eye witnesses who should be holy Muslim men according to the Sharia Law. "Only after such a confirmation, the execution can be carried out according to their law." Deputy Minister Ramanayake said. "Therefore it is questionable if there is sufficient evidence to suggest she had committed adultery as per the Sharia law." He also added that the government is discussing with USA to find a solution for this matter. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna parliamentarian Vijitha Herath joining the same debate said it was this social and economic system in the country that had put the women to such a fate. He added that it was this economic system that has forced the woman to go for domestic work in Middle East. He added that the economy of the country has to be developed to a level that would encourage those women go for Middle East to stay back in the country. UNP parliamentarian Hirunika Premachandra speaking at the debate on the same financial head said the country should be ashamed of sending women abroad to work as domestic aides. She said sending women to Middle East should be banned. Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena stated that the punishment is a crime against women all over the world. He added that the Women and Child Affairs Ministry and the Foreign Ministry should intervene into this matter to bring about a positive result. City Planning and Water Supply Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle stated that in Sri Lanka there were no laws against adultery. She added that however if Sri Lanka failed to get this sentence lifted, the country would have to take a decision on sending our women to Saudi Arabia for employment.
