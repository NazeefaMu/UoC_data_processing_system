Trial against Prasanna, wife  re-fixed for September 13

The case filed against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife was yesterday re-fixed for trial by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Champa Janaki Rajaratne, the prosecution sought a further date since the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General was not present in court. Accordingly, the case was re-fixed for trial on September 13.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on threatening a businessman demanding the balance of Rs. 64 million.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court decided to proceed the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek, who was evading courts from the beginning of investigations. MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are on bail now.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek on committing offences between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015. In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as court productions against the three accused in the case.
