Deshapriya urges voters to register in Electoral Register 2017

The Electoral Commission urges all citizens eligible to vote to ensure that their and their family members' names are inserted in the Electoral Register of 2017 in response to the noticeable drop in voter registration this year.
In a press release issued by the Office of the Election Commission, Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said:
“A noticeable drop in registering as electors in the Electoral Register for 2017 has been observed among the general public in the City of Colombo, District of Colombo, and mostly other urban and semi-urban areas and also in rural areas and in estates. Lack of interest among the citizens in registering as electors or failure to submit the enumeration forms in time or due to the floods or other reasons can be cited as reasons for the noticeable drop of names to be inserted in the Electoral Registrar of 2017.
Therefore, the Election Commission requests all the citizens who are eligible to be registered as electors to ensure that their names and the names of their families are inserted in the Electoral Registrar of 2017.
" Draft of the Electoral Registrar for 2017 is now displayed in the website of the Election Commission www.elections.gov.lk. The Electoral Register of 2016 and the list of names that have been omitted from the Register for 2017 and the list of names that have been added to the Register for 2017 are now available for inspection at all the District Secretariats, Divisional Secretariats, Offices of Local Authorities and all the Grama Niladhari Offices.
If a name of an eligible citizen has not yet been enumerated for the Electoral Register for 2017, requests for inclusion could be submitted to the relevant District Election Offices until September 6, 2017.
