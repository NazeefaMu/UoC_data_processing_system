Fleetwood defending French Open title at ‘different’ Ryder Cup course

Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, Wednesday: Defending champion Tommy Fleetwood is keen to land an early blow for Europe ahead of September’s Ryder Cup when he tees off at the French Open on Thursday.
Jon Rahm of Spain and Fleetwood, two of Europe’s leading stars, line up in a strong field at Le Golf National, the widely-acclaimed course which hosts the 42nd Ryder Cup in just under three months’ time.
World number 10 Fleetwood, runner-up at the US Open earlier this month, said he was glad to be back at the challenging French course but noted that it had a new look about it.
“The course seems so different. It’s so set up now for the Ryder Cup in September... it’s like difficult to get your bearings a bit,” said the 27-year-old. Spaniard Rahm, ranked fifth in the world, is another man expected to spearhead the European Ryder Cup challenge. But the 23-year-old said he was looking forward to playing the French Open, not as a scouting exercise for the Ryder Cup, but because it remains one of the top events on the tour and a personal favourite.
“It’s probably one of my favourite courses all year, not only on the European Tour but worldwide,” he said.
“It’s a great golf course but it’s very difficult. It’s fair, you can think your way around it and if you’re smart enough, you can actually get a score but to win you need to play extremely good.”
Rahm said he had originally thought there would be more top Americans at the course, where they will be attempting to win the title on European soil for the first time since 1993.
“I thought there were going to be at least four or five,” he added.
“And if it wasn’t the players that were already in guaranteed, maybe the people who are on the edge (of gaining a Ryder Cup place).”
Justin Thomas, the world number two, is the top American contender in what he said was a “tremendous” French Open field this year. AFP
