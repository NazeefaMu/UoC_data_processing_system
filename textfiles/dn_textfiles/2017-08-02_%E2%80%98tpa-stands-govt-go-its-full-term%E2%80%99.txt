‘TPA stands by govt to go its full term’

The Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) yesterday said that they would stand by the Government.
“The Government will go on until 2020," TPA Deputy Leader, Hill Country New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister Palani Digambaran said.
Addressing the media at his ministry, Digambaran said the Joint Opposition, regardless of their rhetoric, have not made a significant impact on the Government.
The minister called for the media briefing to explain a recent incident where he was accused of intimidating reporters of a private television channel. Digambaran said the television channel was on a mudslinging campaign against him. Former MP Sri Ranga was heading the campaign given their political differences, he said.
"I am not a leader who believes in keeping his people trapped in line rooms," Digambaran said. The ministry works on a plan to provide estate workers with seven perches of land with deeds and a house, he said.
“We will build 160,000 houses. It cannot be done in a day. But the television channel is trying to say that I am not doing any work. We will hand over 3,000 houses to people soon," the minister said.
When asked about corruption allegations against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, he said legal action should be taken against wrongdoers, whether they are from the Government or Opposition.
