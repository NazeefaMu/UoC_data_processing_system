International broadcasting conference from August 2

The Asia-Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) General Conference 2018 will be held from August 2 - 4 in Colombo, organised by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini (TV) Corporation.
The AIBD was established in 1977 under the patronage of UNESCO. It is hosted by the Government of Malaysia and the Secretariat is located in Kuala Lumpur.
The AIBD is mandated to achieve a vibrant and cohesive electronic media environment in the Asia-Pacific region through policy and resource development.
The Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation is a member of AIBD. As such, it has enjoyed the benefits provided in technical assistance and training opportunities.
At the 2017 Asia Media Summit held in Qingdao, China, the member countries unanimously decided that Sri Lanka should host the 44th Annual Gathering and the 17th AIBD General Conference in Colombo.
By hosting this international media event, the SLRC will be able to accomplish its development goals in various sectors such as, novel policy planning and implementation for the country's broadcasting sector, providing new exposure to the tourism sector to promote travel and tourism among the 26 member countries of AIBD and an opportunity to create awareness about Sri Lankan government's efforts towards reconciliation.
During the conference the SLRC will meet representatives from prime broadcasters in the world to build mutual partnerships, to obtain other lucrative opportunities for the SLRC and further democratic measures such as the Right to Information Act which promotes good governance.
As the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation commissioned a new channel in the Tamil language to promote reconciliation and unity among the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim population, this conference will be an opportunity to promote the Sri Lankan government's efforts towards reconciliation and good governance.
About 60 delegates including ministers, high profile government officials, heads of media stations and other guests will attend the conference.
