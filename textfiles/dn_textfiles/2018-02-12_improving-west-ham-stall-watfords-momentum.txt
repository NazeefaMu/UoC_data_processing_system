Improving West Ham stall Watford's momentum

LONDON, Saturday - West Ham overcame Watford 2-0 in a game with plenty of chances at the London Stadium on Saturday, putting the Hammers level on points with their opponents in the middle of the Premier League table.
Watford had been looking to maintain their recent momentum after their 4-1 midweek win over champions Chelsea.
But it was the home side’s Mexican striker Javier Hernandez who broke the deadlock in the 38th minute, heading in his seventh goal of the season at the far post after winger Michail Antonio wove through the Watford defence and sent in a long cross from the left.
West Ham’s midfielder Marko Arnautovic, back in the side after a hamstring injury, teamed up with new Portuguese signing Joao Mario to tug the Watford defence out of shape and create numerous chances throughout the game.
