Run for charity

Colombo City Running (CCR) is hosting a 10km run on Sunday, July 29 to raise awareness and funds for the Army Para Athletic Association.
Kicking off at 6.30am on the route of the run will mirror the running leg of the Colombo Ironman in October 2017, which encompassed a start from Galle Face Green and followed the Port Breakwater with a return along the same path.
Additionally, CCR is providing an option of a much shorter, 5km run for those so inclined. A community-based recreational running group, CCR aims to promote a healthy lifestyle through running while also helping build a communal spirit and connection through running-related activities. Partners for the event include Asiri Hospitals, Galle Face Hotel, Anim8, Yes FM and RBN and SIS energy drinks and with Vision Care, Zesta Tea, Wurth Sri Lanka and Child Eye Clinic being the sponsors.
An organizer from the Colombo City Running Group Dr. Amila De Alwis said “We are pleased to join up with the Army Para Athletic Association to raise funds for a very noble cause. At the same time, this run will showcase the panoramic Port Breakwater, an area that we have received special permission to use for the run,” he said.
Dr. De Alwis requested the interested to register without delay since the event is limited to 400 runners only and early registrants will receive a wonderful event souvenir t-shirt.
