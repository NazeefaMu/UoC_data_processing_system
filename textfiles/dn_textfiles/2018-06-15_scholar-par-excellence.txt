A scholar par excellence

When the lives and works of our sagacious citizens who had sought and strived not to yield in their efforts to bring joy into the lives of the working classes, farmers and also to uplift the lives of the poor, Fr Peter A Pillai OMI occupies an exalted position.
He began his schooling in Jaffna at his father’s school. His blessed parents (Joachim and Anna Pillai) never dreamt they would bequeath to the Roman Catholic Church - three men of God, Fr Peter, Bishop Emillianus and Brother Cadjethan. He joined St. Benedicts College.
A scholar par excellence, Fr Pillai passed the junior Cambridge and senior Cambridge with distinctions in all the subjects, a first class at the BCs Honours exam, a double first in Mathematics at the London BSc and later obtained a BA which matured into an MA (Cantab) and MSc London.
He joined the OMI novitiate and later was ushered into the Oblate International Scholasticate and Angelicum Pontifical University in Rome. He was awarded the PhD for his thesis on “Bhakthi“and soon after DD from Rome. He returned to the island in 1936 and joined St.Peter’s College. Then he was appointed Warden of Aquinas Hall, the University Catholic Students Hostel.
He was a humble person and did not want his stupendous educational milestones to be mentioned before or after his name, except the name of his beloved order OMI. Rev. Dr Peter, A Pillai OMI, MA, MSc, PhD, DD wished that he be called PA Pillai, OMI.
In 1936, the British press called him the most learned priest in the British Empire. In 1936, the sun never set on the British Empire. When he set foot on his motherland, he had a vision. To reach that vision he set forth on a mission.
A million words will not suffice to publish his speeches, lectures and articles that enlightened and gave courage to many here and abroad in trying to mend the inequalities that exist between human beings who live in this world.His friend was Dr. N. M. Perera and respected the middle path policies of the Samasamaja Party. Socialism was good he said.
He said that man was privileged in possessing an immortal soul and intelligence to know right and wrong. He lost it in the Garden of Eden. However, God loved him so much, that he gave us a reprieve. He gave his son to die for us. Once again we became children of God.Fr Pillai brought out the infirmities of man. He said that ancient and modern civilizations many gifts of God in one’s own homeland were enjoyed by the affluent.
Lord Jesus spoke about this in his Beatitudes and his words about the rich man and the utter impossibility of the elite to enter through the gates of heaven. He strived to show the powers that be the inequalities that exist in mankind in the world and in our own country. He spoke fearlessly on the tragedy of Apartheid in South Africa segregation of God’s children due to colour, horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He spoke on how conquerors played dice with helpless nations.
‘This is mine, this is yours policy.’ They had said God was white. About our own land, Fr Pillai spoke and wrote on the scourge of malaria, poverty, subjugation of the poor by the rich and politicians. The latter preferred a not so educated populace.
Reasons were obvious. Governance was easy. He lauded C. W. W. Kannangara (the father of free education). Fr Pillai is a forgotten crusader. He was the knight who fought for social justice. At times he was alone. A cartoon shows him holding a placard with the words social justice, all alone in the midst of snow capped noontime. He was the pioneer who spoke on social welfare, dignity of labour and about the masters of the working classes who showed goodness while hiding questionable agendas. He pleaded for a minimum wage structure and the employees’ provident fund and the right to strike for a just cause.
His words and thoughts are graphically shown during a college carnival. He had been told that the owner of a chain of cinemas around the island and a few of his officers were seen doling free balcony and Outer Dress circle tickets-acceptable at all his cinemas to the students. He had wanted to show that there was full occupancy or patronage in his halls whereas only a very few had been at these cinemas, manned by black legs. Employees were on strike, a very just and fair strike.
The chairman was a very valuable old boy, a benefactor of the highest Caliber. Fr. Rector made an announcement. All doled out cinema tickets should be returned to him or to those who gave them and he said that no student should patronize these cinemas till the strike is over. Later, we heard that this magnificent employer had gone up to the rector and said that he would accede to all the demands of his employees, immediately. A beautiful gesture welcomed by his employees and the entertainment prone citizens. He continued to be a benevolent old boy.
He became rector of St. Joseph’s College on December 8, 1941. He never stopped speaking about that day. It was the feast of the Immaculate Conception. He belonged to the order of Mary Immaculate. He succeeded Fr Legoc who left us due to a road accident.
He was a rector for twenty years. During this period he never stopped his supplications for those living in squalor, in the city and in the provinces. He founded the legion of Mary, Catholic Social Guild and many other associations like the Catholic Intellectual Movement.
He was a sought after member of the Ceylon Association for the advancement of Science and the University Council and Senate. Amidst all this, he was a child of the times. He fought for radical changes. He foresaw the happenings of 1971. He craved for inter-denominational and Inter- religious amity. He was the happiest when Pope John XXIII spoke on Ecumenism.
He was at St. Joseph’s College for 20 years. It was fascinating to see him chat with the youngest boarder before giving him 15 cts for a piece of Muscat and a glass of lime juice.
He had more empathy than the hypocritical display of sympathy as shown by many. This virtue was most poignantly shown to us one day. We were young boarders. Sunday, a person was brought before him for stealing candle sticks and some silver ware from the college chapel. The man was in tears.
I know that I would never be able to sell these items. They will give me a few rupees. I don’t want to trouble my poor children. I wanted some money to buy betel leaves and areca nuts. Please let me go. Those around wanted the police to be called. Just then Fr Pillai our rector passed by. He gave Him twenty rupees. Twenty rupees in 1949 was a lot of money. He told the weeping old person not to ever enter the college here after. Our one and only security officer at the time, Sebastian was told to take the man up to the gate. About two months later, Sebastian had told a few office personnel and the Rev.Fr in charge of borders a tale bordering a fairy tale. He had taken a person in a neatly attired National Dress to Fr Rector’s office. Fr Rector had recognized the person. This person had walked up to Fr Rector in tears. He had offered the father a sheet of betel leaves and had fallen at his feet and sobbed. He had said amidst tears that, instead of calling the police, Fr had given him Rs.20. With that money, he had bought a “saravita” rack inclusive of a carbide light apparatus. Now he was a successful “saravita mudalali”. He had said “Fr, my Lord Buddha will bless you. My son is married to a catholic girl. They said that they will pray for you when they go to All Saints’ Church.” Sebastian had said that he saw Fr Rector wiping a tear, he had told him take the mudalali to the tuck shop.
Aquinas College of Higher Studies was established by him in 1954 and he was its first Rector. The Aquinas College of Higher Studies was the first university in Sri Lanka to offer external degrees, thereby giving undergraduates the opportunity to pursue their higher studies while being employed. In addition to his other duties, he was appointed Vicar General. In 1961 he retired as Rector of St Joseph’s College. He had an illness toward the end his life. Even while he was ill he would hold discussions and courses to guide young priests, as they were one of his primary concerns.
He could not understand why people should talk in the House of God (Chaplet) and the House of Knowledge (library).Once, he had been doing some reference in a library, abroad. The librarian knew Pillai. The library was closed for the day and only when they opened it the following morning Fr Pillai realizes that it is morning.
He told our general knowledge class, that one of his saddest days was when he was in USA in 1953, August. One of the very prestigious American newspapers had a banner headline`Trouble in paradise’ - it was the day after the 1953 August ‘Hartal’. This wonderful soldier of Christ left us in 1964 yes like all patriot soldiers he did not die but did fade away.
