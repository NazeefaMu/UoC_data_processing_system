Exhilarating flow of natural beauty

Communion with Nature is not only a characteristic trend with the Romantic English Poetry of the 19th century but also the Aha Naanooru poetry of the Sangam Period Tamil Literature of the pre-Christian era. Even in the 21st century, we enjoy relishing the poems of Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Blake and even Coleridge.
Even present day Lankan poets write in the style of the Romantics. One such writer is Yasmin Jaldin who also writes short fiction. I picked up her collection of poems with the title” Flowing Waters.” The evocation of flowing waters brings in a nice sensation as water is the life blood of all beings- human or otherwise.
Yasmin Jaldin is in the field of Lankan English Literature hailing from the Malay community. This 82-page book published by Sarasavi publishers contains 65 little poems. It is priced at Rs.275. As Sachitra Mahendra says in his note “Whether she has accomplished her mission the reader shall decide”
Although contemporary poetry in English in the outer world and even in Lanka has gained depth and finesse, one needs to encourage her efforts.
I shall, therefore, pick out some lines in her poems which I felt were fresh in expression and evoke feeling. After all, the felt experience of the poet must be understood to identify the individual talent.
* Missing your footing was carried away by the gushing waters… The river was our friend but now I see it as my foe
* Enraptured by a lilting voice echoing far beyond the hills, I trekked expeditiously to glimpse the singing echo… You have encountered an apparition who visits this site every full moon, she said.
* Beauty blooms and freshness lingers for a limited time, the petals would asunder and wither rapidly.
* The world is the masterpiece of God’s creation, it is a crumble and also one of sheer delight?
* By the side of a fountain was a pure lily with petals so sleek, standing tall on a gentle stalk drooping her head in shyness resembling a young lass; it looked so forlorn that I dared to pluck it. White lilies adorn sacred places and bouquets of brides to be, their abundance is certainly a florists posy.
* (Please read the poem titled ‘Lost Joy’. Not all her poems are all Romantic and some are personal reminiscences narrated)
* Fame she craved and that was the cause for her bane
* Pushed steadfast on the steep rocky hill stands a stupendous waterfall … resembling the long tresses of a maiden combing her lustrous wavy hair. The laughter of a bevvy of girls equals to the ripples of gushing waters; little cascade, you are unique and breathtaking.
* (The poet Yasmin Jaldin is not a mere dreamer or lover of nature per se, but she is also an observer of the degrading things outside. In that, she is a public poet as well, although she doesn’t vociferously condemn such crime except to leave them to good virtuous judgment to prevail)
* (The poem ’Children’ for instance was not poetry but an ethical sermon on children)
* (On the contrary, ’The Drought ‘ is precise in narrating with vivid description)
* (in ’A Mother’s Anguish’, as an ageing man I was moved by the last line ‘ Your money and clothes are not my essentialities’ it is your frequent presence that would give me much delight’
* (There is pathos in the poem ’Reminiscence” –Holidaying in Switzerland a decade ago; my little girl was playing hide and seek in the snow. Alas. she was buried under deep snow and was no more’)
* Drinking in the beauty of the scene
* Friendship is like rich glassware costly rich; once broken can be mended but still, the crack is there
* Ferocious as it came, it softly calms down its waters returning to the mighty ocean, like the man losing his temper, regretting later for causing harm to another.
All in all Yasmin Jaldin’s poems are beautiful tributes to the wonders of Nature written in a language that anyone can understand and there are a few other poems that describe the vagaries in human nature. While some are positive in interpretation some others have a melancholic tone.
