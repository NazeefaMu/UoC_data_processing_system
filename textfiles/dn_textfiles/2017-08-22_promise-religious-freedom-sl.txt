The promise of religious freedom in SL

Religious freedom in Sri Lanka supposedly abounds. At least that is what the Constitution requires, declaring that, “Every person is entitled to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, including the freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice,” and giving citizens the right to manifest their religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, or teaching, in public and in private. But, according to a new report released by the United States Department of State, and signed off by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the island nation could be doing better.
Every year, the United States releases an “International Religious Freedom Report,” charting the status of religious liberty in countries across the world. This is largely because of the enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act that the United States passed as law 19 years ago, legislation which placed the promotion of religious freedom as a central element of America’s foreign policy.
Legal Framework of Religious Freedom
This past year’s (2016) report on Sri Lanka, released last Tuesday, begins by laying out the legal framework governing the status of religion in the country. It notes that a 2003 Supreme Court ruling “determined the state was constitutionally required to protect only Buddhism; other religions were not accorded the same fundamental right of state-provided protection.” This falls in line with the Constitution, which gives Buddhism the “foremost place” among the country’s religions, committing the government to its protection.
According to the report, the National Christian Council and several Muslim groups have said they supported a secular constitution that did not privilege any one religion.
The report also references the eminence of religion in general in the country, which manifests itself, among other ways, in Sri Lanka’s educational system. Write the authors of the report: “Religion is a compulsory subject in both public and private school curricula. Parents may elect for their children to study Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, or Christianity. Students are not allowed to opt out of religious instruction.”
Finally, the legal framework aspect of the report explains, “Matters related to family law, including divorce, child custody, and property inheritance, are adjudicated according to either the customary law of the applicable ethnic or religious group or the country’s civil law.” In this section, the report alludes to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA), which activists from within and without Sri Lanka’s Muslim community have been petitioning to amend. And yet the report spends a mere two sentences on it, writing that while the government had appointed a committee to propose amendments to the MMDA, the committee had not yet released its findings.
Differential Treatment of Religions
In a meaningful commendation, this year’s report made note of Sri Lanka’s constitution, which does enshrine the right to religious freedom. And yet the report also took Sri Lanka to task for the ways majority and minority religions can often receive differential treatment.
A primary concern of the report is that, according to the Centre for Policy Alternatives, several religious extremist nationalist organizations allegedly regularly espouse hate speech and continue to enjoy impunity from arrest and investigation. The authors of the report wrote that these extremist groups have “continued to promote the supremacy of the country’s ethnic Sinhalese Buddhist population and propagated views hostile to members of religious and ethnic minorities.” Still, the report conceded, this is not occurring to the same extent permitted under the previous government.
Such a distinction seems crucial, given that a country can only ever be authentically measured against its own history. The report pays little mind to that, though, and doesn’t adequately address some of the complexities that have led to such religious tensions in Sri Lanka. For example, there is not a single reference of the nearly thirty year civil war from which the country is still recovering.
The annual report also alleged a general leniency by the government when handling matters involving the religious majority. It detailed two main ways in which this is supposedly happening. First, it claimed that the government continued to permit the construction of Buddhist statues in non-Buddhist areas despite strong objections from members of the Hindu, Muslim, and Christian communities.
“Civil society groups and politicians in the North and East stated that the construction of Buddhist shrines by Buddhist groups or the military in parts of the Northern and Eastern provinces became contentious symbols of perceived Buddhist Sinhalese religious and cultural imperialism. The North and East are predominantly Hindu and Muslim, and some Buddhist shrines were erected in areas with few, if any, Buddhist residents.”
Second, the report critiqued the government for not yet prosecuting extremist monks involved in attacks against Muslims and Christians in 2014. Whether or not this is a systemic problem, the claim is an extension of one made by the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka (NCEASL): that “on multiple instances police reportedly failed to respond to, or were reluctant to arrest or pursue, criminal cases against individuals instigating attacks on religious minority sites.”
According to the report, legal experts who had experience representing minorities with discrimination claims noted that the prosecution of perpetrators was rare.
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, could not be reached for comment on the matter.
The report also went into detail cataloguing the state of religious freedom for the minority religions in Sri Lanka. According to the NCEASL, there were 85 documented cases “of attacks on churches, intimidation and violence against pastors and their congregations, and obstruction of worship services during the year.”
The NCEASL also claimed that newly established churches faced major difficulties in registering, and have alleged pressure and harassment by local government officials to suspend worship activities classified by the government as “unauthorized gatherings.”
For Muslims in Sri Lanka, the situation is often sub-par as well. There have been claims of majority religious figures defaming the Quran, as well as Muslim prayer rooms in universities and mosques being vandalized. The Muslim prayer room at the Jaffna University has been vandalized three times in the past year; the grand mosque in the Nikaweratiya area of Kurunegala District was attacked with gasoline bombs in November. In neither of these incidents did the police make any arrests.
Minority Rights Group International, an international non-governmental organization (NGO), reported 60 instances of hate speech, acts of discrimination, or attempts to desecrate or destroy Muslim religious buildings in the first half of the year. Religious extremists specifically have been caught using racial slurs when describing Muslims and other ethnic minorities at public rallies and in media statements.
However, extremists in the United States have made similar slurs toward the Muslim American community as a whole, and specific Muslim Americans. These include politicians and religious leaders. The President of the United States, who ostensibly wrote the introduction to this report, was the very person who, during his campaign, promised a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”, a threat which violates the very core of what religious liberty means. And yet, in critiquing the treatment of Muslims and other religious minorities in Sri Lanka, the United States’ “International Religious Freedom Report” never concedes that America, too, is far from perfect in its treatment of religious minorities.
Notably, the report barely mentioned the status of religious freedom for the Hindu community in Sri Lanka, who make up 15 percent of the country’s population and a vast majority of the country’s Tamil community.
US Government’s Efforts to Facilitate Religious Harmony
The report concluded by reiterating the U.S. government’s position on religious freedom in Sri Lanka, that it is an imperative, and that even greater interfaith harmony should lead the path forward. It ended on a positive note, detailing the government’s attempts, via its Embassy in Colombo and its Ambassador, Atul Keshap, to facilitate such harmony in the island.
“The U.S. Ambassador urged political leaders to take action to defend religious minorities and to protect religious freedom for everyone. The Ambassador encouraged the government to make the national reconciliation process inclusive of religious minorities and to be protective of minority rights and sentiments. Embassy personnel also met with religious leaders to urge them to assume a leadership role in bridging the ethnic and religious divide in support of interfaith harmony,” the report stated.
“The Embassy continued to support programmes and host events designed to promote dialogue among religious and ethnic groups, and embassy officers met regularly with leaders and representatives from a broad range of religious groups to encourage them to play a leading role in reconciliation.”
