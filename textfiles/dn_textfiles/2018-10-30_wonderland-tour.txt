On a wonderland tour

What would happen if a 21st century Alice collided with Lewis Carroll’s legendary Wonderland? This is the question posed in Jonathan Yukich’s ‘[email protected] Wonderland’, a modern retelling of the classic children’s story has all of the characters you know and love, including the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit and the Queen of Hearts.
The story is laid out in traditional style, except that Alice is distinctly contemporary, complete with cell phone in hand.Full of references to text messaging and social media, the play imagines a present-day Alice encountering the Wonderland so many of us treasure.
Elizabeth Moir School has earned an outstanding reputation for the high standard of its sell-out productions. Following in the footsteps of the hugely successful ‘Singin’ in the Rain Jr’., ‘Rumor’s and ‘Footloose’, this years’ production features the talents of over 50 students. [email protected] Wonderland is directed by Anushka Senanayake, with choreography by Melissa Fisher.
Rachel Hayward and Eleanora Deemer will take on the role of Alice. Kaavya Gnanam and Leonid Mylvaganam appear as the Mad Hatter, with Tienn Kapilasena and Tara Mylvaganam as the March Hare, and Esme Mylvaganam in the role of the Dormouse. Louisa Deemer and Nicole Haddon appear as the White Rabbit and the Queen of Hearts respectively.
‘Alice @ Wonderland’, will be held on November 2 and 3 at the Lionel Wendt Theatre. The Electronic Media Sponsor for the show is TNL radio and the Co Sponsor is St. Anthony’s Coatings (Pvt) Ltd.
