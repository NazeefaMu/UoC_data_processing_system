All Island Transport Union withdraws from Friday strike

The All Island Transport Union yesterday said it will not join a general strike called by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) slated to happen on Friday.
The GMOA yesterday warned it would launch the country’s largest ever trade union action on Friday with the backing of a majority of state sector trade unions, including those of teachers, nurses and the state run public transport.
All Island Transport Workers' Union General Secretary Sepala Liyanage told the Daily News yesterday that his union will not support a trade union action on Friday, but was supportive of an action against the private medical college in Malabe.
Liyanage said if a private medical college is granted equal status as of a state medical university, it would amount to a degeneration of the state medical education in the country which has garnered a high reputation world-over.
Liyanage said although his union has not decided to join a strike on Friday, it will consider such action in the future if the government does not take action to resolve the dispute regarding the private medical college in Malabe.
