GMOA Secretary accuses Health Minister of protecting SAITM

The Health Minister is more interested in protecting SAITM than controlling the country’s dengue problem. The Health Ministry should declare the total number of dengue deaths, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA HeadQuarters in Colombo yesterday, he accused the Health Minister of showing a keener interest in protecting SAITM by placing advertisements and allocating state hospitals for the use of SAITM.But, now dengue has become a major threat to Sri Lanka more than ever.
According to Dr. Zoysa, a total of 43,915 dengue patients had been reported throughout Sri Lanka during the past four months with around 35 dengue deaths reported from the Western Province alone.A total of 41.4 percent of dengue patients have been reported from the Western Province. Dengue cases have also been reported from previously unaffected areas such as Trincomalee, Baticaloa, Jaffna, Kalmunai and Hambantota.
The GMOA has already informed the Acting Director General of Health Services about the need for a immediate assessment of the dengue situation in the country and hope that it will stop SAITM Protecting Project and pay attention towards controlling dengue, Dr. Zoysa added.
