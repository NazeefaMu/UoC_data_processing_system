Oceanfront Condos at Nilaveli to be completed in October

This would be Sri Lanka’s first beach-front, serviced, luxury, and leisure apartments of its kind to be opened. Oceanfront Condos homes offers 81 condominiums in total.
What makes the model of Oceanfront Condos’ operations convenient is that once the apartment is purchased and furnished by the owner, the Company acts as a facilitator for condominium rentals.
While owners go about their life, the Company manages and lets out the condominiums on rent, thus enabling the owner parties to earn an additional income from their holiday beach-front homes.
Oceanfront Condos features a swimming pool, a gymnasium, and a café within its precincts. It is also comfortably located just a 20 minute boat ride away from the Pigeon Island Marine National Park with its jeweled coral gardens and 300 types of reef fish that makes it a snorkelers’ and divers’ paradise. Oceanfront Condos’ close proximity to Trincomalee makes it a viable hub to visit.
Its natural harbor, Konesvaram temple and Fort Frederick are some interesting sites here. Another attraction, of course, is whale watching at the harbor. Potential buyers are invited to visit the property and its fully furnished show apartment this holiday season, to inspect and explore the value of this Nilaveli beachfront investment.
