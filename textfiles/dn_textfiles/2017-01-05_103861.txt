New 130 police stations to be set up

Steps have been taken to open 130 new Police stations in the country after considering the distance between existing police stations and the nature of crimes reported in the respective areas, IGP Pujith Jayasundera said.
He said this when he handed over a newly built house to a needy person recently. The house was built by the Udupila South Community Police Committee under a programme sponsored by the Meegahawatta Police station.
The IGP said he has streamlined the activities of the community Police service after he assumed his post as IGP. There are community police committees in 14,022 Grama Niladhari divisions, he said. The Police has moved closer to the people by conducting mobile service programmes throughout the country, IGP Jayasundera said.
