Grade 5 scholarship allowance upped

Moves have been taken to increase the allowance for students who pass the Grade 5 scholarship examination. The allowance is given by the government to students of low-income families.
The Cabinet recently approved a proposal forwarded by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to increase the amount.
Accordingly, the scholarship amount will be increased to Rs. 750 from Rs. 500 per month. Also, 250 more students who pass the Grade 5 scholarship examination and who need financial assistance will receive scholarships from this year.
The minister added that the government is responsible for assisting students in their studies and ensuring that all students receive equal opportunities for education.
