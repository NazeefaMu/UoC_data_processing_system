Forfeiting a Kingdom for Love

Remembering some of the most cherished moments of world  history when wedding bells tolled and two people united in love in  magical surroundings
She never became the Queen, but the Baltimore-raised society hostess did win the heart of a King. The 1930s love affair between the American socialite, and King Edward VIII, ended with the King abdicating so he could be with the woman he adored. In those days, it was considered unacceptable for a British monarch to marry a divorcée. Not only had she already been divorced once, but she was still married to her second husband when her romance with the man who would soon be wearing the crown, began.
She was Wallis Simpson - the lady who triggered an abdication crisis, in the momentous period leading up to World War II. Wallis’ first marriage failed, and when married to the businessman Ernest Aldrich Simpson, she met the man who was to become her third husband – then the Prince of Wales. In a 1970 BBC interview, Wallis recalled her first impression of Edward. “I thought he was ahead of his time. I thought he had pep. I thought he wanted to establish things that the world was not ready for.”
According to socialite Nicholas Haslam, it came as no surprise Wallis proved irresistible to Edward - she possessed tremendous personal magnetism. Haslam still remembers the first time he set eyes on her. “Suddenly there was a total hush in the restaurant and people dropped their spoons and their cutlery and she walked in and the entire room was silent…and she sat down and she said…’Hi, I’m Wallis.’ You can’t beat that.”
While Edward VIII wanted to marry Mrs. Simpson, once Wallis realized that marriage to her would cost the King the throne, she tried to change his mind. But he was determined. “This was the only subject on which she was unable to dominate her future husband,” observed historian, Philip Zeigler.
Yet, for a love story that changed the British monarchy forever, Edward VIII's wedding to Wallis Simpson was a relatively modest affair.
Six months after his abdication from the British throne that rocked the royal family and the nation—the former King of England, now Duke of Windsor, wed his beloved American divorcée at the Chateau De Cande, in Monts, France.
Free of the pomp and circumstance associated with royal weddings, the controversial union was a small ceremony. And while press photos weren't allowed during the event, Time magazine reported the events of the day in detail, noting that Edward was "hallow-eyed" as Wallis walked down the aisle to the march from Handel's Judas Maccabeus, wearing a dress of "soft blue crepe with a tight, buttoned bodice, a halo-shaped hat of the same color, shoes and gloves to match. At her throat was a tremendous diamond-&-sapphire brooch."
"Only two incidents disturbed the ceremony," noted the Time reporter. "When Vicar Jardine asked, 'Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor and keep her?' overwrought Edward cried 'I will!' in a shrill voice that was almost a scream. When he put on her finger the plain wedding ring of Welsh-mined gold that has become a tradition in the British Royal Family, the trembling of his hands was noticeable even to the farthest watchers."
Champagne and toasts followed, with notable guests including Randolph Churchill, Baron Eugène Rothschild, and best man Major Edward Dudley Metcalfe, but no members of the groom's family.
And while the newlyweds were granted a wide berth from the press following the wedding, at least by modern standards, Time did report that "reporters were waiting when the royal honeymooners reached Wasserloenburg Castle in Austria. The moon was shining as the Duke carried his Duchess over the threshold."
Despite everything he’d given up to marry Wallis, the Duke told the BBC in 1970, “I have no regrets, I stay interested in my country, Britain, your land and mine. I wish it well.”
Although their marriage forced Edward into exile (which explained the move across the English Channel to Paris), Wallis was granted some acceptance from the royal family as the years went on. When Edward died, his funeral was held in England, and she stayed at Buckingham Palace for the event.
Her own funeral in 1986 was held at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle and she is buried alongside her husband in the Royal Burial Ground Cemetery near Windsor.
Looking at the marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla it is sad to note that if the British monarchy had been as liberal minded as they are today back in the 1900s, Edward could probably have kept his crown and had Wallis as his queen. In 1938, when she met Adolf Hitler, even he realized, “she would have made a good queen.”
