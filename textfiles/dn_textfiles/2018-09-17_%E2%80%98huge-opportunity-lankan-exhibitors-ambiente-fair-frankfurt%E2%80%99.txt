Omer Salahuddin, CEO Messe Frankfurt SP Sri Lanka highlighted that five Sri Lankan exhibitors are expected to be participate in Ambiente next year to showcase their products namely Dankotuwa, Selyn, Gospel House Handicraft, AMP Ceylon and Art Decoration.
Kurzawski also spoke about Ambiente offering a vast range of interesting innovations. As a visitor, you may not have the chance to see all of it. “This is why we created –so to speak –some short-cuts, for example, special presentations, like our “Point of Experience”, the Ambiente Trends, and Solutions. They give you the opportunity to get a quick idea of some important trend developments and learn about some exciting new products.
The “Point of Experience” area will be focusing on the changing role of trade, in Hall 4.1, showing the transformation of the point of sale into a point of experience. This area will demonstrate how product presentations can attract attention in the digital age.
There is also a show called Solutions–now entering its seventh edition –which features solutions to problems through clever everyday products, especially in the dining, kitchen and household segments. A programme that is of equally great importance is the talents programme. Obviously, the consumer goods industry is an industry based on innovations. To be successful, producers and buyers continually need to look out for new networks, inspiration and ideas. Talents is a vital platform for young designers to meet professionals in the industry. It gives them an opportunity to present their works in the premium halls at Ambiente.
Moreover, we at Messe Frankfurt believe in giving back something to the industries we work with. And Talents has proved its worth as a career launch pad for many of our well-known and successful designers.
Another interesting feature of Ambiente is the Ethical Style Guide. Now entering its fourth edition, the guide is designed to create transparency. Moreover, the Ethical Style Guide locates all exhibitors with sustainable products and product lines at Ambiente.
Global Sourcing has developed into a well-established benchmark for the international volume business trade. Around 1,500 exhibitors from 55 nations will showcase their products at Ambiente, under the headings of Global Sourcing Dining, Global Sourcing Living and Global Sourcing Giving. Frankfurt is thus the number one trading location for volume business outside China. Fascinating presentations and valuable tips: Running on all five days of the trade fair, the Ambiente Academy will provide insights into current market developments.
Experts will give presentations in Hall 9.2, showing how to compile attractive product ranges and how to position products in the best possible way.
