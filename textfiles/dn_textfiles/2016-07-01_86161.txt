Overall champs at All-Island Schools Relay Carnival: Bens maintain their supremacy

 
The prestigious and the glamour event in the schools’ athletic calendar the All-Island Schools Relay Carnival, which was conducted under grueling ground conditions on the grass track at Bogambara Stadium, Kandy saw all-conquering St Benedict’s College emerge as overall champions in the boys category with Trinity College in their home territory finishing second and longstanding holders of the title Ratnayake Sports School Walala Kandy pushed to third place. The Benedictines also won the Under 15 and under 17 championships with their strong showing.
The Benedictine under 17 outfit which included among others the Sri Lanka Junior National team members to the Asian Junior Athletic Championship held in Vietnam in early June namely, Sahan Rajapakse, the up and coming Avishka Dhananjaya Ratnayake, Lalana Madushan, Santhush Weerasinghe, Manusha Dias, Thiran Avishka and PNP Auchinthiya made a clean sweep winning the 4x100m, 4x200m, 4x400m and medley relays.
The under 15 team comprising Uditha Dilshan (who suffered a major injury during the meet), Anuja Prabaswara, Sanddep Visanperuma and Thejan won the 4x100m and was second in the 4x200m relay.
The usually strong Benedictine under 19 team suffered as a result of serious injuries to their Sri Lanka Junior National team member Shammi Lakshan and last year’s junior national 400m champion Supun Nimesha.
The Benedictines also showed emerging talent with their juveniles (Under 13 segment where no points are awarded) who recorded the best performance at the meet in the under 13 group Serious injuries to Shammi Lakshan, Supun Nimansha, Uditha Dilshan and Uditha Malshan meant that these top performers could not take part in the Western Province Athletic Meet, which was held just three days after the tightly packed schedule at the Relay Carnival where the top athletes had to go through heats, semi-finals and final in two or three events.
