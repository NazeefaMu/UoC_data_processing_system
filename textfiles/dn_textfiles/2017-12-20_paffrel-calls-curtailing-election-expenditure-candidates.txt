PAFFREL calls for curtailing of election expenditure of candidates

People’s Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said that PAFFREL seeks the approval of the Legislature to a draft prepared by them (PAFFERL) to curtail the election expenditure of candidates.
He said that with the draft, PAFFREL hopes to create an advanced election culture specially to curtail election expenditures with a view to conducting a free and fair election.
Hettiarachchi was addressing an awareness programme for media personnel on the draft in Colombo yesterday.
He said the Local Government election will be held under Ward System and therefore the total number of members will be doubled. Unlike the previous occasion, there is a probability that the candidate of a Ward can spend lavishly on the election as the Ward is much smaller than an electorate.
“Therefore, at the initial stage, PAFFREL drew attention on curtailing election expenditures of candidates contesting under the Ward System.Later, it was considered to implement the proposed guidelines to the Provincial Council and Parliamentary Elections,” Hettiarachchi said.
“PAFFREL believes that there should be a limitation of candidates’ expenditures with the introduction of the new electoral system,” he said.
Hettiarachchi said that politics is a more lucrative business than social service now. Therefore, some sort of a mitigation monitoring system is needed for conducting a healthy and fair election.
“This prevailing election culture should be changed. We are engaging in strengthening the legal framework by introducing these proposals,” he said.
He said people should elect the best person for their Ward at the forthcoming Local Government election without considering the political party that the candidate that person belongs to. Corrupt candidates or candidates who spend large amounts of money on elections should not be elected as they tend to use their political clout to make illegal money once elected.
