AIA conducts Higher Education  Scholarships program

AIA’s Insurance’s Higher Education Scholarships Program, now in its 24rd consecutive year, rewards the top performer from each district at the Grade 5 Scholarship examination, by giving them a monthly bursary from Advanced Level (A/L) class right up to the completion of their University degree.
Started in 1994, the program was initiated to lend a hand to Sri Lanka’s brightest and most promising students, as they are the future of our nation. AIA scholarships do not require the winners to be an AIA Insurance customer, but awards are purely based on academic merit.
