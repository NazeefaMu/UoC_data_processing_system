Title: The Silk Merchant’s Daughter
Author: Dinah Jefferies
1952, French Indochina. Since her mother’s death, eighteen-year-old half-French, half-Vietnamese Nicole has been living in the shadow of her beautiful older sister, Sylvie. When Sylvie is handed control of the family silk business, Nicole is given an abandoned silk shop in the Vietnamese quarter of Hanoi. But the area is teeming with militant rebels who want to end French rule, by any means possible. For the first time, Nicole is awakened to the corruption of colonial rule - and her own family’s involvement shocks her to the core... Tran, a notorious Vietnamese insurgent, seems to offer the perfect escape from her troubles, while Mark, a charming American trader, is the man she’s always dreamed of. But who can she trust in this world where no one is what they seem?
The Silk Merchant’s Daughter is a captivating tale of dark secrets, sisterly rivalry and love against the odds, enchantingly set in colonial era Vietnam.

Title: The Undoing Project: A Friendship that Changed the World
Author: Michael Lewis
 
‘Michael Lewis could spin gold out of any topic he chose ... his best work ... vivid, original and hard to forget’ Tim Harford, Financial Times
From Michael Lewis, No.1 bestselling author of The Big Short and Flash Boys, this is the extraordinary story of the two men whose ideas changed the world.
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky met in war-torn 1960s Israel. Both were gifted young psychology professors: Kahneman a rootless son of holocaust survivors who saw the world as a problem to be solved; Tversky a voluble, instinctual blur of energy. In this breathtaking new book, Michael Lewis tells the extraordinary story of a relationship that became a shared mind: one which created the field of behavioural economics, revolutionising everything from Big Data to medicine, from how we are governed to how we spend, from high finance to football. Kahneman and Tversky, shows Michael Lewis, helped shape the world in which we now live - and may well have changed, for good, humankind’s view of its own mind.
‘A new book by Michael Lewis promises an absorbing story, dazzling ideas, journalistic flair and originality. He achieves this with extraordinary consistency. In The Undoing Project he has achieved it again’ Daniel Finkelstein, The Times

Title: FACING THE TALIBAN
Author: Anoja Wijeyesekera
 
It is the night of 11th September 2001 in Kabul, Afghanistan. Anoja is frantically gathering her things for an evacuation. In the background, the falling bombs shake the foundations of the house, but her thoughts are far away, she can only think of her brother, Srinath, who is trapped in the debris of the Twin Towers in New York. In a cruel twist of fate, two siblings find themselves as bystanders on opposite sides of what would soon become a cruel and painful conflict. This dramatic opening to Anoja’s autobiographical account is just a small window into the fascinating and tumultuous tale of an aid-worker, mother and woman who finds herself in a place that would soon become a focal point of global politics. Amidst the heart-wrenching tales, there are instances of humour. The Taliban’s obsessions with their weird rules from the length of a man’s beard and the covering of a woman’s face are some humorous nuggets amid a bleak environment. Anoja’s encounters give a rare insight into the working of the Taliban government.
Through her stories, we witness how sometimes the Taliban themselves were bewildered by the absurdities of their own rules. The book ends with the culmination of Taliban edicts going haywire and leading to the destruction of the Bamyan Buddha statues, the two gigantic and iconic structures of the ancient world, akin in a symbolic way to the attack on the Twin Towers of New York which is the starting point of the book. Anoja’s reminiscences provide a unique picture of a country at the brink of a bloody chapter. Through disenfranchisement and Taliban Edicts emerges a moving picture of a compassionate and kind people who are victims and prisoners of a fate which has spiralled beyond their control.
