Celebrate the Festive Season at OZO Colombo

Leave the preparation for a hearty festive Christmas and New Year to OZO Colombo this season as you share the seasonal spirit amidst your loved ones while you raise a glass to the year gone by and welcome the year ahead!
‘Kisses and Wishes’ is OZO Colombo’s Christmas celebration starting from Christmas Eve through to Christmas Day. EAT, the hotel’s all-day dining restaurant, will serve a sumptuous treat from 7 pm with spins on traditional dishes including a few Asian favourites to an infusion of Mediterranean flavours.
From a tantalizing lamb roast to a succulent turkey with all the trimmings and sauces to accompany it.
On Christmas Day from 11 am to 3 pm, you are invited to dine and revel in the festive colours amongst the people closest you and feast on an all-you-can-eat brunch buffet based on the traditional Christmas lunch.
Bring your house party to OZO Colombo’s ON14 Rooftop Bar and Lounge this New Year’s Eve and celebrate with friends and family at ‘Lavish.’ All the bases are covered, ensuring that revellers bid goodbye to 2018 in style. Start the night with a lavish seafood spread along with an all-you-can-drink happy hour in addition to amazing beverage deals planned to make it a night like no other. After a celebratory dinner, get ready to dance to the tunes of international radio and live DJ, Paula Frost, bring the sounds of tech house and electro to crowds of thousands across the world for over 15 years. ‘Lavish’ also features the best of Sri Lanka’s vinyl DJ’s who kick started the Christmas season for Colombo in August and continued the countdown at ON14.
Guests also have the opportunity to win fantastic prizes. All this, while you take in the stunning view of the beautiful city of Colombo and the Indian Ocean.
