Natural disasters: Government proved detractors wrong - PM

When natural disasters such as the Aranayake landslide occurred amidst the economic problems faced by the country, some people though that the government is incapable of facing such situations. But, the government proved its detractors wrong by finding the necessary funds and attending to the needs of the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after opening the Rhino housing scheme to house people displaced in the Aranayake landslide on February 19.
Wickemesinghe said the Rhino institution had build 20 houses at Wasanthagama, Aranayake at a cost of Rs. 50 million to house people displaced in the Aranayake landslide. He thanked the Managing Director of the Rhino Institution Jayaseelam Gnanam and his staff for their munificence in gifting the housing scheme.
Apart from Rhino, several other government and non government institutions had come forward to build houses for the displaced people while the government too had provided funding to complete other requirements.
The Prime Minister recalled that when the landslide occurred, he toured the area in a helicopter accompanied by Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa to inspect the devastation first hand. He understood that the houses washed away were strong edifices and not wattle and daub houses. The new houses had been built according to the same if not better standards of the houses that were destroyed.
President Maithripala Sirisena too took great pains to provide relief to the people affected by the landslide while Minister Yapa also accomplished a great amount of work towards helping the affected families. The major contribution made in this direction by Minister Yapa was little known because he was not a publicity hunter, said the Prime Minister.
“Now the government had succeeded in providing houses to a majority of affected families almost after a lapse of one year after the calamity. This disaster occurred a few days prior to Vesak Poya last year. The government would be able to bring back to normalcy the entire village before Vesak Poya this year.
The redeveloped village can be considered a world record because visually restoration of a devastated village anywhere in the world would take two to three years the least. When Hurricane Catrina devastated New Orleans in the United Stated, the houses could not be rebuilt even after a lapse of 5 years after the disaster,” he said.
The Prime Minister said the two Cabinet Ministers representing the area also worked with great self sacrifice to help those affected while former Parliamentarians Lalith Dissanayake and Nimal Jayasinghe too took an active part in coming to the assistance of the affected families.
The politicians and government servants too assisted by working in unison eschewing political and other rivalries. They would not have been able to make this achievement if they were disunited.
This was clear proof that any task or accomplishment was not beyond their means if both parties worked in unity, he said.
The Prime Minister said the country’s economy too crashed during the past war period due to the disunity of the people. This led to several major crises. That was why the UNP, and the Civil society through created a change in league with several other parties, when they realised the gravity of the economic crisis.
The Prime Minister said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa went for an election two years before schedule due to his inability to resolve the looming economic crisis. The Prime Minister said at first they got a mandate to work under President Maithripala Sirisena.
The General Election which followed give an opportunity to the UNP and the SLFP to think anew. They are now trying to steer the country forward by setting up a good governance government.
The Prime Minister said finding a lasting solution to the ethnic problem was the biggest challenge before them. Meanwhile, they had to cope with cases filed in the international fora.
Their first duty had been accomplished by uniting the people. This unity had given them strength to talk to the international world with one voice.
