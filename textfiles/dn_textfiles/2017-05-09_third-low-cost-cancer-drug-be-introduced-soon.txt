Third low-cost cancer drug to be introduced soon

The third low-cost cancer drug will be introduced to Sri Lanka soon and the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) had been given instructions in connection with introducing this new third cancer drug, said Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
The minister was answering questions posed by journalists after laying the foundation stone for the Rs. 950 million-worth new building complex at Anuradhapura Nurses Training School recently.
He said the government Medical Officers’ Association involve in strikes without taking care of dengue patients.
“I discussed with President Sirisena on the SAITM issue. In the beginning the discussion was about the standard and now the association demands the Government to take over the SAITM,” the minister added.
“The good governance government will continue until 2020 in order to build the country. The Joint Opposition wants to stop investors coming to Sri Lanka.
The government will face all strikes successfully. Essential services will be carried out under a new system,” he added.
