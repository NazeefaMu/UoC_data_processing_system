NP teacher recruiting exam papers error-ridden: candidates

Candidates who sat for the teacher recruitment examination for government schools in the Northern Province claimed that they underwent much difficulties as the IQ question paper of the exam included many mistakes.
The question papers of the examination, which held on last Saturday, had so many errors including printing and grammar errors.
The question papers were translated from English into Sinhala and that may have caused the mistakes, the candidates said. They said the Provincial Governor should pay his attention on the issue.
