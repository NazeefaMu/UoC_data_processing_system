NMRA to investigate cancer patient fleecing

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) to conduct an investigation into a private company that charged Rs. 429,000 from a cancer patient for a drug which cost only Rs. 125,000, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the company had imported the drug from India for Rs. 125,000 and sold the drug to the patient for Rs. 429,000 by keeping a profit of Rs. 304,000.
The minister had ordered the NMRA to conduct an investigation into the incident through Food and Drug Inspectors and produce a report.
He had given the order based on a complaint received from a cancer patient, the sources said.
Arrangements will be made soon to reduce the prices of expensive cancer drugs and surgical items similarly to the price reduction in 48 essential and commonly used drugs by the Health Ministry recently, the sources said.
