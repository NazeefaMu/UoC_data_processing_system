Atlas Axillia Encouraging creativity in children for over 50 years

Fostering creative pursuits among children and teachers have been a passion close to the heart of Atlas Axillia; for over 60 years, the Company has been involved in developing a product range that meet changing student needs and aspirations.
Atlas products are designed and developed to connect and inspire senses from touch, look, smell and texture. Much effort is taken to understand consumer needs and create products that are a delight to own and use.
Today’s students face challenges unseen by previous generations. They interact with technology and its advancements, often receive an information overload and have to manage their studies while facing many challenges in a highly competitive environment.
Over the world, experts believe that encouraging children to explore their creative skills can contribute towards holistic development. Engaging in creative pursuits such as art, hand work and related pursuits are said to empower children in empathic learning and development, enabling each one to become a star in his or her own right.
“Encouraging and fostering creativity among students is not just a mechanism to help bring out the best in them but it is also an avenue that enhances the potential of each student,” says Ramani Samarasundera of Atlas Axillia, Sri Lanka’s leading brand of stationary and manufactures of arts and craft equipment, “Inspiring students to engage with creative pursuits empowers them to expand their potential and develop their wellbeing.”
Having worked with teachers over the years, Atlas Axillia believe that creative activities such as colouring, creative writing and poems encourages children to develop fine motor skills and improve their hand and eye co-ordination. “In addition, colouring helps children to focus and develop concentration while improving colour recognition. It also enables them to develop a sense of achievement which can improve their personality development.”
“Imaginative activities such as colouring, handwork stimulates creativity in children” adds an educational expert, “ Such creativity also encourages their spatial awareness, helping them to express themselves better and improve their structural skills. Colouring has the power to enable children to connect with their environment, helping them to see their world in colour.”
“ The Atlas Axillia team connects constantly with child centered developments ;we try to gain insights into how student needs change with time and with age – throughout our history as a company, we have strived to deliver the best possible products that encourage and empower student communities in Sri Lanka” says Asitha Samaraweera, CEO of Atlas Axillia in conclusion.
