Kanrich Thaksalava CSR Initiative for students launched

Kanrich Finance has always been in the forefront as a pioneer financial institute and has always come forward very generously to reach out and lend a helping hand to the betterment of fellow Sri Lankans.
It is with the intention of this evolving ethos that Kanrich Finance launched their latest CSR Kanrich Thaksalava, a much looked forward to CSR initiative for school going students.
The latest CSR initiatives of Kanrich Finance Ltd the ‘Kanrich Thaksalava’ programme was successfully launched at Sri Maha Bodhiramaramaya, Batahena in Ratnapura recently.
This programme aims to supplement the knowledge of the school going children through successful incorporation of curriculum components and further study into the programmes run by the Kanrich Thaksalava.
Sharing her views with us, head of the project steering committee and Assistant General Manager Kanrich Finance, Shyamini Fernando has this to say, “Kanrich Thaksalava programme is aimed at students of grade 6 to grade 9 and supplements the curriculum components taught at school.
We adopt innovative teaching methods in successfully delivering and complementing the English syllabi offered at school level. Furthermore, our aim is to reach out to underprivileged students who do not have access to updated resources and material and who do not have the facilities many of the suburb schools have.”
Kanrich Finance Ltd has always been instrumental in uplifting the lives of Sri Lankan people and with their on-going CSR initiatives and their far reaching Kanrich Thaksalava programme they have embarked on another successful journey in investing in the next generation Sri Lankans.
This far reaching initiative hopes to extend assistance in meeting the needs of the suburban school going children who have limited access to furthering their knowledge and skills beyond what is taught at school.
This programme targets the children of Kanrich micro finance policy subscribers and creates a platform for them to learn and practice the skills taught at school outside of the school environments with expert guidance.
This programme has been conceptualised and has been carried out under the directive of Shiran Weerasinghe, CEO, Kanrich finance Ltd.
He promises and looks forward to take this initiative to the next level, reaching far and wide across Sri Lanka establishing Kanrich Thaksalava institutes in localities where Kanrich Finance branches are already present.
