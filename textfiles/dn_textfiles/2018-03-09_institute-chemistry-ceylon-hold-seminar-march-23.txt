Institute of Chemistry Ceylon to hold seminar on March 23

Institute of Chemistry has organized the seminar on ‘Industrial Waste Management and Laboratory Safety’ to enhance and update the knowledge of personnel from academia and industry on March 23, 2018 at the Institute premises in Rajagiriya.
This is the second seminar of the series of seminars organized this year by the institute targeting the current and future employees of chemical industries and research institutes/universities to enhance and update their knowledge and skills on latest developments in Chemical Industries.
The funds collected from the seminars will be utilized for the National Chemistry Olympiad competition for GCE Advance Level students which commenced recently.
Prof. Ajith de Alwis, professor of the Faculty of Engineering of University of Moratuwa and the Director of COSTI (Coordination Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation) is the keynote speaker of this seminar.
He will present about Solid waste management. Eminent research scientists Dr. Udaya K. Jayasundara, Prof. P. G. Rathnasiri and Dr. R. M. S. K. Rathnayake will be addressing on Prudential practices in chemical laboratories, Waste water management/ treatments, Industrial waste management regulations and Chemical waste management. Dr. Champika Amarasinghe will be addressing the audience on Biological and hospital waste management. Bureau Veritas Consumer Products Services Lanka (PVT) LTD will be participating for the seminar as the cosponsor.
Institute of Chemistry Ceylon has the pleasure of inviting all interested parties to participate in this invaluable seminar.
A folder of materials of all the presentations will be given to all the participants and at the end of the seminar. An attendance certificate will be awarded to each participant. Seminar is coordinated by Dr. Chinthaka Ratnaweera, Senior Lecturer, Institute of Chemistry Ceylon.
Waste is anything your business intends to discard, or handles or produces and is not wanted or required. Disposing of waste can have a significant impact on the environment. Producing excessive amounts of waste is often a sign that your business processes may be inefficient.
Waste management is the process of disposal, processing, controlling, recycling and reusing of waste to maintain a habitable environment. Industrial waste management refers to the solid, liquid and gaseous emissions, residual and unwanted wastes from an industrial operation. Industrial wasted are hazardous since they are corrosive, reactive and toxic hence leading to extensive pollution.
Industrial waste can be reduced through recycling, treatment before release and utilizing bio-friendly methods of manufacturing. It’s vital to study solid, biological, waste water, hospital waste and chemical waste management separately to maximize the profit and to build up an environmentally friendly process.
This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling. Laboratory safety is of paramount importance.
The purpose of this laboratory safety and chemical hygiene plan is to provide guidance for the safe handling of all hazardous chemicals in laboratories, ensure compliance and other applicable regulations and demonstrate that this plan meets or exceeds the requirement.
