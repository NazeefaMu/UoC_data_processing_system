Wits in jangles with holiday jingles!

With Christmas just around the corner there is a nip in the air and continuous jingles jangling in my head. I notice that every year around this time, I hear holiday music. It follows me everywhere this overused melodic nemesis piped in the malls and lifts and waiting rooms.
My ears have been assailed and are echoing with the Christmas tunes that are becoming exasperating with their bankrupt repertoire. I am sure you would agree with me wholesale, and retail that I am fed up with hearing ‘Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells rock’! Jingle bells. . . BANG! That was the festive sound of the radio being struck with a hammer by me! So you see an overdose of the holiday music has me already in a holi-daze!
God rest ye merry gentle people, let nothing you dismay, except excessive festive music, heard well in advance of Christmas Day. Yep, it’s that time again! That magical time of year when it is impossible to leave your house without a faint ‘fa-a-la- la-la’ ringing in your ears. ’Tis the season of Christmas songs. ’Tis the season when you are reminded every single day. ’Tis the season when you can recite every single word of, ‘It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year’ because you’ve heard it 27,876 times this morning already and, let me tell you, there is nothing remotely wonderful about the kids jingle-belling and everyone telling you to be of good cheer.
It’s extremely annoying. In fact, it’s more than just annoying. I hate to bring you tidings of discomfort, not joy, but some Christmas music is emotionally damaging and hazardous to your health. And if you've ever worked in a shop during November and December, chances are you will have found Christmas music incredibly infuriating.
I must also admit that I am not a big fan of ‘The Little Drummer Boy’. I am certain you are with me on that. Oh, sure, ‘The Little Drummer Boy’ is a beautiful song, for maybe the first 35 minutes. But eventually it gets on your nerves, those voices shrieking ‘Rum-pa-pa-pum!’
For openers, drums do not go ‘Rum-pa-pa-pum.’ Drums go ‘Rat-a-tat-tat.’ Also, I have issues with the line from ‘The Little Drummer Boy’ that goes: ‘The ox and lamb kept time.’ Really? How? Did they clack their hooves together, castanet-style? Did they dance? Are we supposed to believe that two barnyard animals with legume-level IQs spontaneously started doing the macarena? If they did they must have been unique laughing stock cattle and sheep with a sense of humour and a ‘year’ for music.
I'll tell you this: If I were taking care of a newborn baby, and somebody came around whacking on a drum, that person would find himself in the emergency room having his drumsticks surgically removed from his rum-pa-pa-pum, if you know what I mean. Take it from me there’s no drummer boy mentioned anywhere in the gospels. Besides, ‘Baruppapumpum’ is not a word in English or in Sinhala or Tamil, though it does sound a bit like the sound an automatic weapon makes while firing on all cylinders.
People can be so unfair at times even during the season of good cheer. The cops especially have no sense of fair play or humour either. If you’re singing Christmas songs on your neighbour’s lawn at night with your church group, it’s called ‘carol singing.’ But if you’re doing it alone on the street wearing a Santa outfit it’s called ‘drunk and disorderly’ behaviour. Or say, if you are doing it with no outfit at all, you will be charged with ‘indecent exposure’.
For a nation that sometimes finds it difficult to bare its soul, some Sri Lankan seasonal party drunks are surprisingly relaxed when it comes to baring their bodies. Many of them in a sober state are ‘incredibly well dressed’ before divesting themselves of their clothes to begin their frivolities. In mitigation I must say in their defence that they all wore clothes suited to an activity far smarter than the one in which they were engaged in before being copped. There were men who had worn only neckties for the occasion, which they claimed had provided adequate cover to any dangling adjuncts far more effectively than old Adam’s fig leaf. But the cops are usually unmoved and refuse to buy excuses of exhibitionists prone to proper ‘underwear amnesia.’
Nobody announces in advance that they plan to end up buck naked in public. But it is amazing how often somebody does, plunging themselves into a world of almost unchecked social high-jinks. And the cops have the temerity to say that Santa’s nuts. That he is displaying naked aggression. That he’s hallucinating. They call it the ‘Insanity Clause’. So they frog-march you to the cop shop while you switch to a rousing ‘baila’ with the popular local hit ‘Ralahamy Mung polisiyay, Ralahamy Mung’.
Ok, I will admit that the cops throw a blanket or a rain-cape around you when you are nabbed in an unclothed state in public. But they don’t actually do so through compassion or to keep you warm from the cold snap either. I suspect they do it because they don’t want to suffer an inferiority complex for the rest of the season.
A former journalistic colleague named Lou Hart and I once checked into adjoining hotel rooms one Christmas Eve while on an assignment in Singapore. I was just about to shower when I heard a huge commotion in the corridor outside. Opening the door I was assailed by the sight of Lou bawling his head off at an army of hotel staff. He was tipsy and looked a sight with a hotel towel, which was much too small for him, draped around his waist.
He was blubbering incoherently that his shower head attachment was defective. Guests disturbed by his stentorian roar and peeping into the corridor only heard this part of his complaint: “My damned attachment is loose and is moving around free willy!” Lou was actually mixing free-wheeling and willy-nilly both literally and metaphorically.
And there was old Aunt Madeleine who at a family Christmas reunion had had one too many. She advanced towards the podium tottering perilously on insecure stiletto heels, much like a stilt-walker. Then just as the toastmaster finished his celebratory ritual, Aunt Madeleine raised her glass leaned towards the microphone and made her own salutation: “Up yours!” After a few moments of stunned silence, the toastmaster explained that she had actually been going for was “Bottoms up!”
