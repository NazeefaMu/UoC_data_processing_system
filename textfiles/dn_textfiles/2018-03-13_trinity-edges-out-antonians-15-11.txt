Trinity edges out Antonians 15-11

Skipper Avishka Sheik’s injury time try helped Trinity College edge past valiant St. Anthony’s College by 15 points (3 tries) to 11 (1 try, 2 penalties) in an evenly poised inter-school’s division I first round rugby match played at Nittawela grounds yesterday.
The winners should be thankful to their tireless set of forwards for this win.
At half time the Antonians led 11-5.
It was Antonians who led from the first half till injury time, but they had not brought the match winning luck from Katugastota. The Antonians should be credited for holding Trinity for the entire 70 minutes of play.
Led by Kavinda Amarakoon they deserve immense credit for the superb display of rugby. Though finishing on the losing side the way they played should give the Antonians confidence for the rest of their matches.
For Trinity Lenok Caliyaratne, Weron Weerakoon and Avishka Sheik scored the tries and for the Antonians the try came from Ishara Liyanage and the two penalties came off the boot of Mohamed Makarim.
H.P. Veranga refereed.
The under 16 game too went in favour of Trinity 24-12.
