SLT ‘Cycle Sawariya’, a boost for cycling

The country's longest cross-country cycle race “SLT Speed Up Cycle Sawariya” which will run through 5 days, covering 780 kilometres will commence from Colombo on July 27 and conclude on July 31 in Batticaloa.
Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) sponsored this fabulous event and will be conducted with the fullest support of the Cycle Federation of Sri Lanka (CFSL). The ‘Cycle Sawariya’ serves as an extension of the 2nd phase of SLT's ‘Speed Up’ journey which was launched last year and the race is conducted according to the internationally recognized set of rules and regulations.
This one of a kind cycle race will be held in six stages and will reward the winners at the end of each stage. Over 150 cyclists will take part in the race and the winner will receive a cash prize of Rs. 1 million. The overall cash prizes make up a total of over Rs. 3 million in order to recognize the cyclists’ efforts and further support their future.
“Sri Lanka needs to promote this green energy activity not only as a sport but also as a mode of travel like in advanced economies where many people cycle to work,” said Dileepa Wijesundare, SLT-CEO at a press briefing held at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo.
Veteran cyclists Anthony Siemens, B.J. Sumanasekara, Leslie Rupasinghe were felicitated at this occasion and the South Asian Games (SAG) gold medalist Jeewan Jayasinghe and Naveen Ruchira were also present in this occasion.
