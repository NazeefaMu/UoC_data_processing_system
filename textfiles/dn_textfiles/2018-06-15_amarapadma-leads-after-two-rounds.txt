UTE Engineering Pin Fernando Grand Prix:
Amarapadma leads after two rounds

The June Edition of the Pin Fernando Grand-Prix conducted by the Sri Lanka Golf Union and powered by UTE Engineering, got underway at the beautiful but challenging Sri Lanka Air Force Eagles Golf Links in Trincomalee.
Veteran N. Amarapadma maintained his lead after the halfway mark, seven strokes ahead of second placed B A Sanjeewa. N. Ranga and J M D Indika were in joint third place, a further six strokes adrift. The scores returned indicated the difficulty of the course, especially the greens and short game which made scoring tough. Nonetheless, all top ranked players participated among over 35 entries and the cut-off was implemented for the top 20 players after two rounds. The final two rounds promises a close finish with current Grand-Prix leader Sisira Kumara and the pack of top players chasing down the leader to the final hole.
