Stevie Wonder ties the knot

Steve Wonder has tied the knot for a third time to a woman 24 years younger to him, and the ceremony was a star studded one. The musician married his long-time girlfriend Tomeeka Bracy as three of the biggest names in music industry John Legend, Pharrell Williams and Usher serenaded the couple.
The Sun reports that the groom himself didn’t shy away from taking the microphone to sing for his bride. An onlooker said, “It was a very lavish, romantic and star studded affair.”
The wedding was a family affair with Stevie’s nine children, aged between three and 42 taking on the key roles of best man and bridesmaids.
