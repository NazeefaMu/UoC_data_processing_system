‘Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha’  to be remade?

If there is anyone who can be dubbed as the king of good slapstick comedy, it is ‘Mubarakan’ director Anees Bazmee. Famous for his films focusing on humour and having a great recall value due to the nature of its comedy, the director has made himself a place in every family’s favourite film watchlist.
After his film ‘Mubarakan’ starring Arjun Kapoor – Anil Kapoor in the lead roles won the hearts of his fans yet again, Bazmee has now turned his head towards another project. And this one is going to amp up the excitement level of his fans tenfold.
Ajay Devgn – Kajol starrer ‘Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha’ (1998) was an iconic film when it released, and Anees Bazmee thinks it a great idea to bring the story back to the big screen, as per a report in Deccan Chronicle.
“People are asking me to remake this film, and I am shocked at how even after so many years, people want to see the same story again on celluloid,” Anees says.
“I’m proud that it was my second film which was such a huge hit. I’d love to take it ahead. People want me to keep the same storyline, and I am also keen to do that. I will direct the remake, but I am looking for the right script,” he adds.
However, while this project is on the cards, there is another project in line, and it will see Arjun Kapoor and Anil Kapoor reprise the roles they did this year.
“I will be working with Anil and Arjun once again. I will be making ‘Mubarakaan 2’, since the film got so much appreciation. I want the two together since the film will be incomplete without the uncle and nephew duo,” said Bazmee. India Today
