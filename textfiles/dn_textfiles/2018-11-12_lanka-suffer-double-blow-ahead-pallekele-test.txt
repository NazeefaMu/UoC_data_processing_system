Injured Chandimal out of series, Dananjaya reported for suspect bowling action
Lanka suffer double blow ahead of Pallekele Test

Sri Lanka who lost the first cricket Test to England at Galle by 211 runs suffered a double blow ahead of the second Test commencing at Pallekele International Stadium on Wednesday when captain Dinesh Chandimal was ruled out for the rest of the series and to compound matters spinner Akila Dananjaya has been reported with a suspected bowling action.
Chandimal who suffered a grade one tear in the groin while fielding during the first Test at Galle has been ruled out for two weeks which affectively reduces his chances of playing in the third Test starting at the SSC on November 23 as well.
Sri Lanka will be captained by senior fast bowler Suranga Lakmal for the second and third Tests.
Lakmal captained Sri Lanka in the third Test against West Indies at Barbados and also in the two Tests against South Africa at home when Chandimal was serving a ban.
Remarkably Sri Lanka won all three Tests under his leadership – the win over West Indies enabling them to share the three-Test series one-all and the wins over South Africa giving them a clean 2-0 sweep of the series.
Sri Lanka find themselves 0-1 down in the three Test series against England and Lakmal will need to draw up all his resources to uplift the team if they are to stop England from taking a winning 2-0 lead at Pallekele.
Uncapped Charith Asalanka has been called up to the squad as Chandimal’s replacement. Asalanka scored a forceful half-century (68) against England in the second warm-up game played at the CCC.
DANANJAYA REPORTED
Akila Dananjaya reported for suspect bowling action.
The reporting of Dananjaya’s suspect bowling action by the ICC will be of great concern for Sri Lanka.
The ICC media release states: “The match officials’ report, which was handed over to the Sri Lanka team management, cited concerns about the legality of the 25-year-old’s bowling action.
“Dananjaya’s bowling action will now be scrutinised further under the ICC process relating to suspected illegal bowling actions reported in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He is required to undergo testing within 14 days and, during this period, Dananjaya is permitted to continue bowling in international cricket until the results of the testing are known.”
At the end of the Galle Test Sri Lanka’s long-standing left-arm spinner Rangana Herath quit international cricket and as they were looking for a replacement spinner for him comes the news of the legality of Dananjaya’s bowling action. Dananjaya will still be eligible to play, but what effect it will have on his bowling remains to be seen. He took two wickets in the Galle Test for 183 runs.
Malinda Pushpakumara, a left-arm spinner is the likely replacement for Herath while Sri Lanka still have the services of off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who will now becomes the senior spinner in the side and also Lakshan Sandakan who bowls left-arm chinaman.
SENANAYAKE QUITS AS MANAGER
Meanwhile in another development Charith Senanayake as resigned as manager of the Sri Lanka team at the end of the first Test at Galle citing “personal reasons” according to an SLC media release.
The ‘Daily News’ reported on Friday that there were moves to oust Senanayake from the team as manager and in his resignation letter to SLC he has stated that if his presence is “detrimental to the team’s performances” he should not be there. Jerry Woutersz has been appointed to take his place with immediate effect.
The Sri Lanka team will now have two national selectors serving them. Woutersz in addition to his managerial duties is also a national selector and Chandika Hathurusingha who is the head coach also serves in the selection committee as a selector.
