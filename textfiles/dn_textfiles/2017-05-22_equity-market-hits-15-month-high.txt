Point of view
The official reinstatement of GSP+ along with continued positive market momentum drove equities this week, helping the broad-share ASPI gain ~58 points W-o-W and shrug off losses on Monday and Thursday.
The benchmark index consequently closed in positive territory for the 8th consecutive week, driving the ASPI to a near 1.5 year high of 6729.66 points.
Renewed local and foreign institutional and HNI investor interest, helped drive turnover value over the week, pushing the week’s daily average turnover ~39% higher W-o-W to average LKR 0.93Bn (cf. LKR 0.67Bn last week and LKR 0.73Bn the week prior).

Relative to last week’s 33%, crossings this week rose to ~44% of the week’s total turnover, amid steady interest in Index heavy-weights such as JKH (~49% of week’s total crossings), Dialog (~24% of crossings), Nestle (~9% of crossings) and mid-caps such as TKYO, AEL. Retailers too remained active participants in the week’s trading, helping overall market turnover levels rise ~39% W-o-W to LKR 0.93Bn.
Invigorated market momentum since late-March has pushed up average daily turnover levels, and daily turnover levels in April and May have averaged LKR 1.2Bn cf. a daily average of LKR 0.73Bn in Q1’17. Market volumes were also driven by Foreign investors who returned strongly to markets this week to close the week in a net buying position for the 16th consecutive week (net foreign flows for the week was LKR 1.2Bn cf. LKR 0.21Bn last week). Markets in the week ahead are likely to experience some profit-taking but retain its general trend of positive momentum.
Sri Lanka regains GSP+ tariff concessions
The EU on Wednesday reinstated GSP+ tariff benefits to Sri Lanka, approx. 7 years since withdrawing the preferential trade scheme. Under the GSP+ scheme, effective May 19th 2017 Sri Lanka will be able to export >6,000 products duty free to the EU.
Although the additional tariff concessions gained by industries varies, sectors such as Apparel, Processed Foods, Seafood, Toys, Porcelain and Ceramic-ware are among the main beneficiaries under the scheme.
Within the Apparels sector for instance, duties for most apparel categories are reduced from 9.6% to 0%. Zero duties are also available for sectors such as Seafood (previously 18.5%), Fresh & Processed Fruits & Vegetables (previously 12.5%), Porcelain & Ceramic-ware (previously 8.4%) and Toys (previously 1.2%).
As apparel remains the biggest export to the EU (~61%), the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce estimates that the additional duty reduction (via GSP+) is ~$60Mn, and leading apparel exporters anticipate a 10-15% boost in export earnings over the next 12 months while export volumes are expected to increase by as much as 25%.
The EU’s reinstatement of GSP+ is expected to ease pressure on the country’s B-o-P and debt servicing issues and should help transition the country towards a more export-oriented economy. Nevertheless, the country remains eligible for the concessions only until it graduates to ‘upper-middle income economy’ status, underscoring the need to implement long term and structural changes to increase the country’s export competitiveness.
