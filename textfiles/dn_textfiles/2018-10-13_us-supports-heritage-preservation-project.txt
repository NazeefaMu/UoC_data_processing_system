US supports heritage preservation project

US Embassy’s Chargé d’affaires Robert Hilton inaugurated a two-year project to preserve pre-historic artefacts in the collection of the University of Jaffna.
The funding is provided by the U.S. Department of State under the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP). It totals over Rs. 23 million.
The project will rescue artefacts such as clay pots, brass and copper items, temple statues, coins, coral stones, and ceramic objects that are on the verge of irreversible decay.
Most of the collection was excavated in the Northern Province.
The project will involve both undergraduate and postgraduate archaeology students of the University of Jaffna. Professor P. Pushparatnam, a senior professor and the Project Director, submitted the proposal to the U.S. Embassy and AFCP.
University of Jaffna Vice-Chancellor Professor R. Vigneswaran will assist the project.“A nation’s cultural heritage is one of its most precious resources,” said Chargé Hilton.
“Cultural heritage reminds us of the historical experiences of humanity.
“I am delighted that the U.S. Embassy is supporting the preservation of these important artefacts, which tell the story of the Sri Lankan people.” When preservation is complete, the objects will be on display at the University of Jaffna’s museum.
Since 2001, AFCP has funded 13 projects in Sri Lanka, including the conservation of a Buddhist temple, the restoration of the Batticaloa Dutch Fort, the preservation of Buddhist, Hindu, and other collections in the Anuradhapura Archaeological Museum, and the preservation of the intangible heritage of ritual music and dance forms of the Adivasi, Tamil, and Buddhist communities.
AFCP supports the preservation of cultural sites, cultural objects, and forms of traditional cultural expression in more than 100 countries.
