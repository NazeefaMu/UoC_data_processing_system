‘Living with MS’- addressing the issues of Multiple Sclerosis

World MS Day:
In a bid to raise awareness about Multiple Sclerosis (MS) amongst the general public Multiple Sclerosis Association of Lanka (MSAL) organized a walk themed ‘Living with MS’ on World MS Day with the participation of MS patients and care givers recently.
The participants commenced the walk from the Cinnamon Gardens Baptists Church premises and continued towards the Viharamahadevi Park and back for a commemorative lunch served at the church. On a courteous gesture the MSAL went on a step further to reimburse a portion of travel costs that MS patients had to bear. Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder of the brain and the spinal cord (the central nervous system) which causes communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body due to the immune system attacking the protective sheath that covers nerve fibers. A significant segment of the general public is not aware of this condition which severely impacts the lives of both the patients and their families and requires the interest and support of the larger community.
Calling for heightened public awareness of the condition, the MSAL, President Dr. Enoka Corea stated at the event that one of their key areas of concerns for MS patients are the lack of accessibility for them to public-spaces – be it a place of entertainment, place-of-worship and more importantly the lack of employment opportunities for them.
“This is a serious issue which causes patients to feel useless and unproductive which in turn tends to affect their mental health and well-being. The stigma of disability and unwarranted pity can alienate them from day-today-activities and the society in general. It is important to remind ourselves that all of us will have some sort of a disability with ageing and that all of us benefit if we address these issues,” she added.
In Sri Lanka, MSAL has held commemorations of this day ever since the first World MS day in 2009.
