Vito named Top 14 player of the year

Paris: New Zealand's Victor Vito of La Rochelle was voted French Top 14 player of the year for 2016-2017 on Monday for his part in the club's run for the title.
The 30-year-old back-row was selected ahead of Clermont centre Remi Lamerat and Lyon flanker Carl Fearns following a vote by members of the players' union.
Vito took part in the All Blacks' World Cup wins in both 2011 and 2015 and joined the French club last season from Wellington outfit Hurricanes.
La Rochelle ended the regular season top of the French league but were eliminated at the semi-final stage of the title play-offs. AFP
