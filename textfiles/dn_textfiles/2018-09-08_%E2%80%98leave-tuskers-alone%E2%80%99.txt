‘Leave tuskers alone’

The Sithulpawwa Raja Maha Viharaya Viharadipathi Ven. Metaraba Hemaratana Thera requested devotees visiting the Sithulpawwa Raja Maha Viharaya Sylvan Shrine, not to feed tuskers roaming in the area. This is due to the threat posed to the lives of devotees.
The Thera said a couple of tuskers roaming in the area had become a nuisance to devotees visiting the viharaya.
