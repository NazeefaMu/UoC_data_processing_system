Lift glyphosate ban fully

In recent years, there has been no subject in agriculture as widely discussed as glyphosate, both locally and globally, but no country has rushed into banning this global weed killer in agriculture except Sri Lanka.
The other countries having studied in depth the risks versus benefits, have decided to extend its use as benefits far outweigh the risks. Given the fact that the share of glyphosate exceeds 50 percent of the total pesticide volume that is globally used, the occurrence of some risks is to be expected. No pesticide, for that matter, no pharmaceutical is totally safe. However, in recent times some doctors, especially the SLMA, have been objecting to the lifting of the ban, regrettably without weighing the benefits vis-a-vis the risks. The banning of the weed killer has substantially affected the agriculture of the country.
Two eminent doctors, writing to a newspaper on March 29, opposing lifting of the glyphosate ban, argued that “in the absence of a particular policy, and when there is suspected reason for causing harm to the public, action should be to avoid further exposures rather than wait for final proof.”
In the same article, weighing the scientific evidence, they concluded that “there is no final proof that glyphosate is harmful”! If there is no evidence, must the ban continue? Why do these doctors not act in the matter of air pollution by vehicle exhaust fumes or the Norochcholai toxic emissions? Aren’t they thousands of times more toxic that glyphosate?
Glyphosate, God Natha and SLMA
Cyperus (kalanduru) competing with maize.
The ban was evidently instigated by a flawed hypothesis that appeared in a ‘rubbishy’ journal in 2014, published by a few scientists, two of them local, of which one is supposedly the ‘local agent for God Natha’ and has psychic powers rather than a knowledge of science! The hypothesis is that glyphosate-forming complexes with metal ions (calcium and magnesium) in the hard water prevalent in the Rajarata and toxic heavy metals (arsenic and cadmium) from agrochemicals cause kidney damage (CKDu).
This hypothesis has not been supported by any other scientific publications, and has been totally rejected on the grounds of faulty chemistry, by several leading chemists, including a highly reputed professor of chemistry of the Peradeniya University. However, the SLMA came out in support of it! The senior author of the paper even wrote an article in a Sinhala newspaper on the title “Glyphosate dissolves reservoir bunds: what talk of kidneys?”
As per the grapevine, this God Natha’s agent cured a sickness of the wife of the then Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, who, as a favour, provided funds for analytical work to be done in the USA relating to the said hypothesis.
That the money for the work was provided by that Ministry is a fact, although this research was outside its mandate. This is the way decisions are made and things happen in this country!
Glyphosate in mothers’ milk!
Incidentally, the third co-author, now domiciled in California, has just appeared in Sri Lanka and made a few presentations to several audiences, in which, amongst other things, he has claimed, as reported in a newspaper, that even breast milk in US mothers’ has glyphosate residues. Surely, he should have known that glyphosate in breast milk was a scary claim of an NGO called Moms Across America. It was also supported by anti-agrochemical and anti-GMO food lobbies such as the US Organic Consumers’ Association, Eco Watch and Democracy Now.
Numerous studies have shown that glyphosate does not bioaccumulate, and a Washington State University study found no glyphosate residues in the breast milk of any of the women tested. More convincingly, an exhaustive 2016 study of the German Federal Institute confirmed that there is no evidence of glyphosate in the breast milk analysed. Incidentally, there was a similar scare of traces of glyphosate residues in wine a few years back. It is laughable when the wine (alcohol) itself is a Class 1 carcinogen! So has this doctor come over again to fool Sri Lankans, having earlier misled our state leaders into banning glyphosate? There is no evidence that he has been into any serious research on glyphosate other than being a co-author of the controversial paper referred to above.
Our medical doctors have totally ignored or are ignorant of the massive negative impact of the glyphosate ban on the agriculture of the country. Whilst some countries have prohibited the use of glyphosate in parks and other public places following the International Agency Research on Cancer (IARC) prognostication that glyphosate is likely to cause cancer, no country, to my knowledge, has banned its use in agriculture. As said before, no agrochemical or, for that matter, pharmaceutical that is totally safe, and should the medical fraternity be reminded of the wise words of the founding father of the science of pharmacology, Professor Bombastus Paracelsus (1493–1541), also professor of both physics and chemistry of the University of Basel, that “all substances are poisons; there is none which is not a poison; it is the dosage that differentiates poison and remedy”? There is no argument that misuse of agrochemicals can pollute the environment and harm peoples’ health. So will pharmaceuticals if misused. Swallow 25 tablets of paracetamol and you will be dead; half a tablet is adequate to kill a rat.
Bad science and politics
Both bad scientific advice from two of the co-authors of the above cited paper and political pressure brought to bear by a Buddhist priest, also a politician, were responsible for this foolish decision in 2015 to ban glyphosate in the entire country. The story goes that in 2014, the priest, so overwhelmingly anti-pesticide, even dashed his glyphosate file on the presidential candidate’s table insisting that glyphosate be banned, or otherwise he will return to the opposite camp. He won. The IARC report which appeared soon after the new government was formed, that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic, was also probably instrumental in the ban although it had nothing to do with CKDu.
Sadly, the government made blunder after blunder on the glyphosate episode. It, at the onset, never appointed an expert panel of scientists and medical specialists to study the matter in depth. In fact, the statutory body of professionals on pesticides, the Pesticide Technical Advisory Committee, was never consulted on the matter.
There was only a meeting of the Agriculture Ministry and some officials of research institutions, chaired by the President, at which a key figure was the politician priest referred to above, who in fact dominated the meeting, not even allowing scientists to talk. They all meekly gave into him. A professor of chemistry had attended the meeting on invitation, but was shouted down by the priest when he attempted to explain matters. That is how scientific decisions are made in this country.
Media ethics
The priest did not stop there. Using his political clout, he has prevailed on the media, especially several TV channels to publicise his bad science misleading the public. One channel even named its programme in Sinhala on CKDu the ‘Agricultural Kidney Disease’ and throughout had programmes with biased people of the ilk of the priest that claimed agrochemicals are its cause. On two occasions I wrote to the channel proposing participation of independent scientists in the programme, especially representatives from the relevant institutions, but never had any response. The media in seeking sensation over fact, too often give erroneous messages to the public. Incidentally, the priest’s knowledge of agriculture and ecology is so poor that he even questioned, in one of his articles relating to chemical fertilizers, “whether forest trees grow with applied chemical fertilizer” implying that crops too can grow without it. He is, however, also one of the national leaders of the toxin free-agriculture programme.
Glyphosate–cancer story
The 2015 IARC study that classified glyphosate as “probably cancer causing” overwhelmed environmentalists with joy, especially in Europe, and demanded banning glyphosate. However, many countries in South East Asia were relatively unmoved. That study stated that there is limited evidence of cancer in humans; sufficient evidence of it in experimental animals and strong evidence of genotoxicity caused by glyphosate.
On the other hand, a much wider, US Agricultural Health Study (AHS) that was published last November engaging some 90,000 farmers from two states that regularly used glyphosate did not find evidence of cancer or other health problem in the subjects. A criticism of the latter study is that subjects were followed up only for short periods. However, it continued for over 20 years.
Interestingly, in a California court case by farmers who claimed that their health was affected by glyphosate use, it came to pass that Aaron Blair, an epidemiologist and leader of the IARC study, also a key figure in the AHS, had the findings of the latter with him when the IARC report was published. Had he divulged the AHS findings, the IARC conclusions would have been different. When the court questioned him on this point, he confessed so but stated that he did not reveal the AHS findings at that stage as they were not published. The court decision, finally, was only to carry a label on the glyphosate containers that it is ‘probably cancer causing’.
A further report on an in-depth study, that of the Joint Meeting of the Pesticide Residues (JMPR) of the FAO and WHO, 2016, also concluded that there is neither acceptable evidence of carcinogenicity nor of genotoxicity. Despite the confusion and uncertainty, precautions in the use of pesticide are warranted. The IARC classification is one of hazard, implying that safety measures should be taken when using glyphosate, although it has a very high value (2.1 mg per kg of body weight) of allowable daily intake. A lit candle is a hazard if you hold onto your body, but not for lighting your room. The need for taking precautions when using any pesticide cannot be overstressed.
The glyphosate risk is a drop in the ocean compared to the other environmental risks that we face daily. How much of Class 1 carcinogens do we inhale daily from vehicle exhaust fumes? The vociferous SLMA should read the explosive report on the Norochcholai coal power plant and jump to action. It is reported that to date 2,400 kg mercury, 14.5 kg cadmium, 78 kg cobalt, 308 kg cromium and many other toxins have been emitted into the environment.
Also, approximately 100 tons of fly ash are emitted per day of which 80 percent is less than 10 microns, and they are blown about, remaining suspended in the air causing serious respiratory ailments.
The glyphosate ban has been lifted for tea and rubber, but there is also a compelling need for glyphosate to cost-effectively control weeds in other crops too. In fact, rubber is the crop that needs glyphosate the least. In banning glyphosate, the government has unwittingly pushed the CKDu farmers from the frying pan to the fire. They have an insurmountable problem of controlling some noxious weeds such as cooch grass and kalanduru (Cyperus), which spread rapidly with their underground propagules. Ploughing and harrowing cannot control them, but glyphosate does it effectively.
At present, their saviour is Indian illicit glyphosate, freely available, but six times the cost in India. The illicit glyphosate trade is no second to the illicit drug trade.
The government should immediately lift the ban on this weed killer for all crops.
