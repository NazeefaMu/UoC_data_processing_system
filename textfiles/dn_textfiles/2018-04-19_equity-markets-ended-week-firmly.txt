Point of view 
Equity markets ended the week firmly, gaining ~29 points week-on-week, despite hitting 11-week low on Monday since Mid-January.
Although activity levels remained largely dull in the holiday shortened week due to traditional New Year, the benchmark Index hit a 4-week high of 6,483.91 gaining ~29 points (~0.44% W-o-W) while the S&P 20 index hit a 4-week high of 3,676.98 gaining ~20 points (~0.55% W-o-W).
The average weekly turnover declined by ~49% Week-on-Week to 0.5Bn, lowest since December holidays.
Local Institutional and HNI participation accounted for ~65% (of total market turnover) during the week, higher than the average of ~49% so far in 2018 while Softlogic Finance, Ceylinco Insurance & JKH accounted for largest proportion of crossings (~75%).
Market sentiment had improved after no-faith motion against the Prime minister was defeated 46 votes and the policy rates were eased by 25bps, as the ASPI improved ~40 points (~0.61%), while the S&P 20 index improved 37 points (~1.01%) since 4th April.
Foreign investors recorded a net foreign outflow of Rs.0.5Bn cf. a net foreign inflow of Rs.1.7Bn (highest since 1st week of Jan-18) last week.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the cabinet reshuffle expected to happen before the Traditional New Year, and the activity levels are expected to recover as investors return to markets post the New Year holidays.
Global markets unsettled by geopolitical developments and US protectionism concerns
Reflecting both the heightened sense of domestic political instability and changes in global risk appetite, net foreign inflows to the bourse have begun to indicate a declining trend over Q1’18. Indeed, even excluding the one-off sale in Mar’18 when ORIX Corporation of Japan sold its 29.97% stake in LOLC Plc to LOLC Holdings for Rs.12.8Bn, net inflows to the CSE display a declining trend.
February remained a challenging month for global financial markets, with most asset classes recording losses for the 1st time in months: Global equities lost money for the 1st time since Oct’16 while worldwide bond markets were on track for its worst monthly performance since Nov’16.
For the 1st time since Nov’16, global investors appeared to reject EM/FM assets as net foreign portfolio flows to emerging markets fell $4.5Bn in February, ending a 14-month streak of net inflows.
Although the broad sell off in these EM/FM assets eased somewhat over Mar’18, global financial market volatility remained high amid rising concerns over global trade wars following the US’s tariffs on Metal imports, the worsening diplomatic tension between Britain and Russia and ongoing turmoil within the US political landscape.
Reflecting these broader global themes and also the heightened sense of political instability domestically, net foreign flows to Sri Lankan Equity and Debt markets reversed their positions for the 1st time in months.
Net foreign holdings of G-Sec’s in Mar’18 fell 3.2% to total Rs320Bn cf. Rs.330Bn in Jan. Meanwhile, net foreign inflows to equities which recorded a 3-year high in 2017 eased to Rs. 7.2Bn (excl. LOLC sale) by end-Q1’18 as net inflows in Mar fell to Rs.1.2Bn from Rs.2.0Bn in Feb’18 and Rs. 4.0Bn in Jan’18.
