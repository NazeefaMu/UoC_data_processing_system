Sagala ready to step down

Issuing a special communiqué, Law, Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka announced that he is willing to sacrifice his ministerial portfolio in the best interest of his party, the United National Party.
He had conveyed this personal decision at a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday morning.
Subsequently, he has also informed the Parliamentary Group Meeting of the UNP about his decision.
“I am prepared to sacrifice any position on behalf of the UNP and I’ve always given my utmost and will do my best for the future of the UNP,” he said.
“I will not waiver in my decision. However, I am prepared to take over any other position offered by the party leadership,” Minister Ratnayaka said.
The Minster had reportedly said that he has come under undue criticism from several quarters including President Maithripala Sirisena who had raised concerns. As there are discussions pertaining to a Cabinet reshuffle, the Minister announced that he was willing to give up his position.
“This will enable the Prime Minister to appoint a suitable person to my position. My loyalty to the party will remain as strong as ever,” he said. The Minister’s decision comes in the wake of attempts made by the UNP and the UPFA to show majority support in the 225-member Legislature.
