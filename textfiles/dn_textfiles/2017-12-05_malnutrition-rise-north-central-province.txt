Malnutrition on the rise in North Central Province

The malnutrition among mothers and children in the Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts is on the rise. North Central Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena told the Daily News.
The districts have 15,000 children under the age of five years suffering from acute malnutrition complications, recent surveys revealed. The majority of low-income families are unable to afford balanced meals, and are unaware that their children are suffering from malnutrition.
The parents who battle to earn their livelihood don't have time to spare for caring about the ill health symptoms appearing on their children, and neither medical care nor attention is sought, Bandulasena further added.
He said that he has requested the Provincial Council to allocate a minimum of Rs. 25 million from the 2018 budget to enhance the living conditions, especially concerning dietary habits of children under five years belonging to 1,000 families, who fall prey to malnutrition, as an initiative of a provincial anti-malnutrition campaign.
The programme will be implemented under the auspices of the National Nourishment Programme.
In the meantime, it was learnt that plans meant for identifying households where mothers and children are suffering from malnutrition at a district level through district nourishment committees, has been a failure due to lack of funds, proper guidance, and less interest over the issue.
Also the training programmes aimed at making pre-school students and teachers aware of the gravity of malnutrition, the solutions to be adopted, coordination aspects, finding resources to battle against the menace, etc., are not developing and achieving the planned targets.
As revealed at the August committee session, after holding 23 training and awareness programmes concerning malnutrition, only a sum of Rs. 250,000 had been allocated.
