Revolutionary inclusion

They are gifted in so many ways. They have courage and they are ready to compete. They are admirable athletes- men, woman and children. And it is an honour and privilege to meet them. They may be different but they are an inspiration to everyone else. If they can cope with their problems, then that is something we all can learn from. The Special Olympics is the world’s largest sports organization for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. They have proved that nothing is impossible and that problems are actually opportunities to rise above ones circumstances and celebrate humanity.

The Special Olympics will be held in Abu Dhabi from March 14 – 21, 2019.
Daily News met up with Chairman, Special Olympics Serendib (Sri Lanka) Dr. A.G.N. Kariyawasam who updated us on Sri Lanka’s involvement in the Special Olympics.
Kariyawasam feels that helping disabled people in Sri Lanka is his calling and his duty and responsibility.
“I have lived in the UK for the last 35 years, and moved to Sri Lanka to look after intellectually disabled people totaling more than 700,000 people in Sri Lanka. They are cornered and ill -treated and put in a category that says they can do nothing for this country. This is far from the truth because actually they can do so many things that even a regular person cannot do,” said Dr. Kariyawasam.
Kariyawasam stated that we need to recognize what they can do, highlight this and give them recognition so they might be a benefit to society and it will also benefit them because often they are marginalized.
“I have realized that, physical education and sports are the most effective pathway for them to realize their potential. These intellectually disabled have an IQ level of under 70. For those people even though educating them might be a problem, you can train them. If you train them, you will see astounding results. They can perform tasks so efficiently that even a normal person would find hard to do. According to the way you look at things, their limited capacities may actually be more of a help than a hindrance depending on the situation. For example, the blind man can hear better than a person with vision. If one’s ability is down the other abilities work at greater efficiency,” explained Kariyawasam.
The Special Olympics was founded in July, 20, 1968 by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was the sister of John F. Kennedy. Their sister Rosemary was born with intellectual disabilities. Shriver’s inspiration for the Special Olympics came from Rosemary’s disability.
“More than 4.9 million athletes and Unified Sports partners are involved in Special Olympics sports training and competition in 172 countries. So what we do is, we put them to sports exposing them to events and competitions. So these individuals come out and show their abilities. We also do medical check- ups and vocational therapy so they themselves can recognize what they can do which will help them survive,” stated Kariyawasam.
Sri Lanka has been divided into 25 districts which have been placed under the care of directors, so those areas might be controlled. The 50th Anniversary of the Special Olympics is just around the corner. It came to Sri Lanka in 2004. But unfortunately it did not run properly.
“I came down to Sri Lanka in 2014 and started it again. Though it is successful, we need some help to ensure the sustainability of the program. For this, one can volunteer to help. We have leadership programs as well to identify the leaders amongst them. We need a place for them to stay so we need help from the government or any voluntary organization. We want all these partners to join with us, and help these deserving people,” added Kariyawasam.
Kariyawasam stated that they have faced challenges and difficulties at a time when there was little support. This is because there is very little awareness concerning intellectually disabled people. People do not understand that these intellectually disabled people can contribute to a holistic society.
“However with awareness the willingness will come naturally. I believe the citizens of our country will definitely help if we put it to the masses. People would like to help but have no proper idea concerning the situation. So the only path set before us to raise awareness. It should be of national interest. If we have the support then anything is possible. But we need help from volunteers. But due to the rat race in the country, people can only think of their own families. They also work all the time,” pointed out KariyawasamThese children are very innocent and they need love. They are very expressive and trusting. However the good news is that there are people who love these children. Even the adults, who are intellectually disabled, are like these children.
“Our disabled people arrived at the air- port with gold medals, but there was nobody to accept us. This is sad to say. I am not blaming anyone but this is because there is no awareness. We have been to Australia, Austria, China, America, Greece and Abu Dhabi. But we need funds,” said Kariyawasam
Kariyawasam however pointed out that intellectually disabled people who come from poor families face a very serious problem. How can they buy their air tickets? They need someone who can be of help when paying for the air ticket, and also for the sports items and sports gear. “Normally to get the Special Olympics accreditation there are so many things to do. We entered it in 2004. It however collapsed in 2012.This is because a proper job was not done. They scrapped Special Olympics Sri Lanka and when I came back I could not get the name back. So it went like Special Olympics Serendib. It happened in India and Japan as well. Washington DC is the governing partner.
So I came here in 2014. So the governing body of the Special Olympics tried me out. I did my job properly and then they accredited us, and I am now able to send people abroad,” said Kariyawasam.When you look at the outside appearance of these intellectually disabled people you might immediately jump to conclusions about them. They are such nice people because they have no concept of malice or jealousy. They are not selfish. No competition. That is the beauty. “But they play cricket like Sanath Jayasuriya. But they are not allowed to play because of these prejudices. But they are batting on. They follow instructions. When they are asked to score a target they go and do it. In football you only need to tell them what to do and they go and accomplish it. I can cry when I see all this. If we at least can buy our air tickets that will be giant step. If we can get the sports gear that too will make such a difference,” said Kariyawasam.
