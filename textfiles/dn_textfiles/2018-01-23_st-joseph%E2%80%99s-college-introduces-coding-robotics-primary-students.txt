St. Joseph’s College  introduces coding, robotics  to primary students

St. Joseph’s College, in partnership with Create Lab Singapore, will begin offering coding, robotics and design thinking enrichment programs to students starting from the 2018 academic year.
With technology rapidly taking over many aspects of jobs and industries, St. Joseph’s is taking the lead in preparing students to thrive in a digital future. The program will be available to students in the Primary School as a way of exposing them to new skills and to encourage them to develop a lifelong interest in science and technology.
By the end of the program students will be able to independently create their own computer games, learning tools and digital stories. They will progress on to designing their own mobile apps and smart devices. During this learning process, students will cultivate their creativity and imagination while also developing important life skills in the form of team work, critical thinking, public speaking and problem solving.
All programs will be conducted by Create Lab. They are Singapore’s leading coding, robotics and design school with collaborations with the Government of Singapore, Google, Softbank and NUS Enterprise.
The curriculums are developed by academics from Oxford, MIT and Singapore leading universities and include the latest educational technologies, tools and teaching methodologies. The students who follow Create Lab’s program at St. Joseph’s College will have the same learning experiences and certifications as their students in Singapore.
“The age of the fourth industrial revolution will be an era driven by technology and smart systems, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and big data. In an increasingly digitalized world, the skills that will determine success will be the ability to imagine, create, empathize and solve problems.
Coding skills are a powerful tool that can stimulate and bring forth these already existing abilities within children. Coding helps children improve their analytical thinking and help them look at the bigger picture,” said Create Lab’s CEO, Thilan Wickramasinghe.
“We are very proud to part of this initiative by St. Joseph’s College. We are looking forward to helping raise a generation of Josephians who will be empowered to become the digital leaders of tomorrow,” he added.
