The National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) will support the Government’s endeavours to implement the agreed reforms, National Movement for Social Justice Convener Prof.Sarath Wijesooriya said. Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Wijesooriya said, “Forty-nine organisations of the National Movement for Social Justice signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government on January 8, in 2015. The abolishment of the Executive Presidency, Empowerment of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution so as to strengthen commissions and other independent organisations and the establishment of an equitable electoral system were some of the main terms of the MoU.”
“The present regime has also contributed to the country’s progress by means of establishing independent commissions and strengthening the freedom for anyone to air their opinions.The Government also introduced the 19th Amendment to the Constitution with solutions for some of the prevailing problems as promised,” Prof. Wijesooriya added.
The Convener also said that the Government still had not paid its fullest attention towards the abolishment of the Executive Presidency which was the main purpose for the establishment of a consensus Government in order to reform the Constitution.
Wijesooriya further said that the procedure to take legal action against criminals should be expedited to regain public confidence.
