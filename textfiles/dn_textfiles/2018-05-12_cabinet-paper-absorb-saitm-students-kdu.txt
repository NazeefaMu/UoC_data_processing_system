CABINET PAPER TO ABSORB SAITM STUDENTS TO KDU

A Cabinet paper will be presented next Tuesday to transfer 980 medical students from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) to the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU), Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe confirmed yesterday.
“Their transfer will depend on their qualification as well as their performance at SAITM and they will only be absorbed into the KDU after the completion of their academic and clinical studies. Once satisfied, the KDU will confer them the KDU medical degree,” he told the Daily News.
The Minister added that the cabinet proposal to be tabled in Cabinet next Tuesday when approved will see a series of action that will facilitate the transfer of these students. SAITM students have been holding a series of protests calling for a speedy solution to the protracted issue of their medical degrees.
The students demanded the government hasten the implementation of the KDU proposal. Students cited that President Maithripala Sirisena had come up with the KDU solution last December. However it was yet to see the light of day.
