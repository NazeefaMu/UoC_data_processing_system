Thilakasiri challenges Basil to appoint ‘Phottuwa’organizers

Western Provincial Council Minister Gamini Thilakasiri yesterday, challenged former Minister Basil Rajapaksa to appoint organizers to all electorates from ‘Phottuwa’ (a flower bud) Prty without calling for nominations publishing newspaper advertisements.
He alleged that former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is the person who attempted to destroy the SLFP. All SLFPers and the people of this country very well knows that, Basil Rajapaksa cannot form any party and he can only destroy a party.
Thilakasiri was speaking at a media conference held at Shawasthri, Colombo yesterday.
Thilakasiri also questioned as to why the Pohottuwa Party has not yet revealed the name of its Chairman. He further said that nobody will hand over their nominations if they know who the chairman of this new party is. Therefore, they have allegedly published newspaper advertisements without mentioning the name of the Chairman.
