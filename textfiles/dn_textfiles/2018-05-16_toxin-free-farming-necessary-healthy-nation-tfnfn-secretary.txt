Toxin free farming necessary for a healthy nation - TFNFN Secretary

Toxin Free National Farmer Network (TFNFN) yesterday urged the government not to reverse the toxin free farming successfully practiced by more than five thousand farmers during past two three years.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA), TFNFN Secretary S. K. Subasinghe said that most of the farmers those who are engaged in toxin free farming had to be converted in to the chemical farming method due to the re-implementation of the fertilizer subsidy.
Though the government decided to grant a subsidy for the farmers who engage in toxin free farming, that decision has remained at discussion level for a long period. So, most of the farmers have converted in to chemical farming method as they have no other choice.
He stressed the importance of granting the proposed subsidy for toxin free farming without any delay, in order to encourage farmers those who engage in toxin free farming with the intention of creating a healthy nation.
He further added that the new Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has also recommended the toxin free farming by converting his paddy field in to an organic paddy field.
Addressing the occasion, TFNFN Chairman Priyantha Pathirana charged that the Ministers those who submitted the cabinet paper asking to remove the ban on phosphate, have fulfilled the requirement of chemical companies.
"Both of them are dreaming to be the President of the country by putting the entire nation in to danger," Pathirana further charged.
