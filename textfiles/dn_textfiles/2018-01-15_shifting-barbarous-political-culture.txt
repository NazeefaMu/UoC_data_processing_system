Shifting from barbarous political culture

Sri Lanka has become the homeland for the Buddhist Doctrine as wished by the Gautama Buddha. He is said to have blessed this country thrice. His first visit to this island has taken place on a Duruthu Full Moon Poya day like on the first day of January 2018, just passed. Buddhism in this island nation is surrounded by Hinduism from India, Christianity from Rome and Islam from Mecca in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All these religious denominations wish peace, harmony, unity and coexistence bearing with and sharing out among all.
When the countrymen celebrated the dawn of the new year, there was an unanticipated peace, joy and happiness among them and calmness and quietness all over the country except for the usual don’ts that took place under Dutch courage when crapulent played havoc with participants amidst the festivities in some parts of the country owing to delirium tremens (DT) ending up in hospitals and police stations. Coincidentally, the Full Moon Poya day fell on the day when Christians were to celebrate the solemnity of Virgin Mary, the Mother of Lord Jesus Christ. But, devotees of both religions attended to their religious rites and rituals in unison and in silence. That’s called cooperation which is vital for maintaining harmony. It further substantiated that the feeling of hatred towards religions that existed from primordial times has ended. Therefore, the beginning of this year is auspicious and we can look forward to precious changes that would lead the country to prosperity through collective efforts.
Centenary celebration
The spectacular event that followed on January 03rd was the centenary celebration of the Ceylon Daily News turned Daily News. During the days of the British planters in this country, the Ceylon Daily News and the Ceylon Observer by D R Wijewardena and the Times of Ceylon by Donald Ranaweera were the three English newspapers read in the estate sector too. My father as one of the few local planters among the Europeans in the Kegalle district when Pilapitiya brothers were planters in the hill country received these three newspapers every day. The Tappal Cooly, (the estate sector usage during colonial times for a postman or a messenger in the outer world, the English version of ‘Thavaal for ‘Mail’ and ‘Cooly’ for the labourer in Tamil) had to walk miles ascending and descending hills to go to a remote town to bring the newspapers and the mail. The man who went in the a.m. returned in the p.m. Unlike today by a ‘click’ in a moment even before the sun rises today, we read newspapers in that era in the afternoons. It was in 1949 that at the age of ten my father gave me a copy of the Ceylon Daily News to read.
I remember it carried in its first page a cabinet size photograph of Lord Herwald Ramsbotham Soulbury, the first Governor General of independent Ceylon (Sri Lanka now) in pure white ceremonial dress walking up to board the white horse-drawn chariot which drew him to the King’s house escorted by mounted police in white uniform. I must make mention that I was present with my father standing on the left passage of the Mackinnon Mackinze building in the adjacency of the Grand Oriental Hotel when Lord Soulbury came out of the harbour and walked up to the chariot. Unlike today in any event important or not, big or small there were few spectators, not a huge curious crowd, to grace the occasion.
This newspaper was so respected that during the days when Christian Missionaries were our teachers we students were directed to read the Editorial to learn précis writing. Since then, it became my paper too.
The Daily News has retained its popularity and prestige until it reached its 100th anniversary and, it will continue to prosper. “Men may come and men may go but, I go on forever is what the triumphant lakeside Daily News which among other publications has taken the pride of place, say today.
May you be surrounded by councils of Advisers and multitude of the literati and lead you to infinity enabling you to provide the unending readership with crème de la crème of journalism.
Local Government election
On the eve of our bidding farewell to 2017 and transmigration to 2018, a statement was made by the President Maithripala Sirisena in the form of a deterrent that he will be tremendous and act drastically on the local government election contestants, their sympathizers or others who breach election laws and rules of correct behaviour during the period of local government elections with no considerations. This meant that the long - drawn implementation of election laws have at long last come to life. This realization is welcome.
The Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya not only has taken instructions he has also taken up the cudgels to execute a huge responsibility of wiping out a barbarous political culture. As a public servant who has proved his loyalty and efficiency the Election Commission Chairman has taken bold steps and risks during the last few days to ensure that election laws are implemented to the letter preventing intimidation, threat and thuggery on the voters by politicians and constituents in alliance with them and violent campaigning among themselves too. He is in the field directing his subordinates to go in line with the chapters, sections and subsections of the election enactment.
In support of his indefatigable involvement, the police have read the riot act wherever it became necessary. As a result, a peaceful environment has set in. By this, we have seen the end of a deep-seated menace and, all involved are compelled to conduct their campaigns ethically this time for the first time in the election history which we must determine to continue to establish a new political culture for civilized people.
The amalgamation of the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party was proposed in the fifth decade of the past century when we had an opposition full of pugnacious and sanguinary leftists who were hell-bent to destroy democracy. During the premiership of SWRD Bandaranaike situation worsened when they did not allow him to work restfully, peacefully and sensibly on any day creating a strike every day to paralyse his administration. It went on until his tragic demise. The fruition of this proposal for amalgamation has been decided by the time as a need of the era has been implemented through the Premier Ranil Wickremasinghe, took effect in 2015 but, it’s not well coupled. It has taken donkey’s years to come up to this junction at snail’s pace and at this juncture the need to act decisively to impress upon every denizen in every household in each and every constituency about the responsibility of the citizens to think responsibly and cast their votes to establish a consensus government unanimously to end the seventy years old tug-of-war.
Eliminate corrupt elements
All of us excluding the corrupt have decided to eradicate corruption and eliminate corrupt elements. With this view in mind, the two main parties have nominated their candidates and as confirmed by them every individual has been selected after a positive vetting. This means that there is a guarantee about our having in the local bodies people with clean habits in the future.
The local government bodies should not be allowed to function as independent bodies. They have the independence to work independently but, that should be subject to supervision. They have to report to somebody and they have to account for their actions since it is the first level in this administration from where the progress of the country and accountability begins. There is a Cabinet minister for the local government. At present, he sits in the ministry and talks in the house. If he is empowered and adequately powerful and, if a carte blanche is given to him why is he not acting as a taskmaster? This is a shortcoming descending from the previous regimes. A definite change must come after this election primarily with regard to the performances of Pradeshiya Sabhas not leaving other councils too, alone.
The regular presence of the minister in all these premises, his guidance, directions and intervention will certainly enthuse and activate them enabling the minister to make use of them profitably during their next tenure of office.
The politicians are enthusiastically in the field canvassing but, the people are not. The bewildered they are observant this time because the requests they honoured to vote for the politicians in the past who visited them in full European kits like inflated generalissimos and others in the so-called pure white in colour national dress with thread wrapped in their wrists like ascetics have failed to satisfy them. Many have failed, not all. So, the corrupt politicians in sheep’s clothing should beware of the voters. This information is noteworthy.
