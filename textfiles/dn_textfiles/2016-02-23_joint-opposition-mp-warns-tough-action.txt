Joint Opposition MP warns of tough action

 
Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Ranjith De Soysa warned of tough action if their demand to be recognized as an independent group is rejected by the Speaker.
De Soysa said that the group has already requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to recognize them as an independent group and afford them the privileges given to an individual party.
"We have spoken to him 13 times, and submitted written requests regarding the matter. We expect him to recognize the joint opposition as an independent group. But if he doesn't we will take stern action," he said. De Soysa said that they have not preplanned a course of action in the event their request is rejected by the Speaker.
"But we will take stern action," De Soysa warned.
We headed the request of the Prime Minister and the Speaker last time and cooperated with them to hold a good debate. Meanwhile, the Joint Opposition is to meet at 2 p.m. today.
