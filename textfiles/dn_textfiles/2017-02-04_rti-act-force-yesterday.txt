RTI Act in force from yesterday

The Right to Information (RTI) Act came in to force with effect from yesterday fulfilling one of President Maithripala Sirisena’s pledges during the last Presidential election campaign.The Act aims to restore transparency and good governance in the country, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said.
“Earlier, we had a government that suppressed information whereas now the situation has changed with information freely available,” Minister Karunathilaka said. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the minister said many previous attempts were made to introduce this Bill, but,they did not succeed. Although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe obtained Cabinet approval in 2001 as Prime Minister, the government elected in 2004 did not go ahead with it. Even though, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya tried to bring it as a Private Member Motion as an Opposition member on two occasions, the previous government did not let him proceed with it.
“This legislation is very strong having received inputs from civil society organisations, academics, journalists and the public. It is now within the top 9 RTI laws in the world. Although, we were the last South Asian to bring RTI, today we are second only to India in terms of its effectiveness,” the minister said.
“As a government, we are proud that we were able to enforce RTI, a day before the country’s 69th Independence anniversary. This will specially help the media obtain correct information and do the more investigative stories. We have trained information officers by conducting awareness programmes for Ministry Secretaries, Local Government members and public officers to implement this move. Around 1,500 information officers have been appointed to all branches of government to make the RTI more effective,” Minister Karunathilaka said. “The law was passed in Parliament in August 2016 and the stipulated time frame for its implementation was six months, but, “We have done it well before the dead line,” the minister said.
Hereafter, February 3 will go down in the history as the day of freedom of information while February 4 is the day our nation gained its freedom. Since this move is still new, it will take some time to streamline the RTI process especially in Schools, the Police and hospitals,” he said.
An Information Bureau has been established at the Pelawatta branch of the Ministry and more information can be obtained on Telephone No.011-2513644.
There are 21 categories of information that cannot be revealed including private medical reports and national security matters. But, if some needs to obtain that kind of information, it is possible to go though Independent Information Commission. If that’s insufficient, legal redress can be sought through the Supreme Court or Appeal Court. The public can request information verbally or in writing through a letter or email. Information officers will only register the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons who request information. When providing information, the first two pages of the reply will be offered free of charge and any subsequent page will cost Rs.2 per page.
