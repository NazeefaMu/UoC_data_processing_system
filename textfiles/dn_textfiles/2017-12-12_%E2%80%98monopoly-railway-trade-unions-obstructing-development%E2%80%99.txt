‘Monopoly of railway trade unions obstructing development’

The main factor which placed obstacles for the endeavour of transforming the rail service into a quality service was the monopoly of power exercised by the railway trade unions. Whenever some development work is planned, some union will oppose it in an effort to hold on to its monopoly, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
Whenever recruitment is done, promotions are given, if engines and train compartments are being imported, unions oppose such endeavours to ensure their existence. This has become a common feature in the railway service, he said.
Minister de Silva said on the occasion of the centenary celebrations of the Colombo Fort Railway Station, he would request railway unions to shed their power struggle and assist the endeavour to improve the railway service.
The Minister made this observation participating in the centenary celebrations held at the Colombo Fort Railway Station, recently.
The opening of a new ticket counter, a passenger flyover bridge and the new Bastian Mawatha access road were among the main features of the celebrations. Minister de Silva said transformations seen in other sectors were not found in the railway service because it is a people's service. The railway service had a good history and a special identity. It also has a separate culture which is its pride, he added.
