Cry of Caesar

 According to the ancient Roman calendar, the Ides fell on the 15th day of four months namely March, May, July and October and on the 13th in the other months.
To those who are familiar with the immortal works of the Bard of Avon or to those who some far distant day had occasion to use Julius Caesar as a literature text for the then SSC or the University Entrance, it rings a bell; in this context an ominous bell for it was the sinister greeting of the Soothsayer to the great Caesar.
In ‘Julius Caesar’ Shakespeare has presented a man, a mere shadow of his former substantial self. A man not too popular with the populace enfeebled, subject to the ‘falling sickness’ who exhorts mark Anthony ‘come on my right hand for this ear is deaf. A man peeved at having had to refuse the crown yet retaining his hauteur.
In scene two of the first Act Caesar appears with his train in a public place, followed by a throng to the accompaniment of music when ‘a voice shriller than all the music’ breaks through the crowd;
‘Beware the Ides of March’
This is blood-tingling and there is in the lines a sense of undefined peril. On Caesar's inquiry as to who it was who called on him it is Brutus, Caesar's friend, who later turns conspirator under instigation from Cassius of the Lean and hungry look’ who in measured dispassionate tones transmits to Caesar the cry in the crowd.
“A soothsayer bids you beware the Ides of March’ Here we see in Brutus the man in perfection. The ominous weight of the words is doubled as it emanates from him and the effect is almost electrifying by its innocent irony. Then we see the confrontation of Caesar and the soothsayer.
Caesar: What sayest thou to me? Now speak once again.
Soothsayer: Beware the Ides of March
This incident strikes a note of mystery and the warning crates an impression of danger. But the great man indifferent to seeming trifles dismisses him with characteristic indifference.
He is a dreamer. Let us leave him” But this indifference was to cost him his life.
Act three opens with the ominous; this time echoed by Caesar himself. In this hubris, he disregards all signs, omens and premonitions and proceeds to the Capitol almost snapping his fingers at fate and throwing back in the very face of the soothsayer, his prophecy of doom.
“The Ides of March have come”
But with equanimity, the soothsayer gives the repartee
“Aye Caesar but not gone”
And Caesar pompously proceeds to the Capitol only to receive a bloodbath and with a mighty fall to exclaim his famous last words
“Et Tu Brute? Then fall Caesar.”
