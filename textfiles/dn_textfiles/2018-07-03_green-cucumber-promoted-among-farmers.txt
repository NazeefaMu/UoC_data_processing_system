Green cucumber promoted among farmers

The Agriculture Ministry has taken measures to promote green cucumber cultivation among local farmers as a private-public partnership project to meet the increasing demand for them in the international market.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the demand for green cucumber in the international market had increased by 2.7 percent annually. At present, the demand for green cucumber in the international market is 22,000 metric tons annually.
However, the contribution of Sri Lankan green cucumber to the international market is low.
The World Bank Assisted Agriculture Sector Modernization Project of the Agriculture Ministry signed an agreement with Hayley’s (Pvt) Ltd and farmers of the Batticaloa District to cultivate green cucumber for the export market.
This cucumber variety is rising in demand as large international fast food chains commonly use this product.
Around 500 farmers will obtain funds to develop infrastructure and the irrigation facility through the project. The Agriculture Department will provide technical assistance to implement good agriculture practices.
“Five hundred farmers will be divided into 50 groups and a farmers’ company will be formed for each group. In addition to cucumber cultivation, farmers will receive beehives to promote pollination. Selling honey will be an additional income from land used for cucumber cultivation,” he said.
Hayley’s (Pvt) Ltd has agreed to purchase the total production of the crop from farmers for a price agreed before every season. They have also agreed to provide storage facilities for farmers.
