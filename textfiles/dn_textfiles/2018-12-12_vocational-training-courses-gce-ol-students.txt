Vocational training courses for GCE (O/L) students

The Skills Development and Vocational Training Ministry will provide students who sat for the GCE (O/L) the opportunity to follow full-time and part-time vocational training courses, at no cost, the Ministry said.
This initiative has been taken in view of producing skilled youth for the labour market which is being rapidly transformed with modern technology, the Ministry said.
These vocational training courses will enable students to qualify for National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) certificates.
Notices have been distributed to the students who sat for the GCE O/L.
This programme offers 2,057 courses under 28 vocational trades.
Further information could be obtained at www.youthjobs.lk and on telephone no. 0112 081808.
