University of Houston Victoria conducts open day

The University of Houston Victoria recently concluded a Open Day at Regency Wing, Galle Face Hotel recently. The University is a state-owned public university that offers affordable courses with award winning faculty and facilities.
This Open Day event was held to create awareness of the educational opportunities, scholarships and funding available for students intending to apply to the university. This forum covered most of the key areas of concern that students would have when applying to a foreign university.
Many students also used this opportunity to alleviate their doubts and even obtain necessary information regarding the application process. Further, the university offered assistance and guidance to students to help them chart their career choices going forward.
