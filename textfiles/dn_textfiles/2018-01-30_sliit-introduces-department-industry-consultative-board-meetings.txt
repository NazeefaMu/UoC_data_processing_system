SLIIT introduces Department-Industry  Consultative Board meetings

SLIIT Faculty of Computing and Faculty of Engineering recently introduced a Department-Industry Consultative Board meeting.
The objective of the meeting is to maintain the high quality of the graduates produced by the institute.
SLIIT graduates have contributed significantly to the IT industry. The aim of the recent Department-Industry Consultative Board (DICB) meeting is to give the industry and the academia an opportunity to exchange views on how best to achieve a quality graduate who will be relevant to the industry demands.
SLIIT curriculum should be based on the industry requirements therefore Department-Industry Consultative Boards of all the departments of each faculty will continue to update the curriculum every year by organizing a forum with the industry representatives.
The meetings will mainly play an advisory role to each faculty on how the study programmes need to be improved. Data science, business analytics and logistics and supply chain management are specializations that were identified at DICB forums and introduced at SLIIT to broaden the academic areas.
Industry advisors for SLIIT’s Engineering Faculty are primarily MAS and the Ceylon Electricity Board while companies such as Virtusa, Accelerite, Pearson, Brandix, SLT, and Sampath Bank are the main industry advisors for the Computing Faculty.
For the Business Faculty, companies including Commercial Bank, Jetwing Travels, Jetwing Eco Holidays and DSI Samson Group are the industry advisors. The changes that are recognized within the forum are sent to the Curriculum Advisory Committee (CAC) at SLIIT for the final approval.
SLIIT CEO and Vice Chancellor Prof. Lalith Gamage explained “At SLIIT we place emphasis on consistently upgrading our curricular to keep up with ever-changing industry demands so that we can continue to produce high quality graduates equipped to meet emerging needs. This helps our students to climb up the corporate ladder with confidence and skills.”
