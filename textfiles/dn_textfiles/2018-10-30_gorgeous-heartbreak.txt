A Star is Born
Gorgeous Heartbreak

‘A Star Is Born’ may seem a story Hollywood keeps telling but there is something new in this one which makes it is such a great movie. Produced and directed by Bradley Cooper and written by Cooper, Eric Roth and Will Fetters, it stars Cooper, Lady Gaga, Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chappelle, and Sam Elliott. This 2018 American musical romantic drama relates the story of two lovers on dramatically differing paths: a famous man who’s furiously racing to the bottom and a woman who’s soaring to the top. The movie wrings tears from its romance while it also depicts perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice.
The movie takes place in a contemporary music world which is exciting, suffocating and crowded with fans and their demands and crushing performance of the celebrity. A country-rock musician Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) who, when the movie begins, is performing obviously wasted and is close to ruining. Adrift on an ocean of booze, one he routinely spikes with pills one night he stumbles into a Drag club for more booze. He then meets a singer with a voice that can thunder, Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) where she sings after her waitress shifts. There he watches Ally belt out the Edith Piaf standard “La Vie en Rose,” with her arched artificial brows. Soon after Jack and Ally meet, he peels off one of her fake brows suggesting that he sees the real her and wants the world to do so as well. Cooper understands that casting of Lady Gaga, whose disarming, naturalistic presence is crucial to the movie’s force. Thus the post-Madonna pop artist known for her elaborate stagecraft and costumes has been stripped down here with her mask removed. It brings you closer to her and makes Ally genuine and authentic.
When Ally and Jack look at each other, you are not only watching two people fall in love but also watching a director guiding and creating his star as life ooze into fiction. Soon Ally becomes Jack’s safe harbor, taking on the roles of lover, partner, muse, ideal.
That’s a heavy burden to Ally but she is one of life’s chin-up survivors, with a wayward mother and a loving, larger-than-life father, Lorenzo, who runs a limo business out of their Los Angeles home, where his male colleagues and their boisterous camaraderie fill her house, Ally is accustomed to navigating around men larger than she is, elbowing past them to be seen and heard.
As Jack brings Ally onstage and then on tour, she eventually goes solo, becoming a star whose ascent is shadowed by his decline. The concert scenes of Jack and Ally performing in the movie are energetic but personal. The music mixes standards with new songs some written by Cooper, Lukas Nelson and Lady Gaga whose electric singing can throttle and express passions and feelings far better than her dialogues.
Like in many other movies, Cooper fleshes out Jack’s past and explains why Jack drinks. Cooper spends more time on the story’s male lead and focuses on Jack how he scrapes bottom, goes into recovery, share Jack’s unease with Ally’s stardom, particularly after she connects with a manager and finally watches Ally putting on the mask that Cooper has removed from Lady Gaga, suggesting that unlike Jack’s her art is less than pure.
Jack doesn’t just help turn Ally into a star, giving her the big break, though damaged himself, he becomes her security allowing her to become a greater artist. `A Star Is Born’ is also about a woman whose ambitions are equal to those of any man and a woman who steadily rises as she weeps and sings toward fabulous self and sovereignty.
‘A Star is Born’ is looking to dominate this year’s Oscar race for best original song.
