Any attempt to hide Avant Garde fraud will be a serious crime - Tennakoon

Any attempt to hide the alleged Avant Garde fraud which masterminded all other alleged frauds under the carpet will be a serious crime tantamount to the betrayal of the country and nation, said Campaign for Free and Fair Elections and Human Rights Centre executive director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
He was addressing a press conference in Colombo on October 22.
Tennakoon said the Avant Garde fraud is considered the biggest fraud which occurred in the country during the last eight years.
The Avant Garde transaction contravened the Fire Arms Ordinance of the country, he said. "When there was ample evidence to probe this illegal arms deal concerning Avant Garde, one cannot be satisfied by merely investigating it under the Money Laundering Act only."
He said that even though licence had been issued to use only 87 firearms, more than 3,000 firearms had been exchanged taking cover under this licence.
How could such a big transaction relating to firearms not come under the Fire Arms Ordinance when even a common man is proscribed from using a trap gun under its provision, he asked.
