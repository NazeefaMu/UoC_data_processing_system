Just Nail it!

One of the hottest accessories that a girl can possess is eye-catching nail art. That’s why the world is so full of them and a new trend emerges every day. Pauline Feinauer’s name is synonymous with nail art. The Polish lady who resides in Germany is the World Champion in Nail Master Class (Nail pro Championships Munich 2009) and has won over 30 international Prizes in Nail Art Technology.
She is the owner of the Pauline Feinauer Beauty Academy and is the CEO of the famous German Championship: Nail Master Competition. She is an author, cover -author, show master on international fair trades, world renowned judge and competitor. She has travelled across the globe sharing her experiences and nurturing budding nail artistes. She has done nail art for quite a number of celebrities including Rihanna. She even has her own German Reality Show Star on her own TV Series "Beauty Profi".
The renowned nail art expert was recently in Sri Lanka. The Daily News engaged in a tête-à-tête with her to find out what is the ‘in’ thing in the industry.
“I have been a nail tech artiste since 2005. I was a journalist before I took to nail art full time. Everything was not pre planned. I have always been concerned about having beautiful nails. Once we moved out of the city and I could not locate a nice nail salon. Then my husband suggested that I do things by myself. So it started off as a hobby at the beginning before I realized that I am a natural at it,” Pauline said.
She took a two day class on nail art meant for housewives at the Golden Nails in Frankfurt. That was the beginning of a long journey which brought her to the top of the industry.
“I always loved art. We studied history and art at college. Nail art is done according to the tastes of a person. One cannot say that a particular creation is beautiful for everybody. Art is like yoga for me. I ponder over it and many things including people inspire me in creating my designs,” Pauline expressed.
She notes that whenever she comes across a design that captivates her, she tries to take a picture of it and tries to incorporate it into a nail design.
“Here in Sri Lanka you have thousands of inspirations. There are many flowers of different colours which we do not have in Europe,” she added.
She says that the most important chore for a nail artiste is to protect the natural nail. All the pigments used in nail art has a hazardous effect on the natural nails.
“If you use nail polish it is ok to put the art on the nails but never do nail art on the natural nails without a base. A lot of people have issues with natural nails. They break or chip easily. They destroy the beauty of their natural nails due to their profession. People seek our help at the nail studios because having nice nails has become a vital factor in the 20th century,” she said.
She says that there are no rigid rules in the profession of a nail artiste. A basic nail design lasts for about four to five weeks because nails tend to grow quickly.
“It is really old fashioned to say that certain colours go only with certain skin tones. Everything is possible in 2017. The only thing to consider is that you need to feel good with those colours. I believe in karma so my mantra is open your mind. Do not believe it when people say you cannot do it. Practice and make it happen,” she stressed.
Pauline says that square nails are totally out and oval shaped nails are in. Nude and natural colours or really crazy fantasy nail art are the trends of the season. All things in between are cliché. Once can never have enough flower samples because those are things that the clients usually go for.
Speaking about nail prints she notes that it not her thing.
“We work hard with our hands to create designs. I believe that it is a totally different sector. We are professionals. There are a lot of cheap places which put a few flowers on the nails and call it nail art. Beware of such places. You need knowledge to climb up the ladder in this profession. Take care of your nails because they will be with you till the end of your life,” she advised.
