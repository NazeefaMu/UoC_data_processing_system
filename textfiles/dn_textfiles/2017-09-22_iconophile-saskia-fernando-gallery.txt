Iconophile at Saskia Fernando Gallery

Iconophile, an exhibition of paintings by Sujeewa Kumari will be held at Saskia Fernando Gallery, 41, Horton Place, Colombo 07 until October 3.
Sujeewa Kumari deals with notions on social identity and women in a post-colonial context. In her works she addresses de-realized memories, cultural images and artistic styles which immerge as complex terms in tension between the local and global. She works with paintings, digital photography video, and performance art.
“Through the imagery within my male/female poetic drawings and paintings I explore an intimate inner landscape grappling with my own nostalgia, displacement and psychological transformation. These works act as both psychological and archival visual representations,” she said.
Sujeewa Kumari was educated at the Institute of Aesthetic Studies at the University of Kelaniya, and completed her MFA at the Dutch Art Institute in the Netherlands, where she explored her experimental spirit as a female contemporary artist.
Within her early body of works the artist expresses her point of view as a woman in Sri Lanka, focusing on her female identity in the contemporary art scene and society based on her experiences, and her research on the concept of post-colonial identity discourse.
“Objects I have collected that represent ‘home’ have become part of my personal archive.
These materials, be it family footage, collected photo albums, magazines, nostalgic objects, friends and anything that is very personal to me, they are pieced together in these works.
Through these symbolic references often in combination with the female form, I explore the wider notion of freedom,” Sujeewa Kumari added.
