The Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said the Medical Officer of Health of the relevant area will be informed about the incident of people falling sick after eating croton leaves.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau yesterday he said the MOH will investigate and report on the incident. No information is currently available regarding this incident which could be possible food poisoning. He said only one variety of croton leaves known as `koppa kola’ is consumable.
