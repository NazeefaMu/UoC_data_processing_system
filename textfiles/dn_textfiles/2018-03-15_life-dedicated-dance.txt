A life dedicated to dance

A good dancer may impress an audience with technique and execution, but a great dancer would change your life, make you feel, bring you to tears and create a memory that would never fade, much like Vajira Chitrasena, who celebrates her 87th birthday today.
The audience knew her when she was just 15 years old; a young girl whose beauty matched her artistry. Backed by her guru and lover, this duo broke tradition and revolutionised Sri Lanka’s dance, which was stagnating under colonialism and lacking creativity and innovation.
“The drummers and dancers were of the lower caste and society did not give them the respect they deserved. But Chithrasena came from the English speaking upper class and gave dance the respect it deserved,” said Vajira, reminiscing about her late husband. Back in the day, female dancers did not possess much recognition, as they had to imitate male movements and wear costumes similar to those of men.
This duo shattered cultural stigmas and innovated and experimented new dance movements without harming traditions and culture. Chitrasena revolutionised the barren stage and introduced costumes, lighting and much more. This led to a new dance genre known as Sinhala Ballet, which involved movements to relate a story. Together, the couple produced more than 100 productions which include masterpieces such as Nala Damayanthi, Kinkini Kolama, Kindurangana and Chandali. With these productions taking centre-stage, female dancers grew day by day, while Vajira was a beacon of hope to young girls.
Apart from her career as a dancing professional, Vajira Chitrasena stands tall as a loving mother, caring grandmother and a gentle teacher, observing the moves of the students of the Chitrasena Dance Academy. While other families do their best to protect their heirloom, Vajira does the opposite by bestowing her knowledge on the younger generation. Her daughter Upeka continues this dancing tradition along with her granddaughter Thaji.
“Most people say that Thaji looks like her grandmother,” Upeka said.
Despite the success story of Vajira, the slow progress of the Chitrasena Kalayathanaya has raised much concerns. The land which was donated by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga, was originally planned to accommodate six dance studios, a central auditorium, recording studio, accommodation facilities and a museum.
Yet, only the auditorium and the open-air hall had been constructed.
However, Vajira Chitrasena sits back proudly and enjoys her 87th birthday and a life dedicated to dance and passing on her legacy to the younger generation.
