SLFPYPA demands MR’s expulsion

Sri Lanka Freedom Party Young Professional’s Association (SLFPYPA) representatives said that their association will urge the SLFP Central Committee to expel Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa from the post of party patron.
Addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday, SLFPYPA member Rajika Kodithuwakku said the Parliamentarian Rajapaksa cannot be considered as a SLFP member anymore since he stands for the victory of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) of G.L. Peiris.
“It is clear that Rajapaksa is working for the SLPP.
 It seems that he is acting as the Brand Ambassador of the SLPP. Therefore, he is no more a SLFP member and how he can be an advisor of the party?” Kodithuwakku queried.
“Accordingly, the SLFPYPA will suggest to the Central Committee of SLFP to expel Rajapaksa from the SLFP adviser post with immediate effect,” he said.
Kodithuwakku claimed that Rajapaksa tries to split the SLFP by betraying it while promoting the SLPP of G.L.Peiris.
“As professionals, we request the Central Committee to sack those who betray the party and stand for the victory of any other political streams,” Kodithuwakku added. He further alleged that not only Rajapaksa, but his siblings Gotabhaya and Basil also had betrayed the SLFP.
“Both Gota and Basil are responsible for several financial irregularities amounting to billions,” he said.
“It has been estimated that there is financial misconduct of US $ 7.5 million relating to the MiG fighter jet deal for which Gota’s name is linked during the Rajapaksa regime. There is no responsible person for the huge loss of US $ 7.5 million eventhough the country lost such a huge amount of public wealth,” Kodithuwakku said.
Speaking on Basil Rajapaksa’s political conduct, Kodithuwakku said that Basil is engaging in a political game to coverup his black money. He does not need to make the SLPP win. Speaking on the Presidential Commission report on the Treasury Bond issue, Kodithuwakku said no Commission report was out during the Rajapaksa regime eventhough he appointed many commissions.
“Unlike President Sirisena, the Rajapaksas’ wanted to hide the truth by appointing a commission,” he said. “By speaking on the Treasury Bond Commission report, the Joint Opposition wants to protect their members, who have faced charges of financial irregularities.
