Microsoft, employees donate over $650 mn  cloud services, software in 2016

 Microsoft Corporation and its employees have donated more than $650 million in cash, cloud services and software to non-profits around the world. In a letter published recently, Mary Snapp, corporate vice president at Microsoft Philanthropies, detailed the organisation’s 2016 contributions.
Highlights include $465 million in cloud services donated to more than 71,000 organisations to benefit the public good. In addition, Microsoft employees raised $142 million for 19,000 nonprofits, helping reach an important milestone. The company’s giving programme has now raised $1.5 billion since 1983.
Snapp also reports significant progress is areas such as aiding organisations that respond to human and man made disasters and providing computer science education to those who otherwise would not have access.
“Technology has the power to uplift, to connect, and perhaps most important, to save lives,” Snapp said. “Together with our grantees, partners and employees around the world, Microsoft Philanthropies is using the power of technology to help those impacted by some of the world’s biggest challenges, including economic disruption, inequality, disasters, war, and famine.”
In January 2016, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced the company would donate $1 billion in cloud services to nonprofit organisations and researchers working on the world’s most urgent needs, from health care to education to the environment.
