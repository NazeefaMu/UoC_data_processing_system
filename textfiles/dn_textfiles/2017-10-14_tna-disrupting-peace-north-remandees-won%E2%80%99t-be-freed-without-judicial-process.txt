TNA DISRUPTING PEACE IN NORTH : REMANDEES WON’T BE FREED WITHOUT JUDICIAL PROCESS

Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene yesterday, reiterated that the remanded LTTE suspects, who had allegedly committed serious crimes,will not be freed without a judicial process despite the hartal campaigns in the North.
The State Minister observed that the hartal campaign in the North is politically motivated and a group seeking political mileage is behind it.
Wijewardene made these observations speaking to the media after an event at a school in Biyagama.The State Minister pointed out that several TNA members are trying to disrupt the day-to-day life of the people in the North by organizing a hartal campaign.
The Minister, pointing out that there are no ‘political prisoners’ as claimed by the TNA, said that the investigations have revealed that those prisoners were involved in serious crimes during the time of war. He noted that those prisoners could not be released without a judicial inquiry.
“If there are delays in the judicial process, those must be rectified. However the prisoners must go through the judicial process and either be convicted or released at the end of it,” he said.
