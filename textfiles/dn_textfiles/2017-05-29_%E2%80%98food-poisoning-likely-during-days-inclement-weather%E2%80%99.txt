‘Food poisoning likely during days of inclement weather’

People should be extra careful when they consume foods and drink water these days, the Health Ministry Epidemiology Unit Acting Director, Consultant Virologist Dr. Samitha Ginige said.
The public should drink boiled and cooled water and consume home-made meals. Food items should be stored in clean containers, he said.
Fruits and vegetables should be thoroughly washed with clean water before consuming.
Eating green leaves, salads and other vegetables should be discouraged as much as possible, he said.
Chlorine, cleaning chemicals, and doxycycline tablets to prevent rat fever are now available with the PHIs, MOHs and OPDs of state hospitals in the affected areas, free of charge, he said.
Wells should be properly cleaned before re-using. People are advised to take two doxycycline tablets and it will provide immunity against rat fever for two weeks.
Those who have to work in flood water and mud should take the tablets, he said.
