Villagers in fear as ‘Grease Yaka’ haunts

 Villagers of Wiyalagodawatta, Eheliyagoda have to live in fear as an unidentified person is in the habit of knocking at the doors and windows of houses at night. Women are the most panic-stricken as this ‘ghost’ called ‘Grease Yaka’ knocks at the doors of the houses when men are away.
Villagers have complained to Eheliyagoda Police. Villagers were advised to be vigilant. “If the ‘ghost’ is caught, hand over to the Police without beating or harming him,” villagers were told. A special Police team has been deployed for patrolling at night in the village.
