Sri Lanka awash with new developments - Minister Sagala

Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake yesterday said the United National Party in the National Government has made vast strides in bringing permanent peace and stability to the country.
He said they succeeded in reducing serious crimes in the country by one third, and they are committed in driving the crime wave down further.
“We have regained our GSP+ status by strengthening the rule of law and giving people back their rights, providing a lifeline to the apparel and fisheries industries and will bring tens of thousands of jobs.
The Minister added that the peace and security that they have brought has seen the tourism numbers reach record highs.
The full statement:
Sri Lanka is awash with new developments, the construction of roads, schools, hospitals and local council buildings. These are all concrete signs of a government building a stronger economy and a country moving definitively forward. We are modernising our most strategic industries, and investing into nascent industries that will support our transition to a knowledge based economy. All this is happening against a backdrop of newfound peace and stability. This government is clear that economic growth can only continue as along as peace and stability are maintained. This is why the 2018 budget has identified a number of areas for investment that will both enhance and modernise our law and order services.After two and half years of the UNP in national government, Sri Lanka is safer than it has been in three decades. This stability has opened up all manner of opportunities, social and economic – the two go hand in hand, it’s a simple equation: a stronger economy means more wealth, more wealth means more public spending.
Security is also incredibly important to us at personal level – without it we have no certainty over the physical and emotional well-being of ourselves or our families. This kind of uncertainty and trauma can have long lasting effects on us as individuals. Our jobs and livelihoods also depend on stability and security. Some of our most important industries, such as tourism are incredibly sensitive to stability and security, foreign investment, which bring hundreds of thousands of jobs is also highly dependent on stability. There can be no doubt about it, peace and security are absolute prerequisites for economic growth, jobs and well-being. So, as a government and as a society, we must continue to prioritise this. Three years ago we were on a trajectory that would bring almost certain economic collapse, social divides and tensions were rising again, and families feared for their children’s safety. You would be hard pressed to find a Sri Lankan that does not agree that our history in recent decades has been a traumatic one. Our institutions and arms of government were often used against the people they were meant to protect. People were robbed of their rights, their freedoms were taken away and people suffered, as the rule of law slowly disintegrated.
In two years, the UNP in national government, has achieved a lot to bring peace and stability. We have already reduced serious crime by a third and we want to drive this down further. We have regained our GSP+ status by strengthening the rule of law and giving people back their rights, providing a lifeline to the apparel and fisheries industries and will bring tens of thousands of jobs. The peace and security that we have brought has seen our tourism numbers reach record highs – last year we had over 2 million tourists for the first time in our history.
This is much needed money into our economy and tens of thousands of jobs.Our law enforcement services have been instrumental in achieving the stability we have today and the 2018 budget will allow us to further strengthen these capabilities. Steps are being taken to professionalise and modernise these services, to bring them in line with international standards. Rs. 125 million has been allocated to build a police and criminal justice university. We will be investing as much as Rs. 440 million into leveraging technology to develop our cyber-crime capabilities and increase the efficiency of services. We will also be introducing a special high court with an audio and visual recording system. There is serious momentum behind improving these services so that we have a better, safer society.
It is clear that we are moving forward and we have achieved a lot across many areas that impact ordinary people. We have created over 400,000 jobs, and this will only increase as we tackle unemployment head on. We have helped over 200,000 families secure a home and we are on track to meet our target of ensuring all Sri Lankans have shelter by 2015.
We are supporting pregnant women by providing them with Rs. 20,000. We know the cost of living in a challenge for people, so we are putting more money in people’s hands to help make ends meet through public sector salary increases and bringing down the cost of essential items – we have reduced fuel by 22%. This has all been possible because of the measures we have taken to build stronger economy and bring stability to our country.The steps we are taking are the right ones and the progress we have made has been widely recognised by the international community.
We are developing and enhancing law enforcement services to support the empowerment of people by ensuring their safety. Security is essential to everything we are working to achieve, it underpins our economic growth and social development. We must not let those who sought to bring economic and social chaos to our country influence our decisions and threaten our newfound peace and prosperity.
Only this government has the knowledge and ability to fix our economy. And only this government is trusted by the international community to deliver a fair and just economy where foreign companies will invest.
Only by sticking to our plan to strengthen our economy can we keep Sri Lanka on the path to a better future and ensure our country’s long term stability and security.
