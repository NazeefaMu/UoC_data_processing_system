New model to safeguard and promote tea - Navin

A new model is being formulated by the government to safeguard and promote the industry, said Navin Dissanayake, Minister of Plantation Industries speaking at the Tea convention at BMICH yesterday.
The minister said that even James Taylor dubbed as the father of Ceylon Tea, would never have dreamt that it would one day be the fourth largest foreign exchange earner to Sri Lanka and be such a strong industry.
The minister also recalled with gratitude the services rendered by the plantation workers in the yesteryear who were brought down from India and other countries and paid a tribute to them.
The minister said that workers’ welfare is one of the key priorities of the government and they are in the process of building single housing units for them.
