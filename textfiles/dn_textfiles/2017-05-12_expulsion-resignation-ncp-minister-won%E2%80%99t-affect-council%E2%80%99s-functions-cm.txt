Expulsion, resignation of NCP minister won’t affect Council’s functions: CM

 North Central Province(NCP) Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathna Bandara emphasised that the expelling of ministers and the resignation of ministers in the council would not affect the functions,political stability and the Provincial Council’s administration at all.
The North Central Governor has on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena removed Provincial Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister K.H.Nandsena from his ministerial portfolio. M. Herath Banda has already been appointed to the vacant post.
“This incident is not at all a matter of political or personal revenge. I have nothing to do with these changes. However I feel that the main cause for this would be the opposition expressed by former minister Nandasena to the Lower Malwathuoya Reservoir Project Resolution AT the Provincial Council session agenda on May 9,” he said.
“Provincial Cooperatives Minister S.M.Ranjith told the media that he would resign from his portfolio in objection to the expulsion of the Minister Nandasena. He was entitled to do so as he wished. I have no comment about it, But, he has not so far submitted any letter of resignation to the authorities. I take every possible action to go ahead with our development plans and proposals without allowing them to get jeopardised due to such changes, the North Central Province Chief Minister Bandara concluded. Former minister Nandasena said that he was not given any prior notice of his removal. He said that the decision to expel him was an injustice done to him and a blow to the party supporters and public. Nandasena stated that he would never forget the immense service rendered to the party and country by the former President and his (Nandasena) personal political agenda was based on his past politics.
Provincial Cooperatives Minister S.M.Ranjith said it was no surprise that such injustices and short sighted policies were taking place. He said further that due to such step motherly treatment meted out to personalities of the calibre of Nandasena, the fragmentation of the SLFP would be accelerated.
Former Cabinet Minister S.M.Chandrasena emphasised that his brother who recorded a landslide victory at the last Provincial Council elections was offered the Chief Ministry portfolio after he (Chandrasena) resigned from the Cabinet to allow his brother to serve the people.
