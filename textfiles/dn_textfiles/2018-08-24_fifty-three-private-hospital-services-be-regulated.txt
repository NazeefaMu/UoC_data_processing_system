Fifty three private hospital services to be regulated

Prices of 53 services offered by private hospitals will be regulated from next week, the Health Ministry said.
The Ministry spokesman said high prices of various surgeries, laboratory investigations and various charges related to delivery (child birth) will be included in prices to be regulated. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had instructed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe to draft the final report on regulating high prices charged by private hospitals and other private medical institutions.
New price regulations will be gazetted after drafting it. The Government has already removed VAT from private hospital charges. Doctors’ charges will also be included in the ‘package of charges’.
“The Health Ministry will regulate prices of 53 services offered by private hospitals under the regulating system. At the moment various private hospitals charge different prices for the same surgery or laboratory test,” he said.
