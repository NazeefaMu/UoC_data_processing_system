Easter Fun at Hilton Colombo!

The multinational team of chefs are cooking up a stormy brunch at the GRAZE Kitchen Restaurant on Sunday 16, April! It’s the Easter Egg Hunt that would interest all the little children who plan to enjoy the Easter Brunch! Lots of little coloured eggs will dot the Curry Leaf garden where all our little “Easter bunnies” can have a ball scrambling around looking for their precious share of eggs! That’s not all, they can have their faces painted too!
Highlighting a few dishes that will be on the Easter brunch menu; Italian cold cuts like Coppa, Salami Milano, Parma Ham and Brozolla Chicken Liver Pate, a selection of cheese from Blue to Brie, Camembert and more together with assorted nuts, dried fruit and olives, action from the sea; baked whole Salmon, Pernod & Dill Gravalax Salmon, fresh juices, life size tuna sashimi and more from Japanese traditions including hot delicacies. The highlight from the western world will be the slow roasted Tasmanian lamb and spit roasted Australian beef with accompaniments. More from the lava grill - fresh sea bass and champagne cream, oxtail stew and the jerk pork belly!
From Asia with love comes the ever popular Laksa and the clay pot curries; juicy lagoon crab curry with drumstick leaves, dhunthell rice and of course heaps more. Something else that will fascinate you will be the seafood paella presented in a huge pan; a must try says the chef. Everyone’s favourite from the tandoor oven and the typical Indian curries to the decadent desserts you cannot say “no” to! The chocolate fountain, homemade ice cream station with delicious toppings, the Easter chocolate praline cake and keeping with tradition, the Simnel cake (fruit cake) and much much more.
