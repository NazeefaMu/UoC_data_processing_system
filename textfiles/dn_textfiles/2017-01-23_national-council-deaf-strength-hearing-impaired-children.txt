National Council for Deaf, a strength to hearing impaired children

The invaluable service by the National Council for the Deaf (NCD) to treat hearing impaired children and conducting a pre-school to improve their educational activities were highlighted by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Managing Director Sutheash Balasubramaniam.
He made these observations at the Annual General Meeting of the NCD in Colombo. NCD senior director Maud Senaratne and director Shirani Dissanayaka were also present. Balasubramaniam said no one can isolate this needy sector as they are also a part of the society.
He highly praised the welfare activities by NCD towards the deaf community in the country, especially schoolchildren.
Balasubramaniam said: “The country’s technology has developed to maximum and we could use this development to provide more valuable service for these hearing impaired children too.” It is happy to note that eminent personalities in the field of medicine including Prof. Priyani Soysa, Dr. Ananda Soysa and Dr. T.R. C. Ruberu are also the distinguished members in the NCD council.
He also said even researchers are concerned about the deaf community and innovative methods are being developed to address the challenges of providing tertiary education to those with deafness to excel both in practice and research in their chosen fields. He also thanked NCD for conducting individual speech training for deaf children. to enable them to integrate with other children. Senaratne said the Council is managing a school from Grade 1 to GCE (OL) for the benefit of deaf children of low income groups and thereafter these students will be directed to job orientation programmes enabling them to become employable.
