Sports Minister bans alcohol at Sugathadasa Sports Hotel

Minister of Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports, Faiszer Musthapa has banned alcohol selling at the newly renovated Sugathadasa Sports Hotel that will be opened shortly.
In a statement the Minister said: “I took a decision to stop the sale of alcohol at the Sugathadasa Sports Hotel, simply because so many of our young ‘uns patronise this stadium. I believe that it does not relate well with our nation’s culture and values and clearly is not aligned with my personal belief. With immediate effect I have banned the sale of alcohol at the Sugathadasa Sports Hotel.
“The facility has been under refurbishment over the last couple of years and one of the main improvements was an established fully-fledged bar. This clearly does not resonate with the country’s ethos of empowering andenergizing our youth, especially through sports. The Sugathadasa arena is currently patronized by our young future athletes, swimmers, gymnasts and other sports. The credo for the Sugathadasa Sports Hotel was to provide dwelling for our youth from all across the island. Therefore, alcohol will be banned from this facility when it opens, in the near future,” the Minister stated.
