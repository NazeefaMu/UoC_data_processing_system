NBF calls for prompt action against those who stand for terrorism

The law of the land should be promptly exercised against the persons who instigate terrorism, the National Bhikkhu Front (NBF) said.
The NBF urged the government to take prompt action against the persons who make statements on behalf of terrorists and stand for terrorism.
NBF Secretary Ven. Wakamulle Uditha Thera said that such statements which harm co-existence and the national integrity of the country can never be accepted. Moreover statements of this nature are against the Constitution of the country.
Addressing a media briefing organised by the NBF yesterday, Ven. UdithaThera said that Parliamentarians should act in accordance with the Constitution and it is illegal to make statements which clash with Constitutional provisions.
The Thera added that not only statements, but also acts which encourage terrorism and separatism are strictly condemned by the NBF. “There are persons who want to bring the country to the dark era again and therefore they fuel separatism. But no one has the right to stand for terrorism which brought havoc to the country for over three decades,” he said.
Speaking on the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, the Thera said that the 20th Amendment is much needed to curtail the powers of the executive presidency.
“It should be brought forward and it is a timely need,” the Thera said.
