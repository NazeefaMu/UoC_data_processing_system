Multi Finance to launch talent search and  leadership development training programme

Multi Finance, one of the country’s earliest established financial institutions is ushering in a new era of digitized financial services, following its acquisition by real estate development giant Fairway Holdings.
A rapidly diversifying conglomerate, the Fairway Group has expanded to operate across a plethora of industries following a unique business model for wealth creation for all stakeholders. With financial stability and massive growth potential, MFP will reinforce its identity as one of Sri Lanka’s premier financial institutions through heavy investment in talent acquisition and development for the company’s immediate expansion.
“In keeping with the pace of digitization across the globe, we at Multi Finance are restructuring our business offerings to align with a new, digitized business model,” commented Meditha Karunatillaka, Head of Human Resources at MFP. “In today’s dynamic financial environment, customers demand highly personalized services with transparent benefits and risks. To offer such customized money management solutions, MFP is investing in developing a new breed of financial managers through a specialized Leadership Training Programme.”
“The inaugural batch of trainees will be chosen following strict selection criteria. We are not looking for a financial background. We are looking for the best performers to join us, grow with us and become part of the new MFP culture, to advance MFP and also drive Sri Lanka’s financial industry forward. This is a Professional Development Programme that develops and equips future financial leaders to innovate and implement new value channels, better servicing customers in the management and maturing of their finances,” Meditha continued.
All trainees will be offered multiple benefits, including loans at special interest rates insurance, personal loans for studies, incentives. At the completion of the 24-month programme, a certification of completion accredited by a recognized institute or university will be awarded to all trainees.
“As a long-established, responsible financial institution, our ambition now is to develop new age financial gurus to provide the best financial management services Sri Lanka has to offer,” elaborated Meditha.
“This programme serves as the perfect foundation for skilled and motivated graduates and school leavers who are ambitious to build a highly progressive career upon. This opportunity is not for dreamers, but for achievers.”
