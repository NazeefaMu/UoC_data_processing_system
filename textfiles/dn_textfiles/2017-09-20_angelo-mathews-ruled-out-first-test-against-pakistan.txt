Angelo Mathews ruled out of first Test against Pakistan

 
Sri Lanka allrounder Angelo Mathews has been ruled out of the first Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi later this month with a calf strain. He had sustained the injury during training on Tuesday, before undergoing scans on Wednesday.
SLC cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha confirmed Mathews' unavailability.
This is the latest in a long history of leg injuries for Mathews - the last 12 months having been particularly problematic. He had suffered a torn hamstring during Sri Lanka's tour of South Africa in January, and did international cricket again until July. He had also missed a tri-series in Zimbabwe late last year due to "multiple injuries" in his legs.
Given the recurrence of these injuries, Mathews' workload has been closely managed over the last few months. In fact, he was only required to deliver a few overs per game in the ODIs against India, and did not bowl at all in the Tests. Nevertheless, he finds himself unable to play again, just as Sri Lanka attempt to put the torrid series against India behind them. Mathews had been excellent during Sri Lanka's last Test series the UAE, in 2013/14, hitting 412 runs at an average of 103.
Sri Lanka's two-Test series against Pakistan begins on September 28 in Abu Dhabi. The second match will be a day/night Test, in Dubai.
