Akash leads Open category

Junior Match Play Golf for Rukmini Kodagoda Trophy:
Top seed T. Akash had an easy win over M. Prasath (VGCR) 7/5 and last year’s winner Vinod Weerasinghe got the better of Januka Dilshan 1 up in the Open/Gold division (under 19) as the match play segment of the Rukmini Kodagoda Trophy junior golf continued at the RCGC yesterday. Armand Flamer Caldera was given a fight being taken to the 20th hole by R. Sugumar of Kandy and Vihan de Alwis beat Dilip Kumar easily 4/3 in the elite category.
In the girls open, Binaara Dias beat M. Premika 3/2 and Kiyara Dunuwilla beat Hiruni Devindi 6/5, to get a semi-final berth. The quarter finalists battled it out over 18 holes and no major upsets were recorded.
The tournament is played in four age group categories : 15-18 years (Overall/Gold Division), 12-14 years (Silver Division), 10 -11years (Bronze Division), 9 years and under (Copper Division). The winner of the overall championship girls and boys would carry away the Rukmini Kodagoda trophy donated by the family in memory of one of Sri Lanka’s talented sports women, a national champion in both tennis and golf. In the silver division age group under 15yrs, top seed Dilshan Malinda beat Amrik Perera 8/7 and S. D. M. Hirushan beat T. Vikash 3/1. In the other matches Haroon Aslam (VGCR) beat Himal Randima 5/4 and S. Dhuwarshan (NEGC) beat Isuru Praneeth 6/5.
The keenness and talent shown in the Bronze division age group 12yrs and below was encouraging to note with players like Yannik Kumara playing good golf to have a smashing win over Pranav Muralidaran 6/4. Another talented player Nirekh Tejwani showed grit by beating M. S Sanjay (NEGC) 7/6. K Danushan had a convincing win over L. Lidhurshan of Nuwara Eliya 6/5. Much was expected of Sherin Mithara but young Shanal Binuksha beat her 4/2.
The semi-final games will be played today and the prize distribution will be held on Friday hosted by the sponsor Perera and Sons Bakers Ltd.
