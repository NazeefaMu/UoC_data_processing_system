Lucky escape for CR beat fighting Army 25-24

The disallowing of two controversial tries by referee Dinka Peiris by Army Sports Club in the second half brought CR & FC a close 25 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalty) to 24 (3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) win in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby match played at
Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue yesterday. The winners led 7-3 at half time.
Army dished out a superb second half rally where they came from behind 3-7 down to lead 17-15 but a try 10 minutes before the close and the last minute penalty by CR along with the two disallowed tries by the referee cost them the match in the end.
The match got off to a good start with both teams engaged in a battle for supremacy where CR & FC drew first blood in the 17th minute when their national fly half Tarinda Ratwatte touched down for a try off a beautiful three quarter move covering 40 metres and full back Reeza Mubarak made the conversion, CR led 7 nil.
In the 32nd minute, Army full back Shanaka Kumara put over a penalty to make it 7-3 which was the score at half time.
Soon after the break in the 43rd minute Army centre Imanka Ariyapala who played an outstanding game and stood out from the rest went over for a try off a superb three quarter move. Kumara slotted in the conversion for Army to grab the lead for the first time 10-7.
Within three minutes Red shirts moved the ball wide from right to left where ball changed several hands and finally centre Amila Bandara made a fabulous off load to his co-centre Rehan Silva who dived over for a try near the left corner flag, where Mubarak missed the conversion to go into the lead 12-10.
Army regained the lead in the 52nd minute when their fly half Ashan Bandara ripped off the ball from CR fly half Ratwatte and darted down for a sensational try covering nearly 65 metres. Kumara once again slotted in the conversion for Army to lead 17-12. In the 62nd minute CR cut down the lead with another Mubarak penalty and the score read 17-15 in favour of Army.
Red shirts went in to the lead in the 68th minute when second row forward Dilanka Perera crashed through for a cracking try off a rolling maul.
Mubarak missed the conversion and CR led 22-17.
CR sealed the match in the 77th minute when their reliable place kicker Mubarak put over a fantastic 35 metre penalty to make the score 25-17 in Red shirts favour.
In the final minute Army scored a brilliant consolation try through their captain cum number eight Manoj Silva off a fine three quarter move, where he foxed the CR defence and dived over mid right; replacement full back Gayan Salinda made the conversion and the final score read CR & FC 25 to Army SC 24.
