MR suppressed both electronic and print media: SB

The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime suppressed both electronic and print media through legal and illegal means. While some sections of the media toed the line, others tried to oppose, but they were silenced, Social Welfare and Empowerment Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Mahinda Rajapaksa held two-third majority in parliament and almost 99 percent control in provincial councils as well as extreme presidential powers. Therefore, he thought he could easily win the 2015 presidential election but he had get defeated ignominiously he said.
The minister was addressing the SLFP Central Province Graduates’ Association AGM at the auditorium of the Central Province Chief Minister’s official residence recently.
Dissanayke said Mahinda Rajapaksa went for early elections two years before the end of his term for several reasons. One was a prediction made by his astrologer that it was opportune to call early elections. Other reasons were the inability to face the conditions laid against Sri Lanka by the UNHRC in March 2015 and the compelling need to impose taxes and curtail public relief from 2017 to offset repayment of heavy loans taken by his government.
He held early elections fearing that people would rise up against measures imposed to curtail subsidies and other public relief.
During that period we in Sri Lanka were being systematically throttled through sanctions. Removal of GSP plus facility, European Union ban on fish exports and war crimes allegations made against 46 persons including four top level politicians were some of them.
Today President Maithripala Sirisena was ably tackling and overcoming all those problems after forming a consensus government of the two main parties, the minister said.
The election pledges made by the President could not be fulfilled unless he formed a consensus government, he said.
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Provincial Minister Ediriweera Weerawardena were also present.
