Sports Camp of Elpitiya Education Zone, a great success

School children from 25 schools in Elpitiya Education Zone were given a three-day residential sports and leadership training at the Gamini College, Bentota recently. The Zonal Education officials with the support of coaches, sports teachers in the region conducted the programme with the support of Elasto Group.
The training was focused on instilling nuances of leadership qualities among the participants in their respective sports disciplines. The children were stylized not in a sense of glitter but in quality of technique and sharing knowledge. The main goal of the camp was training the athletes for their respective events.
What added value to the event was the donation of resistance/therapeutic bands worth of Rs 75,000 for physical training activities in participated 25 schools by the Managing Director/Chairman of Elasto Group, Mangala Gunasekera.
