Indian Export-Import Bank officials evaluate India-funded projects

A team from Export-Import Bank of India visited Sri Lanka to monitor the progress of projects being executed in Sri Lanka under the Indian government Lines of Credit (LoC), particularly in the railway sector.
The team visited project sites of the Northern Railway Rehabilitation Project, including Kankesanthurai Railway Line, Omanthai-Pallai railway line, Talaimannar-Madhu Road Railway Line, Medawachchiya-Madhu Road Railway Line, etc apart from evaluating the signaling and telecommunication system installed under the LoC.
India has provided concessionary credit facilities amounting to about US$ 800 million to Sri Lanka to undertake the Northern Railway Rehabilitation Project. IRCON International implemented the project, including track upgrade, and the setting up of signaling and communication infrastructure.
The team also called on Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and senior officials of the Sri Lanka Railways, Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, External Resources Department, National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry.
“India remains committed to strengthening its bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka, including through closer economic ties, enhancing connectivity and other linkages, and continued development partnership,” stated the Indian High Commission in a release.
