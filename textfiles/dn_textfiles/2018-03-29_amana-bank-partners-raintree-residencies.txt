Amana Bank partners with RainTree Residencies

Amãna Bank has partnered with RainTree Residencies, Sri Lanka’s latest affordable luxury project being developed in the heart of Colombo 3, to offer customers an apartment financing solution with an innovative repayment plan.

Commenting on the partnerships, Amãna Bank’s Vice President – Retail Banking and Marketing Siddeeque Akbar said “We are happy to tie up with RainTree Residencies. With this partnership we have facilitated customers an affordable and innovative installment scheme, so that they can easily pursue their dream of purchasing a home of their own at the heart of Colombo”

It consists of 87 residential units and premium facilities such as a rooftop infinity pool, an atrium deck, a zen-inspired rooftop garden, a fully-equipped gym, smart key card access systems and state of- the-art automated parking.
RainTree Residencies is the flagship project by HNJ Towers and is designed by Sri Lanka’s foremost architect of luxury high rises Milroy Perera Associates and will be constructed by N&A Engineering, a leading C-1 contractor specializing in high rise residential developments.
