'Battle of Lyceumers' on July 1 at Moratuwa

The 2nd 'Battle of Lyceumers' limited over cricket encounter 2017 between Lyceum International School, Nugegoda and Lyceum International School, Panadura for Nikitha Grero Challenge Trophy will be held on July 1 at De Soysa Stadium, Moratuwa. This big match was initiated by Nikitha Grero last year and Panadura Lyceum will be the host this year.
The Nugegoda team will be lead by Dewmin De Alwis under the guidance of head coach Lal Senarathna and MIC Pathum Madhushanka while the Panadura team will be skippered by Nesanda Weerasekara under the supervision of head Coach Kapila Mahinda and MIC Rumesh Wickramasinghe.
Lyceum Panadura became the champions of the inaugural encounter, last year by chasing the winning score of 92 runs in just 11.5 overs with 5 wickets intact after they restricted Nugegoda lads for a paltry 91 runs in 29 overs.
Both teams got opportunity to play in the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Tournament almost one year back and have fared well since. Lyceum Nugegoda U-15 cricketers became Division 3 champions. Lyceum Panadura reached U-13 Division 3 quarter finals while their U-17 team reached Pre-Quarters of the same Division. In addition both teams have performed remarkably well in all age groups of the Inter International Schools Cricket Tournament.
