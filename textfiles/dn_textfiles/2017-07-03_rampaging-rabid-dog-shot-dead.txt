Eight persons including two constables attached to the Ambalantota police station are receiving treatment at the Hambantota Hospital after being bitten by a rabid dog in Ridiyagama road opposite the police station recently. The two constables were bitten when they tried to intervene as the animal was pouncing on pedestrians passing the spot. A resident of the area shot the dog dead with his licensed gun.
