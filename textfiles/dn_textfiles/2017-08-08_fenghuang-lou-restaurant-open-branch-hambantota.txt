Fenghuang Lou restaurant to open branch in Hambantota

Fenghuang Lou, Jawatta Road, Colombo 05, one of Colombo’s Chinese restaurants will open its first outstation branch in Hambantota by the end of the year.
“We have earmarked two properties in Hambantotoa for this project and will invest around Rs. 100 million for the entire project,” said Fenghuang Lou founder and Managing Director M.R. Hassan.
“We are very proud to be operating Fenghuang Lou which has attracted a large number of Chinese expats and tourists, besides our own Sri Lankan clientele, all of whom have contributed largely towards our popularity in a very short span of time here in Colombo.”
"Our success has prompted us to branch out and we have selected Hambantota to locate our second branch as we see a demand for authentic Chines cuisine by the large number of Chinese in the area as well as Sri Lankans.”
He said that their vision is to be an outstanding restaurant for Chinese cuisine amidst a large cluster of Chinese restaurants already operating in the city and they hope to realize it with their kitchen brigade headed by a leading Chinese chef from the Shandong province of China, Executive Chef Zhang Guo Min, who works full time at the restaurant.
Director K. Sumanasena said that the venue is also very popular among the business community and even among politicians due to its wide selection of private dining areas.
“At Fenghuang Lou, Sri Lankan guests too can also taste the best of upscale cuisine in an ambience of sleek and contemporary setting,” said General Manager Rohana Perera.
Fenghuang Lou is also reputed for its wide variety of Chinese dishes made available in its delicious a la carte menu and this is the reason Chinese tourists in large numbers patronize the restaurant.
“Fenghuang Lou also operates an extensive take away service with a large variety of dishes for one to choose from and have it delivered to one's doorstep within the city at no extra cost, said Sales and Marketing Executive Shanmie Rasangika Gamhewa. (SS)
