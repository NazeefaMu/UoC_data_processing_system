‘Govt. will always rule according to Buddhist principles’

Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday said ministers need to have the strength to bear the criticism levelled against them by the media. “The media attacks us, the President and the Prime Minister. At times the limits are crossed. As rulers, we don’t see our own mistakes at times. So we should appreciate the media for pointing them out. We are not going to attack the media for that,” he said.
The Minister was participating in a ceremony held at the Medamahanuwara Rajamaha Viharasthanaya.
He further said that the government would always rule according to Buddhist principles. “The government is also committed to upholding the supremacy of the law and democracy. We cannot prevent individuals from committing crime. But as a government, we have given prominence to the law. The era where the government itself engaged in illegal activities is over. There was a time when our people disappeared, journalists were harassed, government servants put under various pressures, and the country became infamous for its lawlessness. The United Nations in its sessions allocated three days to answer these questions.”
“Our government will not support or permit any illegal activity. We have provided an environment for all to live in peace,” he said.
