CCD to probe Rohingyan refugee incident in Mt. Lavinia

Acting Inspector General of Police C. D. Wickremerathna yesterday ordered the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) to investigate the Tuesday’s incident in Mount Lavinia involving Rohingyan refugees. It was allegedly mobbed by a group of local protesters and many of them were in yellow robes.
The police has obtained an order from the Mount Lavinia Magistrate’s Court to acquire unedited video footage of the incident from media institutions that recorded it, Police spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekera yesterday told the Daily News.
The incident had prompted the police to move 30 refugees to a safe location from Mount Lavinia.
The group was arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy in April when they attempted to illegally enter the country.
They were kept at a safe location run by the UN in keeping with a court order.
