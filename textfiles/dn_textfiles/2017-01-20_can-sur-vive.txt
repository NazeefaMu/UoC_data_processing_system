Can-sur-vive

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and is increasing particularly in developing countries such as Sri Lanka where a majority of cases are diagnosed in the late stages, according to the World Health Organization.
Cervical cancer has been identified as the second most common cancer among women in Sri Lanka. However, with early detection and treatment, cancers can be cured and managed.
Can-Sur-Vive, a CSR effort aimed at providing the patient with emotional, psychological and societal wellbeing, is a project of the CAN SUR VIVE TRUST of Sri Lanka.
Observing International Cancer Day in February, Can-Sur-Vive, in collaboration with Jetwing group will conduct the 5th ‘CAN – SUR – VIVE’ CSR program on January 28, from 8 am at the Lanka Hospitals.
The workshop also aims to actively educate women on breast cancer with regard to medical, physical, financial, spiritual and other related aspects pertaining directly to a cancer survivor’s well-being while reinstating their and family members’ confidence.
The workshop will be attended by consultants, including well-known clinicians, psychologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, sociologists, and financial advisors and clergymen.
The “survivor” is often used to mean someone who has completed active treatment. ‘CAN – SUR – VIVE’ program intends to invite all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are at present on treatment too.
