Of cabbages and cucumbers, scarecrows and jars of pickle
For the child in all of us

Ever wondered why rabbits have soft white fur? Why cucumbers feel cold when you bite into them? What do scarecrows dream of, as they stand in the middle of a vegetable plot all day long?
I know, that part of us that grew up and became adults, who are today too engrossed in our smart phones and wall posts on Facebook may not be bothered to find out. But the part that still remains a child would love to know the answers. Guess who can tell us? Who else but the legendary author of many acclaimed children's books beginning with the ‘Kuda Hora’ to ‘Suttara Puncha’ to the ‘Little Kite’, Sybil Wettasinghe, of course.
But the answers to the above questions are found only in her new books (Piduru Pala, Achcharu Muttiya, Sudu Sinidu Thuwaya, Nanna giya Yaluwo) published by M.D Gunasena, that prove to be a beloved addition to children's literature for many decades to come, for many good reasons too. The stories here, in much the same way Appu and Bappu touched our hearts in our own childhood, speak to the heart of every child, even if they happen to be living in the 21st century, playing computer games instead of climbing trees and may never have seen a scarecrow in their lives.
Just as well. For those who have never seen a scarecrow, Piduru Pala is the best scarecrow they could ever meet. With a face as round as the moon, forever smiling, dressed in a blue stripped shirt and shorts, he stands in the middle of Podi Appu Aiya's vegetable garden, till one day he tries to go for a walk.
Wouldn't you love to know what happens to him when he moves away from the pole he is tied to? I find it a great pleasure to keep this secret to myself, till you read the book and find out all about it in your own good time.
What about the cucumber and the cabbage who went to the river for a bath? What happens to them in Nanna Giya Yaluwo? Who can solve the mystery of the crane's white towel which goes missing, in Sudu Sinidu Tuwaya? The answers to these questions too, are best left to be found out on your own.
There's no mystery in Achcharu Muttiya, though. In this story you will find yourself traveling back in time to a village where a Mudalali is in the habit of throwing the dirty water after he washes the plates of his customers right onto the road in front of his ‘kade'. In Accharu Muttiya you will meet delightful characters like Ranhami and Kande gedera Ranso Nanda.
Each page on each book bursts with color. The warmth and exuberance of the pictures, so delightfully depicting the emotions the characters are going through, offset by minute details, the purple butterfly who gapes in astonishment at the crane, the squirrel laughing at the cucumber, the crow on the Mudalai's roof - enrich the books’ poignant themes.
Not only the children, but you too, will enjoy each story because there still is, or was, a child in all of us. What's the bet you will be smiling as you say goodbye to Piduru Pala. He is nolonger as young as he used to be, but we know he is safe and happy as he could ever be.
