GMOA to continue trade union action

The GMOA decided to continue their token trade union action on the SAITM issue since relevant authorities did not heed their demands, GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Accordingly, doctors in the Sabaragamuva Province will launch a token strike today, he said.
“We conducted strikes in the Southern, Eastern, North Central, Wayamba, and Central Provinces successfully, he said addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
However, the trade union action will not apply for emergencies and childcare, he said. The GMOA was compelled to take these steps since the Higher Education Minister and the Health Minister failed to take actions to safeguard island-wide patients, he said. “We urge the President to direct the Health Minister to publish the gazette notification on the minimum criteria of medical education standards. But it has still not been done. The Health Minister has still not signed for the recommendations of the SLMC technical Committee appointed to advise him in this regard,” he said.
The SLMC has to give conformity certificates for medical degree awarding institutions in Sri Lanka. However, the SAITM had not obtained the certificate, and the Higher Education Minster must clarify this situation immediately, he said.
“We urge the President to take over the Health and the Higher Education ministries and take these steps in 24 hours if the subject ministers do not want to do that,” he said.
In the SAITM case, an Additional Solicitor General from the Attorney Generals’ Department appeared for the Health Minister, but the AG has not appointed a lawyer for the SLMC, he said.
