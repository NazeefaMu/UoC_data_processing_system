Huawei’s new device will be officially revealed on Sunday, 26th February 2017. Last year, Huawei became the first and only brand in the world to build a dual camera smartphone together with Leica’s legendary camera engineers. Huawei has also set a high bar with industry-leading battery power, including devices that can last a full 48 hours, next-generation wearables for fashion and function on the go, and lots more.
