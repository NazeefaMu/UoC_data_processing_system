Missing Chinese national found in pit

The Chinese national, who went missing while working on the Matara-Hambantota Southern Expressway project, was found in a pit in the Dandeniya forest reserve by two children who accompanied their father into the reserve to clear a chena, Thihagoda Police said.
The children, who traced the Chinese national in the pit by following the cries raised by him, had alerted the police on the 119 hotline.
They had also given him water to drink to quench his thirst. Thereafter, a police team led by Thihagoda Police OIC Wasantha Kumara, had rushed to the spot and pulled out the Chinese national from the pit.
Later, they had called an ambulance and dispatched him to the Matara hospital. A hospital spokesman said the condition of the Chinese national was returning to normal. The Chinese national who had arrived in Sri Lanka with three other friends had been assigned to work on the Southern Expressway construction project. He went missing in the Dandeniya reserve the same day he started work.
During the last four days, the police together with the Army, launched an operation in the reserve to track him down. They had recovered the mobile phone belonging to the Chinese national and the pair of slippers worn by him during the operation.
Posters were also put up in the area pledging a cash reward to the person who would help in locating him.
A special team led by Inspector Vasntha Kumara has launched an investigation into the matter under the direction of Matara SP G. S. Marapana.
