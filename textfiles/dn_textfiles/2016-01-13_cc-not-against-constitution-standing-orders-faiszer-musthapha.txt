CC not against constitution, standing orders - Faiszer Musthapha

The proposed Constitutional Council is not against the constitution or the standing orders, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha, PC said.
Musthapha said the amendments which are to be made with a referendum, would not take place in these reforms.
The minister expressed these sentiments at a press conference at SLFP headquarters.
He said: “A new constitution or an amendment would be done according to the 1978 Constitution. So the criticisms made towards us are baseless. The SLFP is not talking about a ‘new constitution’. Even the word “new” is removed from the amendment.
Some of the political parties criticize us asking how the proposals would be done without a draft. We are going to engage in the drafting process.
The SLFP would never amend the priority given to the Buddhism, the integrity, or the sovereignty. The integrity meant something different in the drafts made by the people who are criticizing us. So they have no moral right to make such criticisms. The Prime Minister has accepted the proposals made by the SLFP".
