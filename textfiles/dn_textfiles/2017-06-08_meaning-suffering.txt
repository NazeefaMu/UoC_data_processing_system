Meaning of suffering

As humans, we are always eager to explore all thoughts those pop up in our minds. At times we do not correctly identify the inapplicability of some thoughts and engage in them, just for the sake of short term happiness. For this reason we become so “visionless” in our behavior and make our own lives so miserable, in a longer perspective. Although the life is full of suffering such shortsightedness aggravates the sufferings and blocks the path to end suffering. Sometimes we take such blindness even in understanding the spiritual path to end suffering and set wrong priorities. As Buddhists, we sometimes forget, knowingly or unknowingly, that Buddha himself has set an example through his life for setting right priorities and ignoring undue concerns.
Cula-Malunkya sutta, sometimes referred to as Cula-Malunkyovada sutta, is a great source that teaches us why we should not follow the notions that would divert us away from the final goal and lead us to further suffering. Buddhists should always remember that the Buddha had only one clear and consistent message in his teachings for the sake of spiritual awakening and liberation: Nibbana, the end of suffering. Cula-Malunkya Sutta: The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya (Found in Majjhima Nikaya in Sutta pitaka of Tripitaka), is another sutta where the Buddha is challenged regarding the so called “Great Questions” of all times. In the dialogue found in this sutta, the Buddha consistently refuses to answer anything that would prove to be a diversion from the goal of the Eightfold Path, citing how such an act would only reinforce ignorance.
Today, we live in an educated society where everything is looked upon with a scientific approach. Madly, we want to know the exact nature of everything around us, believing, that would one day end our distress. The importance of this Sutta arises due to the fact that the un-awakened monk Malunkyaputta represents the modern intellectuals who are more interested in philosophical arguments based on a mechanistic approach than in personal development; self-centered speculative notions than in selfless people orientation. The Buddha, through his wisdom, realized and showed us the path of the true purpose of spiritual life, and what the real and immediate questions of life are. After going through the article one can clearly understand how the Buddha avoided explaining matters that are not connected with the spiritual path and the final goal for ending of suffering.
This sutta can also be considered as one which discourses the well-known ten undetermined views set aside by the Buddha due to their unexplainable nature and invalidity in the path to the final goal. The ten points are as follows, where the first 4 views are about the cosmos, next two are about the self or soul and the last four views are about Tathagata: 1) The cosmos is eternal. 2) The cosmos is not eternal. 3) The cosmos is finite. 4) The cosmos is infinite. 5) The self is the same as the body. 6) The self and the body are separate. 7) A being* [satta] exists after death. 8) A being does not exist after death. 9) A being both exists and does not exist after death. 10) A being neither exists nor not exist after death. (*In Pali this is referred to as tathagatha)
Cosmos
Although, these were declared as undetermined here, one should apprehend the fact that Tathagatha himself was aware of the answers to these questions and these were explained in different other suttas. Argument here is about the validity of such questions in the context of life that we spend and not about the questions, per say.
One of the Monks of the Sangha, Malunkyaputta, when in isolation in the Jetawanaramaya, Anathapindika’s monastery, these thought occurred to him; “There are speculative views those have been left unanswered by the Blessed One, namely: The cosmos is eternal, the cosmos is not eternal, the cosmos is finite, the cosmos is infinite. Also, self (or soul) is the same as the body. The self and the body are separate. On the other hand, a being exists after death. A being does not exist after death. A being both exists and does not exist after death. A being neither exists nor does not exist after death”.
The monk was confused and went and met the Blessed one to clarify them so that his questions are answered. After paying homage to the Buddha, he sat down at one side and said: “Bhante, the following thought arose in my mind. These speculative views have been left undetermined and set aside by the Blessed One”. He then put forward the 10 great questions and said, “If the Buddha does not declare them for me, then I will give up being a monk and return to the normal life.”
He then reiterated those questions challenging the Buddha, “If the Blessed One knows the cosmos is eternal, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, ‘The cosmos is eternal’ or, if the Blessed One knows the cosmos is not eternal, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, ‘The cosmos is not eternal.’ If the Blessed One does not know: the cosmos is eternal or the cosmos is not eternal, then, it is only honest for one who neither knows nor see to say, ‘I do not know, I do not see’”.
Blessed
Then he went to his second question and said “If the Blessed One knows the cosmos is finite, then, let the Blessed One declare to me, or if the Blessed One knows the cosmos is infinite then, let the Blessed One declare to me. If the Blessed One does not know the cosmos is finite or the cosmos is infinite, then, it is only honest for one who neither knows nor see to say, ‘I do not know, I do not see’”
Venerable Malunkkya went along the same line of argument for other theses as well, one by one.
