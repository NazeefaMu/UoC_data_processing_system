Hanks to produce and star in ‘A Man Called Ove’

After ‘The Da Vinci Code,’ ‘Angels & Demons’ and ‘Inferno,’ Tom Hanks is all set to tackle an adaptation of another international best-selling novel ‘A Man Called Ove’.
According to a report, Hanks is attached to star in the project and will produce with his Playtone banner partner Gary Goetzman.
Rita Wilson, Hanks’ wife and frequent producing partner, is also producing along with Fredrik Wikstrom Nicastro.
The 2012 book by Fredrik Backman told the tale of a cantankerous widower who seems to revel in his bitterness and loneliness even as his frequent suicide attempts seem to be thwarted by bad timing and bad luck.
His life, however, takes a turn toward the unexpected when a mixed-race couple, with two young daughters, move into the neighborhood, leading to a heartwarming and life-affirming friendship.
The book became the best-seller and remained on the top of the list for a consecutive 77 weeks. It has been translated into 43 languages. ANI
