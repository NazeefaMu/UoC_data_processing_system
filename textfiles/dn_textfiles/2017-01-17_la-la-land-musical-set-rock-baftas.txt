La La Land musical set to rock the Baftas

Hollywood musical ‘La La Land’ is set to steal the show at the Baftas. The Damien Chazelle film has been nominated for 11 awards, just days after winning seven Golden Globes. The American romance follows a musician and aspiring actress who met and fall in love in LA. The two face a battle of juggling once-in-a-lifetime love and being in the spotlight.
The film features Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Tom Everett Scott, Finn Wittrock, J.K Simmons, Rosemarie DeWitt and John Legend. Both Gosling and Stone have been nominated for awards at the Baftas. According to Oddschecker, Gosling is 7/2 to win Best Actor whereas co-star Stone is 8/15 to win Best Actress, giving her a 65.2% of winning the award. ‘La La Land’ looks set to win Best Picture at 1/4, and Damien Chazelle is even more likely to claim Best Director at 1/6.
Following the recent success of ‘La La Land’ at the Golden Globes, odds for the film to pick up an Oscar for Best Picture have shortened dramatically and the odds are expected to become even shorter following another successful night at the Baftas. The Barry Jenkins film ‘Moonlight’ appears to be ‘La La Land’s main competition for Best Picture. Moonlight showcases the struggle of a young man growing up in a rough neighbourhood in Miami. The drama has already won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and is 7/1 to win Best Picture at the Baftas.
Casey Affleck is set to put a dampener on Ryan Gosling’s evening. Affleck is as short as 1/5 to win Best Actor and is also a short favourite to take home the same award at the Oscar’s. ‘La La Land’ have had no nominations for either Best Supporting Actress or Actor with Viola Davis role in ‘Fences’ as short as 1/10 to win best supporting actress, while Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Nocturnal Animals) will battle it out for Best Supporting Actor.
The ceremony will be held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 12 February.
