Kids Athletics Grade 3, 4 National Finals in Kandy

The Kids Athletics Programme 2017 organized by the Education Ministry with the generous sponsorship of Nestle Lanka will be worked off its Grade 3 and 4 national level finals on March 3 and 4 at the Bohambora grounds, Kandy with the participation of nearly 6000 school children from across the island who have qualified from district and provincial level contests.
The programme has a unique structure as it lining up children with a team sports spirit in day-to-day activities like walking, running, spinning and throwing in a fun and exciting manner with a scientific perspective can help meet their physical exercise requirement.
Children should engage in physical activity programmes based on the 'Four F' concept (Fun, Fitness, Fundamental and Friendship) conducted in suitable environments that provide a balanced physical and academic education. In addition to helping children be fit, these activities help recognize students with a talent for a specific sport and help develop their abilities too. Therefore to develop unity, team spirit, friendship and other character building qualities among children, the Ministry of Education introduced the ‘Kids Athletics Programme’ for primary students in 2015. The programme currently conducts team sports for grades 3, 4 and 5. Nestlé sponsors this programme and has been very popular among schools. By developing the basic athletic talent of primary students, the programme aims to improve Sri Lanka’s future in athletics.
Through this programme, more than 175,000 students participated in 247 divisional level games, 74 zonal level games and seven provincial level games in 2017. All provinces have been represented at this year’s championship, totaling 5,940 children for the finals (1,920 from Grade 3, 2,016 from Grade 4 and 2,004 from Grade 5).
The national level Grade 5 finals will be worked off on March 25 at the Mari Stella school grounds, Negombo.
The All-Island Schools Kids Athletics Championship is part of Nestle’s Kids Athletics Programme. It is the physical activity component of the Nestlé Healthy Kids Programme which teaches school children about improved diets, healthy cooking, hydration, food safety and hygiene.
