Price control for private health services

Work has commenced to apply a price control for private sector health services, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the private sector will be the next area to implement a price control.
“The health service is not a trade. It is a service,” he said, addressing the gathering after handing over appointment letters to 2,145 health staff members, including 1,629 nurses, 76 nursing graduates and 168 PHIs during a ceremony at Temple Trees, yesterday.
Minister Senaratne said the foundation stone will be laid for a new nursing faculty to be constructed at Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital premises with 19 floors. A total of 2,000 nurses can be trained at once at this faculty which has a 14-storey nursing quarters. A total of Rs. 300 million will be spent on developing nursing schools at Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Anuradhapura and Kandy. The Health Ministry needs a total of another 8,500 trained nurses by 2020. At present, there is a shortage of 600 nurses. Heart surgeries are performed at Colombo National Hospital even after 4 pm, which is the time all State institutions close, he said. Around 20 percent of the total cost of Colombo National Hospital is spent on providing free stents for heart patients, the minister added.
