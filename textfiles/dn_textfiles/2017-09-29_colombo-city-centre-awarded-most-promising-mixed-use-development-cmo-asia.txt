Colombo City Centre awarded 'Most Promising Mixed Use Development' at CMO Asia Awards 2017

Colombo City Centre (CCC), an upcoming mixed-use venture developed by the Abans Group in collaboration with SilverNeedle Hospitality, attained the illustrious award for 'Most Promising Mixed Use Development' at the 8th annual CMO Asia Awards 2017 which was recently held at the Le Meridien, Sentosa, Singapore.
“It has been our endeavour to contribute to making Colombo a world city. We are honoured and humbled at such recognition being received early in the project stages itself. We do hope to ensure that we build this best in class mixed use asset and help Colombo be the megapolis that the denizens of this city long deserve” said Anand Sundaram, Chief Executive Officer, Colombo City Centre, regarding this milestone achievement.
Colombo City Centre won the award over some of Asia’s leading mixed-use and commercial developments, which acted as a powerful testament to the ground-breaking retail and real-estate offerings that Colombo City Centre will provide to Sri Lankan citizens.
The CMO Asia Awards was a premier event organized by CMO Asia, the foremost authority in branding and marketing excellence awards. This ceremony aimed to recognize the outstanding contributions made by the most renowned brands and industry professionals in their respective fields throughout the Asian region. Overlooking the breathtaking emerald-green Beira Lake, Colombo City Centre is an ultra modern mixed-use development that uplifts the standards for enriching, high-end lifestyles within Colombo.
Divided into three phases, the project will include exclusive residences that will redefine luxury living in Sri Lanka; a colossal five-floor retail lifestyle mall that will host premium retail brands, a multi-cuisine food court, a spectacular six-screen Cineplex and more; and Next Hotel, the flagship brand of SilverNeedle Hospitality that will feature a futuristic approach towards accommodating the needs of professional business travelers.
Situated in an upmarket location that has already appreciated over 40% since 2016, Colombo City Centre will showcase stunning panoramic views of the Beira Lake, Indian Ocean coastline and rapidly evolving Colombo city skyline. Residents will also obtain a freehold title to their apartments.
As of 2017, the project is currently on track for completion with the target being Q1 2018 for the opening of the Colombo City Centre Mall. The handover of the apartments will commence from October 2018 onwards whilst Next Hotel is expected to open in October 2018.
In addition, Colombo City Centre has lately signed up with premium brands including Food Studio, Scope Cinema, Colombo Jewellery Stores, and many others to be showcased in the Mall, further reinforcing the commitment towards introducing retail and entertainment that is consistent with global standards in Sri Lanka.
