Enterprise Sri Lanka:
Bridge to a brave new world

The Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition, organised by the Finance and Mass Media Ministry to create an economy of entrepreneurs, was opened under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Moneragala, yesterday.
The exhibition has 12 zones and 515 stalls to raise awareness on the implementation of the recently-launched interest-subsidised loan scheme, Enterprise Sri Lanka. It will apprise the public of the progress of the ongoing and future development projects of the government.
