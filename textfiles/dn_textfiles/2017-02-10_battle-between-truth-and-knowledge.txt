Battle between truth and knowledge

Most significant incident that took place on the Navam Poya Day was the appointment of two chief disciples or agrasravakas, Sariputta and Moggallana. The enlightened one with his divine eye saw that some senior monks were negatively reflecting upon the decision and explained to them the suitability of those two appointments. In order to clarify his stand Buddha explained that seniority was not the only factor or qualification that had been considered in making those two key appointments.
Buddha’s discourse, Ovada Prathimoksha, helped monks to develop self-discipline. The other significant incident that took place on the Navam Poya Day was the holding of first ever Buddhist council. On the first Navam Full Moon Poya day after the Enlightenment of the Buddha, there were a large number of disciples in the Order of Maha Sangha. Although there had been no problems until then the Enlightened One would have expected incidents of breach of behavior and morality when the society of Sangha grew in number.
The aspirants of asceticism, initially, were ordained by Buddha Himself. As the Sangha community grew, Buddha introduced the principles of delegation and requested the members of the Maha Sangha to ordain the candidates.
This enabled them to go into priesthood when and where they wished. Buddha will intervene if they needed any clarifications and advice. As mentioned, the appointment of Sariputta and Moggallana as the two – “Aggrasavaka” took place on Navam Poya. Sariputta was appointed to the prestigious position of Dharmasenadipathi and Moggallana as Dharmapurohita respectively. There were discussions as to why some of the senior monks were overlooked in making these important appointments. To clear all misgivings of the monks, the Enlightened One, related the exciting story woven round Sariyuth and Mugalan in their previous birth during the time of Anomadassi Buddha. The Arahat Sariputta born during Anomadassi and was known as Sarada. He inherited massive wealth and a "Good Samaritan" who distributed wealth among the poor people. Through meditation, he gained Attasamapatti - eight attainments. Sarada had a close friend by the name of Siriwardane. Buddha Anomadassi preached to him. At the end of the sermon, except Sarada, all attained Arahatship. Sarada’s goal was to be become a chief disciple of Gautama Buddha. Anomadassi Buddha gave Sarada the assurance to be one of the chief disciples of Gautama Buddha. His friend Siriwardena too presented alms to Anomadassi Buddha, and aspired for the second position of chief disciple. Buddha’s announcement of Parinibbana within three months is also a significant event associated with Navam full moon.
In the journey of ‘Truth’, one must understand that merely collecting knowledge is not enough; first hand realization of the fact is key. Acquiring knowledge by listening to others or by reading books, affects only superficial layers of consciousness. At deeper layers of our being nothing really changes by merely acquiring knowledge.
Realization is direct, first hand, experience of the fact of life. When there is direct Realization of a fact of life, the whole being including the conscious, subconscious and unconscious realizes it, leaving no doubt whatsoever about the Truth. Let us take a direct example. Most of us have realized in our life, by direct experience at some point of time in life that ‘Touching very hot objects can burn and hurt life’. Now, when there is fire or there is very hot object, there is not even a little confusion about what one must do. In contrast, let’s take example of a child who has merely heard his mother say, the fire burns or do not touch hot objects. As he has mere knowledge but no realization of the fact, he may still feel curious to touch the object.
One must take a journey that can change his or her life does not merely give you knowledge, it takes you on a journey where you can directly realize the facts of ‘Mind’ and the ‘Human Consciousness’ as it takes place inside you. Layer by layer, you can realize the facts of life. Truth of existence dawns when you reach there!
Animals talk all the time. They are exactly the same as you and me and perhaps so much greater because they have powers that you cannot even dream of. They love, feel scared, they cry, laugh, and they know when you are going to kill them. The only way in which we are superior is that we know how to kill and we use that power all the time. So many animals know their previous lives and their relationship to the people that they live with. Each one of us has been connected in so many different ways to all the animals that we encounter – including the ones we eat –Animals carry this knowledge, we humans with our utterly selfish attitudes, have lost it.
If all of us had the capability to think like them, what a different world it would be. How could you kill them or eat an animal that is exactly like you? We do not have the abilities that animals have; some of them change their colours to suit their surroundings. A non-poisonous insect will develop the colours of a poisonous insect to keep predators away. A male garter snake produces a female smell when it feels cold, so that other males would rush in and form balls around it transmitting their heat to him. Sparrows with smaller bibs will always give way to the sparrows with the larger bibs to allow them to mate with females outside of their normal pair.
A fox would lie upside down with its eyes closed, and tongue hanging out – creating an impression in birds, it’s dead. Birds come down to consume the dead body.
Fox waits for an opportune moment to jump up and catch one of them. Is there any disparity between their behaviour and ours – apart from that they are much smarter.
In a world that is ruled by human continuously at war with all the other variety – and win a war by killing and harming and destroying them.
May all beings be Happy!
