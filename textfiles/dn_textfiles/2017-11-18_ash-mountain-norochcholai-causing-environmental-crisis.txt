Ash mountain in Norochcholai causing environmental crisis

The ash mountain accumulated by the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant is causing an acute environmental and social crisis threatening community life in the area, National Policy and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera said.
He was making a special statement to the media after an inspection tour of the ash mountain and the surrounding areas to inspect the harm caused to community life. State Minister Perera said the UNP joined hands with the people in the area and conducted protest campaigns against the plant when it was being built by the former regime.
Environmental sensitivities should have been taken into account when putting up plants of this kind in a highly populated area, he said.
People in the area had to be victims due to the absence of a proper waste management scheme to the CEB.
The State Minister said the problem was aggravated due to the low quality of coal used for the plant.
The CEB had failed to provide a solution to the problem as promised. An example is the spending of billions of rupees for purchasing electricity from the private sector at short notice.
The people suffering due to the Norochcholai ash mountain have suspicions about the proposed Aruwakkadu Waste Management project too.
