Five underrated cricketers of modern times

Since it’s inception, cricket has seen some great players who have taken the game itself to the next level. They increase the quality of the game and in doing so get noticed in the cricketing world.
But, there will always be some really good talents who do not receive as much praise as they should despite their exceptional talent on the field. The fact that many of their careers are born at a wrong time has led to them going unnoticed.
Cricket is a game of uncertainties, for you never know who may become a star on the field. Though it is a game played by 11 people on either side of the team, there are few noted players who shine brighter than the others.
Cricket too has seen unsung heroes since its inception and even in the times of social media, it is no exception.
In this segment, let us all have a look at 5 most underappreciated cricketers of modern times.
5. Brendan Taylor
Brendan Taylor has been the face of Zimbabwe cricket for more than a decade now. He has scored runs all over the world and saved his team from defeat many times. Taylor has carried a nation’s hopes on his shoulders whether it’s with his batting or captaincy.
In 28 Test matches, he has scored 3397 runs at an average of 33.35 which includes 5 centuries and 8 half centuries. In ODIs, he has scored 6156 runs at an average of 35.79, with 10 centuries and 36 half centuries.
He amassed 433 runs in the 2015 Cricket World Cup which was more than any of the top Indian batsmen. He scored back-to-back hundreds against India and Ireland.
But, despite such achievements, Brendan Taylor, as a wicketkeeper-batsman and as a skipper, has always been underrated in world cricket.
4. Azhar Ali
Azhar Ali has become Pakistan batting department’s most trustable batsman after the retirement of Younis Khan and Misbah ul Haq. Azhar Ali has been probably their best batsman in Test matches in this decade. He debuted in test matches before ODIs and he is one of the rare breeds of cricketers to whom Test cricket means everything.
He has scored 5303 runs at an impressive average of 44.19. This includes 14 Test centuries and 29 half centuries. He has 3 double centuries and 1 triple century against his name which goes to shows the gritty and resilient character he is at in the Test level. And one of those great double hundreds came at MCG against Australia when Pakistan needed it the most.
He recently retired from ODIs to continue his Test career which is such a rare thing to do nowadays, since everyone wants to play the shorter formats. Azhar Ali still continues to produce great innings in Tests for Pakistan especially when the team needs it the most.
3. Morne Morkel
The tall fast bowler from South Africa who intimidated every batsman with his pace, Morne Morkel, is undoubtedly one of the most under-appreciated fast bowlers of the modern era.
In 86 Test matches. he picked up 309 wickets at an impressive average of 27.67. In 117 ODIs, he picked up 188 wickets at a brilliant average of 25.32.
He formed one of the most devastating bowling combinations of modern era along with Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander. Furthermore, when Steyn suffered injuries, he continued preying batsmen with Kagiso Rabada and Philander. But, he always lived under the shadow of the legendary Dale Steyn. He retired early this year after the Test series against India.
2. Rangana Herath
Rangana Herath said goodbye to the game of cricket a week ago in a game when Sri Lanka lost to England at Galle. Herath will go down as one of the most underappreciated spinners of his generation. For a career that was in disarray when Muralitharan was in charge of the spin department, Herath picked himself up after the age of 30 like no other in history.
In 93 Test matches, the Lankan legend took 433 test wickets, the most by any left-arm bowler in the history of the game. He retired when he was the 8th ranked ICC bowler in the world. He took 74 wickets in 71 ODIs too, which not many people would remember.
For a player to have taken more than 350 wickets after the age of 30 is a remarkable achievement. He has defied age in every sense of the word. But he leaves a noiseless legacy behind.
1. Ross Taylor
This may come as a surprise for a few, but there is absolutely no denying the fact that Ross Taylor’s career is one of the most underappreciated in modern history. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest players to have come out from New Zealand in the last 2 decades. But has never witnessed the sweet smell of success in terms of the limelight for his achievements.
In 86 Test matches, Taylor has amassed 6282 Test runs at a terrific average of 46.53 garnished with 28 half centuries, 17 centuries, including 2 double centuries. He broke a 111-year-old record with his magnificent 290 at Perth.
In 207 ODI matches, he has scored 7428 runs at an astounding average of 47.01 which includes 43 half-centuries and 19 centuries. It’s an astonishing career for any middle order batsman.
His blitzkrieg innings against Pakistan at Pallekele in 2011 will go down as one of the most destructive innings in the World Cup history. Taylor has that ability to change the match when it’s needed.
However, despite his tremendous career, he will go down as one of the most underrated cricketers of all time. - sk
