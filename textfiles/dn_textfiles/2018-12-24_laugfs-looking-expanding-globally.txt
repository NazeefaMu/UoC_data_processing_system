LAUGFS looking at expanding globally

LAUGFS has been always looking at innovation diversification and new markets and this was the key to the company being one of the largest diversified business conglomerates and a trusted name in Sri Lanka, said the Founder and the Executive Chairman of Laugfs Holdings Limited Founded in 1995, W. K. H. Wegapitiya.
Wegapitiya in an interview with ‘Daily News Business’ said that they started their business ventures by launching Auto Gas for motor vehicles and this was a major success. “This gave us confidence to move forward following it up with similar ventures and diversifications in LP gas, super markets, petroleum, solar energy, leisure and bunkering.
He recalled that when they moved in to the local LP gas market, the monopoly was with the multinational company, Shell. “However we took the challenge and launched Laugfs as a true Sri Lankan company and today our products have become a house hold name.”
In the year 2001, when the government of Sri Lanka decided to liberalize the LPG industry, LAUGFS Gas commenced its operations as a humble limited liability company, with an intention of becoming the second fully-fledged LPG downstream player in Sri Lanka.
In the year 2010, the company, having consolidated itself as the second player in the LPG industry decided to go public and accordingly initiated Initial Public Offering (IPO), inviting the general public to become a partner in the next level of development of the company.
Today LAUGFS stand as a public-quoted business entity at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) with the participation of the general public as share holders from every corner of Sri Lanka.
Today LAUGFS holds one of the state-of-the-art storage and filling facility at Mabima about 15km away from Colombo. The LAUGFS plant is capable of holding 3000 metric tons of LPG at any given time. Currently plans are underway to increase the capacity to 4000 metric tons by year 2017.
He said that it was the large population and investor friendly policies that first attracted them to move to commence LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh Limited and introduce LP gas to the country.
PetredecElpiji Limited was renamed as LAUGFS Gas (Bangladesh) Limited in 2015 after its acquisition by LAUGFS Gas PLC of Sri Lanka, and has since expanded rapidly to become one of the largest LPG downstream players in the Bangladesh market.
“Recently we commissioned our newest cylinder requalification plant at its terminal facility in Mongla, Khulna.”
Operating a world-class LPG import, bottling and distribution facility in the Mongla Port, LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh imports and distributes over 60,000 metric tonnes of LPG in the country.
“As part of our expansion plans to strengthen our presence as a regional energy conglomerate, we have a strong focus on the Bangladesh market. The new state-of-the-art cylinder requalification facility is an important milestone in this journey. It will also enable us to serve the Bangladesh market with the safest LPG cylinders,” he said.
“We see tremendous potential in the Bangladesh LPG market and will continue to invest to strengthen our operations there,” he said.
He also said that to strengthen their energy operation they also acquired several ships and also opened its LPG storage complex at the Hambantota Port. Laugfs has plans to bring LPG in larger vessels from international markets like the Gulf, US, Singapore, to Hambantota.
“We believe that the port operator’s connection to an international brand name like China’s CMPort is something the local industry can leverage on”.
Wegapitiya said that the world is moving away from old-fashioned ideas and instead of nations wanting full control of their own enterprises they are leveraging what they have to attract the right partners, to create synergies that would help them to move forward.
He also said to meet the demands of the leisure sector, they opened two built hotels in Anantaya Chilaw and Passikudah resort and they have invested over Rs.4.5 billion for this.
He said that they shelved their plans for the real estate sector so far and said that they are keen to move to the pharmaceutical business with the manufacturing of saline. “We are awaiting further approvals from government to go ahead with this project.”
He also said that the country needs long-term policies and consistent tax structure so that they could plan out their strategies well in advance.
“Our teams including Managing Director, Thilak De Silva works tirelessly to strengthen our footprint in Sri Lanka and beyond as a trusted conglomerate. We are looking for more opportunities in Myanmar, Africa and the region.”
The company today has expanded across 20 industries, establishing a strong presence as a leader and pioneer in the power and energy, consumer retail, industrial, services, leisure and logistics in Sri Lanka and beyond. With over 4,000 employees and an annual turnover exceeding Rs. 37 billion, LAUGFS continues to expand and empower millions as a trusted Sri Lankan brand.
