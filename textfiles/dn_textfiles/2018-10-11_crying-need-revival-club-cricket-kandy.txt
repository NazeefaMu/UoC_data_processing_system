Crying need for revival of club cricket in Kandy

Most of the sports fraternity in Kandy believe that cricket at club level is the most popular sport in this city, although, realistically, it is behind rugger. In Kandy club cricket has not been part of the cricket lovers favorite sports, since it has not been promoted the way it should be at club level. When presidents of the caliber of Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, Dr. M. S. Uduwella, Harindra Dunuwille, Roy de Silva ruled, only a few clubs like Kandy CC, Kandy Youth SC, Peradeniya University RC were involved in the game at top level, later clubs like Saracens SC, Old Trinitians played in the lower group, in the country’s domestic tournaments. Later more and more fancy clubs came into the scene but they only get active when the AGM is around the corner, to get their people get elected into the main committee by playing fancy six a side tournaments.
That will never help to promote cricket, and also those at the helm get active to obtain complimentary tickets when international matches are played in the hills. Clubs should be given the right support, having many clubs will not help promote cricket that will only promote the officials and kill players’ cricket. If there are limited clubs then for sure they will succeed. According to a research done, today no club has a ground to call their own. They don’t have the proper players. Today no school leaver is keen to play for a Kandy club because there is no prominence given at club level. They move out of Kandy and play for other town clubs.
Fans overwhelmingly want cricket to finally make a comeback to Kandy.
In the early days in sports there was no politics involved, today it is the thing and if a politician gets in as president he wants all his supporters in the committee, who know nothing about the sport. There should be a man who supports every sport as the sports minister of the province. Today sports ministers come and go, and they can only be seen as chief guests at events and if the funds are obtained they go only to their known schools and clubs. Grassroots cricket at club level is struggling in Kandy and everyone believes a big change is needed to give it a viable future.
