Dynamic blow needed to stop This horrific human traffic flow

Today is World Day against Trafficking in Persons. Established in 2013 by the United Nations General Assembly the event is marked globally on July 30. The observance focuses on raising awareness of human trafficking and the importance of stopping it.
Trafficking of persons is essentially the trade of humans. International conventions condemn it as a grave violation of human rights. The purposes of trafficking in humans include, but are not limited to, sexual slavery, commercial sexual exploitation, forced labour, servitude, forced marriage, removal of organs among others. Almost every country in the world is involved in trafficking, whether as a country of origin, destination or transit for human trade victims.
Ttrafficking for employment
Trafficking in persons involves an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring or receiving a person through the use of force, coercion, fraud, deception or other devious means, for the purpose of exploiting them. A recent report commissioned by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) states that in Sri Lanka men, women and children are trafficked primarily for labour, commercial sexual exploitation, including domestic child sex tourism.
There are also growing concerns about trafficking for employment to the Middle East, Singapore and other countries for jobs in domestic work, construction and factory employment. The demand for cheap labour for ‘3D’ jobs — Dirty, Dangerous and Demeaning — fuels trafficking in countries such as ours.
Sri Lanka is primarily a source and, to a lesser extent, a destination country, for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking. Certain Sri Lankan men, women, and children who migrate to the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Afghanistan to work in the construction, garment, and domestic service sectors are subjected to forced labour.
Before leaving Sri Lanka, many migrant workers fall into debt to pay high recruitment fees imposed by unscrupulous labour recruitment agencies — most of them members of Sri Lanka’s Association of Licensed Foreign Employment Agencies and their unlicensed sub-agents. Migrant labourers receive a monetary advance as an incentive to move abroad, only to be trapped in debt bondage upon arrival at their destination. Some recruitment agencies commit fraud by changing the agreed upon job, employer, conditions, or salary after the migrant’s arrival. Some Sri Lankan women are subjected to forced prostitution in Jordan, Maldives, Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere.
Forced labour
Sri Lanka’s two million migrant work force has been a blessing for the economy of our war-torn nation. Indeed they are the heroic army battling on the economic frontlines providing significant support to the country’s balance of payments. Although our island nation receives a huge amount of foreign exchange from agricultural and industrial products, garments, tourism, gems and jewellery industries, the foreign exchange directly received from Sri Lankan migrant workers surpasses them all.
Last year alone, their remittances topped a staggering US$7.5 billion in foreign exchange to the country’s coffers. In essence, the government depends increasingly on resources that come directly and indirectly from migrant workers. But the cost in human terms seems horrific. Women represent roughly 60 per-cent of Sri Lanka’s growing migrant work force.
Most of them work in the Middle East as housemaids. Their problems are numerous and linked to their gender. In several host countries they face sexual and physical abuse as well as economic exploitation and in many instances with no access to judicial recourse or proper legal representation.
The International Labour Organization estimates that 21 million people are victims of forced labour globally. This estimate also includes victims of human trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation. While it is not known how many of these victims were trafficked, the estimate implies that currently, there are millions of trafficking in persons victims in the world.
Almost a third of all human trafficking victims worldwide are children, according to the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons released in December 2016 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Women and girls comprise 71 percent of human trafficking victims, the same report states. The UN plan calls for integrating the fight against human trafficking into the UN’s broader programs to boost development and strengthen security worldwide.
Slavery
The UN resolution also states that trafficking in persons, especially women and children, constitutes an offence and a serious threat to human dignity and physical integrity, human rights and development. Despite sustained measures taken at the international, regional and national levels, trafficking in persons remains one of the grave challenges facing the international community, which also impairs the enjoyment of human rights and needs a more concerted international response.
According to the 2016 UN report, women and girls tend to be trafficked for marriages and sexual slavery, while men and boys are typically exploited for forced labour in the mining sector, as porters and as soldiers. It also states that refugees from war and persecution are particularly vulnerable to becoming victims of human trafficking.
Unlike the transatlantic slave trade, modern slavery is not the backbone of western civilization or in something easily recognized. But those who hold others captive and force them to work against their will are making profits off this crime. In fact, human trafficking is estimated to be a US$32 billion industry.
Although slavery has been outlawed in nearly every country, millions of men, women and children are working as slaves in brick kilns, rice mills, garment factories, fishing operations and many other industries. It is one of the darkest and most revolting realities in the world today.
The tremendous advances in human civilization, in the sciences and technologies tempt us to think that slavery is a thing of a distant past. But when we examine the facts, we are shocked at how much slavery in all its modern forms is with us more than ever, albeit in a more submerged way.
Far from being a historical footnote and far from of diminishing or going away, this phenomenon of trafficking in persons is growing, provoked by conflicts and extreme poverty, and exacerbated by the present migration and refugee crisis.
It’s hard to believe that real slaves, people forced to work long hours through threats of violence or coercion, are living in our midst. We must devote ourselves to never again letting a generation go by without forward progress. Working toward a world without modern slavery is no doubt a bold proposition, but it is one that we must work toward.
Modern slavery is happening all around you and you can be part of the solution by raising your voice to end this shameful scourge. The threat is real, and needs combined efforts to stamp it out. Human trafficking is modern day slavery which deprives people of their human rights and dignity. Given the huge stakes in ruined lives, the ongoing fight against modern-day slavery should be unyielding.
