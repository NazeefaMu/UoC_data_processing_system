Fuel price hike decision with President, PM – Minister

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that final decision regarding a fuel price hike will be taken by the President and the Prime Minister together.
He made this remarks during the New Year celebration held at Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal (CPSTL) premises, yesterday.
“Government has not finalised whether to maintain CPC and CPSTL as profitable institutions or as institutions which provide service to the public, yet,” Minister Ranatunga said. “Government has to finalise it soon. Uncertainty of fuel price hike is the most popular topic everywhere. The Finance Ministry is also discussing with us. However, the final decision has to take by the President and Prime Minister together with the Cabinet.”
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Chairman Dammika Ranatunga stated that they were able to take victorious action regardless of barriers within a short period.
“We were able to achieve several victories in 10-11 months from the projects which were not initiated for years.”
“We planned some projects, initiated some and completed the rest. CPC was able to finalise the calling of tenders for the aviation fuel supply project in Katunayake within 45 days. It saves US$ 2 million for the country. We have completed the aviation fuel filtration unit which was recommended by JIG in 2001 within four months. We are also constructing an oil tank terminal in Kolonnawa,” Dammika Ranatunga said.
