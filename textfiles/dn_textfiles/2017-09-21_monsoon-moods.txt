Monsoon moods

The rainy season is here. It’s time to get your raincoats, gumboots and waterproof make up out again. But don’t let the rains dampen your style. Natural and minimalist make up is the mantra if you want to look stunning even in the downpour. For those of us who feel undressed without make up, here is a lowdown on tips to beat the grey skies.
Changes in your daily skin care
Skin care routines don’t normally change too much during monsoon seasons. It is mostly fluctuations in temperature that generally need either a heavier or lighter routine change.
Make up for the rainy season
If you know that you are going to get caught in the rain, you should wear less makeup. Light weight foundations and moisturizers need to be used. Eye makeup or anything that can smudge is a big no no. Go for eye make up only if you have got water proof liners and mascaras. During these times you can play up your lip and cheek make up so that the attention is drawn to those features.
Hair care rules for the rainy season
Blowdrys and fancy dos don’t make sense during the rainy weather. Instead, try a chic chignon with a middle part or a braided hairstyle. Go for something that keeps your hair tightly in place and won’t change if you get caught to the winds or drizzle or if the humidity levels change.
Everyday make up essentials for the rainy season
Keep some blotting paper handy. Also have whatever makeup you are wearing that day in your handbag to use in case you need to touch up.
Diet for the rainy season
There is no food that is categorized as better or worse for you when it rains. However a nice hot bowl of soup is always a good idea for cold evenings.
Monsoon makeover tips
Avoid see through fabrics. Carry a scarf with you to protect your hair and always wear practical shoes. You never know when you will step in a puddle!
Any kind of jewellery can be worn as the rains should not affect jewellery.
Dos and don’ts
Stay away from runny makeup and heavy fabrics that could sag with water weight in case you get drenched in the rain. See through fabrics and pretty shoes covered in satin are also not the best rainy day choices.
