Murder of two in Kotakethana:
Woman acquitted after six years

A woman held in remand for six years over a murder was aquitted and released yesterday.
Colombo High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi made this order taking into consideration the insufficient evidence placed against the second accused Asoka Chandani Kumari alias Batti during the prosecution evidence.
The second accused who was held in remand custody for six years in connection with the murder of a 52-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter in Kotakethana in 2012, was ordered to be acquitted and released by the Colombo High Court yesterday.
The husband and wife Lokugam Hewage Dharshana alias Raju and Asoka Chandani Kumari alias Batti were accused of killing Nilmini and her daughter Kavindi Chaturangi Sellahewa.
However, the High Court decided to proceed with the trial against husband Lokugam Hewage Dharshana alias Raju and further trial was fixed for November 1.
Senior State Counsel Lakmali Karunanayake prosecuted. President Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne defended the accused.
