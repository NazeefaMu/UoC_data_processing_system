Woman injured in drug raid crossfire

A woman received gun shot injuries when police opened fire on a car suspected to be carrying heroin smugglers in Bodagama in Thanamalwila yesterday.
The police raid was carried out on information given by a decoy of a large consignment of heroin being transported in a car.
The car had ignored orders to stop at a barrier and had fled the scene. A police jeep had given chase. The occupants had opened fire at the police jeep when police retaliated in self defence. A bullet had hit a woman in the crossfire. The victim was admitted to the Hambantota Hospital. Two special police teams were deployed to arrest the culprits.
