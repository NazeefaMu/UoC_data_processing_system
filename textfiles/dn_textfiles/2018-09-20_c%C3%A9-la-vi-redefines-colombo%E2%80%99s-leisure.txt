Besides serving up a menu of Modern Asian cuisine, CÉ LA VI is also a feast for the senses as the venue offers patrons the view of the city’s skyline and ocean. The restaurant boasts a Teppanyaki station and is the perfect location for a romantic dinner, family get together or even a business lunch which will undoubtedly impress clients.
The lounge offers guests the option of either enclosed or al fresco dining while overlooking the Indian Ocean.The lounge features a spanning view of the city skyline, not to mention the exotic, one-of-a kind, signature cocktails. Sip on expertly crafted signature cocktails by master mixologists and enjoy the entertainment every night. The lounge features cozy sofa seating, lined with a sleek modern bar.
