SriLankan refuses to disclose top employee salaries

SriLankan Airlines has now twice rejected the Airline Pilots’ Guild of Sri Lanka’s information requests under the Right to Information Act.
The trade union originally filed an RTI application with the airline in June looking for information about “the alleged misuse of public funds and the multitude of irregular practices within by the management of the airline,” they said in a statement.
But their requests were rejected by the airline in July, and then rejected again on appeal.
The trade union said today they will take the airline before the RTI Commission, the judicial body that rules on appeals.
The pilots have asked for the salaries of the CEO, Head of Human Resources, and Chief Commercial Officer of SriLankan airlines, as well as information relating the the termination of the relationship between Pakistan International Airlines and SriLankan airlines.
