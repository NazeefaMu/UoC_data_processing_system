Stern action should be taken against UPFA MP Soyza

Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe stated that stern action should be taken against UPFA Ratnapura District Parliamentarian T. Ranjith Soyza for presenting incorrect facts in Parliament concerning parliamentarians’ closed files by the Bribery Commission due to lack of evidence.
Making a statement in Parliament, Minister Wijayedasa Rajapakshe stated that 55 of the seventy four cases pointed out by T Ranjith Soyza one day have been closed by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, as there had been no evidence to prove. He added that all those cases have been closed during the previous regime not under this good governance government.
He stated that these files have been opened against many members including Johnston Fernando, Feliex Perera, Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, Karu Jayasuriya, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Rauf Hakeem, Dilan Perera, A H M Fowzie, Duminda Dissanayake, Kabir Hashim, S B Nawinna, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Suresh Premachandra, Mavei Senadirajah, Susil Premajayantha, late Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, late T Maheshwaran , Jeewan Kumarathunga, Lakshman Kiriella, etc.
He said a Commission has investigated into these files and had closed down the files due to lack of proper evidence. The minister said T Ranjith Soyza said that no investigations have been taken against them which was baseless.
