Father, daughter drown as trishaw caught in high tide

A 41-year-old father and his 14-year-old daughter died and two others managed to swim to safety when the three wheeler in which they were travelling got swept away in a high tide while crossing the Pedduwa Causeway across Deduru Oya on Saturday.
The man was identified as H.M. Gamini Herath and his daughter, Rashmi Navodya of Anodawa, Pahala Pedduwa. Those who managed to escape the ordeal wee their relative W.M. Gunatilleke, 55, and an 18-year -old neighbour named M.B. Dulaj Mahesh Madushan. Navodya, a grade 9 student of Wellawa MV was the only child in the family.
They had left home in the three wheeler around 3 a.m to attend a pinkama held at Weeraketiya when the tragedy occurred on the way. Navodya's body stuck in a thorny shrub about a kilometre down stream from the causeway was found by neighbours around 8 a.m, while Herath's body was found about one and a half kilometres drown stream around 11 a.m.
Dulaj Mahesh who swam to safety after creeping out of the three wheeler had alerted neighbours and brought them for assistance.
They saved Gunatilleke who was dangling from a branch of a tree on which he had hung by his hands to save himself from surging waters.
The ill fated three wheeler stuck in the river about 200 metres down stream was pulled ashore by neighbours. Kurunegala Acting Magistrate Felican Perera who held the magisterial inquiry sent the bodies to the Kurunegala Hospital JMO for a post mortem examination. Wellawa Police are investigating.
