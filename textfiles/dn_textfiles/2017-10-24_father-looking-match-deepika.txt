Father is looking for a match for Deepika

Deepika Padukone recently wowed over everyone who laid eyes on her in the ‘Padmavati’ trailer. Her ethereal avatar as Rani Padmini had fans singing praises of her beauty. While a war may have been waged to covet her in the film, Deepika recently shed some light on her love life off-screen.
Much to everyone’s surprise, the actress spoke candidly about her romantic relationships at the launch of Hema Malini’s biography. At the event, Deepika was quoted saying, “Romantic relationships are complicated.”
Taking a cue from Hema’s own experience of her parents putting matrimonial ads on the paper, Deepika joked, “Like Hema Malini’s dad did, my father may also be looking for a match for me.”
While Deepika may not have openly admitted to being in a relationship with Ranveer Singh, the two have often been seen cosying up at parties and heading out on a number of dinner dates around the city. TNN
