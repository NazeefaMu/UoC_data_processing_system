AIA employees lend  hand to Batticaloa School

AIA Insurance employees colour-washed a school building in Batticaloa, under a series of CSR efforts called ‘HR Rendezvous - we come to you.’  Staff from Colombo and other regional offices were present in Batticaloa to join AIA colleagues from the East to give the Vinayakar Vidyalaya in a rural area called Pavatkodichenai in Batticaloa, a new coat of paint.
Additionally, the school’s 400 students were gifted school bags for the upcoming new school year. AIA also facilitated a medical camp conducted by doctors from the Kaluwanchikudy base hospital, for students, parents and the rest of the community. Over 150 people attended and got free check-ups. AIA’s CSR initiatives are intended at bringing together AIA’s staff in fulfilling AIA’s mission to help the communities we serve live longer, healthier, better lives.
