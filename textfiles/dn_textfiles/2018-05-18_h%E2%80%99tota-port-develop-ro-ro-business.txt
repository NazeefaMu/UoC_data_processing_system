H’tota Port to develop ro-ro business

The management of Hambantota Port is looking for the development of a marine-related industrial park and the construction of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power plant for the Port, said Chief Operating Officer of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) Tissa Wickramasinghe.
He said that Hambantota Port has the potential to develop the Roll-on/Roll-off (ro-ro) business, with volumes doubling within the first quarter of the year.
Hambantota could be an important ‘pit stop’ in the Indian Ocean for ships plying the east-west route,” he added making a presentation at the 2018 TOC Asia (Terminal Operator Conference) in Singapore recently.
He pointed out that Hambantota is a unique deep-water multi-purpose port located adjacent to the main east-west sea route and its potential is yet to be tapped.
He also highlighted that the possibility to be then new bunker storage and supply location in the region is huge. Wickramasinghe stressed on the importance of its location at midpoint between Singapore and Fujairah, which are the world’s number one and number two bunkering ports respectively. His presentation titled ‘Hambantota Port – New pit stop in the Indian Ocean’ emphasised that Hambantota has the potential of becoming the maritime hub for the Asian and African regions. Commenting on the presentation he made to TOC Asia 2018, Wickramasinghe said: “Hambantota and its true potential have not been adequately presented to the international port and shipping community. This was therefore an excellent opportunity to place Hambantota on the map. The interest it generated is most encouraging.”
The TOC Asia Conference & Exhibition, held in conjunction with Singapore Maritime Week, is the complete Container Supply Chain event for Asia.
This was the fourth occasion that Wickramasinghe was among the eminent speakers at a TOC session, having addressed previous conferences in Dubai and Singapore.
Wickramasinghe was also invited to be a panellist at the sessions of the ‘Asia & Middle East Infrastructure & Investment Forum 2018’ which was part of TOC Asia.
The Hambantota Port is managed by Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) and Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS) two new companies set up by the China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA).
CMPort is one of the largest global port operators, with terminal operations around the world, including the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), which manages the Colombo Port’s South terminal.
