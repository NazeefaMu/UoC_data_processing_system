She needs help

Four-year-old Thesanga Nerhsala Dissanayake of Pahala Kalankuchchiya in Kalankunchiya in the Anuradhapura district is suffering from thalasseamia (major) and has to undergo regular blood transfusion and iron chelation at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Consultant pediatrician Dr. T.U.N. de Silva has recommended a bone marrow transplant.
The surgery is estimated to cost Rs. 5.7 million. Her father D.M.G. Dissanayake says he is unable to foot the bill due to his financial plight. He requests the public to assist him in his daughter's cause by sending financial contributions to help expedite the surgery. Contributions should be remitted to account number 5650435 at the Bank of Ceylon, Galnewa branch.
