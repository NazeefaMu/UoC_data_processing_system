Bairstow revives memories of Stokes stand with double century

 
LONDON, Tuesday - Jonathan Bairstow was involved in another large stand with a big-hitting partner as he revived memories of his finest day in an England shirt.
Four months ago Bairstow and Ben Stokes, who struck a stunning double century, shared a record-breaking stand of 399 against South Africa in Cape Town -- a partnership that included the Yorkshireman’s maiden Test hundred.
Monday saw Bairstow in the runs again, this time for defending county champions Yorkshire, with the wicketkeeper-batsman posting a career-best 246 and sharing a partnership of 227 with Liam Plunkett, who made 126, as Hampshire were run ragged on the second day of a First Division fixture at Headingley.
Asked if there was a similarity in the two stands, both of which featured him batting alongside a big-hitting partner, Bairstow said: “Exactly.” Both Bairstow and umpire Nigel Llong had to take evasive action when one of Plunkett’s 18 boundaries came whistling straight down the pitch.
“I think he nearly cleaned me up at the other end,” said the wicketkeeper-batsman.
“I didn’t really see too much of the ball, and I think Nigel Llong was running the other way as well,” said Bairstow, whose innings was the centrepiece of Yorkshire’s imposing total of 593 for nine declared.
Plunkett may be better known as a fast bowler but the England international’s hitting power with the bat is no secret -- it’s just that he’ rarely wielded the willow to such good effect. “The way Liam came out and played was absolutely fantastic,” said Bairstow. “You saw from ball one how cleanly he came out and struck it.
“When someone’s striking it like that, you just let them go as long as possible.”
Hampshire captain James Vince then did his chances of an England Test call-up no harm with an impressive 76 not out against one of the best county attacks around as the visitors reached stumps on 141 for five.
Elsewhere, Australia-born Sam Robson pressed his cased for a Test recall with a career-best 231 on a day when Middlesex and England colleague Steven Finn marked his return to action with a wicket first ball against Warwickshire at Lord’s.
Robson, 175 not out overnight, went to his double century in 311 deliveries before Middlesex were all out for 452, with New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel taking four wickets. Fast bowler Finn, making his first competitive appearance since the third Test against South Africa in January, saw his opening delivery take the shoulder of Ian Westwood’s bat on its way to Nick Compton, another England international, at fourth slip.
