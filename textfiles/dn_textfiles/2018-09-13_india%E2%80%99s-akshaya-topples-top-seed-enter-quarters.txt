India’s Akshaya topples  top seed to enter quarters

Top seed Chui Kei Leung of Hong Kong was handed a shock defeat by India’s Akshaya Suresh who created a major upset when she won 7/5, 7/6(2) to book a berth in the women’s singles main draw quarterfinals of the ongoing ITF Junior Circuit Week II at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association clay courts yesterday.
It was an exciting game right from the beginning as both players tried hard to overcome each other. Akshaya won the hard fought first set after a close fight. The second set saw a more intensified battle where the Indian sealed her victory in a tie breaker. Akshaya will meet her teammate Tanvikhaa Saravanan in the quarters.
