Not meant for ladies!

Long johns, the underpants Victorian men wore when they went to bed to snore, now women wear to cathedrals. Another form of common dress is the so-called leggings and flip-flops, notwithstanding the state of their bundy. Men of charm, ability and enterprise who see a heavily pregnant woman trundling towards them in these ghastly outfits, discreetly step aside to avoid getting run over and landing themselves in intensive care and the clutches of waiting white coats who will likely treat them with a banned drug. Western medicine has progressed in leaps and bounds. Betrayals have come from the practitioners, who worship lucre.
Women are now demanding free access to pubs. The aim and purpose of a pub are to encourage unlimited boozing and smoking. To that end, the pub is made very comfortable. For women of luxurious tastes, there is the salon deluxe. For women who are ill at ease in clean surroundings, there is the low doggery. No such comforts await at home.
Husbands are likely to be less polite and probably a good deal less tidy. So women who have free access to a pub will naturally be disposed to anchor themselves on to the foot rails, sit on the high cushioned tripods with a cigarette dangling from their lips, eye the chromatic decanters lined on the shelf filled with measured amounts of fluid ounces and booze until their tortured livers revolt and they are ripe for the undertaker.
Demanding legislation
Today wealthy wives do not care a hoot for their husbands. They use their credit cards and fly away at whim just the way we hopped on to our bikes and pedalled to Lion house for a cup of tea when the University of Ceylon was the pride of Asia. Sadly, those days are no more. Now the oath taken by the bride at a wedding ceremony is so much froth quickly gone with the wind, like the way Sri Lankan Universities have gone unable now to find a place in a rating of 400 Asian Universities.
A wealthy mouse of a man knew his wife has gone to Bali after a friend told him he met her at the Resort. To put on the shoulders of meek husbands, who are often giants by girth, the sins and indiscretions of their wives are out of date and out of fashion. When a wife purchases a high-class flat in a wealthy neighbourhood without seeking the approval of the husband that unilateral act scandalizes only the man with a Victorian mentality. Wives are now demanding legislation to protect themselves against marital rape.
The days when mothers were at the gate to welcome children returning home from school seem to be over. I am aware this is a rash sally because there are still devoted mothers who stay at home to look after their children. But they are a dwindling breed. When I saw my mother at the gate, I quickened my pace into a run since I knew I was entering a place of safety, a sanctuary.
Mothers protect their young
When the hermit monk took me when I was a mere boy of 15 from the Elephant Rock in Kurunegala, to the Tortoise Rock and then the Eeel Rock, from where I would descend to the Wewa that fed water to the town and walk back home, a wild boar crossed our path, followed by a brood of squealing piglets. The monk stretched out his hand and stopped me with the admonition let them pass, the jungle belongs to them. If you are perceived as a threat the mother will attack, tearing your legs to ribbons with her tusks and let you bleed to death. That’s the way in the animal kingdom. Mothers protect their young with a fierce intensity.
Mothers stay at home and protect yourself and your children. The atmosphere in a smoke-filled pub is grim. Fights between bar flies are common. Apart from drunks who pester for free drinks, there are the sharpies. Stay in the safety of the home and enjoy the company of your children. Teach them knowledge is useless without memory. Memory is the foundation of all culture as the ancients showed through the myth of Mnemosyne, Mother of the Muses, the nine goddesses of literature and the arts. Remember there is a time to live and a time to die-Ecclesiastes 3.
