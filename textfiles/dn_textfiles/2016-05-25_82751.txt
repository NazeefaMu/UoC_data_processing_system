‘Can’t see why  Sri Lanka have been  sent to the north’ : Former England quick Agnew questions Lankan tour itinerary

 
 LEEDS: Former England fast bowler and present cricket commentator for BBC Test Match Special Jonathan Agnew has questioned the rationale behind Sri Lanka being asked to play the first two Tests of the English summer up in the north where the cold conditions would make any team from the subcontinent struggle for survival.
“It is great for the home side that England won, but the nature of that victory does raise some serious questions about the scheduling and venues of these early season matches,” Agnew wrote in his regular column on BBC.
“I don’t understand why Sri Lanka has been sent to Leeds and Durham for these opening two Tests.
“You could say that the cold, grey conditions quite likely in the north of England at this part of the year give the hosts their best chance of winning - but there’s much more to it than that,” said Agnew.
“While you certainly do not want to give the opposition a leg-up, you have to do what’s best for Test cricket. That includes providing the best possible spectacle, ensuring the match is a contest and giving value for money to those who have tickets.
“Sri Lanka being shot out for 91 and 119 before the close on day three does none of those things and is no help to people who wanted to see cricket on days four and five or those who want to maximise income from these international matches,” Agnew continued.
“There are questions hanging over these May Test matches, not least because their continued existence prevents England players from going to the Indian Premier League.”
Throwing more light to why Lord’s was staging the third Test and not the customary second Test, Agnew said, “This year, Lord’s was not available for the first two Tests (it will stage the third) because of work being done to the Warner Stand, while the other ground in London, The Oval, usually stages the final match of the summer.
“Could Surrey and The Oval volunteer to do something that is best for the game and take on one of the early summer matches I doubt that will happen.
“Next year, the Tests won’t be held at this time because of the Champions Trophy but, after that, should we look at where these matches are played”
Yorkshire’s chief executive Mark Arthur was also critical of the ECB staging Test matches at Headingley in May.
Arthur has said it would be “sensible” for Headingley to host Tests in July.
“Headingley should be playing their Test match cricket in July,”
Arthur told BBC Radio Leeds.”The current regime at the ECB has inherited this situation and they agree with us that it is nonsense to have any Test matches in the north in May.”
On Monday we questioned the manner in which the Sri Lankan tour itinerary had been drawn up and why Sri Lanka Cricket had not even made an attempt to change it. We also criticized the amateurish way in which the administrators had handled the fixtures allowing eight free days between Tests for a team that is struggling to come to terms with English conditions.
The second Test against England ends on May 31 and Sri Lanka have to wait till June 9 for the start of the third Test at Lord’s with no fixtures arranged in between.
