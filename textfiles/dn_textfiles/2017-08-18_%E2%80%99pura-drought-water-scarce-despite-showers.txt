A’pura drought: Water scarce despite showers

Although there were signs of a significant rainfall in the Anuradhapura district, no major rainfall was experienced except for a few showers in certain areas.
Anuradhapura Irrigation Chief Engineer Jayantha de Silva said there was no positive change in the water levels of 13 major tanks as a result of the showers.
Anuradhapura Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Development Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that there was no water collected in the 3,000 minor irrigation tanks with the recent rainfall. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka said despite minor showers, the number of DS divisions suffering from the shortage of drinking water is on the rise.
By August 14, two more DS divisions were added to the list of divisions where drinking water is distributed through bowsers. At present, drinking water is distributed to Nochchiyagama, Mahawilachchiya, Thalawa, Thambuttegama, Padaviya, Galenbidunuwewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Rambawe, Ippalogama, Galnawa, Horupothana, Kabithigollawa, Thirappane, Madawachchiya, Palugaswewa and Nuwaragam Palatha (Central) DS divisions covering 120 Grama Niladhari divisions.
The population being provided with drinking water is 76,000 of 22,800 families. Wanninayaka said 1,000 water tanks of 1,000 litres are placed in remote villages for storing drinking water.
“We have hired a fleet of tractor and lorry bowsers in addition to government vehicles to transport and distribute water. The President has directed to provide the utmost priority to make potable water available to the suffering masses at any cost. In distributing drinking water to distant remote villages, we are facing the problem of finding suitable water bases or sources nearby,” Wanninayaka said.
He said he requested the Mahaweli Authority and the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to provide Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa tank, the main water source in Anuradhapura supplying drinking water to a population of nearly 300,000. He pointed out that the other two tanks in the system, Thuruwila and Thissawewa, have an adequate water capacity to continue water distribution for another one month. According to him, these tanks purify around 40,000 cubic metres of water daily for distribution in Anuradhapura, Nachchaduwa, Mihinthalaya, Saliyapura, Wijepura and the sacred city area.
