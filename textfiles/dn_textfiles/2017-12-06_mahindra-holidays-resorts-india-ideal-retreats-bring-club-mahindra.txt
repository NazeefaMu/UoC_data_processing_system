Founded in 1996, Mahindra Holidays & Resorts India Limited (MHRIL) is the leisure and hospitality arm of the Mahindra Group, a USD 19 billion multinational group based in Mumbai, India. Mahindra Holidays is the largest vacation ownership company, outside of the USA, and offers quality family holidays to its members.
The Company is committed to creating 'Magical Moments' for its members when they holiday at any of its resorts in India and abroad, as well as in their city of residence all year round.
"When Club Mahindra was first introduced in India, it was a new concept and Mahindra was among the first few to identify the opportunity as worldwide the concept was backed by companies who were high on Trust, Transparency, and Credibility for which Mahindra was endorsed and known in the market", said Pankaj Agarwal, Head Customer Acquisition, International Business, Mahindra Holidays and Resorts India Ltd.
"Over the last 20 years, we have grown to be the largest vacation ownership company in the world, outside of the US. As of September 30, 2017, MHRIL has 225,000 vacation ownership members and operates 53 resorts across India and abroad and its subsidiary, Holiday Club Resorts Oy, Finland, a leading vacation ownership company in Europe has 50,000 members and 32 resorts across Finland, Sweden and Spain."
" As to Club Mahindra's future plans both in Sri Lanka as well as internationally, we plan to start with our sales office through Ideal Retreats and look forward to having a Club Mahindra property in Sri Lanka in the coming months. We are already in touch with the OZO group of hotels to start the first tie up for our existing members".
MD Ideal Retreats [Pvt] Ltd, Richard de Zoysa, addressing the gathering said, "we will be responsible for promoting membership of Club Mahindra to families, individuals and to the corporate sector. We will initially work in compliance with the strategies set by our principles with a few deviations of our own since we are more aware of the local market trends. We also benefit by the presence of a senior management representative of Club Mahindra who will sit in our offices permanently".
