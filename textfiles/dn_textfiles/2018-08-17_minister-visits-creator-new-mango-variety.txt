Minister visits creator of new mango variety

Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera visited Tom Ellawala who introduced a new mango variety called TEJC, at his residence in Jayewardanepura, recently.
Minister Amaraweera said that the government was ready to pay tribute to the 88-year-old Ellawala for his contribution to economic growth and the well-being of the people in Sri Lanka.
The TEJC mango is the world’s largest mango, with an average weight of 600 grams. This mango variety was created by Ellawala and the late Dr. Juan Carlos from the Philippines.
With the help of the Agriculture Department and late Dr. Carlos, Ellawala was able to register the mango as ‘TEJC’.
Currently, there is a huge demand for TEJC mangoes, both in the local and international market.
The tree yields fruits throughout eight months of the year, and unlike other native species, it is a regular bearer of fruits.
TEJC has been recommended for the Dry and Intermediate Zones of the country by the Agriculture Department.
