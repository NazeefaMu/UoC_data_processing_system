UK Travel Advisory SANS negative affects-Hoteliers

The updated UK Travel Advisory requesting UK nationals to be more vigilant when travelling to Sri Lanka would not have any negative affect for tourism arrivals.
The updated UK travel advisory website advised, “You should exercise vigilance and avoid all demonstrations or large political gatherings,” subsequent to the appointment of the new Prime Minister.
President Colombo Hoteliers Association, N. Shanthi Kumar said that the UK Travel Advisory only says to ‘avoid’ and is not a ‘harsh ‘advisory.
“We don’t see any cancellation of winter bookings for Colombo which is very positive.”
Meanwhile an official from the Hotels Association said that there were no cancellations of booking made by UK tourist or any other tourist to travel to Sri Lanka.
