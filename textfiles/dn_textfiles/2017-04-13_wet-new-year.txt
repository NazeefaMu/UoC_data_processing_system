Wet New Year

The Meteorological Department forecasts fairly heavy rains across the country during the New Year holiday.
Its weather forecast said the prevailing showery condition is expected to enhance until April 15 due to the low level atmospheric disturbance in the vicinity of Sri Lanka.
“Showers or thundershowers will occur in most provinces after 2.00pm. Showers may occur in the Eastern, Western and Southern Provinces during the morning too. Heavy falls (about 100mm) can be expected at some places particularly in the Western, North-western, Southern, Sabaragamuwa, Central, Uva and North-central provinces” it stated.
“There may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers. The general public are requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damage caused by lightning activity” it added.
It also advised the naval and fishing communities to be cautious as sudden roughness of the sea areas is possible due to sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80kmph) in the deep and shallow sea areas off the coast extending from Matara to Trincomalee via Hambantota and Batticaloa.
“Showers or thundershowers will occur at times in the sea area off the coast extending from Puttalam to Trincomalee via Colombo, Galle, Hambantota and Batticaloa. Heavy falls are also likely at some places. Seas can be temporarily rough during thundershowers due to temporary increase of wind speeds up to 60-70kmph” it stated. The maximum rainfall of 118 mm was recorded from Dodangaslanda, Kurunegala in the 24 hours ended 12 pm yesterday.
