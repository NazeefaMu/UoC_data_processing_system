Protesters violating law will be brought to book: IGP

Those who engage in protests violating Court orders are dealt with the same law, whether it is the North or South, IGP Pujith Jayasundara said yesterday (17).  
He added that legal action would be taken against those who engaged in a protest in the North violating court orders that banned them from doing so.  The IGP answered the above at a media briefing at Police Field Force Headquarters when questioned whether legal action would be taken against Northern Provincial Councillor M.K.Shivajilingam who had organised a protest in the North violating court orders.  He added that investigations have begun into the actions of the Councillor and other protesters who took part in the protest.
