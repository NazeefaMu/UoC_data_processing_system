Throwback to 70s

The "Super Stars Super Concert" marks the reunion of the original members almost after 25 years. They were the most popular band of the 70s. In order to celebrate this event in a grand scale, they have finalized and made all arrangements to stage.
The Super Stars Super Concert Musical Extravaganza will be held on November 7, at the Nelum Pokuna theatre, Colombo at 6.30 p.m.
The Super Stars was extremely popular in the mid seventies and it spanned for almost two decades being the most popular band on stage as well on television. They were featured on the programme "Nandana Vindana" on Rupavahini channel and "Madu Rasanga" on ITN Networks which were the two most popular musical shows to be telecast then.
The band was originated by A. A. Perera, father of Indrani Perera, and the Three Sisters. From there onwards being extremely popular, Emest Soysal led the band and they performed in all parts of the Island. They were involved in recording of cassettes and film songs. During that era it was Singlanka who was instrumental in producing many cassettes of local artistes and they were fortunate to be one of the bands to direct music for many of those singers.
They were the only band to have four Music Directors namely Ernest Soysa, Sarath de Alwis, Upali Kannangara and Nesan Thiagarajah. The Super Stars were the first band to be invited twice overseas in 1975 to perform in Kuwait and Bahrain.
This concert is going to be one of the grandest events of this year and the show will feature of host of popular singers such as Sunil (Gypsies), Sohan (X-periments), Errol (Los Caberellos), Indrani (Three Sisters), Nalin (Marians), Coreen (Coreen and Co.) and Paul Fernando performing backed by an orchestra of about 10 musicians.
The original members of the Super Stars are Sarath de Alwis, Emest Soysa, Upali Kannangara, Maurice de Silva and Mahinda Silva will perform with the assistance of Tharinda Bandara, Rama (Srimath Chaminda), Asanka Jayawardena and Chanaka Senadeera.
