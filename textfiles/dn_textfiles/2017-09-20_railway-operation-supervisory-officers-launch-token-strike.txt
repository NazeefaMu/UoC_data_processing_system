Railway Operation Supervisory Officers launch token strike

The Alliance of the Railway Operation Supervisory Officers’ Union yesterday announced a 48-hour token strike beginning from today’s midnight.
The Union comprising Station Masters, Drivers and Guards decided to launch the token strike in protest of Salary and Cadre Commissions’ failure to implement the recommendations with regard to their salaries.
Alliance Convenor Lal Ariyarathna said the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry has made recommendations with regard to their salaries, but the Commission shows reluctance to implement the recommendations.
“This issue is dragging on since 2010. We have decided to launch the strike as our discussion with the commission failed this evening,” he said.
However, Ariyarathna said they are willing to give up their trade union action if the Secretary to the Prime Minister or the President intervenes to solve the issue.
Railway Drivers’ Union Secretary Indika Dodangoda said the authorities assured them relief measures instead of implementing the ministry recommendation.
“We have made the authorities aware of this trade union action two days in advance,” he said.
