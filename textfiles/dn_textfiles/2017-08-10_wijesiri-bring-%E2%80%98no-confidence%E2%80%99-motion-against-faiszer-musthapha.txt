Wijesiri to bring ‘no-confidence’ motion against Faiszer Musthapha

 
UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri today told Parliament that he intends to hand over a no-confidence motion against Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
The MP, observing that Minister Musthapha was repetitively absent in the House to reply to the questions about Uva Provincial Council Chief Minister Chamara Dasanayake, alleged that Musthapha has failed in his duties as the subject Minister.
“As an MP in the Yahapalana Government, I am ready to present a no-confidence motion against the Minister and I request the support of backbenchers to it. In this Yahapalana Government there is room for such actions against the ministers,” he said.
The MP pointed out he filed complaint at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) as the charges made against the Chief Minister have been proven from the audit inquiries.
“The Speaker, at many a times before, told the Minister in Parliament to pay attention to the allegations, but in vain. For some time now, the minister does not turn up in Parliament to answer to my questions,” he said.
MP Wijesiri had been raising question after question in Parliament for the last two years on allegations against the Uva Chief Minister over financial misappropriations and irregularities.
Minister Mustapha had constantly maintained the position that he could not interfere into provincial issues coming under devolved subjects.
