MR’s broken promise to Moon led to current impasse with UN

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted the fact that war crimes had been taken place in Sri Lanka and promised Ban Ki-moon on May 23, 2009 to hold an investigation but he did not do this, Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said .
He said Dr. Dayan Jayatilleke explained the method of conducting the investigation in his report. But nothing was done. “That is what ruined the cordial relations that existed between Sri Lanka and the UN, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the weekly cabinet press briefing held at the Government Information Department Auditorium, yesterday The Minister said the former President should have rejected the opportunity given to him to address the UN because he rejected all the reports released by the UN. The inaccurate decisions made by the former President, dragged the issue to its current position.
According to Dr. Senaratne, the word hybrid is nowhere and it will be a domestic mechanism which is to be set up to investigate war crimes.
The Hybrid Special Court is only a proposal included in the UNHRC Report and it is not final. The final decision will be made on the 30th. Even the US proposal does not contain a hybrid special court.
All leading countries such as China, India, Russia etc. support the domestic mechanism. Only countries such as Ireland oppose it.
Maybe recommendations will be made requesting Sri Lanka to obtain foreign expertise and technical assistance to implement the domestic mechanism. It is all right because even the former President appointed three foreign judges. It is clearly mentioned in the Paranagama Report. “We have to wait and see how the final proposal is being drafted.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that it will take around one and half years to conduct the local investigation and the duration can be extended if required. No new laws are needed to conduct the local investigations. So far no country had won a crusade against the UN.
“The only relief we have today is not signing the Rome Convention. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe did not sign it.
"It was me who opposed 13 - (thirteen minus) proposal of MR and halted it by fighting against it all alone. It minimized the damage,” he added.t at the event.
