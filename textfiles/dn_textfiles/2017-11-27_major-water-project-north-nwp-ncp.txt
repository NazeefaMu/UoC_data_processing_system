The first phase of a huge water management project was launched for farmers in the dry zone recently.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that it would provide water for farmers in the North Central, North and North Western Provinces. The project will benefit around 770,000 people in the Malwathuoya, Meeoya and Yanoya river basins. It will enhance water supply systems, boost environment friendly agriculture, establish community base rural water schemes, and decentralise drinking water projects.

The UN Development Program (UNDP) along with the Disaster Management Ministry, Agrarian Services Development and Agriculture Departments, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and National Community Water Supply Department will assist the project. Wanninayake said. Rs. 3,113 million will be invest to improve agriculture in the river basin areas, while rehabilitating 325 rural tanks, 30 cascade systems.
