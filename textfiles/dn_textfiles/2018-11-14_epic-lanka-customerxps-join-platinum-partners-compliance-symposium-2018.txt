Epic Lanka, CustomerXPs join as Platinum partners for Compliance Symposium 2018

Coinciding with the local banking industry’s progressive measures towards achieving a strong and cohesive compliance culture, Epic Technology Group and CustomerXPs Software stepped forward as Platinum sponsors for the Compliance Symposium 2018, Sri Lanka’s first and biggest compliance convention.
Organised by the Association of Compliance Officers of Bankers Sri Lanka (ACOB), the Compliance Symposium 2018 will take place at the Cinnamon Grand hotel on November 13. Senior representatives of Epic Lanka and CustomerXPs witnessed the landmark sponsorship as Epic Lanka Technologies Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Viraj Mudalige presented the sponsorship cheque to Sudarshana Jayasekaera, President ACOB.
“As Sri Lanka’s premier technology conglomerate, it is our distinct pleasure to join hands with Association of Compliance Officers of Bankers Sri Lanka in their efforts to host Sri Lanka’s inaugural compliance convention,” said Viraj Mudalige, MD/CEO of Epic Lanka Technology Group.
“Over the past few years, we have seen a number of manifestations of sophisticated money launderers across the globe that makes bankers work around the clock and re-think their strategy and execution to curb these attempts. Thus, compliance and corporate governance have become two important factors for banks and there has been an increase in investments on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and fraud prevention measures by these organizations to fortify their perimeter defenses.”
“As the biggest compliance convention of Sri Lanka, we believe that Compliance Symposium 2018 will be an ideal opportunity to bring together the best local and international minds together on a single platform and deliberate on the many challenges and opportunities facing banks and other stakeholders of the industry,” Mudalige added.
“The regulatory compliance landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. Besides domestic compliance mandates, there are several critical global mandates which financial institutions need to comply with. Advanced real-time, cross-channel fraud + AML/CFT technology solutions such as Clari5 use a human brain like approach to help banks stay compliant proactively as well as mitigate fraud risk. We are excited to be at the upcoming Compliance Symposium to share more details on how banks can radically change the way they address risk and compliance,” said Rivi Varghese, CEO, CustomerXPs.
The Association of Compliance Officers of Banks (ACOB) is an institution, which was established in 2010, with the intention of a building a forum to promote a common understanding among Compliance Officers on regulations as well as share experiences and knowledge across banks in building effective compliance systems and procedures.
The steps taken to form ACOB resonated positively when the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Financial Transactions Reporting Act were introduced, which required financial institutions to have in place a Compliance Officer who is responsible for establishing procedures and systems in respect of Know your Customer (KYC), customer due diligence, training, retention, reporting etc.
