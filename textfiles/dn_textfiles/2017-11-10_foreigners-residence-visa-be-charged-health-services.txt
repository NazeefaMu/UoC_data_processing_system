Foreigners on residence visa to be charged for health services

Health Ministry has proposed the Government to charge at least USD 50 from all foreign nationals who visit Sri Lanka on working / residence visa. The charge is for the health services provided for them, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday he said that under the current law no foreign national is eligible to receive free health services offered by the Sri Lankan Government for all Sri Lankan citizens.
Only Sri Lankan citizens are eligible to receive the free health service.According to Dr. Bandara, at the moment around 60,000 foreign nationals arrive in Sri Lanka on working / residence visa and they stay in Sri Lanka at least for six months.
They obtain various health services from Sri Lankan hospitals during their stay in Sri Lanka. The new charge will be an additional income for Sri Lanka. These foreign nationals also pose a threat to Si Lankan health sector because there is a possibility of them bringing in certain diseases such as malaria which has already been eliminated from Sri Lanka, Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
