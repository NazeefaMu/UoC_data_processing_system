ROYAL INVITEES!

The royal wedding is in just two months, and is set to be one of the most famous events of 2018 - but who exactly will be attending Windsor Castle in May?
Without a shadow of doubt, Britain’s Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle will be one of the major news events of the year – but who’s going to be on the guest list?
The forthcoming royal nuptials are sure to be a star-studded affair, with the couple boasting a host of high-profile pals. Here’s what we know so far about who could be attending the big day.

The couple released their official engagement photos shortly before Christmas
The couple have been keeping tight lipped about the guest list – so beyond knowing that the likes of The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William will be invited, there haven’t been many confirmed names.
The invitations were printed on March 22, suggesting that the guest list has now been finalised.
One thing seems certain, though – there won’t be as many wedding guests as when Harry’s big brother tied the knot in 2011.
This is because Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding took place at Westminster Abbey, with 1,900 guests – St George’s chapel, Harry and Meghan’s venue, has a capacity of 800 people.
They will also invite 2,640 members of the public on the day including 1,200 people, who have demonstrated strong leadership in their communities.
Around 600 people have been invited to the actual service which takes place at St George’s Chapel on May 19.
Kate and Wills had their fair share of celebrity guests, such as the Beckhams, Sir Elton John and the late Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.
Also likely to be on Harry’s invite list are Tom Inskip and Guy Pelley. Harry may also want to invite Army comrades who he served alongside in Afghanistan.
According to the Daily Star, Meghan’s older half-siblings, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Markle, will not be invited on the big day.
Her nephew, Thomas Jr’s son Tyler Dooley, and his mum Tracey Dooley, are also rumoured to have been left off the guest list.
Meghan’s mum, Doria Ragland, is said to be attending as is her father, Thomas Markle Sr.
The shy 73-year-old, who lives a reclusive life in Mexico, is rumoured to be walking Meghan down the aisle.
This is despite reports that he is extremely shy and shuns the limelight, but is said to be willing to persevere as he and Meghan have a close relationship.

While we previously revealed that a fleet of glamorous pals including tennis ace Serena Williams, Indian actress Priyanka Chopra, stylist Jessica Mulroney and Made In Chelsea’s Millie Mackintosh could be among Meghan’s bridesmaids.
Protocol normally means that royal brides only have adult bridesmaids, although Kate’s sister Pippa Middleton was an obvious exception to this rule.
At the very least, we’d expect to see a few of Meghan’s mates as guests at the wedding – as well as fashion designer Misha Nonoo, who’s thought to be the woman who set her and Harry up.
It’s inevitable that the wedding will be attended by a host of foreign royals, as well as significant political figures from across the Commonwealth.
And with an American marrying into the British royal family for the first time, there has been speculation over whether Donald Trump will receive an invite.
One man who seemed determined to get an invite is Anthony Joshua, one of Harry’s guests during his special Radio 4 appearance – and he wants a starring role.
It has also been reported that two of Prince Harry’s former flames, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy have both scored invites.
The Sun has revealed that Elton John would be attending the Royal wedding.
The Rocket Man has cancelled two Las Vegas gigs on the same May weekend as the Royal nuptials, which leaves him free to attend or even perform.
The singer was a close friend of Harry’s mum Princess Diana and was among a handful of celebrities to attend Prince William and Kate Middleton’s wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011.
It was the same venue where he famously sang Candle in the Wind at Diana’s funeral in 1997.
Mel B was speaking on US talk show The Real when she confirmed that all five of the Spice Girls were invited to the wedding.
Unfortunately, Scary Spice did not budge when she was asked about the invitation or other details around the wedding.
Mel sternly said: “I’m not saying any more,” but when she was asked whether they would perform or not, she grinned and looked down at her hands.
As the audience clapped Mel laughed and said: “I’m going to be fired!”
It was reported that the couple were keen to invite Barack Obama to the wedding rather than Trump - which had all the makings of a sticky political situation.
The 33-year-old prince has become good friends with Barack Obama and his wife Michelle since bonding with them during the Invictus Games.
But government mandarins had pleaded with the couple to change their minds as Britain’s relations with Trump’s White House sunk to their lowest ebb since his election last year.
And it seems they have had a rethink, as a source told the Daily Mail: “President Trump will not be invited because the wedding will be for friends and family only.
“It won’t be a state occasion. If Mr Obama was invited, the invitation could look like a snub to Mr Trump, and His Royal Highness would not wish to cause a diplomatic row.”
The Sun revealed that the Government was urging the prince not to invite the Obamas, at risk of worsening tensions with the current administration.
The prince was quizzed on the possibility of inviting the Obamas when he guest-edited BBC Radio 4’s Today programme just after Christmas.
However, he refused to be drawn on the matter, insisting: “I don’t know about that, we haven’t even put the invites or the guest list together yet.”
