President creating an environment free of corruption - Faiszer

President Maithripala Sirisena was creating an environment in the country that was free of corruption and he was a leader who rejected corruption during the period of this government as well as the previous one, said Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha.
The Minister said the statement made by some requesting people to vote for him to make him President and not to vote for the party he represents this time around is very silly. If he is a good person then the party he represents should also be good and we should vote for this party.
He was speaking at a series of rallies addressed by former President Chandrika Bandaranaike in the Attanagalla electorate to garner support for the candidates contesting from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, on Tuesday.
More than 99% of the Muslim community voted for Maithripala Sirisena during the last presidential election and Muslims should vote for the Sri Lanka Freedom Party this time around too.
“The President's hand should be strengthened for the sake of the Muslim community,” the Minister said. “You can remember how the Muslims had been beaten up and had been subjected to abuse. Whatever any one may say today, the Muslims are able to practise their religion in a peaceful environment.”
Some were traditional UNP supporters, he said, but we should now begin a new era by voting for the SLFP.
Dring a visit to the Eastern Province, the Minister said, “Some others are wearing a ‘Muslim’ label and doing politics and we are well aware of their brand of politics which is purely business. Those leaders had always been selling the Muslim community and all Muslims should really be aligned with the majority parties.”
He went on to say that the Muslim Congress has lost the confidence reposed on them by the Muslim community. Now the Muslim Congress has transformed into a three-wheeler party. After the death of Ashroff, Ferial Ashroff was chased out by leader Hakeem and those like Rishad, Ammer Ali, Najeeth Majith Athaula, Basheer, and Hassan, were all kicked out. This time the people will kick out the Muslim Congress at this election.
The Minister said, “I am always with the Muslim community, but as Sri Lankans we should be together with Maithripala Sirisena and I am ready to give leadership to the Muslim community in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.”
