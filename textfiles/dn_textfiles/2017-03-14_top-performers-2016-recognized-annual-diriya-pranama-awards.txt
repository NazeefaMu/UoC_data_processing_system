Top Performers of 2016 Recognized at annual Diriya Pranama Awards

Unilever Sri Lanka’s Project Saubhagya, a longstanding symbol of women’s empowerment in the country’s rural areas, awarded its top performers at the annual Diriya Pranama Awards held recently at the Cinnamon Grand. The awards celebrate the top 100 entrepreneurs of Unilever’s Saubhagya Channel across the island.
Currently in its 14th year, Project Saubhagya is Unilever Sri Lanka’s key initiative under its Unilever Sustainable Living Plan pillar of providing ‘opportunities for women’.
This unique project empowers women through entrepreneurialism, helping rural women become direct-to-home ambassadors of Unilever brands. As a testament to the success of the programme and the capabilities of rural women, this year’s top entrepreneur for the third consecutive year was R. N. Ranjani of the Monaragala district.
The chief guest of the event was veteran actress Malini Fonseka. Also in attendance as special guests were Neil Hapuhinna Director General, Samurdhi Authority and J.K. Pathmasiri Director Planning, Samurdhi Authority.
“Unilever Sri Lanka is deeply invested in the future of Sri Lanka and we strongly believe that to reach our nation’s ultimate potential, women must have a seat at the table when determining the path forward., said Unilever Sri Lanka’s Customer Development Director, Aruna Mawilmada.
Project Saubhagya stems from a deep understanding of the difficulties faced by women in developing markets and the integral part they play within Unilever’s own distribution network. It was implemented in 2003 with five brave women entrepreneurs that took the first step towards economic inclusion and the programme has progressed from there to more than 5,000 Saubhagya entrepreneurs today.
The top 100 Saubhagya entrepreneurs who were recognized at the Diriya Pranama Awards with the event’s chief guest, Malini Fonseka and representatives of the Samurdhi Authority, Unilever Sri Lanka and its partners.
