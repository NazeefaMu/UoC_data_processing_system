ACUET wants vehicle permits withdrawn

 
The All Ceylon Union of English Teachers has made an urgent appeal to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe asking that the circular prohibiting vehicle permits be withdrawn.
The Union's Secretary General Stanley Perera pointed out that some sections of the Government are in trouble because of the withdrawing of vehicle permits. He expressed the union's confidence that the Prime Minister would take positive action in their regard, together with the Minister of Finance to grant them relief.
