Windsurfing Championship

A windsurfing championship will be conducted in Marawila later this year with the intention of promoting windsurfing in the area. It is being organized by the Asian German Sports Exchange Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Tourism.
Surfers from Britain, Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Finland and Russia are likely to take part in this event.
Windsurfing has been confined to Bentota, Hikkaduwa, Arugam Bay and Negombo so far and by holding this championship they hope to promote the sports in the Marawila and Chilaw areas. It will also help to boost tourism as the competitors from Europe will be accompanied by their family members and friends when they visit the country to take part in the championship.
