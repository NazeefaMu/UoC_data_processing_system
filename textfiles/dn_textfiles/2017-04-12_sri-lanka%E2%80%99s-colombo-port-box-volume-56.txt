Sri Lanka’s Colombo port box volume up 5.6%

Throughput at Sri Lanka’s Colombo port rose 5.6 percent to 484,866 twenty foot equivalent units (TEUs) in January 2017 from a year earlier, with transhipment growing 4.2 percent, official data shows. Domestic container volumes also rose 9.1 percent to 116,746 TEUs. Transhipment volumes rose 4.2 percent from a year earlier to 362,451 twenty foot equivalent units in January 2017 despite a fall in ship calls, Central Bank data shows.
Sri Lanka’s deep draught terminals led by Chinese-owned Colombo International Container Terminal have been attracting larger box ships, while traffic to older, smaller terminals has reduced. Inclusive of re-stowing, total containers handled by Colombo rose 5.6 percent to 484,866 TEUs in January 2017 from a year earlier. Colombo’s throughput grew 10.6 percent in 2016 to 5.74 million TEUs in 2016, with transhipment up 12 percent to 4.355 million TEUs. (ECONOMYNEXT )
