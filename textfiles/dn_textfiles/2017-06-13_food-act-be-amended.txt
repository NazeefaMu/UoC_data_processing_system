Food Act to be amended

The Health Ministry has decided to amend the Food Act Number 26 or 1980. Since 1980, producing, and selling foods, food technology and consuming patterns of the Sri Lankans were changed, and the need for amending the Food Act is felt taking into account the changes, Health Ministry sources said.
The Health Ministry now accepts public views on amending the Act, the sources said.
The public can submit their views to the Director, Environmental/Professional and Food Health, Food Control Administration Unit, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry, 7th Floor, No. 464, T.B.Jayah Mawatha or email to [email protected], the sources said.
The Food Act was introduced to regulate and control the manufacture, importation, sale and distribution of food, to establish a Food Advisory Committee, to repeal the Food and Drugs Act of 1949, and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
The Act came into force on February 1, 1981, the sources said.
