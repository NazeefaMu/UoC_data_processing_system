Blueprint for Western province waste management

Meethotamulla garbage dump to become urban forest:
Additional 1,300 MT of waste daily by 2030:
Cabinet approval has been granted for a long term waste management plan for the Western Province as the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry estimates that an additional 1,300 MT of waste would be added daily by 2030.
The Megapolis Plan which includes the Colombo Port City will have a greater catastrophe than the present if waste is not managed.
In the short term, the ministry has proposed to take initiatives to stabilise the disturbed landfill at Meethotamulla in the next five months and to eventually develop it into an urban forest.
The long term proposals include granting powers to the Central Environmental Authority to issue environmental approvals, encourage the public to dispose of segregated waste and to transport only segregated waste to designated centres, start waste disposal and processing centres in Local Government authorities where more than 50,000 families reside in, commence a project to generate electricity from waste, obtain project proposals from other countries through their foreign missions regarding waste disposal projects in Aruwakkaru, Puttalam, transfer the land required for the construction of a Transfer Station at Kelaniya from the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.
