Carlo’s ire

Maverick academic Prof. Carlo Fonseka was in combative mood the other day after visiting a medical faculty student leader, now in remand, over damage caused to public property, during an anti-SAITM demonstration. He (Fonseka) said he will be in the forefront in any campaign to overthrow the present government over its privatisation of medical education and all other ills. The diminutive octogenarian who is well known for his colourful prose and witty remarks was in his element, responding to journalists outside the remand prison, wading into the government with uncharacteristic gusto.
This was in quite contrast to the genial and humble former chief of the Sri Lanka Medical Council when he was visited by President Maithripala, recently, while recovering from an ailment, at hospital. On that occasion, in the presence of head of state, the professor was the epitome of politeness and decorum, responding to the inquiries of the President with a humbleness that belied the gung ho figure who was breathing fire and brimstone outside the remand prison.
When reminded by a journalist that the SAITM did not originate under the Yahapalanaya government but dated back to the days of Mahinda Rajapaksa and as to why, as President of the SLMC, he remained mum at the time, the good professor attempted to explain this away by playing with phonetics, in characteristic fashion. He said when SAITM was given the green light by him, as head of the SLMC, the “M” (in SAITM) denoted management. It was only subsequently was he to learn that this “M” indeed stood for Medicine. He promptly wrote to former President Rajapaksa informing him of the dire consequences if the institution was allowed to continue. This was by way of an answer to a journalist who queried if he feared the Rajapaksas.
We are not aware of any protests or combative posture adapted by the good professor from 2012 (when he sent the letter to MR) until the change of government in 2015. Neither was there even a whimper of protest by Prof. Carlo Fonseka when a private medical facility was established at the Kotalawela Defence Academy, which came under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
As a reputed and respected academic, it is incumbent on the likes of Prof. Fonseka to ensure that academic activities in the universities continue without interruption and that they should do everything in their power to see to it that students are not used as pawns in political games, as is the case with the current SAITM imbroglio, that is being fanned by the GMOA, which has the full backing of Prof. Fonseka. The good professor is well aware that there is a shortfall of some 10,000 doctors in the country and that every effort should be made to bridge this gap if we are to sustain the free health service and combat the rapid spread of disease.
Instead, we have a scenario where academics like Prof. Fonseka egging on the students to take to the streets by their combative speeches and aligning with organisations like the GMOA whose members make no bones about where and with whom their political sympathies lay. Does Prof. Fonseka truly believe that the SAITM issue will be resolved, were the Rajapaksas to come to power, after remaining silent for four long years, passing on the baby to the Yahapalanaya government? Rajapaksa for his part says that he handed over the letter sent to him by Prof. Fonseka to the minister concerned. Why pray, was the matter allowed to end there, with Rajapaksa not pursuing any follow up action? Does not this alone indicate that Mahinda Rajapaksa had no intention to move in the matter just like MR and co. are bound to leave matters to lie, were they to return to power?
It is time that Prof. Fonseka act in exemplary fashion and refrain from goading students to abandon their academic activities, and, above all, steer clear from making political statements that are not in keeping with his high reputation. The government has another three full years to complete and the public will decide, at the end of that period, if the Yahapalanaya regime is fit to continue or not. The 84-year-old Prof. Carlo Fonseka is well advised, therefore, to enjoy his retirement and not involve himself in projects to topple governments or be in the forefront of protests to achieve this end, in the evening of his life.
MR's no show
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa says although he received an invitation to attend the 66th anniversary celebrations of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, he was unable to attend the event since he received the invitation at the eleventh hour and was not in position to cancel his ‘busy schedule'. We thought that Rajapaksa did not need an invitation to attend events associated with his party of which he is patron. It was only the other day that Rajapaksa claimed that he was still the chairman of the SLFP and the present incumbent is holding that post by default. Why wait for invitations when he is a true blue, as he often emphasizes?
