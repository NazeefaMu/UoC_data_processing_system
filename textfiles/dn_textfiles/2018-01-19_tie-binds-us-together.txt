Understanding national reconciliation:
The tie that binds us together

January 8 -14 was declared a National Integration Week by the Government. It was supposed to drive home the imperative need for national reconciliation for development. However, except for reported speeches of the President and the Prime Minister and isolated references by few religious dignitaries in their sermons nothing much was observed. Even the media stood aloof.
Our Honourable Members of Parliament thought it’s better to engage in fisticuffs and exchange un-parliamentary compliments rather than think of reconciliation. Perhaps the politicians were more concerned with electoral battles for local (or national?) governance. In the context of elections most of them were promoting not national reconciliation or integration but their conflict and separation.
What is reconciliation? Cambridge Dictionary defines it as “a situation in which two people or groups of people become friendly again after they have argued”. With a history of several decades of distrust, intolerance and prejudice between principal national communities inhabiting the country and the ugly experience of a fratricidal war which lasted almost three decades, it is obvious that Sri Lanka is in dire need of a process that could restore trust, tolerance and fraternal relations between all its communities.
Institutional structures
Though everybody acknowledges the latter objectives quite the contrary is observed in practice in numerous instances, established customs and certain institutional structures and among various groups of people.
Reconciliation is one of building trust among people as members of a common species –humans, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, politics and cultural beliefs. It is unity in diversity that should be strived for and defended. It is such unity in diversity that is abundant in inanimate nature as well as in fauna and flora. Should humans, as part of nature, be different?
Trust could be built only on the basis of recognizing the equality of reconciling parties. Hence, notions and practices of superiority or dominance of one over others is inimical in building trust. Similarly all parties should have equal rights. There can be no privileged parties.
In the case of nations and nationalities a sine qua non for reconciliation is the acceptance of their equality. There cannot be superior and inferior nations and nationalities. Similarly all languages and cultures should have equal status.
Equality also implies equal access to state services and opportunities for development. The ideal to be ensured is equity or social justice, which means that historical wrongs have to be corrected and special efforts should be made to remove anomalies in the provision of access to and opportunities for services.
Actually, national reconciliation is a process that includes among others seeking the truth of what happened, identifying and ensuring justice to those victimized by conflict including reparations, guaranteeing rights of all and ensuring non-recurrence of wrongs through institutional reforms.
Needless to say that that this process cannot be achieved overnight. As a preliminary there should be an attitudinal change amongst the public. Marx used to say that an idea would become a material force once it is grasped by the people. Hence, the necessity of an awareness campaign amongst the masses about the need and benefits of national reconciliation.
Administrative procedures
Reconciliation is not only a political necessity but also an economic necessity for national discord and strife would destabilize the country and no development would be possible. Investors would be reluctant to come to Sri Lanka. It would also lead to internal disturbances including the breakdown of industrial peace.
One could also begin with confidence building measures such as ending discriminatory practices, improvements to administrative procedures, enhancing accountability of state institutions to improve the atmosphere for further progress.
For example, such measures could include strengthening the civil administration in the North and East, restoration of the powers of provincial and local government representative bodies, return of private lands taken over and presently occupied by security forces to their former owners, re-settlement of the displaced and provision of means of livelihood to them, ascertaining the fate of the disappeared, release of prisoners of conscience held under detention for long, ending the culture of impunity for miscreants and strengthening the rule of law. The annulment of repressive legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act and certain Emergency Regulations are also tasks to be carried out in the short-term.
None of these measures involve any threat to the security of the state or the territorial integrity of the country as alleged by opponents of national integration.
On the foundations laid by the confidence building measures one could advance further towards sharing of power by presently estranged national communities in various fora including representative bodies. Such power sharing should include not only devolution of power to the peripheries but also power-sharing at the center. The latter would act as a deterrent to divisive or separatist tendencies as it would give the formerly marginalized a stake in central power.
However, the final objective of national reconciliation is the revision of the Fundamental Law of the land or the Constitution to guarantee a society in which all communities could live in peace and harmony with dignity and equality, participating in economic, social and cultural development of the country.
