Arjuna Ranatunga began trend of winning title twice

The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, during its four decades of cherished history, has produced top cricketers with different talent, abilities and from all parts of the country.
Winning the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title is the dream of every schoolboy cricketer, considering the milestone achievements of the past winners. Former Sri Lanka, NCC and Royal captain turned ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle remains the maiden recipient of that coveted title. But it was Sri Lanka’s world cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga who had the honour of winning the mega title twice for the first time in its history.
Besides Ranatunga, five other schoolboy cricketers have achieved this rare honour of winning the coveted award on two occasions – all five of them in successive years while Ranatunga’s feat had been achieved after a two years’ gap.
The left-handed middle order bat, as an outstsanding schoolboy cricketer from Ananda College, first won the prestigious title only in its second awards ceremony in 1980 after Madugalle. Two years later Ranatunga, as the captain of the Ananda first X1 team, won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer Award once again in 1982.
It was the beginning of Ranatunga’s illustrious career. Subsequently, he had the rare honour of leading the Sri Lanka national team which emerged champions at the 1996 World Cup tournament, beating Australia by seven wickets in the final play in Lahore on March 17, 1996.
However, former Nalanda captain turned ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama became the first to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in successive years. He performed this rare feat way back in 1983 and 1984. Since making his Sri Lanka debut as a proud product of Nalanda, Mahanama cemented his place in the national team in next to no time.
Apart from Ranatunga and Mahanama, only Thilan Samaraweera (1994 and 1995), Lahiru Peiris (2004 and 2005), Bhanuka Rajapaksa (2010 and 2011) and Charith Asalanka (2015 and 2016) have won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title two times each. The last of those six rare occasions was witnessed last year when Richmond’s emerging hero Asanka won back to back titles.
Sri Lanka’s first and the most prestigious school cricket award show will be held for the 39th consecutive year, continuing the rich traditions maintained by the country’s flagship English newspaper, the Sunday Observer. Ever since its inception in 1979, at a time there had been no formal inter-school Under-19 tournament or a platform to showcase the most outstanding schoolboy cricketer, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event has unveiled many outstanding Sri Lanka cricketers who had made their presence felt in the international arena.
Joining the star parade in 1985 through the contest was reliable top order batsman Asanka Gurusinha, who could be easily rated as one of the most reliable one drop batsman that Sri |Lanka has ever produced. In fact, Gurusinha became the second Nalandian to win the title after Mahanama.
While the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest continues to maintain its rich traditions, a couple of similar awards ceremonies have emerged in recent title. That alone is a great achievement for the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest as the game would be the eventual winner – giving more opportunities and awards to outstanding schoolboy cricketers. It is heartening to see others following the Sunday Observer’s great initiative the country’s budding schoolboy cricketers who would ultimately benefit from all these shows.
The Mother of all Shows - the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest continues for the 39th time, breaking new ground and a talent search for tomorrow’s cricketing heroes.
The prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Mega Awards ceremony has gone from strength to strength, since its inception way back in 1979. It has taken a giant leap forward especially during the last decade, largely due to the financial backing of the Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel.
