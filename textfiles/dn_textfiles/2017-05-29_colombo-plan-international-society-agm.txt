Colombo Plan International Society AGM

The 32nd AGM of the Colombo Plan International Society 2017 was ceremonially held recently at the Sasakawa Cultural Centre, Colombo.
The Colombo Plan was inaugurated on July 1, 1951. This great idea was translated into a reality by a group of eight Commonwealth nations namely Australia, Britain, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa.
The aim was co-operative economic development in South East Asia. In fact the idea was conceived 18 months earlier at the Conference of Foreign Affairs held in Colombo in 1950.
The Ceylon delegation was of the view that through this plan the underprivileged would be helped by the countries with wealth.
This would also help to bring a closer understanding and a greater appreciation of culture and civilization of the developing countries. This also strengthens human understanding and fellowship.
The Colombo Plan International Society (CPIS) was formed by the Colombo Plan Scholars who participated in varied fields of education in the donor countries and on their return this society was formed in 1972 and continued till 1978. After a lapse of six years it was revived in 1984. The society of has contributed to the nation in the form of workshop, seminars and awareness programmes in the rural areas.
These were conducted with the assistance and co-operation of the Colombo Plan Secretariat, the Police, anti narcotic division and District Health Department, Kalutara.
