‘Girl child egged on for future leadership’

The Women and Child Affairs Ministry in collaboration with other institutions under the purview of the ministry, UN and NGOs have taken measures to minimize gender-specific challenges faced by women to encourage them to become tomorrow’s leaders, Women and Child Affairs Ministry Secretary Ashoka Alawatte said.
She was addressing the national ceremony to commemorate the International Day of the Girl Child at the BMICH, recently.
The Ministry Secretary stressed the importance of ensuring rights of young women.
He added that some of them have lost their rights and freedom due to religious and cultural barriers.
Child Protection Authority Chairman H. M. Abayaratne said young women should practice hard work to achieve their goals.
He stressed the importance of being disciplined, self-confident, and dedicated young women.
In 2012, the United Nations passed a resolution that named October 11 as a day when the global community stops and considers the issues impacting the lives of girls around the world.
The aims of the day are to highlight the needs and challenges girls face, while promoting girls’ empowerment and the fulfillment of their rights.
