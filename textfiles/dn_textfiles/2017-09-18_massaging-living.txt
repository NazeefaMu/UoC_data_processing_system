Massaging for a living

The city of Colombo and suburbs have an ever increasing number of outlets advertising massages in spas etc. A phenomenon found in other cities too. Some are open 24 hours. Majority are staffed with women. Most from out of town.
Massage therapist certification
Massage therapy certification is a demonstration of your expertise as a massage therapist. Certification should be a requirement before becoming a qualified masseuse, legally practicing massage therapist.
Broadly a therapist should know about
• Knowledge of body systems
• Anatomy
• Physiology
• Kinesiology
• Pathology
• Business knowledge and ethics.
Facets insufficiently developed in Sri Lanka.
Another side of the profession
Most often currently, outlets offering services are sweat shops, exploiting women with rudimentary notions of massaging, licensed as spas offering Ayurvedic services. It’s an essential service if engaged in professionally. However, due to a variety of reasons clients look for special services unrelated to conventional massages. Those who can deliver earn through tips. A vital need for women and some men desperate to earn a living. Since special services are deemed illegal, they are fare game to periodic police raids, exploitation, blackmail, trafficking and finally life threatening diseases if undetected or treated early. Some clients promise the moon and use them for sexual gratification and dump them after awhile. Once in this vicious existence most in it have to lie eternally to family, friends alike. If found out their entire character is denigrated. Some become outcasts hating men etc. Others may seek solace in different forms of substances.
Story of Renuka
Renuka is a thirty plus mother, one of three siblings from a farming family in a village in the North Western Province. The patriarch an extraordinarily tough farmer who fell ill and was treated for months for Chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology (CKDU) when in fact a massive tumor was growing in his stomach. Two of Renuka’s siblings are in the teaching and domestic worker profession. The latter spending many years working in Cyprus. The third with a family, is engaged in odd jobs. Renuka has three female children with the eldest a ‘garment’ worker whilst two are still in their teens. She is in her second unhappy marriage.
The current husband who is older to her has no steady means of income. To support the family she has worked in Jordan, Lebanon etc. Currently she works in massage clinics. She has the aptitude to do the work of two men and is a very enterprising, hard working woman with the genes of her father. Due to long periods away from the family, her husband terms her a prostitute, has beaten her parents resulting in hospitalisation, the children are prevented by him from seeing her parents and he has threatened to kill her if she comes home. When she calls to talk to her children the father prohibits them from answering the calls. However, on every occasion he or the children need money they answer and she sends cash home. This includes by taking Samurdhi and SANASA loans and loans in the informal sector with high interest rates. Since the father’s malignant tumor was diagnosed, an operation was conducted at Maharagama to remove it. Expenses have been high. She has been the sole source and not her siblings with greater resources. Her last place of work, a long standing outfit had several girls known to each other through family connections.
Each placement a result of this extended network including women agents charging placement fees procuring rural women for jobs in massage ‘clinics’. When they run afoul of each other word is sent back to families destroying their character. Renuka had to leave under such circumstances recently and immediately found accommodation in a ‘boarding’ with ‘nangis’ in their twenties working nights at a ‘ayurvedic’ massage clinic in Colombo 3.
Clients choose the woman by their looks and are charged Rs.1,300/. It’s a variation of the flesh trade. She is sometimes able to earn 3,000-4,000 rupees on a good night providing ‘special’ massages where the ayurvedic ‘doctor’ provides the tissues etc sometimes at 2 am.
The ‘nangis’ with whom she is staying has a ‘wheel’ driving ‘husband’ who drops them at night and picks them in the morning after 5 am.
This writer classifies the ‘wheel’ driver, a pimp selling ‘his so called wife’.
Renuka works to pay loans, meet family expenses, her mother believes she works in a ‘garment’ or has chosen to lie too and no one in the family really worries as long as Renuka provides the cash required on demand.
She lies profusely and seems unable to see what’s in store for her next or too far gone to come out even though a whole new safe accommodation and decent job option was presented to her. She is in poor health.
She has given up on regaining her reputation.
It’s a sorry, sordid tale.
The future fortunes of her three daughters is unknown for now. I have no doubt this story with variations is the narrative of so many young and older girls and women in a fast developing industry where quick bucks are there to be made. Can we improve their lot?
What does a massage therapist do?
A massage therapist job description at its most basic involves using the hands and fingers to relive stress and pain built up in patient’s muscles.
People seek out massage therapists for many different reasons. For example, an athlete may need a massage therapist to help them recover from a serious injury. On the other hand, some people just find massage to be a relaxing activity, or might hire a massage therapist when they are under stress.
Some of the specific duties of a massage therapist include:
• Meeting with patients and reviewing their individual needs and medical history
• Analyzing patients’ sore muscle areas and identifying solutions to correct their problems
• Using the hands, arms and fingers to relieve areas of stress and pain
• Providing patients with information about how they can care for their muscles on a daily basis
These are just a few of the basics of the massage therapist job description. The specific massage therapist job description will depend on the work environment and whether or not you specialize in a certain massage.
Specialized massage therapist job description
A specialized massage therapist job description usually involves specializing in a specific massage technique, called a modality. Some of these modalities include:
• Deep-tissue massage
