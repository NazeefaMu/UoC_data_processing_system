Development work nears completion

The construction work of the Addalaichenai Fathima Islamic College concrete road is nearing completion.
Industry and Commerce Minister and All-Ceylon Makkal Congress Political Party Leader Rishad Bathiudeen has allocated Rs. 3.5 million for the development project at the request of All-Ceylon Makkal Congress past General Election Candidate A. C. M. Sameer.
This road, which has not been repaired for a long time, has large pot holes which turn into muddy puddles on rainy days, inconveniencing motorist and pedestrians.
Affected villagers urge authorities to take steps to construct the dilapidated Fathima Islamic College road. Minister Rishad Bathiudeen took action immediately for the renovation.
Thousands of farmer families are benefited by this road-development project.
