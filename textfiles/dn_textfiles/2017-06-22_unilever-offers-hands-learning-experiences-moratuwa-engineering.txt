Unilever offers hands-on learning experiences to Moratuwa Engineering Undergrads

Unilever Sri Lanka, recently marked the completion of its inaugural LEaD (Learn, Explore, Develop) training programme at their head office.
The event saw 18 second year engineering undergraduate students from the University of Moratuwa graduate from the seven month program which was launched in October2016.
Unilever embarked on this initiativewith the aim of ensuring that the nation’s future engineers are able to meet the high global standards brought on by rapid development and shifting technology landscapes. Within this framework one main area of focus was soft skills which were developed to meet corporate expectations.
The programme exposed candidates to the inner workings of the Unilever supply chain where they learned about the FMCG giant through its various processes, explored the factories and were able to develop their careers through formal training. Applications for positions in the program are called for each year on the Unilever Careers’ Facebook page.
Once enrolled, candidates needed to commit two half days or one full day each month to participate in interactive learning sessions. Managers from Unilever were assigned to mentor individual students through the course of the programme.
“We are happy that our undergraduates were able to receive firsthand experience from a company like Unilever which has a wealth of knowledge and expertise from across the globe.
These lessons will be invaluable in shaping their young minds and help them determine their future. They are now armed with a firmer understanding of the industry and a set of experiences that will set them apartfrom their peers in the job market,” said Nihal Wijeyewickrema, Director - Industrial Training Division, University of Moratuwa.
“A ready talent pool is at the core of our successful Supply Chain and we at Unilever want to ensure that it stays that way. With the LEaD program, we have gone the extra mile to create that talent pool by constantly nurturing the resources at an early stage. By opening our business to these undergraduates, we are providing them with practical experience to supplement their theoretical knowledge,” said NomanLutfi, Supply Chain Director, Unilever Sri Lanka.
This latest programme is in keeping with Unilever’s HR strategy of enabling opportunities for undergraduates. Similar programs include the Leadership Internship Programme and Unilever Sparks, both of which empowered the business leaders of tomorrow by giving them firsthand corporate experience at a renowned multinational.
Unilever Sri Lanka is one of the largest FMCG companies in Sri Lanka, with 30 market leading brands in categories such as Home Care, Personal Care and Foods.
