New Year messages
‘Promote unity, peace, brotherhood’

May unity, peace and brotherhood strengthen between all communities while health, wealth and prosperity increase, stated Malwatta Chapter Anunayake Thera Most Ven. Niyangoda Vijithasiri Thera.
The Thera, in his message for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, said that the New Year is celebrated according to Sinhala and Tamil traditions. The transition of the Sun from the House of Pisces to the House of Aries marks the beginning of Sinhala and Tamil New Year, celebrated on April 14. Both the Sinhalese and Tamils celebrate the event and participate in New Year rituals in a festive mood.
The Thera said all must practice these age-old rituals and customs with an understanding of their importance. The Thera also observed that the majority of the nation, the Sinhalese, have to act with great responsibility and called for unity between ethnicities and wished all a prosperous New Year.
