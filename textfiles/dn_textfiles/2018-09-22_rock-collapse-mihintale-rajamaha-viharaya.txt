Rock collapse at Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya

A giant rock located in the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya had collapsed around 7.45 a.m on Thursday (20).
Mihintale Dhamma Rathana Thera said the rock had fallen down soon after the morning buddha pooja and there was no damage to buildings or pilgrims present. The rock, which was located between the Samadhi Buddha statue and the shrine room is said to be very old. The Thera said Archaeological Department officials need to pay more attention to ensure that sacred sites are protected.
