Police bust heroin racket in Galewela

Galewela Police busted a heroin distribution racket from Colombo to Jaffna on Tuesday.
They arrested a suspect named Keshamoorthy Kismeprasath with 25.240 grammes of heroin in his possession near the Galewela town around 3 pm.
Investigation revealed that the suspect is hired by a drug kingpin whose modus operandi had been to provide some heroin for consumption by the suspect and then handover a parcel of drugs to him and put him in a bus from Colombo to Jaffna.
When he arrives in Jaffna the kingpin based in Colombo contacts him on his mobile and instructs him to handover the parcel to a certain individual in Jaffna. That individual after taking over the parcel offers some heroin for his consumption and gets him to board a bus on the return trip to Colombo.
The racket had flourished without detection for a considerable period. Galewela Police OIC acting on information had tracked him for a considerable period and arrested him in Galewela from where he had disembarked from the bus realising that he had forgotten to bring his mobile phone.
The suspect was produced before the Galewela magistrate and a detention order was obtained for further investigtions.
