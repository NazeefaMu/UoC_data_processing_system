German TT team  to tour Sri Lanka

 A 43 member Table Tennis Team from Wuppertal, West Germany under the leadership of Christoph Team will tour Sri Lanka in March 2018. A series of matches are planned, including a game in Kandy with Lokubandara Dissanayake showing interest in hosting the German Table Tennis Teams for an encounter.
This will be a boost for Kandy District since most of the matches will be conducted in Marawila in the Jens Baudisch Indoor Stadium, which is the headquarters of AGSEP.
Ms. Jana Pirlein, a German Intern for AGSEP, who will be in Sri Lanka until August 2017 will be coordinating the German Team's visit.
In the 90's till 2004 the Sri Lanka German Sports Exchange Program was very vibrant and over 2,000 German Table Tennis players visited Sri Lanka during this period and the Sri Lanka National Teams took part in reciprocal visits to Germany more than 12 times. The CEO of AGSEP in Sri Lanka Chandana Perera is organising the tour.
