Point of view
Share markets fell ~75 points during the first week of 2017, as last month’s gloomy sentiment continued to predominate yet again this week.
The ~70 point drop on Monday and Tuesday dragged the ASPI down to a ~ 9 month low with foreign selling (particularly in Index-heavy-weight JKH) adding to the overall dull sentiment.
Turnover however, was supported by bargain-hunting on selected counters with active participation by HNIs and Institutional investors in key counters such as JKH (~87% of the total crossings), Chevron & Singer Sri Lanka helping account for ~52% of the total turnover.
Higher HNI and Institutional activity helped daily average turnover surpass LKR 0.50Bn (cf. 0.26Bn without crossings).
The daily average turnover level in the 1st week of trading in 2017 was consequently LKR 0.54Bn, although 26.54% lower than 2016’s full year daily average of LKR 0.73Bn and ~49.41% lower than full year daily average of LKR1.06Bn in 2015.
Foreign flows into the Bourse meanwhile, turned negative for the first time after a month of consecutive of inflows, with foreign selling in Blue-chips resulting in a net outflow of foreign funds of ~ LKR 1.0Bn (cf. net inflows of LKR 11.98Mn last week and inflows of LKR 3.20Bn over December).
Muted activity is likely to persist in the holiday shortened week ahead as investors (particularly retailers) remain on the sidelines.
In its Road Map for 2017, the Central Bank (CB) highlighted that improving macro-fundamentals indicate that economic stability is broadly on track and reiterated its commitment to ensure stable economic conditions on a sustainable basis.

The Monetary Authority noted that although some of its policies may be perceived as ‘painful’ in the short run, they are intended to strengthen the medium-term stability of the economy.
The CB added that while the GoSL is in the process of addressing deficiencies in budgetary operations via a new fiscal framework, the CB would complement these efforts through its transition towards a flexible inflation targeting framework and new framework for FX management to establish a market- based exchange rate system.
The CBSL also elaborated on some key changes to its monetary policy formulation process, including the reduction of Monetary Policy Committee meetings to 8 meetings per annum (cf. current 12) and the reintroduction of a Monetary Policy Consultative Committee comprising academics and professionals.
The CBSL also highlighted its intentions to streamline and strengthen its regulatory and supervisory framework via amendments to the Banking Act.
The Monetary Authority added meanwhile, that while inflation is expected to remain at mid-single digits (ie: 4-6%) over the medium-term, consistent with the inflation target bands stipulated under the EFF arrangement with the IMF, expected changes to tax structures along with weather-related supply shortages and possible global oil price shocks could cause temporary variations in price levels.
