Injured Agar to miss last two India ODIs

New Delhi: Spinner Ashton Agar has broken his finger and will miss the remaining two one-day internationals against India, Cricket Australia said on Monday. The left-arm spinner injured his right little finger while fielding during the third ODI in Indore on Sunday. Steve Smith’s lost the game by five wickets to concede an unbeatable 3-0 lead to the hosts.
“Following the conclusion of the match he went for X-rays which have confirmed a fracture of the finger,” team doctor Richard Saw said in a statement.
“He will return home to Australia and consult a specialist with a possibility of surgery.”
Agar, 23, was not included for the opening match against India in Chennai. In the next two games, he took two wickets while conceding 125 runs.
The selectors have not asked for a replacement in the 14-member Australian squad for the matches in Bangalore and Nagpur on Thursday and Sunday.
The teams will also play a three-match Twenty20 series starting October 7. AFP
