Government will provide relief to drought-affected for four months

 
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said in Parliament that farmer’s families who were unable to cultivate during the droughts will be granted relief for four months, begining from March.  
The Minister also said that there is no need to declare an emergency situation, as drought is a natural disaster.
He added that the government has taken measures to make an assessment on the damages caused by the drought and that two separate census are underway to assess the crisis situation.
