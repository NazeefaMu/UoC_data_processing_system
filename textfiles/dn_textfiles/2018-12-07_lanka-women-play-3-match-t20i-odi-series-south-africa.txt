Lanka Women to play 3-match T20I, ODI series in South Africa

Cricket South Africa have announced the dates for Sri Lanka women’s tour of South Africa, which will feature a three-match T20I series and three-match ICC Women’s Championship ODI series.
The T20Is are set to be televised, and the tour follows on from the showdown between the two sides at the ICC World T20, which saw the Proteas triumph in a seven-wicket victory, led by a superb bowling performance from Shabnim Ismail. Nevertheless, both sides crashed out in the group-stages.
