CNCI Seminar on EPF and ETF to be held on December 11

The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI), has planned a full day Seminar on “EPF and ETF” to be conducted on December 11, 2018 at Hotel Taj Samudra.
The CNCI has observed that the Private Sector employees all of whom are members of the EPF & ETF are not fully aware of their entitlements, privileges and additional benefits such as monetary grants at their sicknesses, awards of scholarships for children of the employees at their excellence displayed at examinations, death donation schemes, housing loans, funds for heart surgeries, eye surgeries, online balance inquiries, reckonable income, eligibilities, latest amendments to the online systems etc etc.
Under the circumstances, this seminar is a good opportunity for those who are involved in Payroll Management, Administration, Human Resource Management and Accounts. Seminar consists with a Q & A session too, where the participants will have an ample opportunity to clear any doubts and seek clarifications on the issues concerned.
The Secretary General of the CNCI, Abeyratne Muthugala said that the participants for the seminar will undoubtedly gain a sound knowledge on the EPF and ETF systems and administration and the Chambers expectation is to make their company employees well aware of their EPF/ETF rights and benefits.
The seminar will be conducted by Milanga Weerakkody, Chief Legal Officer and Labour Commissioner, Enforcement, Department of Labour and K G Kumarasinghe, Legal Officer, Department of Labour who are well qualified trainers and have years of all-round experience in the Department of Labour.
