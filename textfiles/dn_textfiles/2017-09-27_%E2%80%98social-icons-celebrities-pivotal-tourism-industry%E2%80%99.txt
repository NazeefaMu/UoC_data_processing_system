‘Social icons, celebrities pivotal to tourism industry’

Social icons and celebrities are pivotal to the travel and tourism industry because they inspire their followers or fans to visit destinations they travel to,” said Brekke Fletcher, the Executive Editor of CNN Travel.
Speaking at the Cinnamon Future of Tourism [FOT] Summit held in Colombo to commemorate the World Tourism Day at Cinnamon Grand yesterday she said that this ultimately creates a ‘sure flow’ of tourists for these destinations,’’ she added.
‘Travel requires both passion and a professional approach. Sri Lanka must use Social media giants like Instagram and Snapchat to literally grab the attention of people to various destinations through the use of geo- location tags so that finding places, restaurants, reputed tourist sites are now at the user’s finger tips. Then the country can become a ‘tech –wise’ tourist destination.’’, Brekke said.
Minister of Tourism and Christian Affairs John Amaratunga said that the government will soon launch a strategic tourism plan for 2017 to 2020.
The Tourism Vision until 2025 is also planned to ensure that the authentic and innovative side of Sri Lanka’s tourist industry comes out while also protecting the nations’ natural resources and heritage sites.
