Monkeys in Kataragama

Troops of monkeys and torque monkeys have become a menace to people in Kataragama, including pilgrims visiting the sacred area. Farmers said their produce is at the mercy of the monkeys invading their lands daily. Residents said wildlife officials should step in to introduce a programme to catch and relocate the primates similar to the programme introduced in respect of crocodiles infesting the Menik ganga.
