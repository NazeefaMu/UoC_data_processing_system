Navy apprehends human-traffickers, illegal immigrants from India

Following a tip-off, Naval personnel on board a Fast Attack Craft attached to the Northern Naval Command, during routine patrol, intercepted a suspicious dinghy in the northern seas with seven persons aboard, on Sunday.
Having noticed the boat's suspicious movement, about 11 nautical miles north of Kankasanthurei, the Navy dispatched the Fast Attack Craft to the dinghy's location.
Accordingly, Naval personnel apprehended two human-traffickers engaged in smuggling activities from India to Sri Lanka. Among the illegal immigrants were two women, two men and a child. Subsequently, the apprehended persons were taken to the Naval Base SLNS Uththara in Kankasanthurei. Having administered firstaid and other medical needs, the suspects along with the dinghy, were handed over to Kankesanthurai Police for further action, the Navy Media Unit said.
