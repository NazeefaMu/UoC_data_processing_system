Monuments Matter !

Ancient Sri Lanka had four long-term capitals. They are Anuradhapura (Over 1300 years), Kandy (223 years), Polonnaruwa (Over 160 years), Kotte (150 years). However, Kotte is the most neglected capital city of the country since it was never rebuilt or properly conserved after its destruction by the Portuguese.
From the time of its destruction in the 1565, it was even vandalized for recovering building materials. However, in the mid of the 20th century with the archaeological act some monuments were preserved. However the destruction was accelerated with the Kotte becoming capital for the second time in Sri Lanka during the early 1980s.

Apart from the well-known monuments such as Alakeshwara palace, Veherakanda mounds, the most important ruins left in Kotte are the rampart along the parameter of the inner city and the two moats of inner city and outer city boundaries. If these monuments are preserved with a great sense this ancient city could be transformed to make a wonderful tourist attraction where Kotte is located at a few minutes’ drive from the metro capital of Colombo.
However, the pathetic side of this historically valued city is the 4.5 km long rampart and moat is in great danger of being wiped out because of some dubious approaches of the authorities.
It seems the Archaeological department has already been issued license for encroachments and destructions of these great monuments. The entrance location of the inner city gate and part of the bastion traces had already been destroyed recently.
The Director General himself has mentioned that though there are about 40 to 50 archeologies in Kotte. They have gazette only 13 locations so far. Though the DG-AD had agreed to carry out this process soon the matter had been delayed continuously. Hence little has been done to halt destruction. This legal loophole has paved way for further destruction. Proper name boards cover what is left of the ancient Kotte kingdom.
The Kotte Heritage Foundation (KHF) has stepped forward to end this process. Their primary objective is to ensure that no more monuments relating to the Kotte kingdom and situated in Kotte area are destroyed. In order to achieve this objective, the foundation hopes to engage in the following tasks:
* Persuade the authorities to identify the monuments.
* Persuade the authorities to display boards with the survey plan of the monument and other details where practicable.
* Promote the idea of protecting the monuments among the present residents of the ancient city.
* Educate the residents now occupying places of archaeological value and those having any monuments within their premises.
There is no intention of acquiring the lands and they are the proud owners of the ancient monuments. The Foundation is vigilant about their activities
The KHF was born when some residents of Kotte, who have a great sense for heritage, got together to formed a movement to pressurize authorities to preserve the Kotte heritage. Having had the awareness meeting in early May 2015 more people joined hands with the group.
The KHF held its Annual General Meeting in July 2015. The registration process is currently underway. The KHF consists of multidisciplinary professionals, such as doctors, engineers, accountants, lawyers, marketers, senior administrators, bankers etc. The membership is open to other categories of residents who have a passion to preserve the heritage of Kotte.
Three categories of memberships: Life, Ordinary and student are available. For more details call 011 2876873 or send an e mail to [email protected]
