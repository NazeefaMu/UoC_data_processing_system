China will always stand up by Sri Lanka and the relationship between the two countries will be further strengthened,” Chinese Ambassador Yi Xianliang said.
“I highly appreciate China’s spontaneous support to Sri Lanka in this difficult moment. As a country, Sri Lanka will have to do more to re-build the country, rehabilitate damaged roads, houses, infrastructure etc.
