Citizens’ Mail

It is surprising to find that the World Workers’ Day celebrated yearly has not brought a new lease of life to the toiling workers in Sri Lanka. In the plantation sector, the tea estate workers have not got an increase of wages in keeping with rising cost of living. Unless they are satisfied they cannot enjoy the May Day.
Similarly, there are underpaid workers in large number all over the island. All of them have to be paid higher wages without further delay by the socialist government.
There are underpaid workers in private sector too. The government should instruct the private sector to increase the workers’ salaries in keeping with the condition of service in the public sector. In the case of retired workers too, the government must consider a considerable increase of pension to live comfortably in the last stage of their life.
In reality, a part of money is lavishly spent on May Day celebrations. This could have been well utilized for payment of increased salary to the suffering workers.
