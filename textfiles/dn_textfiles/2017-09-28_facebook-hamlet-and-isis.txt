Facebook, Hamlet and Isis

It was 10 pm when word came from the Zarari family’s neighbours: Isis was launching a book raid on their street. The family convened in their living room, grouping around the dark wooden shelves that contained dozens of banned volumes. In this moneyed quarter of Mosul, each of them had a different vice to hide. For Said, the head of the household, it was his copy of The Game of Nations – Miles Copeland’s controversial treatise on his time with the CIA. For his wife Asma – like Said, a lawyer – it was her legal texts.
Their twenty-five-year-old daughter Hasna was a graduate in English literature. She would die if the militants found her copies of Hamlet and Wuthering Heights. Particularly, she reflected, because one of them featured a picture of the handsome British actor Tom Hardy on the cover.
Philosophy texts
Her elder brother Hakam, a PhD candidate in physical chemistry, reasoned that Isis would not object to the leather-bound copy of his thesis on the theoretical study of critical packing parameters of hydrotropes using DFT theory and QSAR calculations, a highly complex examination of the way that certain surfactant compounds fit together. But he had a guitar hidden on top of the ceiling panels by his wardrobe. If discovered, it would lose him his head.
The family were faced with the decision of whether to risk their lives for the sake of some books. First, they decided to burn them all. But as they emptied the shelves, a sense of regret stole over them. Armed with shovels, they went into the garden and buried the ones they couldn’t bear to lose. Arabic philosophy texts went into the ground wrapped in black plastic bags, alongside Robinson Crusoe and Twelfth Night. Tom Hardy’s chiselled features were soon obscured under a foot of soil, the lawn ­patted flat on top.
The next day, Said waited until lunchtime to set fire to the remaining books which they had piled up in the garden. Clouds of smoke choked the neighbourhood. Dozens of tomes on philosophy, law and ethics glowed under the hot sun. The quarter in which the Zararis live is one of Mosul’s wealthiest – home to government officials, traders and top-tier professionals. It is Mosul’s Belgravia, and like its London equivalent, its inhabitants usually live a life set apart from the city’s harsh reality.
But when Isis swept through Mosul in 2014, many of the Zarari family’s neighbours fled. They believed that life in the city, Iraq’s second largest, would be impossible under the militants’ harsh brand of Islamic law, in which women had to cover even their fingertips and men were lashed for smoking. The Zararis, however, decided to stay at home and weather the crisis. Their house, on two floors, contains a dozen rooms, all packed with paintings and crocheted hangings. They would be comfortable there. Besides, they were used to danger. Even before the arrival of Isis, Mosul was a very dangerous place, in which car bombings, assassinations and kidnappings were commonplace. If they kept to the rules and didn’t venture too far, they reasoned, they could avoid the worst of what Islamic State threatened. But month by month, the rules became stricter, and living conditions worsened for everyone. Electricity and water were cut off or were in sporadic supply. The streets were lawless.
Packing parameters
When they lost their books, the family foundered. Hakam tried to study. But the internet had been inaccessible for months, and anyway the electricity was intermittent. Even the theoretical study of the critical packing parameters of hydrotropes had its limits as an engaging ­subject.
“You have no idea how bored I was”, he told me. It was a month after the family’s neighbourhood had been liberated from Isis by Iraqi forces, and we were standing on the lawn outside his house, shaded by an orange tree. “But staying inside was better than being with Daesh.” As we spoke, a mortar thudded nearby. No one noticed. At the beginning of the Isis occupation, Hakam could still communicate with the outside world. Whatsapp, Viber and Facebook all worked, and he would get regular updates from friends in other parts of the country. Soon, however, the militants began to crack down on illicit internet usage.
“If they found a SIM card they would execute you”, he said, laughing. “We just stopped talking to other people.” The Zararis began to search for engaging, therapeutic pursuits that complied with the militants’ laws. There were not a lot of options. Anything that required electricity was out of the question, as was music or dancing or almost any activity that involved leaving the walled compound of their house.
For Said and Asma, two of the most highly qualified professionals in Mosul, gardening became their salvation. They developed an obsessive fascination with cultivating rare breeds of roses and cacti. Around the flower beds in their garden, they planted orange trees for shade. On a luminous afternoon in the spring of this year, Asma flicked through photos on her iPad to show me the garden in full splendour, beaming at their perfection. Paper-thin poppies and scarlet peonies had flourished, along with a yellow bloom she called the Mosul Rose. “We did all of this ourselves”, she said. “We worked together for this.” For their daughter Hasna, who barely left the house, they bought a half a dozen parakeets. Within weeks, she had tamed them.
“They all have their own names, their own story”, Hasna said, running her hands over the bars as the birds pecked at her fingers. “And they’re in a prison, just like us.”
As Iraqi, Uighur, Russian and Syrian fighters patrolled the battle-scarred streets outside the house during the years of Isis occupation, all they could see was a pink cement wall. But behind it lay an oasis, where things carried on almost as normal. Last autumn, however, when forces led by the Iraqi army began an offensive to liberate the city from Isis, the veneer began to crack. Air strikes pounded the city. For two weeks, the family slept in their clinker-tiled bathroom. One day, a car screeched up to the door. Inside were three Isis snipers demanding to be let into the house. “We said of course”, Said laughed darkly, as he showed me around the garden, where the outer wall bore deep scratches from shell shrapnel. “Take it.”
The family fled to a relative’s house, as Isis used their sanctuary to launch a last stand against the advancing forces. It took two months for the neighbourhood to fall to the Iraqi army. When the family finally returned to the house, they feared the worst.
“They left seven RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] here”, said Hakam, pointing at the roof. One of the fighters had knocked out a firing hole in the terrace wall. “There was rubble everywhere. But the house was ok.”
