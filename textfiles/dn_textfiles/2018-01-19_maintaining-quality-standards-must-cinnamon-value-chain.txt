Maintaining quality standards must  for cinnamon  value chain

IPS research officer, Dilani Hirimuthugodage, speaking on cinnamon production, recently highlighted the importance of maintaining quality standards at each level of cinnamon value chain.
Lack of proper production infrastructure and technology in meeting required quality standard at the producer level, less concern in assuring the quality of cinnamon and lack of awareness of international standards and specification at the collector level, high cost in maintaining quality standards and at the exporter level were identified as the main constraints in the production process.
Hirimuthu Godage made these observations while presenting on the topic ‘Analyzing Quality Constraints in Cinnamon Value Chain in Sri Lanka’ at the 11th Annual Research Forum of Sri Lanka Agricultural Economic Association (SAEA), on Natural Disasters, Risk, and Agriculture, held in Kandy on January 13,2018.
