Success of Club Football is the key to a strong National Team - CEO Umar

Sri Lanka Football needs to work on its priorities and bring a set of complete reforms to the existing "club football structure" if the governing body wants to see some international success. Many strategies to uplift the National team’s performances proved to be unsuccessful in the past for various reasons.
A complete new approach is now put forward by the New CEO of Football – Jaswar Umar and he speaks out on how our football can reach the next level.
“World football is dominated by very strong Club Football Structure and club competitions. Some of these club competitions have become very strong brands in the world with high commercial values. English Premier League, La Liga, Bundasliga are to name a few. These club competitions have transformed the modern-day football into global ‘football industry’ with profits, skills, millions of global fans base and football celebrities.” Jaswar explained.
“The success of Club Football will automatically create a strong National team. I strongly believe that supporting clubs and revamping club competitions will change the landscape of our football completely. Ever since I took this office as CEO in a short period, I have given priority to all clubs, supported every club in whatever ways possible with an approach of ‘football first’.
Every club has been treated fairly and I have listened to their issues; solved those appropriately. Every club could walk into my office without any appointment and my doors are open to them anytime.”
The Football CEO explained the new plans for clubs with AFC’s Club Licensing Program which will be implemented from this year.
AFC has requested all member countries to implement Club Licensing to all its clubs. This will begin from this year and made as mandatory to all member countries from 2018. Jaswar Umar who is also AFC Club Licensing Manager said, FFSL will implement the first step of club licensing this year to all to league (Champion League Clubs) as mandatory for the 2017 season.
Clubs will be assessed under Sporting Criteria, Infrastructure Criteria, Personnel and administrative Criteria, Legal Criteria and Financial Criteria.
The Club Licensing procedure will be done online with paperless environment and all clubs will be given individual access to upload their documents for approval. The online system is now ready he said.
AFC Club Licensing will make the clubs into a strong entity with financial stability and independent organization with its fan base and income sources. “We want to see at least ten of our top teams become professional football clubs within the next five years. We have set a two-year target and a five-year target to these clubs.”
The CEO seems to be very ambitious but says it is not an impossible task to do these reforms. AFC and FFSL have already conducted two workshops to the clubs and steps are underway for more workshops, trainings and supports for the top league clubs.
The CEO also stated that he has already made a road map for the top coaches in the country to enhance their knowledge and to provide more skills in coaching. This includes necessary support to sit for AFC A license courses, skill development program from foreign experts etc. From 2018, all top league clubs MUST have coaches with AFC license.
“I will go an extra mile to support these clubs to make them as profitable football clubs. ” Jaswar said. FFSL is now planning to make some strategic reforms in Club Competitions including a possible professional league structure and Club Youth League by next year.
