Mahanama, Dissanayake further remanded

The President’s former Chief of Staff, I. H. K. Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake, who were in remand custody for bribery charges, were further remanded until September 25 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake. Senior President’s Counsel Arseculeratne, appearing on behalf of P. Dissanayake, informed court that the bribery commission had filed charges against both the accused in the same certificate.
He said it is procedurally flawed.
