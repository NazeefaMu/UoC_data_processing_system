Rameswaram fishermen to boycott Katchatheevu festival

Rameswaram fishermen have decided to boycott the two-day Katchatheevu festival, scheduled for March 11 and 12.
They are protesting the arrests of fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy. They have demanded the release of 85 fishermen and 128 boats and decided to launch an indefinite strike from March 7. There are also plans for a rail roko at Pamban rail bridge on March 11.Twenty four fishermen — 15 from Rameswaram and nine from Pudukottai — were arrested on Saturday for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line and fishing in the Island Nation’s territorial waters.The Hindu
