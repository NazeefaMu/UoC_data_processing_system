In praise of readability

To the writer who cannot suppress the ignoble sensation that it is not altogether unpleasant to have readers, Ben Roth’s entertaining little polemic against readability is something of a puzzle. In short, Roth fulminates against the term “readable” as a term of critical praise. It is (he says) now the “pre-eminent adjective” in the reviewers’ lexicon. He goes on to castigate “readable” books as commonplace, if not downright clichéd; absent of abstraction, innovation or style; and altogether sans anything to stimulate the mind. Zadie Smith, Jonathan Franzen and Dave Eggers are among those thus chastised, for even a poor aim can take pot shots, if the pots are large enough. “Readable” books are (he says) “false trophies”, a statement sufficiently revealing as to require no further examination.
It would not, I think, be edifying to address any further the article itself. Rather, I write in praise of readability: of the skill such a quality demands, of its variance and of its benign and galvanizing effects.
First, prose which is “readable” may attain something of that quality famously praised by Orwell: that it is “transparent, like a windowpane”. The reader, spared the dense frost-fronds on the glass of triple-claused sentences and baroque obfuscations, peers instead directly at the objects beyond the window. Exemplars abound, not least of course in the works of Orwell himself; I have encountered it most recently and most deliciously in John Berger’s A Country Doctor, the opening of which is spare to the point of emaciation:
One of them shouted down a warning, but it was too late. The leaves brushed him down almost delicately. The small branches encaged him. And then the tree and the whole hill crushed him together.
What is the effect of this? Prose so “readable” as to almost vanish, leaving only a crushed man, a tree, a hill.
Second, fiction which is “readable” often promises, early on, thrills to which the reader is eager to return. Consider, for example, the opening of John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress (which also displays that first quality of a self-effacing simplicity of style):
As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a Den, and I laid me down in that place to sleep: and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream . . . I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, “What shall I do?”
Third, prose which is “readable” is prose which is skilled. It is quite useless to argue that there is no objective standard for “good” and “bad” where writing is concerned; one need read hardly more than a dozen books before discovering that a bar is set. Readable prose is, generally speaking, diligent in its sentence construction, erring from received rules of grammar only deliberately and to a clear effect. Its figurative language functions so that the reader is not left puzzling over a metaphor which creaks like a well-oiled door (you see, I hope, what I did there); its characterization bears some resemblance to people as you and I know them; it is what one might call “ontologically sound”, creating a world entire from which it does not wilfully depart. Yet all these principles the skilful, “readable” book may wickedly flout, and still remain skilful and “readable”. Fourth, prose which is “readable” has little truck, if any, with the notion that the best works of literature lie beyond the ken of the general populace; and that this is indeed the measure of true quality. Rather, it is often benevolent, generous and humane; suspects that readers are creatures of intellect and query, and proceeds on that basis. William Tyndale, embarking on the translation of the Bible into English, famously retorted that he would see to it that even the ploughboy knew his Scripture better than any priest. 500 years on the King James Bible remains “readable”; for there, within the genealogies and archaisms, are great tracts of memorable cadences which convey – plainly and simply – complex and sublime ideas in a manner designed for the widest of readerships (“Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil”).
It is this fourth quality which is perhaps of greatest importance, for it is readable prose that changes the world. Foxe’s Book of Martyrs is “readable” – a riveting, gruesome, illustrated compendium of human courage and suffering – and it was central to the formation of the English consciousness. The Communist Manifesto is unabashedly “readable”, with its ringing declarations (“All that is solid melts into air! All that is holy is profaned!”), and series of robust, repetitive sentences. It might well be argued that Plato’s Socratic dialogues are an exercise in “readability”: abstractions as amiable conversation are rather more appealing than unbroken polemics.
Since the quality of “readability” is so varied, and so rich, works which may defy the standard on the one hand may fulfil it on the other. Berger’s A Country Doctor is “readable” in the sense that it is elegantly plain; but it is also allusive and profound, requiring careful contemplation. Jane Eyre is “readable” in that it contains an orphan, a mystery, a fire, a madwoman; but the prose is in places trippingly dense and strange.
Maggie Nelson is “readable”, for her radiant intelligence and warmth are as irresistible as an open fire; but you could burn yourself on her sentences.
There is a line in The Republic which I think is the sum of all the above: that the quality of “readability” is not only not to be despised, but it is to be pursued. Socrates says, “Come then, and let us pass a leisure hour in storytelling, and our story shall be the education of our heroes”. Storytelling as leisure, as education and as a galvanizing force? These are features of the “readable”, and I will never despise them.
