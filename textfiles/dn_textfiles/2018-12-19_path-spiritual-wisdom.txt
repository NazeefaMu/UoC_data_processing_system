Katina Maha Pinkama of Keysborough Dhamma Sarana Temple, Melbourne, Australia
In the path to spiritual wisdom

Among many countries, Australia stands prominent noted for good governance, working for the betterment of the multicultural society recognising their religious interests. Over the years Buddhism has taken root firmly as a sacred doctrine flourishing today preserving the Buddhist cultural heritage where temples play a vital role. What a dream come true to have witnessed the Katina Maha Pinkama of Keysborough Dhamma Sarana temple in Melbourne on 11th November 2018. Sri Lankans should have been proud to see a serene gracious ceremony of such magnitude taking place in an alien country. As the name suggests this magnificent seat of sacred value owes its name to the tranquil location and the great service it performs.
Enjoying a picturesque backdrop with a brilliant blend of all features and all requisites of a temple, a solidly constructed cone-shaped top helps to identify it from afar. This is a perfect religious venue reflecting the proud culture and tradition inspired by Buddhist ideals enjoyed by many a Buddhist in Melbourne. Here they seek the blessings of the Triple Gem in all activities of life. The recent Katina ceremony held was quite a successful mission, the reasons for which are many.
Model Buddhist Centre
The honour of preserving it to date should be attributed to the vision, foresight and religious enthusiasm of Ven.NaotunneVijithaThero, the Chief Adhikarana Sangha Nayaka of Australia who performs an endless service to the spiritual progress of the Buddhist community along with the other learned resident bhikkhus. Under his guidance this has become a model Buddhist Centre providing writing opportunities giving meaning to their skills and talents in the religious sphere.
There are young bhikkhus engaged in writing dhamma books. To name a few, they are Ven.AthurugiriyePiyaratana and EmbuldeniyePagnasara. A distinctive feature of the Katina ceremony was the novel idea of publishing a book to mark the occasion, taking into consideration the younger generation, their knowledge of the language and religion. This was fulfilled by the above mentioned scholarly bhikkhu, Venerable Piyaratana Thera. The inspirational message conveyed by his compilation, “Great Amity” was a dhamma dana, a very important milestone of the event.
Dayaka Sabha
Then there is the Dayaka Sabha deserving special mention, giving much support and strength to all activities of the temple. They were totally committed to the task devoting their time and energy giving of their best. Working as a team was the key to their success. The preparation for the sacred event had taken place long before the date. The chain of activities prior to the traditional Katina Pooja was carried out in perfect order giving a very good message to the Buddhists around. The entire premises was gaily decorated with Buddhist flags and illuminations. There were thousands of mini bulbs in and around the temple building adding to its glamour. The elaborate programme included Katina Maha Perahera, almsgiving and dhammanusasana to invoke the blessings on the devotees at large.
Perahara
The most admirable arousing festive spirit in relevance to the sacred ceremony was the “Perahera” conducted on a grand scale. It was great to see the Buddhist devotees in full white attire to suit the occasion carrying flags, flowers and numerous decorative items, giving prominence to conventional and traditional culture. Gorgeously dressed drummers, trumpeters and dancers added glory to the event. The dancing items presented by the children were the most eye-catching. The other paraphernalia of the procession included many decorative scenes out of which the most venerated was the Katina Cheevara. The atmosphere was of genuine excitement. The grandeur and beauty of this unique cultural pageant are beyond expression. The organisers were amply rewarded in their efforts towards the success of this holy event.
Alms Giving
After the Perahera, they went right ahead with their plans for the almsgiving. They undertook the task with enthusiasm and will. There was a good turnout for the dana. Spacious dhamma shala was fully packed. It had been organised perfectly fine. An important and exciting attraction of the Katina ceremony was the participation of the laity in the stitching of the Katina robe, where there was a long queue waiting for the purpose prior to the almsgiving. It was performed with overflowing shraddha. Nearly fifteen members of the Sangha had been invited among whom there were reputed erudite bhikkus from Sri Lanka, including Ven KotapolaAmarakiththiThero. In their anusasana sermons, they emphasized the significance of this sacred event.
Nayaka Thera
Venerable Naotunne Vijitha Thera who is proficient in several languages, after his welcome speech mentioning the names of the bhikkhu invitees in his anusasana made mention of the names of forty families in the Katina group who played a dominant role in making the event a success. The Venerable Thera went to the extent of breaking rest till midnight the previous day, attending to the details of the ceremony.
After offering alms to the venerable Sangha, there was provision for the laity. Lunch had been organised seeing to the comfort of the devotees’ present, providing all the facilities. Katina Pooja came to a close with the Katinanusansa sermon held towards the evening. All these enhance the temple’s reputation as a stronghold of Buddhism in a foreign land.
