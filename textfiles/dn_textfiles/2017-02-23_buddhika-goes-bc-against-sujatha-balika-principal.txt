Buddhika goes to BC against Sujatha Balika Principal

United National Party (UNP) Matara District Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission yesterday, with regard to arbitrary conduct of the Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya Principal.
MP Pathirana said; “The principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya is allegedly involved in producing fake vouchers and bills with the aid of some teachers. The principal has taken measures to appoint clerks who are supportive of her as teachers. Also priority has being given to teachers who are supportive to her arbitrary conduct over qualified senior teachers when appointing grade coordinators.”
He further said that money has been allegedly collected from students continuously without even issuing any source document.
MP Pathirana requested the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption to conduct immediate investigations into this matter. Patirana said that principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya was backed up several individuals including past pupils, School Development Committee representatives, politicians and police officers in favour of illegal and unethical benefits.
Pathirana said that income sources of the principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya should be assessed to trace as to how a principal of a national school was able to build a luxury house within a short time period of being appointed as a principal.
MP Pathirana further said that parents and students had issued affidavits regarding the allegations committed by the Principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya. He said that principal of Sutjatha Balika Vidyalaya would be suspended and a complaint would be lodged against her for the damages caused to the central electricity system at his main office premises in Matara yesterday morning. Buddhika Pathirana also said that independent commissions should be empowered further.
