SLTB lacks strategic planning
It is no secret that the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) is incurring heavy losses despite possessing the physical assets and the manpower, far in excess in terms of numbers, to run a better and more streamlined service.
In my view, what this ailing government-owned, service-oriented organisation lacks is strategic planning to tap the potential and rake in the revenue from identified viable routes.
There are loss-making routes, no doubt, but what about those where there’s ample potential to make money and offset the losses to some extent, so that the SLTB can even, hopefully, breakeven? There is a silver lining, and if there’s a genuine effort made, it can be spotted amidst the dark clouds.
Let me cite examples of how the SLTB has virtually “abandoned” two lucrative routes, which even private bus operators find it difficult to service due to heavy commuter traffic.
Route No. 155 (Angulana-Mattakkuliya): There are no SLTB buses operated on this route despite this being the only bus service along the Galle Road which cuts across the Colombo University, Nelum Pokuna, University of Performing Arts, National/Eye Hospitals, Town Hall, Maradana, Armour Street, Kotahena and beyond.
Not only patients seeking OPD treatment plus visitors/employees of these two important hospitals, but also scores of university students depend on this only public transport link to their destinations. But the SLTB, in its wisdom, has completely abandoned this route. The end result is private busmen holding sway and operating jam packed buses with commuters balancing on the foot-board like acrobats. (This happens particularly at Bambalapitiya junction where train passengers also link up for their onward journey).
The SLTB Mattakkuliya depot injects some buses from Town Hall which serves no useful purpose at all, as by then, most of the passengers, including university students, have disembarked after a harrowing journey akin to Jews being transported to the gallows!
Route No. 154 (Angulana-Kiribathgoda): This again is the solitary link along Galle Road to Jawatte (SLBC/Rupavahini Corporation), BMICH, Borella and the Kelaniya University. The SLTB thinks if fit to operate a few buses from Bambalapitiya Railway Station. The route is overcrowded by the time they reach the junction (near MC).
While commuters, particularly women suffer the most with sex perverts also preying on them, the SLTB operates plenty of buses on the Galle Road to Pettah which invariably run half empty as 99% of the private buses on this route are also Pettah-bound.
It beats logic why the SLTB bigwigs cannot use their common sense and divert more buses to profit-making routes without washing their hands off and allow the private bus mafia to hold suffering commuters to ransom.
It there are joint timetables between the two service providers, surely they can be readjusted in line with passenger well-being because it is the prime responsibility of a government to ease the suffering of the masses.
