GMOA to meet President

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) expects the new Government to look into their grievances and outstanding issues. The expectations of the GMOA will be discussed with President Maithripala Sirisena in the near future, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday evening, he said the GMOA expects the Government to act on the Singapore Free Trade Agreement after formulating a National FTA Policy and considering the recommendations of the Presidential Commission appointed by the President. The policy should be formulated with state sponsorship.
According to Dr.Aluthge, the state tax policy which made professionals and the entire public suffer should be changed with immediate effect.
“The proposed new Prevention of Terrorism Act which is aimed at suppressing trade unions should be withdrawn immediately. All incentives given to professionals before 2015 in order to keep them in the country should be granted to them again. Those incentives were cut down after 2015,” Dr.Aluthge said.
Dr. Aluthge pointed out that the National Wages Policy should be protected and it should be strictly followed. The recommendations made by the Presidential Committee appointed for a period of two months should be considered. The Gazette notification on closing down SAITM should be issued with immediate effect.
“The Sri Lanka Medical Council should be broughtback to its original status and it should be protected from all forms of interference. There are some other proposals,” he added.
