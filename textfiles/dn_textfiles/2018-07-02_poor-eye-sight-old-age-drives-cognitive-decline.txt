Poor eye sight in old age drives cognitive decline

Poor eye sight in old age drives cognitive decline in older people, new research suggests. Both vision and mental sharpness decrease with age, which can cause a loss of independence and a reduced quality of life in sufferers, a US study has found.
Researchers believe poor vision reduces people’s abilities to participate in activities, leading to reduced brain stimulation. Another theory is cognitive decline and vision loss may both be caused by inflammation or deterioration of the central nervous system.
Cognitive impairment without dementia affects around 5.4 million adults in their 70s in the US, while more than 2.9 million suffer reduced vision. The researchers, from the University of Miami, analysed 2,520 people aged between 65 and 84 from Salisbury, Maryland.
The participants were followed for eight years. More than half of them died during the study’s duration. Their eye sight and mental state was assessed four times, on average every two years, during the investigation.
Mental state was determined by their ability to orientate themselves to a time and place, their attention span, language understanding and ability to recall three words. The findings were published in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology.
Poor people are 50 per cent more likely to develop dementia. This comes after research released last May suggested poor people are more likely to develop dementia. The 20 per cent most deprived adults in England are 50 per cent more likely to suffer from severe memory loss than the wealthiest 20 per cent, a study found.
Study author Professor Andrew Steptoe, from University College London, said: ‘Our study confirms that the risk of dementia is reduced among well-off older people compared with those who have fewer economic resources. Many factors could be involved. Differences in healthy lifestyle and medical risk factors are relevant. It may also be that better off people have greater social and cultural opportunities that allow them to remain actively engaged with the world.’
Study author Dr Dorina Cadar added: ‘Dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with devastating consequences to individuals, their families and governments around the world. ‘Our efforts are unified in identifying the risk factors associated with a delay in the onset of dementia or a slower progression.’
