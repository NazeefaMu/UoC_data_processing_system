Flexible working hours project from Sept. 18 at Battaramulla

A three-month pilot project for flexible working hours in Government offices, established in the Battaramulla area, is to be implemented from September 18.
The project is aimed at easing traffic congestion at rush hours. A public administration circular has been issued last week informing the work plan of this project to all the Ministry Secretaries, Provincial Chief Secretaries and Department Heads.
At the end of three months, the Government will evaluate outcomes and decide on future measures to ease the heavy traffic congestion in Colombo. The pilot project is carried out based on a Cabinet decision taken on May 16 and August 1.
As per the Circular, employees can report to work from 7.30 a.m. to 9.15 a.m. and depart between 3.15 p.m. to 5 p.m. after completing their working time.
“The drivers, minor employees and other officers should serve nine hours, eight hours and 45 minutes and seven hours and 45 minutes respectively from 7.30 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.
All officers should compulsorily perform duties between 9.15 a.m. to 3.15 p.m. as per above prescribed working hours, in order to serve the public,” the circular signed by Public Administration and Management Ministry Secretary J.J. Rathnasiri stated.
The Heads of Institutions have to give prior approval for their subordinates’ flexible working hours while ensuring that the duties of the institution are not interrupted.
“During the period in which flexible office hours are being implemented, the officers, who have agreed to consider office hours which are not his/her regular working hours, shall not be provided with the relief mentioned in Public Administration Circulars for delaying to report for duty and leaving from duty and to cover the period he/she delayed,” the Circular further stated.
The pilot project in Battaramulla area will end on December 17.
