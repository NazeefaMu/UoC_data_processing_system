[APPRECIATIONS - (05-10-2015)]

Hameed Abdul Karim:
A people - friendly man with a golden heart
A reason to write a second appreciation on the demise of someone close to your heart, should not happen to anyone within a space of one month. In August, I wrote on the demise of my brother in law, Prof. Uditha Liyanage and in September I am writing this with a heavy heart on Hameed Karim who was a very close friend for nearly 40 years.
I met Hameed for the first time at a Jaycee meeting at the then Hotel Ceylon Inns at Wellawatta in the mid 70s. He greeted me as if we had known each other for ages and this was the start of our friendship. Since then, I have been a regular visitor to his house at Hampden Lane and lately at Saranankara Road, and he to my residence, where we spent hours in friendly banter.
Hameed was a live wire at any gathering and his public relations kept everybody happy and part of the works.
To describe him, two words would suffice. A "good man" . A good man - a simple, unpretentious, well read, articulate, fun loving, people friendly man with a golden heart.
He was a prolific writer who had an excellent command of the language and expounded views on public interest, governance, the cause of Palestine, Islam and politics. We had contradictory views on some matters and he would listen and try to understand the issue without any prejudices.
He was not into communal politics and throughout his life supported national political parties where all communities were present. He despised political parties based on ethnicity. Yet he worked for the betterment of his community and made people understand Islam. He knew where to draw the line. Hameed had the opportunity to mingle and closely associate with the political elite including the highest of the country, but he never expected or obtained any personal gain from them. It was for the cause that he worked and nothing else.
He was happy with his two wheels which kept him on the move and his house, but nothing more. He was a contended man. His two daughters Nabia and Huda were his treasures and the new addition to the family made him immensely proud.
Yasmin his wife took good care of him, sometimes being the mother figure to him. He had his points and I had mine and those bonded us for nearly 40 years.
He has gone to the world beyond, performing Hajj, a religious obligation and had a noble death. Our thoughts are with him and we as a family will miss him here on Earth.
