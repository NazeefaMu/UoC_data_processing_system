Content with Contempo!

Their voices bring perfect harmony whatever the masterpiece is. They are made up of a group of diverse people some who have just left school, undergraduates, stay at home mums and career women in varied fields. Yet they share the common enthusiasm to continue their musical careers they started in their Alma Mater. Contempo formally known as the Past Bridgetines’ Choir speaks about their journey and their musical dreams.
Having come a long way since their first public appearance in 2001 all-female choral ensemble has gone on to perform at various concerts and events. For Amanda Raymond singing is not anything new as she was a member of the school choir. Raymond who also led the Western Band of St. Bridget’s Convent joined Contempo in the year 2010.
“It has been quite an amazing time singing with Contempo I enjoyed singing and the friendship of the members. We are more like family. We have had new members joining in and Contempo keeps growing day by day. Last year was important for us as we took part at the Asia Pacific Choir Games. It was a good exposure and it added a lot of experience for us,” Raymond said.
She was appointed the Co-Directress of the ensemble in latter part of the year 2015. All members meet up every Tuesday at St. Bridget’s Convent for their regular practice. “Each time we have a practice we have about 20 to 25 members and it turns out quite good. All in all it is a nice experience and I will continue to sing with Contempo as long as I can,”
Saranie Wijesinghe, an undergraduate finds singing different genres of music to be interesting. “In school there were lots of children in the choir and we always sang gospel or spiritual music. Here we learn the technical side of singing. As there is a lesser number we enhance the technique in singing and we also train the voice. I find it quite different to what I sang in school, Contempo is far more interesting,” she said.
Participating in the Asia Pacific Choir Games made an impact on Wijesinghe as well. “We didn’t know what to expect there. We could take something from every choir performance. Even watching the other choirs perform was a learning experience for us,” she explained.
Thilini de Alwis is also the Co-Directress of Contempo. She says most of the choristers sing as a hobby. “We all love singing so after leaving school we just wanted to continue singing. Although many of us have careers the passion for singing blends us together. It is nice to meet friends every week and to take part in events including ones in school and Past Pupils Associations’ events,” she said.
One of the senior members of the choir Sanjana Selvarajah recalls the memories of singing in the convent chapel and in the school auditorium. “It was tradition to sing in the school chapel and in the hall whenever we had school functions or holy mass. Out here we are able to continue that journey we started and we have a good time in doing so,” she said.
“Last year the ensemble evolved and grew. More members joined the choir and there were changes career wise and personal. We expect to take the choir to the next level and be more involved in events. Sometimes we cannot make it to every event due to unavailability but we do our best whenever we can,” Selvarajah added.
The choir so far has done four major shows including ‘Viva la Diva’ at the Russian Cultural Centre and the most recent 'Forever In Song’ a choral concert which included toe tapping songs ranging from the genres of gospel/spiritual to pop, rock and jazz staged at the Lionel Wendt Theatre.
Selvarajah was also a part of the team that competed in Asia Pacific Choir Games and she feels this opportunity changed the outlook of the choir. “Choir games pushed us really hard and we came out of the shell. It was a great opportunity. The name Contempo is now more on people’s lips and we are glad that we pushed ourselves,” she added.
Dilini Perera joined in to say that Choir Games made them realize they are able to do A cappela, Jazz or Barbershop. “Suddenly we realized that we could do different types of music for the audience.
There was diversity in singing and it was exciting to sing at Choir Games. Now we are excited about the future. It opened a new chapter for us and audiences will definitely see more of Contempo in future,” she said.
Perera feels that being a part of the ensemble is encouraging in every way. “Sometimes we bring our children for practices. Our Director is child friendly so not only us our children also get to experience the beauty of singing. Singing has become a part of our lives and it is a family oriented thing for us now,” she explained.

The one who brings out the potential and the talent of the choristers into limelight is none other than their Choral Director, Harin Amirthanathan. Taking the reins over from versatile musician Eshantha Peiris, an alumnus of New York University, Amirthanathan says with his classical music background he was not quite sure how he could pitch into a contemporary choir. “Every choir is unique. The music Contempo had chosen had a personal touch thus the approach was easier. In time to come you will see more of Contempo,” he said.
Amirthanathan is the founder of the 'Vox One’ a choral music project in Negombo, specializing in classical and contemporary choral music. Among many other involvements Harin also acts as the Director of Colombo Philharmonic choir.
“We make music our centre and all other things fall in line. I look forward to work in a classical music project with Contempo. It is a different genre of music.
There is a niche there and we can show our strengths as a female chorus that performs classical music. People are getting to know about the ensemble and there will be a lot more to offer for all music lovers,” Amirthanathan added.

The choir is thankful to Principal of St. Bridget’s Convent, Sr. Alexandra Mendis for giving them the practice space and also mentioned their past choral directors, Eshantha Pieris, Sheranga Perera and Nishantha Warnakulasuriya with gratitude.
If you want to experience and enjoy their music, you can join Contempo at St. Andrew's Scots Kirk Colombo on May 13 at 9.30am as they sing for Ascension Sunday Service.
