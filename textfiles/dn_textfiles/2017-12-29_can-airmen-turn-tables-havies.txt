Can Airmen turn tables on Havies?

A closely fought out battle can be expected between Air Force against Havelock Sports Club when they lock horns in their second round Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby encounter at the Air Force grounds in Ratmalana today at 4.00pm.
The Airmen are packed with some outstanding players of the caliber of towering flanker Radeesha Seneviratne, scrum half Gayantha Iddamalgoda, fly half Nuwan Perera, Pabasara Hewage, winger Ranindu Padmasanka, ex Anthonian centre Jehan Seelagama and full back Rumesh Ramdas.
But they should get their act together if they are to pull off a win against the formidable Havies outfit and to achieve that the several experienced players who are in their ranks have to give off their best under the leadership of their play maker and former national centre Charith Seneviratne.
Meanwhile the young Havies outfit at present are in a team rebuilding stage and under the watchful eyes of their dedicated and committed head coach Sanath Martis. Captain and second row forward Jason Meldor will know that losing this game could mean somewhat of a setback for them in the league tournament to achieve glory as they have already lost two games unexpectedly to Navy SC and Kandy SC.
Hence they will come out with their best game plan for this match and will go out with all guns blazing to topple the Air Force team and make a bonus point win.
