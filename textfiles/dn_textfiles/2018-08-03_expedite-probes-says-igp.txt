Expedite probes, SAYs IGP

The IGP has directed the CID and other crime divisions of the Police to expedite investigations into high profile crimes including the killing of former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and other serious crimes, assault incidents and kidnappings, paying attention to evidence available. He said that no investigation should be allowed to get stalled on any condition.
The IGP also said that the suspects involved should be arrested forthwith without concern for their status or standing and legal action taken against them.
The IGP had issued this order when he was questioned about the delay in concluding investigations into these cases at a progress review meeting of all investigations arms of the Police department including the CID, Colombo Crimes Division, Police Headquarters, anti crimes operations division and the STF held at Police Headquarters.
