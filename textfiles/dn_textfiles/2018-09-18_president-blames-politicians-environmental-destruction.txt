International Ozone Day
President blames politicians for environmental destruction

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday held politicians responsible for most of the environmental destruction that has taken place in the country. He said that prior to his taking office, such destructive activities overwhelmed the country.
Numerous government institutions which grant permission and licences for rock, sand and other extractions for construction purposes, do not continue to monitor these activities, the President said.
“It was the politicians who mostly cut down trees, mined sand, extracted soil and quarried rocks. If you take Ratnapura for example, in one of the divisional secretariats there are 86 quarries. When I took over office in 2015, I asked for the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry for two reasons. For one, I wanted to complete the Moragahakanda project. The other reason is to stop the large-scale environmental destruction that was taking place in the country,” President Sirisena said.
The President was speaking at the International Ozone Day commemoration at the BMICH yesterday morning, organised by the National Ozone Unit under the instructions of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry.
President Sirisena said that he took over the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry to strictly implement laws and regulations over those who destroy the environment. “For the first time in Sri Lanka, we have the Tri-Forces deployed to secure the environment. Every two weeks, the Sri Lanka Air Force monitors the felling of trees in forests as well as illegal cannabis cultivation in the country and reports to me. We take data and information by using satellite technology as well. The racketeers who are involved in these activities use weaknesses in our legal system to evade justice,” President Sirisena said.
The President also said that social media is accusing him of many things, including living expenses. “There is a whole list of things that social media blames me for. They blame me for not allowing extracting sand and soil, even for housing construction,” the President said, adding that the country needs a sustainable housing policy.
Deputy Environment Minister Ajith Mannapperuma and Environment Secretary Anura Dissanayake also spoke at the event.
Professor Chandana Jayaratne delivered the Special Guest Speech. A refrigerant analyser to detect refrigerants and prevent illegal import of ozone depleting substances was donated to Sri Lanka Customs. Prizes were also distributed to the winners of competitions held among schools islandwide to mark International Ozone Day, at the event.
