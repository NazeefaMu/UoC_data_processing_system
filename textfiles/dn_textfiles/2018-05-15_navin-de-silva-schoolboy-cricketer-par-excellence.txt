Navin de Silva schoolboy cricketer par excellence

Readers please note this article appeared in the book “CRICKET CAMEO” by the author published in 2014.
Sri Lanka had played Test cricket and one day cricket for more than 30 years but have yet to produce an all-rounder even faintly resembling guys in the caliber of Kapil Dev, Imran Khan, Sir Ian Botham or Sir Richard Hadlee.
We certainly would have had one if Navin de Silva decided to extend his excellent school cricket career in the eighties. Built like a mini battle tank he used to tonk the ball at will in the pocket sized Campbell Park. When the news got around that Navin was at the crease all the cricket enthusiast be it spectators watching in adjacent grounds like Campbell Place, Bloomfield grounds or even wandering schoolboys after school would make a beeline to watch the wonder boy in action at the tiny Campbell Park where it was packed to the hilt. His lusty hits landed many a time at Campbell Place the adjacent road bordering the park. He was not only a mauler of the red ball but also had finis and technique, mainly due to Milroy Muthuvelu’s guidance (Muthuvelu played and shone for Wesley during the early sixties).
Due to his outstanding efforts with the bat and the ball for Wesley College in 1981, Navi was named the captain of the Sri Lanka Schools cricket team. They toured England and this was the very first tour undertaken by a Sri Lankan schoolboy cricket team to play an English schoolboy cricket team.
The team was a star studded outfit which consisted of Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Rumesh Ratnayake, Graeme Labrooy, Ashley de Silva etc. who adorned Sri Lanka cricket with distinction later on. Arjuna and Aravinda fitted into the world class category like ducks taking to water. As they all played under Navin and had he continued he would have been a huge asset to Sri Lanka cricket as an all-rounder.
When inquired about why he refrained from continuing where he let off, he informed me that his father wanted him to pursue a professional career according to family tradition. As a result he opted to become a pilot with Air Lanka, now known as Sri Lankan Airlines where Navin became the youngest captain of Air Lanka at that time.
Before Sanath Jayasuriya came to the scene, Navin was quite a revelation and he showed that he could thump the best of fast bowlers over cover for six. He was also a fantastic fast medium bowler who was fair skinned and broad in build and looked a bit like Ian Botham although he was closer to earth than Botham by about six inches.
It has to be mentioned that 1962 was the year when late Minister Gamini Dissanayake was making a bold bid to attain Test status for Sri Lanka. As a precursor to this the Minister quite judiciously arranged this strong schoolboy outfit to tour England soon after the senior Sri Lankan team led by Bandula Warnapura which was another talented outfit then. The senior team nor the junior team let the Minister or the Sri Lankan cricket fans down because they shone well enabling us to gain Test status. As a matter of fact Navin’s team won all the matches bar one.
School cricket in my time from the sixties to the eighties when Navin played, the spectators attended the matches in hordes. They were from all ages and different strata of society. Nowadays the scenario had changed so much that most of the grounds where schools first eleven matches are played, only the teams and the umpires are left to be seen. When inquired about this pathetic situation Navin was of the view that there were too many schools matches being played. It used to be 9 matches per season in his day Navin pointed out that nowadays this has shot up to about 20 and as a result the player quality has dropped drastically.
Navin also noted that tuition classes had misguided the youth into neglecting sports and yet another valid reason was the cricket coaching “kades” where every Tom, Dick and Harry donning track suits and looking like “Manning Market mudalali’s“ have joined the band wagon to earn their fill in lining their pockets which is the name of the game in this unfortunate country of ours! No wonder the quality of schoolboy cricket has gone to the dogs. However mechanisms are to be installed in future and if they are to be properly streamlined and effectively executed we should be able to get quality schoolboy cricketers in the caliber of Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha, Ashley de Silva and the list goes on.
