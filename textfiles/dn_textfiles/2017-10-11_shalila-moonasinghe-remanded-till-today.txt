Shalila Moonasinghe remanded till today

Litro Gas Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe arrested in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to his personal account in Sri Lanka was yesterday ordered to be remanded till today (11) by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
According to CID reports, the Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$ 60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.
The CID initiated an investigation following a complaint made by Bank of Ceylon about this fraudulent money transaction on October 6. The Taiwanese government had also taken a decision to send investigators to Sri Lanka to probe the cyber money heist.
The CID arrested the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni of Rajagiriya last Friday, regarding the incident when he was attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyaram Trotsky had issued an order to the Immigration and Emigration Controller preventing Shalila Moonasinghe from leaving the country in connection with the Taiwan bank heist.
