Arjun Aloysius ordered to reveal his Apple user account name, password

Treasury Bond Commission of Inquiry:
The PCoI investigating into the Treasury bond issue yesterday (28) decided to issue a written order to Perpetual Treasuries Limited former CEO Arjun Aloysius to reveal his Apple User Account name and password to experts conducting a digital forensic examination over Aloysius’ digital communication devices.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda said Aloysius had initially claimed that he does not have an Apple user account. Later on, the investigators have found out that Aloysius has used an Apple user account to download certain applications.
Kodagoda said Aloysius refused to give his user account name and password while claiming that he cannot recall creating such an account. ASG Kodagoda requested the commissioners to summon Aloysius to the Commission on Monday and verbally order Aloysius who is under oath.
Kodagoda observed that certain legal actions could be taken lest Aloysius comply with the Commissions's order.
The Commission later decided to send a written order to Aloysius to provide the necessary information.
Following an order made by the Treasury Bond Commission, former PTL CEO Arjun Aloysius handed over all his communication devices including his mobile phone and laptop to the Criminal Investigations Department on July 24 evening.
