Lanka’s top archer cold  shouldered by association

Thisaru Disnaka who reached the qualification standard for the forthcoming 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina has been reportedly neglected by the Sri Lanka Archery Association who want the athlete to participate in the trials.
Only two athletes, Thisaru Disnaka and Kavisha Dalpathado participated in the world archery championships in Argentina last year and Thisaru was selected among the best sixteen archers after his performance.
For the first time in the history of Sri Lanka archery a 15-year old boy has achieved such a milestone. He qualified and secured ninth place out of 78 archers from 48 countries.
The Ministry of Sports proudly welcomed Thisaru after his achievement but the current situation in the Sri Lanka Archery Association is that they will select participants only from the trials. An official told the Daily News said that the Sri Lanka Archery Association wants to shut out Thisaru for no apparent reason.
"Due to a personnel grudge this archer is facing an issue. We hope the Minister of Sports will take necessary action regarding this matter," he said. "We are wasting our youth resources because of sports politics and this is why Sri Lanka sport ends up in bad situations.”
President of the Sri Lanka Archery Association Brigadier Rajeewa Wickramasinghe said that so far five archers had reached the selection standard including Thisaru in the local trials and the final trial will be held in August.
Due to Thisaru Disnaka’s best performance in the World Archery Championship Sri Lanka received the quota to participate at the Youth Olympic in Argentine this year.
