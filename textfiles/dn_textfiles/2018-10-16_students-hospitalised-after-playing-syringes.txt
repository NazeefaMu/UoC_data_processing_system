Eleven schoolchildren who had stabbed themselves with syringes were admitted to the Marawila Base Hospital before being transferred to the Chilaw General Hospital, last Friday.
Police said one of the students had brought a set of syringes to the school and during the interval, the children had played with them.
The school principal had rushed the students to the hospital and handed over the syringes to the Marawila Medical Officer of Health.
Blood samples of the students had been taken for medical examinations.
