Regulations for private hospitals from Feb. 1

The Health Ministry will commence regulating private hospitals from February 1, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne stated.
According to Minister Senaratne, an international organization named KPMG has already gathered information of the prices charged by all private hospitals in Sri Lanka for various services and forwarded a report to the Health Ministry.
After studying the report presented by the KPMG on the prices, arrangements will be made to establish a system to regulate private hospitals. The objective of the process is to offer a quality health service to the people at a reasonable price, according to the Minister.
The Health Ministry will also check on private hospitals which did not provide information for the survey conducted by the KPMG.
The price of expensive drugs will be reduced after introducing the regulating system for private hospitals. The Health Ministry sources said the Ministry had received several complaints from the public on charging unreasonable prices for various services offered to them by various private hospitals.
