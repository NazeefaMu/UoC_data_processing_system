31-day food challenge

A 31 day mission Malaysian artist and architect Hong Yi -aka Red- took upon her self to create a daily fun illustration with her food. Her parameters were simple: the image had to be comprised entirely of food and the only backdrop could be a white plate.
The project has been documented heavily around the web, but if you haven’t seen it all head over to her Facebook. Photos will also be appearing on her Instagram at @redhongyi.
