SLFP and govt. would protect Auditor General: Dayasiri

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the Government would protect the Auditor General as he is an impartial government officer, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said.
“The Auditor General has rendered a commendable service so far, but if he commits any mistake we would criticize him” the Minister added.
“He cannot investigate into treasury bond issuance numbering 2300 occasions at once. It had taken him three months to prepare the report on the inquiry into the questioned Treasury Bond issue. So how could he give a report on 2300 issuances at once?”
He made these observations in response to queries made by a media personnel at the Press Conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) head office in Colombo.
Minister Jayasekara said that the Auditor General is answerable only to Parliament and not anybody else. “The Finance Minister has no right to ask for documents from him,” Minister Jayasekara said.
“The Auditor General gives those documents as and when he is asked. As he has nothing to hide, he uploads them. The other matter is the Right to Information Bill has been passed in Parliament. What is the use of it, if information is concealed?”
He also told the Joint Opposition that they need not to worry about the security of the Auditor General as they would protect him. Gampaha District Parliamentarian Sudarshani Fernandopulle also participated.
