An open letter to President Maithripala Sirisena:  EXTINCT IS FOREVER

Dear Mr President,
I write as a concerned citizen of Sri Lanka. I have lived all my life in this country and truly appreciate the supremely beautiful flora and fauna that we are blessed with. My entire family emigrated to Australia, but it never entered my head to do the same and turn my back on my Motherland.
However, I am deeply saddened at the last few decades of wanton destruction of the environment. Sure, development must take place, but I personally know of many instances when environmental impact assessment reports are not carried out before undertaking major projects, in spite of vetos from the Central Environmental Authority and other environmentalists, who have done in-depth studies and research.
The Mahinda Rajapaksa regime created havoc in the Hambantota/Mattala/Colombo Port areas. Don’t take my word for it -look for yourselves. Is this sustainable development? Now that the damage is done and white elephants have been created, your government has no option but to make the best of it, inheriting enormous debts to the Chinese government and others.
But the point is: are you and your government going to make the same mistakes?
I voted for you, along with many of my friends. I personally was delighted that in your Manifesto you included protection of animals. I believed you and had great expectations of a radically changed society (Yahapalanaya), where citizens live by the rule of law. I am Chairperson of The Animal Protection Trust and can tell you that your Ministers and other government officials continuously block our efforts to promote the Animal Welfare Bill and the setting up of an independent Animal Authority.
Only last week there was another tragedy on the Habarana Road, where a baby elephant was killed by a speeding bus. Its mother tried to resuscitate it, by which time a crowd of people had gathered. To the humans, this was a chance to take photographs and videos, but to the mother elephant, it was intense sadness and bereavement. Animals, especially elephants, are intelligent and family orientated. Eventually, the mother was shot dead by the Police, I am told. Where were the Wildlife officers? Why could not the elephant have been tranquilised? The driver of the bus was apparently remanded. I can bet my bottom dollar that some politico will intervene and the driver will go scott free, without a fine or jail sentence.
So, two more elephants lose their lives. Totally preventable deaths.
A well-known animal activist contacted the Provincial Councillor of the North Central Province, offering, at her own expense, to erect large luminous signboards and speed humps on roads where wildlife cross and are vulnerable.
This was in April of this year. She had no response whatsoever. There was no commission or money to be gained, so the authorities were just not interested. Money and Power -that’s the name of the game!
Mr President, you and your government promote Buddhism and tolerance for all other religions, but the stark reality is that this country has a very bad track record relating to the protection of animals. The Buddha, who preached compassion to all living beings, must weep to see the misery and abuse that is taking place. You have the authority, given by us, the citizens of this country, to take action.
Live up to your noble traditions and take note before it is too late. Gather around you educated, sensible people to carry out your orders, not giving way to the ignorant, greedy, self-seeking officials, who have no love for the country. Take heed, or you will live to regret it.
In the final analysis, we should be true to ourselves. You are in a position to rule the land without fear or favour.
Do it!
