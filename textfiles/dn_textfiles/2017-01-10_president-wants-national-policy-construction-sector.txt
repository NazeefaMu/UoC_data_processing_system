President wants national policy for construction sector

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday emphasised the need for a national policy for the construction sector.
The President said it was important for a national policy for the construction industry and added it should be implemented with the cooperation of both the private and public sectors.
He made these observations at the launch of a green government buildings code and evaluation system at the BMICH.
President Sirisena pointed out that Sri Lanka was currently facing a number of issues due to population growth and added that several challenges have arisen due to the non-availability of a national policy on housing and building construction.
The programme to encourage maintain green buildings, while preserving the environment has been prepared by the Urban Development Authority and the Environment and Mahaweli Development Ministry under the guidance of the Presidential Secretariat. The President said haphazard construction paved the way for a number of challenges and issues and has posed a threat to the environment.
He said such construction will also affect the availability of land for plantations and cultivation in the future.
