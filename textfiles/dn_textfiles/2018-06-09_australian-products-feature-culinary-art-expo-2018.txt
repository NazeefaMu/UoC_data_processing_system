Australian products feature at Culinary Art Expo 2018

The Australian High Commission brought a flavour of Australia’s food and wine to Colombo on June 2 at the Culinary Art Expo - Sri Lanka’s leading food and beverage exhibition.
The Culinary Art Expo featured a Butchery Masterclass using high quality Australian lamb and beef. Leading local chefs taught participants knife skills and master cuts. The Butchery Masterclass was supported by Maybury Fine Foods Lanka, the Australian High Commission stated in a release.
Premium Australian wine was showcased by an experienced sommelier at another event. Presented by International Distillers Limited and Australian Vintage Limited, these wines won praise for their quality and value, sense of place and diversity of style, the release added.
Australian culinary skills and training offerings were highlighted in a video presentation by TAFE South Australia, one of the country’s largest vocational education providers. TAFE South Australia’s International Centre for Hospitality, Tourism and Food Studies is an integral part of South Australia’s thriving food and wine industry.
As Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality sectors grow, Australia is ideally placed to meet the demand for premium food and beverage products. Australia has the fresh produce the industry demands and Australia has the skills and education capability needed to drive Sri Lankan hospitality to the next level to give Sri Lankans and visitors alike a fantastic food and wine experience, the release stated.
