Be that light!

Lives of all great men teach us that we can make our lives as sublime and leave our footprints on the sand of time. She put this quote into perspective and deed by helping the needy from her early years.
Touching many lives through her words and work Sheshadri Kottearachchi continues her mission with the same zeal she possessed many years ago.
“I experienced injustice which was directed specifically towards young people during my school and university days. Yes, there will always be something or someone who crosses your path and brings your progress to a halt, but it’s your responsibility to develop your capabilities to an extent where no challenge is tough enough to hold you down. It’s a difficult process, undoubtedly, but it’s important to engrain a sense of optimism and confidence in young people. We tend to be easily discouraged and the last thing this country needs is a proactive portion of the population that feels like they are not good enough,” Sheshadri enthused.

The 25-year-old past pupil and former Head Girl of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo, had represented the country at the 72nd meeting of the Third Committee at the General Assembly in New York, 2017. She had also delivered the youth statement, based on the agenda of “Social development, including questions relating to the world social situation and to youth, ageing, persons with disabilities and the family” at the event. She had worked closely with youth delegates from countries like Switzerland, Germany and Georgia to formulate a working-paper on representation of youth in national policy-making.
She had been noted for her leadership, public speaking and debating skills. She had won the title of the Best Delegate of Security Council at Everest International Model United Nations in 2017. She had been awarded the prize for Best Leader of the Year 2010 by former president Mahinda Rajapakse. She bagged the Colombo Toastmasters Club All Island Best Speakers Competition’s Bartleet Challenge Trophy in 2012 and became the Best Speaker of the Kelaniya Intra-University Debating competition in 2013. She also became the Best Speaker at the 12th Dr. Mahbub Ul Huq Memorial Interschool Debate, organized by the UNDP and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.

“The ‘perfect recipe’ for a good leader isn’t written in stone. A good leader evolves with time and adds or removes certain attributes of their personality for the sake of improvement I appreciate leadership qualities like dedication, an inspiring personality, an understanding soul, reliability and optimism. With dedication comes passion in what you are involved in and the motivation to keep going. Someone who is passionate about their work or their purpose in life will work hard to see it develop into something better. They know what it means to slowly, but steadily nurture a good cause,” Sheshadri opined.
Her first big win came when she clinched the title of Colombo Toastmasters Club’s All Island Best Speakers Competition soon after she had completed her schooling. She says that she had taken part in the event not because she was vying for the glory of winning but to prove to herself that she could speak in a public setting without feeling nervous.
“Despite being a debater, inter-school award-winning announcer and MUN delegate, I had a fear of public speaking which I was keen to shake off. The process up to the semi-finals of the competition was daunting. I remember feeling extremely intimidated by the older, more experienced competitors. I was so convinced that this was as far as I would make it, that when they announced the winner (me!) it took me a few moments to respond accordingly as I was sitting in a corner, envisioning my speech for next year,” she recalled with a smile.

She says that inspiring people brings about waves of change, because they are able to reach out to others on an emotional level.
“Being able to inspire people to do better and be better can create revolutionary changes if we allow it. You can call them, ‘role models’ – people who set good examples and motivate other people to do the same. We tend to mimic, or at least appreciate what we see more of. If you spend time with someone who has a well-rounded personality, chances are, this will influence you too. On the other hand, if you’re exposed to someone with questionable values, you might find yourself spiralling downwards,” she said.
She says that her biggest inspiration in life comes from her grandfather. His own grandfather had been the national hero and author Piyadasa Sirisena from whom Sheshadri and her grandfather had picked up their life- long love of books.
“This has been the best gift anyone has given me. He was a simple man – somewhat stern and a brilliant singer - who believed in always doing what was right, no matter how difficult it may be.

When he was alive, seeya was one of my biggest supporters; always showing up for plays I acted in as a child, taking me to the library and telling me stories about his life growing up in a village. One of my fondest memories of him was how he used to head outside in the hot sun and fill in the cracks on the road with cement. When I asked him why he bothered to do so (he no longer owned a car himself),he simply replied “It isn’t good for people’s tyres when they constantly fall into these holes – so I’m fixing the road to prevent that”,” Sheshadri enthused.
Reading and writing skills come hand in hand. Sheshadri published her maiden novel titled ‘City Lights’ when she was 12. She also hopes to publish a collection of poetry and prose soon. She says that she herself is her harshest critic and is obsessively thinking how she could have done a certain task better.
She notes, “While it is always great to evaluate yourself, it opens up a floodgate of doubt and allows other people to do doubt you too. In that sense, learning to differentiate between constructive criticism and scathing remarks has been a game-changer. It’s important to listen and improve but it is also important to take a step back and appreciate what you’ve done so far.”
Born and raised in the suburbs of Kelaniya Sheshadri grew up in a setting which was full of books and art supplies. Her father, Lalith Kottearachchi, is a businessman while her mother, Shehara Sirisena, is a a full-time matriarch. Her sister, Senara, is a decade younger than her. Her family as well as her grandmother, Malini Sirisena, has been understanding and supporting her work.
Sheshadri is employed as the Communications Coordinator for Oxfam in Sri Lanka. As the United Nations Youth Delegate she also supports youth oriented programmes. Though hectic she says that her roles are educational and challenging.

At the UN Headquarters in New York
“I am quite the workaholic and what better than to be busy yet love what you do at the same time! I travel and work with different communities across the island through my work at Oxfam. Our team focuses on poverty alleviation, women’s empowerment and improved sanitation, among other thematic areas; covering a wide scope of prevailing issues that average Sri Lankans face on a day-to-day basis. This has definitely opened my eyes to the pressing issues we face as youth and as citizens of this country. It helps piece together the many aspects that build our society and also brings out the problems that need to be addressed,” Sheshadri pointed out adding that as a UN Youth Delegate her areas in focus are self-development, education, gender equality and the anti-ragging movement in universities.
“Many groups I have worked with are motivated and have a clear vision of what they want to accomplish. Realizing that the future of Sri Lanka lies in the hands of a talented, motivated crowd of young people is reassuring. What remains is the need to give them a final push towards their goals,” she stressed.
Queried on what she thinks is the most crucial issue concerning Sri Lankan youth today and prompt comes the answer.
“Sri Lankan youth have lost faith in themselves. How can we blame them? The socio-political landscape of this country is quite unforgiving and undoubtedly leads to a lot of issues; particularly among youth, who are a volatile segment of society. We lack the space and freedom to explore our options and because of this, seldom do we see young people breaking apart from traditional lives. Thinking outside the box is a risk that many hesitate to take and plenty of talent is lost in the process. Of course, we must be grateful for new programmes which are slowly emerging; promoting innovation and creativity. But such platforms don’t always reach the far corners of the island - which is a shame. There is a lot of untapped potential in Sri Lanka. Young people are a gold-mine of resources but seldom are it seen that way.
The archaic misconception that young people are trouble-makers still exists in Sri Lanka, when in reality, if given a platform for expression. One can easily find trailblazing personalities in every part of the country,” she said.
She proposes restructuring the education system as one means of solving the issue.
“I know this has been said over and over again to no avail, but it is where we ought to begin. We need to change the way we educate ourselves and by this I mean, we need to start thinking ahead and prepare ourselves for future challenges instead of depending on outdated textbooks and replicating parroted answers onto an exam paper,” Sheshadri adds.
One of her favourite quotes in life is Winston Churchill’s “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”
“I am a huge advocate of ‘looking on the bright side’ and while this is often contested as being ‘detached from reality,’ I firmly believe that our reality is what we make it out to be. Being optimistic and always trying to find good in anything you do, is important. It helps you find faith and the energy to keep moving, no matter how challenging a situation can be. An optimistic leader can boost the morale of everyone who looks up to them. In this day and age, where the world seems bleak and problematic, I look to leaders who have an inkling of faith in the goodness of people and are optimistic about what we’re capable of achieving,” Sheshadri mused.
She aspires to continue her work for the humanitarian and development sector and be a part of the life-changing endeavours people make, globally.
“I want to empower young people and help make Sri Lanka an example for the rest of the world. We are a nation that has endured a lot of grief and yet to this day, we remain hopeful and hungry for a better future. It’s amazing how after all our people have gone through, we still have warmth and kindness in our hearts. This motivation is an inherent part of our identity and if nurtured properly, can help us move forward as a nation,” Sheshadri said.
“Don’t be afraid to be who you are. The world will do everything in its power to make you feel insignificant, that your ideas aren’t ‘normal’ and that your voice deserves to be drowned in a cacophony of ‘nay-sayers.’ Don’t let that hold you back. Work hard.
Develop your uniqueness. Appreciate your support system. Don’t let anything dull your shine. As Dumbledore rightfully said, “Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times. If only one remembers to turn on the light.” Be that light,” she concluded with a smile.
