Meet  Madame Eyebrows!

This is Madam Eyebrows
She’s an English bulldog who lives in Germany with her human family and best friend Luna. And she’s got pretty distinctive markings which go towards her overall unique look...kinda like a sad dog clown.
‘She always looked sad and had eyebrows,’ her owner, Janina, tells The Dodo.
But don’t be fooled by her permanently grumpy, disenchanted look. Janina says that Madame is actually very happy and goes around wiggling her tail and giving kisses.
‘In real life, you have to see her only a few minutes and you see that she is happy. We don’t see only her sad face. We see how funny she is! And how much love she gives to us.’
But this is nothing new, for Madam Eyebrows was born looking forlorn Metro
