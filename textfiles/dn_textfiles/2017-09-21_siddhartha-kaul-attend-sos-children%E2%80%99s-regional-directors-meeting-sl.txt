Siddhartha Kaul to attend SOS Children’s regional directors' meeting in SL

Siddhartha Kaul, President, SOS Children’s Villages International, arrives in Sri Lanka on September 23 to head the annual regional directors meeting to be held from September 24 at the National Training Centre in Piliyandala.
The regional directors’ meeting is held annually in Austria at the SOS International office. However, for the first time, the meeting has been organized in Sri Lanka to strategize and discuss the current status, the way forward and the initiation of the SOS Care Guarantee for children and young adults.
The regional meeting will further elaborate discussions on living an independent life, the importance of education, employability, preparation for living and after care which focuses on specific areas of need. Following these key fundamentals, there will be discussions on gradually decreasing support whilst enabling and maintaining lifelong ties with SOS families currently occupying the SOS Villages across 134 countries.
Commenting on Siddhartha Kaul’s visit, Divakar Ratnadurai, Deputy National Director, SOS Children’s Villages, Sri Lanka said, “It is our privilege and joy to welcome back our President Sidhartha Kaul to his second home, the SOS Children’s Village in Piliyandala. President Kaul built this village in 1979 as a young man and to date, we celebrate his efforts that he invested to make SOS Children’s Villages in Sri Lanka a reality and a success that it is today.”
Coinciding with the SOS Children’s Regional Meeting will be the launch of the Pragna Education Fund on September 27 with the support of Hatton National Bank.
Kaul stresses that “no child should grow up alone and the success and impact of our work is and shall be reflected in what the young people in our programmes achieve”.
