Virtusa announced the launch of “Virtusa Tech Month”, a celebration of the company’s innovative spirit and technology leadership, at its Colombo Advanced Technology Center recently.
Bringing together Virtusans from across various practices and domains including Healthcare, Communications, Media and Information Industries (CMI), Banking and Financial Services (BFS) and FinTech, the event seeks to facilitate greater sharing of knowledge, expertise and learnings on how the company leverages emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Blockchain, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Internet of Things (IOT) to reimagine customers’ businesses in an increasingly digital world.
Virtusa Technology and Chief Software Architect and Vice President Thushera Kawdawatta, who is spearheading this initiative said, “Across practices, our teams continue to leverage emerging technologies to reimagine the digital future in each of their realms. The rapid pace of transformation taking place in these spheres within the company brings with it a wealth of accumulated knowledge that often tends to remain within the individual teams.”
“Hence, we host events such as the Virtusa Tech Month from time to time to enable greater interaction amongst our teams, allowing them to learn more about the how each practice and project leverages different technologies in its own unique way to accelerate business outcomes for our clients,” he added.
The month-long event will consist of workshops and meetups dedicated to various technologies, whitepaper competitions, gamified idea generation contests, coding contests that test participants for speed, quality and creativity, hackathons to build something useful in short time span, etc.  A host of preeminent local and international speakers from the world of business, technology and academics will share invaluable insights during the TechTalk/Meetup sessions throughout the month.
The event will conclude with a ‘Tech Day’ exhibition where teams from Virtusa and partner universities are set to showcase some of the innovations, technology usage and cool projects they are working on.
