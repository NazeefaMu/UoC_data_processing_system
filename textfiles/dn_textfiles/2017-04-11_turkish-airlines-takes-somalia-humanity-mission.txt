Turkish Airlines quickly responded to this call for action which has turned out to be one of the most powerful social responsibility campaigns of all times. In response to the demand of Jerome and his friends to carry humanitarian help to Somalia, Turkish Airlines as the only airline that connects Somalia to the world tweeted the message “We had a call for a journey of love and action” and announced that, they will support the campaign by carrying 200 tons of humanitarian aid to Somalia in the coming 6 months.

In the 15th day, money raised reached over $2.4 million with 80.000 contributors from 125 countries.
Initially 65 tons of high protein baby formulas were delivered to Somalia with the Turkish Airlines cargo jet which took off from Istanbul on the evening of April 4th. The cargo jet was met by local NGO delegates, Federal Republic of Somalia officials including Health Minister Fowsiya Abiikar Nur, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Salad along with Ambassador of Turkish Republic to Somalia Olgan Bekar and Turkish Airlines SVP Corporate Communication Seda Kalyoncu.
Somalian Ministers expressed their gratitude initially to the social media phenomenon, the Turkish Republic for their constant support as from 2011 and to the Turkish Airlines. On the campaign, Turkish Airlines SVP Corporate Communication Seda Kalyoncu commented as follows; “We are here to support the people of Somalia who are fighting with one of the worst hunger and drought disasters of our age.
