About 856 traders who tried to sell outdated and unfit food items have been nabbed by officials of the Consumer Affairs Authority and the PHIs of the Kurunegala District during past four days.
Meanwhile, 28 traders who sold unfit food to consumers during the festive season have been arrested by PHIs of the Mahawewa MOH area. About 257 groceries and shops have been raided to crack down on these errant traders.
