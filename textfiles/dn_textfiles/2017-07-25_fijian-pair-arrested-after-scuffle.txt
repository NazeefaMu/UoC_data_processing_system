Fijian pair arrested after scuffle

Paris: Fiji rugby stars Josaia Raisuqe and Vuidravuwalu Waisea were arrested in the early hours of Sunday, after allegedly getting into a drunken scuffle outside a Paris nightclub in which a woman claimed she was sexually assaulted.
The players, who are on the books of French Top 14 side Stade Francais, were still in custody on Sunday afternoon after being picked up by police at around 3 a.m., a source said.
A woman alleged that Raisuqe had “touched her breasts in a brutal way”, the source told AFP.
A fight then broke out between the two players and friends of the young woman.
In a statement, Stade Francais called for Twitter users to exercise caution in their views “in the absence of official information”. AFP
