Elect best candidates devoid of corruption - PAFFREL Executive Director

The people have to go to the polling center at the local government election and elect the best candidates devoid of corruption in order to convey the message to the political parties that they cannot win elections with the corrupted politicians, said People's Action for Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi yesterday.
He said that this is a test case and all the voters have to vote at this election and to elect the best candidates to serve their own ward. He made these observations yesterday during a press conference organized by the March 12 Movement held at the CSR, Maradana.
He said that however the people's right to select their own candidate has been deprived from them as the political parties select them.
He added it has to be changed saying although all the parties speak of the clean politics, all have so far failed to submit the criteria that they should have to select the candidates.
Samadani Kiriwandeniya of Sanasa Development Bank speaking at the press conference said that when she spoke to people in Jaffna, Kottawa etc, it seemed that there would be a draw back in the numbers that would go to the polling centre at the local government election. She said that but more people should go to the polling centre this election than the presidential election since this is the one that would elect the politicians that would work directly to the ward itself. She said that this election should be the one that would elect members to protect the environment in the ward, select the best development project to the ward, select projects that would prevent women going abroad for employment and electing capable female representatives rather than those male representatives who would only attend on passing tenders.
Manjula Gajanayake from Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV), Athauda Seneviratne from Organization of Professional Association, Shashee de Mel from Transparency International and Pradeepa from Mothers and Daughters of Lanka also expressed their views at the occasion.
