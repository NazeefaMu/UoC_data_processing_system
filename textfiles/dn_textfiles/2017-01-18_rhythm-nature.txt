Rhythm of nature

The Hempel Galleries presented Shaping Texture by Sue Harrigan recently at the Amangalla Spa, Fort Galle, Sri Lanka.
Harrigan’s love of natural form and texture is revealed in her interpretation of the human form, pattern and texture, which she will be presenting for the first time in Sri Lanka.
“The ancient olive trees in the surrounding area of my home in northern Tuscany embody this. I see the twisted trunks resembling pleated silk skirts; knurled deformities as billowing fabric and the intertwined boughs soaring their way to heaven, as female bodies frozen in time. The rhythm of nature beats at the heart of my work.”
Harrigan grew up in the UK on the edge of Dartmoor, in the vast wilderness. This proved to be an inspiration for her creativity from an early age. After leaving Kingston Art School, she worked in Rome with top fashion designers such as Valentino and Alberto Feretti and taught Fashion illustration in Florence and London where her work was regularly reproduced in fashion publications.
Harrigan now splits her time between Tuscany, the UK and Sri Lanka:-
“ I have lived in Sri Lanka too: revelling in the colour and vibrancy of daily life and nature; the form of the Bodhi trees inspiring my work, is an accretion of my perceptions and observations.”
