FIFA on top of the world at Vistas

With the 2018 FIFA World Cup just around the corner, Mövenpick Hotel Colombo is gearing up to entertain guests, 24 storeys high at Vistas, the most happening rooftop bar and lounge in town. The FIFA World Cup is the single largest sporting event in the world and will be hosted in Russia between June 14 and July15. During this time, Vistas will be transformed into a vibrant outdoor spot with giant screens, meal deals and entertainment not only for sports lovers, but something for everyone to enjoy.
During the World Cup, guests can participate in a daily half time quiz with a variety of prizes, together with a special menu designed just for the games, featuring common favourites ranging from hot dogs to satays, good ol’ fish n’ chips, burgers and wadeys. Boasting spectacular 360 views of Colombo guests can enjoy panoramic sunsets and breathtaking ocean sights from its impressive location, a venue offering the kind of scenes that would be the envy of restaurants across the island.
