Alcohol-free SLFP 66th Anniversary celebrations

 
Fisheries Minster and United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the 66th anniversary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) would be the biggest event in the recent political history – and would also be entirely free of alcohol.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo this afternoon Amaraweera said President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed all electoral organizers to strictly prohibit all alcohol at or before the event.
The 66th anniversary of the SLFP will be celebrated on September 2 and the Campbell Park in Colombo.  The 64th anniversary of the SLFP was held in Polonnaruwa with the participation of about 10,000 people and the 65th anniversary held in Kurunegala.
