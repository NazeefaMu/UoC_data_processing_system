Plan to keep elephants away from landfill sites

Programme in nine LG bodies:
Fifty four landfill areas within elephants' reach:
Japanese manufactured compost plants will be established in nine local government bodies to prevent landfill sites from turning into feeding grounds of wild elephants.
The nine areas are: Mahara Pradeshiya Sabha, Ibbagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, Wadamarachchi Pradeshiya Sabha, Hambantota Municipal Council, Addalaichena Pradeshiya Sabha, Bandarawela Municipal Council, Kegalle Urban Council, Dambulla Municipal Council and Polonnaruwa Municipal Council areas. A joint proposal on the compost plants submitted by Wildlife and Sustainable Development Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha, was approved by the Cabinet.
The Wildlife Ministry has identified 54 landfill areas near wildlife sanctuaries, which have become accessible to elephants. The ministry estimates that over 300 elephants congregate around these sites daily for food.
The elephant when used to the consumption of garbage makes it a habit to have garbage regularly. The herds of elephants that come to such places are seemingly increasing by the day. Unsegregated polythene, residual food, rotten meat / fish and other poisonous substances are infected with bacteria cause the animal to fall sick and shortens its lifespan.
In March, the media reported of a 20-year-old elephant dying near the Manampitiya garbage dump due to toxic bacteria from the rotten food in the dump.
A World Bank report estimates that each Sri Lankan would generate 1kg of garbage per day by 2025.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry has proposed that the Rs. 1,660 million Korean loan facility made available for 2017 be used to purchase compost plants from the company, Kawishima Pvt Ltd. One of their plants functions in the Kundasale Pradeshiya Sabha and handles 17 metric tons of biodegradable waste. The plant costing Rs. 123 million can handle up to 50 metric tons of waste per day and will take 60 days to produce organic fertilizer. The project will be launched as a commercial venture.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry will extent the waste segregation programme to all local government authorities in the country. The Wildlife Ministry will build electric fences around waste disposal sites to prevent elephants from having access to garbage.
