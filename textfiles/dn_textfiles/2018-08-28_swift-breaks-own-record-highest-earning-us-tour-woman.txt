Swift breaks own record for highest-earning US tour by a woman

Taylor Swift has broken her own record for the highest-grossing US tour by a female artist. ‘The Look What You Made Me Do’ singer has been trekking across the US and other nations since May on her epic Reputation Stadium Tour.
Her US gigs alone have now made an incredible $191.1 million (£148 million), according to Billboard.com, meaning that with 11 American dates still to play she has surpassed the gross earnings of the previous record holder, her 1989 World Tour - which made $181.5 million (£140.5 million) in 2015.
During the tour, she has averaged earnings of more than $7 million (£5.4 million) per show - with all 27 of her completed dates sold out. The pop princess is having a brief break from the road after performing at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida on August19.
After the gig, she praised hometown girl Camila Cabello - who has supported her alongside British singer-songwriter Charli XCX throughout the tour.
“MIAMI I LOVE YOU!! You were so loud and FUN,” she wrote on her Tumblr page. “Shout out to Camila for killing it in her hometown and being just the greatest most precious magical human possible.”
In addition to her US gigs, Taylor has also performed in the UK, Ireland and Canada, with the latter concerts having grossed $11.1 million (£8.5 million). Figures for her British and Irish dates are yet to come in, and unlike in the US, not all of these shows sold out.
She will conclude the tour in Australia, New Zealand and Japan - meaning the worldwide takings from the Reputation Stadium Tour should easily surpass the $250 million (£193 million) her 1989 live dates made globally - and may come close to beating the $408 million (£316 million) Madonna’s Sticky & Sweet Tour made in 2008 and 2009, the most earned globally by a female artist.
