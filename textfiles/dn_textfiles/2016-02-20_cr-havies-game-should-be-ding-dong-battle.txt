CR-Havies game should be a ding dong battle

CR and FC who suffered a nail-biting 15-12 defeat at the hands of Kandy SC in Nittawela last week will go all out to make amends for it when they take on Havelocks SC in their Dialog 'A' Division League return rugby match at Havelock Park today. Kickoff is at 6.45pm under lights.
The lads from Longden Place went down 34-18 in the first round game played on their home ground and another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected. CR will miss the services of sturdily built hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya, winger Anuradha Herath and flanker Dilanka Perera who are on the injured list.
The Park club will be sans Dulaj Perera and Danushka Ranjan who are also down with injuries. Flanker Shenal Deelaka who missed the last match due to injury makes a welcome return to the Havelocks team.
Havelocks who scored a hard fought 27-24 victory against Police SC last week will strive hard to pull off this game in their favour.
CR and FC (Probable XV): Nipuna Devinda, Lahiru Pavithra, Shane Sambandapperuma, Ishan Noor (captain), Panduka Angammana, Sasanka Ariyaratna, Jason Dissanayake, Arun Kumar, Kavindu de Costha and Tharinda Ratwatte, Bhanuka Nanayakkara, Ashan de Costa, Kanchana Ramanayake, Kavindu Perera, Prince Chamara.
Havelocks (Probable XV): Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Prasad Padmasanka, Ganuka Dissanayaka, Sithum Peiris, Janik Jayasuriya, Shenal Deelaka, Rohitha Rajapaksa, Sudarshana Muthuthantri, Rahul de Silva and Samantha Lakshan, Kevin Dixon, Nishon Perera, Hirantha Perera, Sadun Herath (captain), Rimzie Jamaldeen.
Kandy go out favourites
The high-riding Kandy SC will go out favourites against Navy SC in their Dialog 'A' Division League return game at Welisara today. Match commences at 4.30pm.
Kandy gave a pathetic display against CR and FC last week at Nittawela and will have to come up with a much better performance if they hope to overcome the Sailors who have notched up victories over CR, Army, and Police before holding the much fancied Havies to a remarkable 20-all draw at Havelock Park.
The forte of the Navy side have been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with another superb display with Roshan Ranasinghe, Sathya Ranatunga, Supun Peiris, Nivanka Prasad, Matheesha Sarathchandra and Sajith Saranga likely to give of their best.
Navy SC (Probable XV): Roshan Ranasinghe, Nisal Desatha, Sathya Ranatunga, Matheesha Sarathchandra,, Chathura Dilshan, Supun Peiris, Nivanka Prasad, Sajith Saranga, Richie Dharmapala and Chanaka Chandimal, Saliya Handapangoda, Lee Keegal, Kosala Thisera, Heshan Maduranga, Thilina Weerasinghe.
Kandy SC (Probable XV): Piyumal Manchanayaka, Damith Dissanayake, Kishore Jehan, Shehan Dimitri, Gayan Ratnayake, Heshan Kalhara, Shehan Pathirana, Buwaneka Udangamuwa, Roshan Weeraratna (captain) or Srinath Sooriyabandara and Nigel Ratwatte, Richard Darmapala, Gayan Weeraratne, Lavanga Perera, Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Danusha Dayan.
