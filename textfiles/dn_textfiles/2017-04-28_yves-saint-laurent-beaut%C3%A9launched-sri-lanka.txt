Yves Saint Laurent Beautélaunched in Sri Lanka

Parisian couture brand, Yves Saint Laurent (YSL), launched its makeup range in Sri Lanka during a formal cocktail event at the Galle Face Hotel. The event was attended by VIP customers of the luxury fragrance, skin care and cosmetics retailer, Exclusive Lines of the Pee Bee Group. Exclusive Lines is the sole agent for Yves Saint Laurent in Sri Lanka.
Yves Saint Laurent was originally a French luxury fashion house that was founded by designers Yves Saint Laurent and his partner Pierre Berge. Currently it markets a broad luxury range of women’s and men’s clothing, leather goods, shoes and jewellery. YSL Beauty products have a notable presence in the luxury beauty market across the globe.
Speaking at the launch, Jerome Georges-Vivien, the Zone Director for Yves Saint Laurent said: “YSL fragrances have already been in the country for some time and we felt that it was the right time to launch the beauty products.”
“YSL was originally known for their couture and thereafter that they introduced accessories, such as watches and handbags. Luxury fragrances followed and that’s where my interest lies. About 25 years ago we never had an opportunity to introduce any kind of couture in Sri Lanka,” said Exclusive Lines Director , Hiru Surtani.
YSL offers a wide range of beauty products for women from lipsticks, eye shadow palettes, mascara and make up brushes as well as several others. The brand has also introduced an extensivecollection of perfumes for both men and women. YSL’s fragrance line includes many that are considered pillars of the perfume industry such as Mon Paris, Black Opium, La Nuit de L’Homme.
