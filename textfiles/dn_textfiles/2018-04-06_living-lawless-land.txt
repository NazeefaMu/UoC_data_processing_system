Living in a lawless land

The canopy of the news bulletin on every television channel or radio at present is supported by four main columns of news - killings, accidents, drugs and hooch, and roadblock demonstrations, with a considerable extent of its inside crammed with tidbits of violence, burglary, civil commotion, natural disasters etc., while the rest is taken up by political bunkum. Hardly there is news on anything constructive and optimistic which clearly reflects what is going on in the country.
With so many incidents of violence, killings, robberies, extortions and mayhem taking place in the country regularly, it is apparent that the laws currently in force have become inadequate in thwarting the rapid rise in criminal activities. While everything seems to change with the needs of the rising population, the centuries-old legislation still remains static. One obvious reason for this is that many of those who are responsible for criminal acts are protected by politicians due to their heavy dependence on the underworld for achieving sordid ends.
The interference of politicians with the law enforcement authorities for safeguarding underworld characters they favor is a common occurrence in this country. Whoever comes to power, this deplorable situation continues to thrive, seriously affecting the police in combating crime. Instead of being rewarded, many staunch police officers who are brave enough to deal with the kingpins of the underworld get immediate transfers to difficult areas due to the influence of politicians. Corrupt politicians who outnumber the honest ones are a curse to this country and it is impossible to expect a change in this situation as many of the new entrants to this stream are also devoid of the qualities of real statesmen.
People’s expectations
It is an open secret that politicians are behind the disappearance of those who know too well about them and it has been the fate of many missing journalists who have sacrificed their lives for exposing these nefarious characters to the public. Armed with the cloak of democracy, many politicians now have pistols instead of daggers hidden behind to suit the times. Sri Lanka is not an exception when compared to the countries of South Asia where almost anything can be bought if surplus money is spent, which includes law as well. With plentiful ill-earned money, there is noting that politicians find impossible. This is a sad truth known to many but there is hardly anything the general public can do except grin and bear under such circumstances.
Those who came to power by ousting the last regime that was on a dictatorial path with heavy nepotism in its wake too failed in fulfilling people’s expectations. The promise they gave for exposing the corrupt politicians too became a damp squib. Even after gathering enough evidence to bring the embezzlers of public funds to book, they shelved them until the time of provincial elections to make the best use of them as a tool, which in fact backfired in quite an unexpected manner, making them lose the confidence the public had in them that they would expose the wrongdoers which has become lackadaisical even at present.
The leaders of the ruling party which has become an epitome of incompatibility, have been ranting about speedy development in the country with large-scale industries and export-oriented businesses, none of which has been materialized as assured. Bringing down the cost of living and the price of commodities is but a pipe dream, but there should have been a pragmatic approach to taking away its heavy pressure through effective opportunities made available to the general public.
Dignified statesmen
However, their vision seems to have confined only to mere words, the best example of it can be had from no less a person than the president who makes so many pledges woven in fine fanciful tapestries of words while making public deliveries. They are so beautifully-worded, but in fact, there is noting more than the shiny sparks of a sky rocket - nice to behold, nothing to gain! The case is similar even with the prime minister. Pledges that span heaven and earth, with nothing in reality, have made people progressively lose the confidence they had in him. It would be futile to speak of others who come below them, as they are worse than their leaders when it comes to action.
In such a situation what can be expected by the masses? Obviously, noting else but leaning against those who they had rejected once! There is no other option. This is what has been happening in this country ever since the gaining of independence. Only those who ruled this country immediately after the independence could be rightfully honoured as dignified statesmen. D S Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake and Bandaranaike belong to this exclusive class of luminaries. With their demise, the period of statesmen too came to an end and we would never see leaders of their ilk ever again in Sri Lanka. They spent their personal wealth for the wellbeing of the country, whereas the present day politicians mercilessly rake off whatever meant for the general public for their own gain.
The present political system is so chaotic that whatever the government does is hotly contradicted by the opposition. Never there has been any consensus and praise for the ruling party for the good deeds the government does at least occasionally. We should take a lesson from the western world for political coexistence which is never found in this land. The latest strategy used by the former president is to visit all the leading temples in the country and make it an occasion to air his views criticizing the government and rabble-rousing. If his sole intention is to pay homage to the prelates of the temples he visits, he should opt for a less dramatic role and discourage the paparazzi who flock around him for politically-motivated excerpts by making it clear to them the real purpose of his visit to the temple.
People in Sri Lanka are yet to be politically matured. What they do is turning from green to blue and vice versa, always keeping the red at bay! They expect to find solace through bringing the other party to power once when they are hard bitten during a particular reign. In this process, they wide open the sluice gates of polls in anger without making them hang in balance. Making landslide victories with indiscriminate voting in desperation eventually makes people’s voices drown for another lustrum. Unfortunately, this situation will prevail as long as people in Sri Lanka are politically ignorant and the light at the end of the tunnel seems very far!
We will leave the arena of politics and have a look at our society which is as chaotic as politics. When it comes to entertainment, undoubtedly television takes precedence with the main theme being tele-dramas. Many of the tele-dramas currently aired by almost all channels in this country are built around the society in which we live. Since of late, most of the tele-drama makers have begun to feel that their efforts are futile if pistol-totting characters are not included in them. Years ago, spectators could barely see a pistol but now it has become so ubiquitous that every tele-drama has one or more characters wielding this weapon.
With the escalation of violence which is also given prominence on television, where the usage of pistols or hauling of them from thugs are regularly highlighted, corresponding effort is also made to give this weapon the same stature with the multiple use of it in many of the stories seen by all alike. This may induce the young ones a craving to wield such a weapon as done by their heroes. This is the beginning of a gun culture. The possession of a weapon nowadays is not that difficult, as many of them are strewn around the country due to the war. The liking they get after seeing it in action may make them trigger-happy, which would eventually result in begetting yet another despicable and dangerous character in the society. Sri Lanka has already made a name for its crime rate, and with this new gun-culture, it would be obviously elevated to a higher level of notoriety.
Self-centered
We get to see the wanton destruction of forests and elephants by loggers and poachers protected by insensible politicians who are only interested in their personal gain with merciless disregard of the eventual damage it does to the ecosystem of the country. Indiscriminate clearance of lowlands of trees in the vicinity of high mountains has caused soil erosion and given way to landslides with the slightest rain which has not been heard of so often in the past. All this happens as people have become self-centered without respecting the laws of nature.
Since of late, the insensitive speed fiends have made the road a death-trap for other users. Mowing down pedestrians even on zebra crossings is all too common and a daily occurrence in Sri Lanka. At least there are four or five head on crashes reported from all over the island. A novel excuse of careless drivers who make so many road accidents is something strange - ‘they have fallen asleep on the wheel’ Farcical, isn’t it? Something as such has not been heard of before! Speeding vehicles crash into houses and boutiques, while some dive straight into rivers and canals. Why the laws governing the speed of vehicles cannot be revised to suit the present conditions, taking into account the steady increase in the number of vehicles and reckless drivers? While the speed fiends hog the road, helpless pedestrians have to stake their lives on the road. This dire situation should receive priority in putting an end to losing so many lives on the road.
It has become a way of life for factions instigated by politicians to use public roads to stage demonstrations. Regardless of the difficulties that stem from such an act, these insensible protesters keep the roads impassable for long hours until they are dispersed with water cannon and baton charge by the police. Those who get injured in dispersion become overnight heroes, backed by politicians who take unfair advantage of it to protest against the state for breach of democracy. What they purposefully fail to note in such a callous act is the inconvenience and despair it causes to thousands of others who are not concerned in such an act. There can be people rushing off to the nearest hospital with a patient for urgent medical assistance, to the airport to be in time for the place, or to beat the deadline of an urgent commitment, or many other important tasks. All this is lost because of one single irresponsible act. It is ridiculous that this undesirable strategy has been employed by some people as a means of settling their domestic problems as well. One such instance has been highlighted recently over the conflict of possession of the ownership of a young girl in a family. Why the authorities are dormant in enforcing law to keep protesters off public roads? If the existing laws do not have strong enough teeth, it is the duty of the legislature to replace them to suit the present conditions.
This can be the only country where Buddhist monks take to the road for staging protests, steadily losing their stature. It is obvious they have become tools of political leaders who simply manipulate them indiscriminately. No other religious leaders who belong to the other two main religions in Sri Lanka have condescended so low as to lose their dignity by participating in similar incidents.
Reap political benefits
Yet another despicable act of politicians is to instigate the masses on communal grounds to wreak havoc and reap political benefits out of it, as made evident by the recent incidents in Kandy.
Rigorous laws as found in many other countries such as Saudi Arabia should be imposed in this country too if the outcome to be truly effective. This may sound harsh but the end result would be greater safety and a haven for people. It has become a habit of bringing up democracy as a shield against whatever bad done in this country. Would it be possible for the so-called democracy to bring down the rate of crime and make this country safer for people? What is the use of such democracy if the entire nation is given freedom to act on its own, allowed to run wild, regardless of others who are law abiding?
