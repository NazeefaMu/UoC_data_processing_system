Well water under-utilized

A public well located at Kandubedda off Vevaththa junction on the Ampara-Mahaoya-Mahiyanganaya road is underutilized.
The well, community property in the area of Rideemaaliyadda of the Mahiyanganaya electorate, and built at a cost of Rs.550 000, was to be used by about 150 families.
However, it is currently utilized only by a few families of the neighbouring area, as there is no overhead tank for water storage and no pipes for distributing water. The community urges the government and the Uva Provincial Council to taken action in this regard.
A former pradeshiya sabha member said that a private company once expressed willingness to donate Rs. 1,000,000 for such a project.
D.M. Mutubanda Dissanayaka at Orubendiveva, Araavaththa added that the company had responded to a request by the office of the chief United National Party organizer for Mahiyanganaya (electorate).
