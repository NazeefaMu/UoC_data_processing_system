Meethotamulla garbage crisis: Tissa proposes simple remedies

Many foolish ideas being presented to solve the Meethotamulla garbage issue such as transporting garbage by train when many simple scientific solutions are available, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
He was addressing a press conference at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
The LSSP leader said trains have to operate day and night a year or more to transport over 20 million tonnes of garbage from Meethotamulla to Puttalam. We have many no cost scientific solutions to solve the issue. I can show how I have implemented such a solution to remove the garbage at my Colombo residence, he said.
Covering garbage with a hard polythene sheet and allowing it to decompose and become natural fertiliser is one solution. The money earned from selling this fertiliser can be given to the Meethotamulla people. The Bloemendhal garbage mountain naturally underwent this procedure. Today that location is covered with grass and plants and has converted to a natural mountain, he said.
“A total of 100 tonnes of garbage can generate one megawatt of electricity. The The Yatiyanthota Pradeshiya Sabha commenced fertiliser production scheme using garbage under my guidance and now it is functional. The solution presented by the late Bernard Soysa and I 22 years ago was defeated by MPs who had been bought by some private companies which earned from garbage and it is still the same, he said.
