Joint Opposition wants House convened

The President should convene Parliament for discuss the Bond Commission report, the Joint Opposition said yesterday.
MP Bandula Gunawardana said the trust in the Central Bank had been lost and the trust in Sri Lanka was lost internationally because of the Bond issue.
He said the Bond Commission report is no longer a secret and it should be tabled in Parliament for debate because there are many facts to be revealed for the people.
He further said it is the duty of the President to present this to Parliament and the President has the power to convene.
