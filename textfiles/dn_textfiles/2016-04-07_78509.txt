Kandy SC's 'Mr Rugby'

Malik Samarawickrama who richly deserves to be tagged as 'Mr. Rugby' has contributed immensely to give Kandy Sports Club a place at the top in local rugby football. His involvement with the club to make them what they are today is worth its weight in gold.
When one talks about sports in the city of Kandy it is rugby that comes to mind. Indeed, it isn't coincidence that Kandy's rise in rugby is synchronized with Samarawickrama's loyalty to the game, club and rugby supporters in the hill capital. However, the ever modest garment industry tycoon sees it differently. He insists that one may pour in all the funds and material, but if one does not have the men and the spirit to convert these 'goodies' into success, the club will not make any headway.
Fortunately for Kandy SC, its officials, sponsors and well-wishers have delivered with spirit, all the necessary facilities at all times providing the players the best and they have repaid by pocketing all trophies and titles on offer. As long as Samarawickrama is around, sponsorship and support will flow like the Mahaweli. The team plays its part by performing at peak and putting to second best all other clubs.
Today in Kandy rugby is the only sport which is on the correct path at club level. The rugby ground is not a place for the frail or faint-hearted sportsman. Rugby players of Kandy have been acknowledged as some of the most skillfull to play the game, lighting up Sri Lanka rugby for many years. This is the third time they have won the double by being unbeaten. The first was under Lasantha Wijesuriya, then under Sean Wijesinghe and this time under Fazil Marija.
Last Friday, Kandy ruggerites were given a heroes welcomes when they were greeted by the committee members and fans at a get-together. Every player was presented with a medal and Samarawickrama awarded personal contributions to each player and everyone who was involved with the team. Such generosity should not pass without being acknowledged.
Kandy SC is a club with a long and proud history. It is important to recognize the man who has made a significant contribution to the game and made Kandy maintain its dominance it has held since 1992. It has become the brightest era in Kandy purely due to the foundation Malik has laid at the Nittawela club.
It took 42 years for this club to win a major trophy and become an invincible force in the rugby field thereby destroying the dominance of Colombo based clubs. That was after Malik's arrival. . As a result the Hill Capital changed the destiny of local inter-club rugby, including the rugby playing schools in Kandy who have raised their standards and become a driving force in the Schools' Association.
Samarawickrama is a strict disciplinarian. He helped the side to win the league 19 times since 1994 and the Clifford Cup 20 times. All the good work by Kandy SC 1992 has been due to Malik's initiatives, know-how, and solid backing. He has made successful contracts with players, promoted careers and given employment; and arranged sponsors. So successful was he, that players from Colombo showed keen interest in turning out for Kandy SC.
Malik was the founder of the Singer/Sri Lankan Airlines International Sevens. He supported and helped the organizers to conduct this tournament for 10 years from 1999 to 2008 gaining IRB status in 2004. This international sevens tournament, which was introduced to celebrate 125 years of Kandy Sports Club in 1999, was one of the most successful international tournaments to be organized in Sri Lanka. Again in 2004 the club conducted the Rugby World Cup Qualifier for the Asian Region. On successfully conducting this event, the IRB offered the event the first "Asian Region Rugby Seven's Satellite Series" in 2005 and even provided IRB funds to conduct this tournament. Unfortunately this tournament was 'high-jacked' by the Rugby Union and taken to Colombo. Malik is used to saying that whilst it is easy to reach the top, it is more difficult to stay on top! Kandy SC has stayed at the top for a decade.
When the history of rugby is recorded at Nittawela and the controlling body, the name of Malik Samarawickrama will stand out as one of the greatest administrators and friend of this sport and whom we all love.
