No provision to transfer powers to Provincial Governors: GL

Professor G.L. Peiris said there is no provision with the Constitution to transfer powers to Provincial Governors once a Provincial Council is dissolved. He was addressing a press conference of the Joint Opposition yesterday in Colombo.
Prof. Peiris said the Government is looking forward to postpone the Provincial Council elections through implementing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. But there are no provisions with the Constitution to transfer powers to Governors and postpone the elections.
Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena said the government is seeking every possible way to postpone elections. According to him, the speaker is partial and his behaviour is shameful.
Tissa Vitharana said the people of the country will be affected since the government is trying to allocate a huge sum of money for the defence budget through the forthcoming budget proposal for 2018. According to him, the government allocates such a huge amount to the defence budget on the advice of the United States. Considering the recent price increase of LP Gas, it is proved that the government doesn’t bother about harassing the people, he added.
Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila said there is a huge financial misconduct behind the receiving of an Indian ship for the Sri Lanka Navy. The former Defence Secretary had to resign from his post since he refused to approve this ship transaction, Gammanpila said.
“The JVP and TNA is also a part of the UNP itself.'' Gammanpila added that most probably the Provincial Council election will not be held next March as the Prime Minister said because the process of holding elections will takes time. He added that the intension of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by bringing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is to become the President at the 2020 Presidential Election.
“There maybe an amendment to the 20th Amendment mentioning that only persons, who have completed 40 years uninterrupted service in Parliament can contest the next Presidential election. Only then will the Prime Minister be qualified and he can become the President unanimously,” he said.
