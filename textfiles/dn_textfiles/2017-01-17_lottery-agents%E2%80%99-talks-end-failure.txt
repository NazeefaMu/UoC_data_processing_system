Lottery Agents’ talks end in failure

The All Island Lottery Agents Association yesterday said that their talks with National Lotteries Board Chairperson Shayamila Perera ended in failure.
Association sources said they want to reduce the price of a ticket to Rs. 20. “The chairperson said the board is unable to comply with our request.
We are determined to continue our trade union action until a solution is given to us,” the sources said
