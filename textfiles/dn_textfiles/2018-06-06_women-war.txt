Women  at war

Aristophanes’ Lysistrata has long been regarded as a modern classic. In Priyankara Ratnayake’s production, it seems to expand to fill the vast space of the title role. The iconic study of what anyone could call “the clash between masculinity and feminism” is set against the epic breadth of the mist-wreathed classical Athens.
Credited for introducing Sophocles to the local theatre, Priyankara Rathnayaka recently took a different route directing Aristophanes' Lysistrata. "So many ask me why I dwell on tragedies. May be because I have directed two tragedies. That is one reason why I wanted Aristophanes' comedy on our local stage," comments Ratnayake.
Rathnayaka teaches theatre at Kelaniya University, the only place which offers it as a separate subject, and leads 'Academic Players' which had won several awards over the years. A theatre festival named after Priyankara Ratnayake will be held from June 7 to 10 at the Lionel Wendt Theatre.
Lysistrata is a comic account of a woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peace—a strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career.
In Greek mythology, Antigone is the daughter of Oedipus and his mother Jocasta. The meaning of the name is, as in the case of the masculine equivalent Antigonus, "worthy of one's parents" or "in place of one's parents".
A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta, the former queen of the Amazons. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set.
The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.
IN ''Asinamali!,'' the first offering of Lincoln Center's monthlong South African theater festival, five black men sing, dance and shout unceasingly for 90 frenetic minutes - almost as if they feared that to stand still might be to surrender or to die. And that may well be the overriding point of this stunningly performed tapestry of satire, tragedy and reportage from the land of apartheid.
What can people do when denied their rights, their dignity, their families, their lives? The men of ''Asinamali!'' turn not only their harsh experience but also their voices and bodies, their every sound and gesture, into protest art.
In this kinetic theatrical event, each rapid-fire breath is a volley of defiance against the repressive state.
