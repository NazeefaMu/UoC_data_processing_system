‘Army’s ‘right-sizing’ programme grossly misinterpreted’

The Sri Lanka Army responding to recent criticism of its security preparedness by some retired Army Officers, said it had taken all necessary measures to prepare the Army for any eventuality.
Issuing a statement, the Army said their recent ‘right-sizing’ programme, had been grossly misinterpreted and misunderstood.
Nine years have passed since the Sri Lanka Army victoriously completed the near 30-year long brutal war. During that 9-year period, four experienced Commanders maintaining the highest level of battle-preparedness have commanded the Army while introducing various training modules and exercises to that effect which are being more refinedly continued to-date.
Likewise, all measures have been adopted uninterruptedly to introduce new training modules at all levels for all ranks, incorporating the most modern techniques of warfare, based on experiences, gained in the battlefield in order to face any future battle threat perception. Similarly, necessary measures have been adopted comparatively to enhance more opportunities to both Officers and Other Ranks to receive foreign training slots with state patronage. This has further broadened their knowledge on international warfare, too.
