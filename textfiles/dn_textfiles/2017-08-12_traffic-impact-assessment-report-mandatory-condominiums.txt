Traffic impact assessment report mandatory for condominiums

The traffic impact assessment report will be made mandatory to obtain approval for the construction of condominium buildings, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He was addressing the media at his ministry yesterday.
Apart from the criteria by the Urban Development Authority, the traffic impact assessment report would also be taken into the consideration before granting approval for the construction of new condominium buildings, the minister said.
He said the improper constructions of condominiums have resulted in traffic congestion in Colombo, Kotte, Sri Jayawardanapura, Mount Lavinia and Dehiwala.
