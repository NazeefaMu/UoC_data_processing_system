Social media not so social
President Maithripala Sirisena declared that if something is detrimental to the society we will have to get rid of it despite being useful another way. President Sirisena expressed these sentiments recently in reference to Sri Lankans’ habit of using the social media to destroy ethnic harmony. President Sirisena added that the mobile phone, the computer, internet and social media have been invented by the society to uplift humanity.
According to President Sirisena, the public has lodged complaints long before violence erupted in Ampara and Kandy districts. Complaints have been centred on Facebook. President Sirisena elucidated how Facebook has destroyed the family life, inciting hatred among various communities.
“We did not control it at that time. We were compelled to place certain restrictions temporarily on them when the violence started in these two districts,” President Sirisena added.
We fully endorse President Sirisena’s statement. It is important to control social media to a certain degree. It is surprising to note how the politicians now rant against the social media control. They fail to witness the harm generated during the recent riots.
Only a few politicians had the gumption to come forward to control the recent riots. But when the government controlled the social media to stop the riots, many cardboard heroes came to the forefront to wage useless wars. They began to deal with the subjects of democracy, press freedom and media freedom.
But they must understand that peace and harmony are much more important than all this. What is the use of media freedom and democracy when there are riots? These social media are managed by various businessmen. They are worried about their financial gains. They are worried about their marketing. They are not worried about the damage done to our young generation or family life.
