The dispute between doctors and specialists of Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital that broke out on Wednesday further aggravated as the same consultant doctor who was involved in the Tuesday’s incident had blocked the entrance of the hospital vehicle park obstructing the vehicle into and out of the park.
He had come with some outsiders to the hospital premises and parked his car blocking the entrance and removed a wheel of same resting it on a jack in retaliation to the doctors protest against his alleged behaviour the previous day.
