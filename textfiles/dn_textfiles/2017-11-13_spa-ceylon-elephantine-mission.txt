SPA CEYLON ON AN ELEPHANTINE MISSION

Spa Ceylon has strengthened its mission to aid and promote the work of elephant conservation projects in the island by launching a new range of luxurious products under the label Ceylon Elephant Co. The brand is building upon its long history of commitment to the cause with a new pledge to donate 10% of the retail value of all Ceylon Elephant Co. product sales towards strategic conservation projects identified by the company.
As a conscious brand, Spa Ceylon believes in contributing to the island and mother nature by promoting the protection of the country’s most recognizable ambassador - the majestic Ceylon Elephant. This majestic creature is at risk - large populations of elephants across the country are rapidly losing their natural habitat to the advent of cities and livelihoods. The natural result of this human-elephant conflict tips the scale against these creatures, as the traditional forest area that they can inhabit is limited. Recognizing this Spa Ceylon has taken several initiatives over the last few years to help raise awareness about their plight and to fund conservation projects that address the situation.
Ceylon Elephant
Since setting in motion the Save The Majestic Ceylon Elephant Campaign in 2012, Spa Ceylon’s aim has been to safeguard the Ceylon Elephants around the island from the increasing threats prevalent in their natural habitats. In addition to raising awareness about the dilemma faced by these majestic creatures due to the human-elephant conflict, the campaign has raised funds that have been directed to carefully chosen and monitored conservation projects around the country, including towards the purchase of equipment, food, cash and vehicles donated to various conservationist projects around the island.
Orange Elephant project
Project Orange Elephant is a worthy and ground breaking cause which will benefit from the Ceylon Elephant Co. This is an initiative that was first taken in 2012 by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society in the village of Radunnewa, which borders the Wasgamuwa National Park.
Radunnewa lies along an elephant corridor and suffers extensive crop losses from elephants, with the elephants in danger of falling victim to deterrant devices built to keep them at bay.
The pilot Project Orange Elephant initiative provided grafted orange plants to 10 villages that suffered the most crop damage from elephants. As elephants were averse to the pith of the green orange, they would leave this particular crop alone. Since then the farmers of Radunnewa, alongside several other villages, have successfully established orange groves that provide them with a steady source of revenue, and keep the elephants safe from human conflict as well.
Spa Ceylon will assist the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society to broaden the project’s reach and success by contributing funds to sustain the project and expand its reach.
Elephant Transit Home
Another project supported by Spa Ceylon is the Udawalawe Transit Home, a facility within the Udawalawe Park established in 1955 by the Department of Wildlife Conservation. The transit home rehabilitates orphaned elephant calves before releasing them back to the wild. It perfectly captures Spa Ceylon’s vision for the future of these majestic animals, says Spa Ceylon founders Shiwantha Dias and Shalin Balasuriya in a press release.
“Our funding is directed towards supporting elephants in the wild. We believe that these animals belong in the wild, not chained up to service human needs. We have been so moved by the transit home’s work in rehabilitating baby elephants that have lost their parents to the human-elephant conflict, in order to release them back to the wild.” Spa Ceylon’s support to the Transit Home includes purchase of equipment for use by Wildlife rangers, such as tractors for carrying food. The company has also ‘adopted’ baby elephants by providing financial support for their care until they are old enough to be returned to the wild.
Ceylon Elephant Co. Range
In introducing the campaign, Spa Ceylon created a decadent range of Ceylon Elephant Co. themed bath, body and home aroma products. They are perfumed with fresh and invigorating blends of fragrant essential oils inspired by the natural habitat of these majestic creatures.
The aromatic blends are enriched with essential oils of Pink Grapefruit, Sandalwood, Kaffir Lime, Frankincense, Lemongrass, Eucalyptus and Patchouli. The formula also includes powerful Ayurveda actives, virgin coconut oils and natural fruit butters to soothe the body and uplift the soul.
The Ceylon Elephant Co. range consists of nearly 37 products including Home Fragrance Oil Blends, Elephant Shaped Cleansing Bars, Luxury Candles, Home Aroma Diffusers, Aroma Incense, Aroma Car Fresheners, Room Aroma Sachets and a collection of luxury gift sets with these formulae.
These products are available in the trademark Spa Ceylon packaging, which utilizes vibrant colours coupled with unique Ceylonese palace art motifs - depicting the magnificent mammoth form of the Ceylon Elephant.
