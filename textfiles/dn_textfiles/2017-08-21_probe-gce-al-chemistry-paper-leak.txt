Probe into GCE A/L Chemistry paper leak

The Police have launched an investigation into the distribution of a handout near a leading school in Gampaha which contained several questions that appeared in the exact form as in the second Chemistry question paper in the GCE Advanced Level examination.
The handouts are said to have been distributed by a person claiming to be a private tuition teacher conducting classes for AL Chemistry students.
The handouts had been distributed when the students were leaving the examination centers in the school after sitting for the second chemistry question paper on Saturday.
Following the incident parents of several students had taken steps to inform the Police and the Department of the examination about the incident.
Gampaha Division Police SP Muditha Pussella when inquired said that a probe has been launched following the complaint made by the parents.
Meanwhile, Ceylon Teachers’ Services Union General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said that if the said person had distributed a handout with the exact questions as in the Chemistry paper soon after the exam was over, he must have had prior knowledge about the questions.
He also said that authorities should conduct a comprehensive probe as the matter was highly sensitive and serious one. Meanwhile,reports said that the Department of Examinations too has launched a separate probe on the incident and Examinations Commissioner has also submitted a complaint to the Inspector General of Police in this connection.
