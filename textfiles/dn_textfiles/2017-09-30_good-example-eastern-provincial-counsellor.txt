Good example by Eastern Provincial Counsellor

The Eastern Provincial Council is to be dissolved very shortly.
Council Member Shibly Farook from Kattankudy in the Batticaloa district has returned the balance stationary issued to him by the council for his official use along with the cheque to the tune of Rs. 67,428.40 to the Council Chairman Chandradasa Galappathy at Trincomalee on September 25.
The cheque returned was the expenses incurred by the Council for his food and refreshments during the Council period.
This is a good example to other members too to follow suit. Eastern Provincial Council Secretary M.C.M. Sheriff was also present at this event.
