Riaz promises Pakistan will back ‘younger brother’ Amir

 
LONDON, TUESDAY: Pakistan’s Wahab Riaz has insisted Mohammad Amir has the support of all his team-mates as he prepares to make his return to Test cricket at Lord’s on Thursday.
Fellow left-arm quick Amir’s career came to a dramatic halt during a Test against England at Lord’s in 2010, when he and new-ball partner Mohammad Asif were caught bowling no-balls to order on the instructions of captain Salman Butt as part of a tabloid newspaper sting operation.
All three received five-year bans from cricket and together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms. Amir, who served three months in an English young offenders institute, has only featured in the international game’s shorter formats since his return to Pakistan duty in January. AFP
