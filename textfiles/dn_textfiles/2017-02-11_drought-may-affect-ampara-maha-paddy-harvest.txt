Drought may affect Ampara Maha paddy harvest

The Ampara district which is, described as the granary of the East may face a drop in the 2016/17 Maha season paddy harvest as a result of the prolonged drought, farmers said. “Although harvesting is in progress, the expected yield may not be forthcoming,” farmers said. “Around 58,500 hectares of paddy lands were brought under paddy cultivation during the current Maha season,” sources said.
“Farmers of the district showed greater enthusiasm in paddy cultivation. However,the scarcity of water, severe drought,subsequent floods when the crops were ripening and damage caused by wild elephants hindered the paddy yield,” sources added.
Meanwhile, paddy harvesting in Addalaichenai and the surrounding areas is in progress while rice mill owners and middle men are busy in purchasing paddy from farmers.
At the very start, the price of a bag of paddy (65 Kilograms) was sold at Rs:3,300. But, at present the price of a bag of paddy has come down to Rs:2800. Most of the farmers have cultivated red rice dry this season.
The combine harvester is harvesting about 5 to 6 acres per day. There are several combine harvesting machines at operation. Drought and flood affected farmers sustained heavy losses. They have complained to the relevant officials regarding this matter.
