New traffic plan has added to the chaos - Gemunu

The new traffic plan in Colombo introduced by the Police is a total failure since it has actually created more traffic congestion, Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
He said the government should introduce a long term plan to tackle this problem without diverting traffic here and there.
“You cannot stop people from buying new vehicles and when these too are added, road traffic deviation will not work,” he added.
People in countries like Japan always use public transport and they use their cars only on weekends to attend to their private work.
“We should develop our public transport system to that level,” Wijeratne added. He noted that it is essential to make the shift from private to public transport to tackle the problem of congestion due to the increase in vehicles.
When the average speed decreases, it leads to longer travel times, causing economic loss as a result of high fuel consumption and rise in pollution levels.
