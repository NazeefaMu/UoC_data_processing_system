Missing policeman found dead

The body of a 48-year-old Police constable attached to the Anuradhapura Police station was found in Neelambemma, Saliyawewa on Monday evening.
The Police Constable had gone missing with his service revolver about two weeks back.
A Police team investigating the disappearance of the Police constable had found the badly decomposed body of the deceased officer in a shrub jungle in Neelambemma after being alerted by villagers in the area.
Two villagers who had gone to Neelambemma for sand mining had seen the decomposed body and had alerted the Police. The Police team also had found the missing service revolver of the constable, his identity card and the wallet.
The Police had also found a bottle of liquor, a bottle of soda and two slippers close to the body.
The Policeman was last seen leaving for duty at the Anuradhapura Magistrate’s Court, about two weeks back.
He had obtained the revolver and several rounds of bullets from the armoury of the Anuradhapura police station stating that he has been posted for duty at the court premises.
The investigations are continuing.
