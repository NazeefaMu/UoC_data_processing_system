Water levels at Maussakele reservoir rises rapidly

 
Water levels at the Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs are rapidly rising due to the continuous rain.
Engineers in charge of the reservoirs said that water levels in Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs are 9 feet and 09 feet respectively.
Maussakele and Castlereigh reservoirs supply water for hydro power stations including Laxapana, New Laxapana, Wimalasurendra, Canyon and Polpitiya.
