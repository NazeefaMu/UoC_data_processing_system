Helicopter tour  for Mobitel 4G customers

Sri Lanka’s national mobile services provider, Mobitel, embarked on its 4G Nation campaign to promote 4G in the outskirts of Colombo and in rural areas.
Mobitel is setting up more towers in towns out of Colombo to improve quality of 4G connections to enable customers to enjoy the facility in rural areas as well. The 4G Nation campaign was held this year in Galle, Ampara, Anuradhapura and Trincomalee.
The winners of the 4G Nation promotion were treated to a thrilling helicopter tour for an experience of a lifetime.
Mobitel constantly lives up to its ‘We Care. Always’ brand promise, and the roll-out of 4G LTE is testament to its promise to make the latest technology available to all citizens at affordable prices. Here, the winners of Mobitel 4G Nation campaign pose for photographs with the helicopter before taking to the skies.
