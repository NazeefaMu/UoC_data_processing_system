Cat owners unaware their pet is carnivore!

Cat owners are unknowingly feeding their pets poor quality food as well as often handing out scraps of their own meals, including chocolate and cheese, research has found.
A study of 2,000 cat owners revealed many are oblivious about what foods could be harmful to their cat’s health – with some even sharing takeaways and leftovers. A fifth of owners don’t even know their cats are carnivores – with one in 10 feeding them raw vegetables and another one in 20 serving up salad leaves.
The research, commissioned by Lily’s Kitchen, also found nearly four in 10 cat owners never check the label when buying cat food, with 64 per cent baffled about what they should look for.
One in 20 simply buy the cheapest cat food on offer, and a further 15 per cent swap from brand to brand depending on what’s the best value. But leading veterinarian Rodney Zasman has warned that serving up some of the cheaper cat foods available could be no better than feeding your cat a daily dose of McDonald’s.
He said: “It’s alarming that many of the nation’s cat owners are oblivious to what constitutes a healthy diet for their pets, particularly when healthy eating plays such a big part in modern day living for the owners themselves.
“One of the biggest dangers to our cats’ health is actually poor quality, mass produced pet food.
“In some instances these foods contain as little as four per cent meat and, as a result, cats aren’t getting the nutrition they need to keep them healthy.
"But many cat owners are largely unaware of this fact and only find out when they take their poorly or overweight moggy to the vet.”
Four in 10 Brits give food items to their cat despite not being sure it’s healthy for them while almost a quarter still give their pet treats knowing it won’t do them any good. A further 40 per cent are happy to share their own meals with their cats; with a third of pet owners giving them cheese without realising large amounts can be dangerous.
One in 20 have offered it a piece of chocolate and almost a fifth are happy to let their cat lick from a bowl of cream, which can be unhealthy for moggies. One pet owner even claimed their cat loves nothing more than to nibble on a piece of leftover fruitcake, which could be harmful to the animal.
