OHCHR to take up SL under Universal Periodic Review

Sri Lanka's report under the Universal Periodic Review will come up for consideration by the OHCHR Working Group on UPR today, in Geneva.
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) was established by the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) in 2006, as a process through which the human rights record of every UN Member State is peer-reviewed.
This review, conducted through the UN Human Rights Council (HRC), is based upon each country’s human rights obligations and commitments in the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights instruments to which the country is a party, and other sources. During the process, the country under review submits a written report on its human rights record and appears before the Council, where it receives recommendations regarding its human rights record from the other UN Member States.
The country under review is able to ‘accept’ or ‘note’ these recommendations. Those accepted form the basis for future reporting, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.
The UPR is the only process through which all UN Member States undergo review and scrutiny of their human rights records. Sri Lanka underwent its first UPR cycle in 2008 and the second in 2012. The review that will be conducted today will be Sri Lanka’s third, and along with Sri Lanka, the following countries will also be reviewed under the UPR’s third cycle at the 28th Working Group, during the period November 6-17: Argentina, Benin, Czechia, Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Japan, Pakistan, Peru, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Ukraine, and Zambia.
Keeping with the National Unity Government’s firm commitment to protect, promote and uphold the human rights of all citizens of Sri Lanka as national policy, the Sri Lanka’s delegation to the review will be led by National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva.
The delegation will comprise officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General’s Department, the President’s Office, and the Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the UN in Geneva, the Foreign Affairs Ministry in a statement said.
The National Report of Sri Lanka covers areas that were part of the recommendations accepted by Sri Lanka following the 2nd UPR in 2012. The National Report was drafted, following wide consultations with all stakeholders including public consultations in Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Jaffna, and Kalmunai, online consultations and consultations by post.
Sri Lanka will continue to engage constructively with the UN Human Rights Council and all member states of the UN to promote and protect human rights locally and internationally, the Foreign Affairs Ministry stated.
