LG elections will be postponed - SB

The local government elections will be postponed as around 2,300 amendments have to be brought to the new electoral system, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake said.
"Specially some electorates of Kandy and Colombo have to be divided into two," the minister said.
Dissanayake made this observation following a function in Madamwela recently. Around 15 opposition parliamentarians will join the government, he said.
The minister said discussions were on regarding the ministerial portfolios that are to be offered to the six MPs.
"The group of parliamentarians will join the government to strengthen the government, the party and the alliance by defeating the attempts to create alternative groups by dividing the SLFP," Dissanayake said.
