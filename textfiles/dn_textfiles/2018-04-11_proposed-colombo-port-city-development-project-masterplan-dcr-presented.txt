Proposed Colombo Port City Development Project Masterplan, DCR presented

The presentation of the Proposed Masterplan and Development Control Regulations (DCR) of the Colombo Port City Development Project provides a clear mechanism for the implementation of the Master Plan, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday.
He made this observation at the presentation of the Proposed Masterplan and Development Control Regulations (DCR) of Colombo Port City Development Project of which the theme is ‘Road Map to Prosperity’ at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.
The DCR directs both public and private sector developments with a set of development objectives, definitions and regulations which are essential to enforce the vision and objectives of the Master Plan in a transparent manner.
The Minister also said that in 2004, the experts stated that the Central district had to be expanded and following environmental impact assessments,we have come to a point that this project is a reality.
Minister Ranawaka added when the Good Governance Government was elected in 2015, a Special Committee was appointed to look into the project which finally cancelled the project and proposed a completely new methodology. We also conducted environmental impact assessments, social impact assessments etc before we came to this stage.
Megapolis and Western Development Ministry Secretary Nihal Rupasinghe, Urban Development Authority Chairman Dr.Jagath Munasinghe, Colombo Port City Project Director Nihal Fernando and Director General of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management B.K.
