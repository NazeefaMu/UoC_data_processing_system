Walk to forget dementia

Dementia occurs as a result of physical debilitating process of the brain. A person with dementia would show clear signs of impaired memory, thinking and behavior.
One of the most common dementias is memory loss.
According to medical experts Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. Dementia is a collective term used to describe over a 100 physical brain disorders that cause dementia. Seventy percent of people with dementia have Alzheimer’s.
Other kinds of dementias include; vascular dementia caused by stroke, Lewy body dementia, Fronto-temporal dementia (including Pick’s disease) and alcohol related dementias.
While it is also possible to have more than one type, all these dementias damage and kill brain cells hampering the smooth function of it.
While it is still not known what exactly causes dementia, medical researchers all over the world work on finding causes and developing treatment.
However a recent study has found that having an extensive social network seems to protect against dementia. People with poor or limited social network had a tendency of 60 percent increased risk of dementia.
In Sri Lanka it is an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people have dementia.
Lanka Alzheimer’s Foundation
A friend in need is a friend indeed and Lanka Alzheimer’s Foundation (LAF) is one such friend for people with dementia and their families.
LAF (www.alzlanka.org) situated in Colombo 10 functions with the mission of improving the quality of life of those with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and enhance the wellbeing of their families and custodians or carers.
Registered with the ministry of social services, LAF is a member of the world body, Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) that represents 79 countries.
Co-founder and the President of LAF, Lorraine Yu spearheads activities at the centre with her dedicated team of volunteers.
“The community has the responsibility to understand the symptoms of dementia and have empathy towards people having dementia. Through awareness building we are on a quest to raise a dementia friendly community in Sri Lanka”, says Lorraine Yu.
She recommends people over the age of 60 to take the free ‘Memory Screening’ conducted at the LAF.
“People are concerned of their physical wellbeing but they should know their mental wellbeing is as important as physical wellbeing. It is time people realized the importance of the memory screening and assessment we offer”, she said. Everything done at LAF is free of charge for its clients. (LAF calls people with dementia who visit for therapy as clients)
She said social isolation is equally bad for the custodians or carers of people with dementia thus their wellbeing too should be looked into. LAF activity centre offers a day-off to these people by taking care of clients on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
“We have setup LAF activity centre here as non-pharmacological intervention is far more beneficial than use of drugs for people with dementia. Volunteers keep company to the clients by stimulating, supporting, encouraging and praising the activities and artistic creations of theirs”, she says.
“Art triggers dormant memories and emotions and inspire conversions among people with dementia. The art project has provided LAF’s clients many enjoyable hours of self-worth, which has helped to enhance their communication skills, brain function and social interaction”, she adds.
Identification Bracelet for the clients is an innovation by LAF.
Can people reduce the risk of having dementia? Look after your heart, follow a healthy diet, challenge your brain, be physically active and enjoy social activities is the message from LAF to the community.
