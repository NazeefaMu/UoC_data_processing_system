Pray for lasting peace and reconciliation: D. M. Swaminathan

“We will all pray on this Thaipongal Day for lasting peace and reconciliation in a united Sri Lanka. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous future where expectations will be fulfilled and goals can be achieved for a better future,” Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan in his Thaipongal message states.
Marking the commencement of the first month of the Thamil Calendar, the Tamil people all over the world celebrate the month of ‘Thai’ on January 14 every year. The Thaipongal festival, celebrated to mark the beginning of the month of ‘Thai’, is observed by the Tamil community in a grand manner as it carries great social, cultural and religious value.
The Tamil community is guided by the ‘Thaipongal festival to express their reverence and appreciation for nature. In the month of January, the Thaiponal festival is celebrated to offer our gratitude and thanks to the Sun. It is the Sun which helps the farmers to harvest their crops.
The Sun is what sustains human beings for the rest of the year by providing food, warmth and its glorious sunlight. So farmers as well as all others express their gratitude and thanks to the Sun on this holy and celebrated day of the Thaipongal festival for ensuring their sustenance. Even though each community in Sri Lanka has their own distinct culture, language and religion, when celebrating such festivals as the Thaipongal festival we pray for the sustenance of all human beings thus uniting us all as Sri Lankans.
It helps us unite and co exist regardless of cultural, religious and ethnic differences.
