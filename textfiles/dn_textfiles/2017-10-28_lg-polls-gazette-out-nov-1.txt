LG Polls Gazette out on Nov. 1

The gazette notification pertaining to the upcoming Local Government elections will be issued on November 1.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday said the environment was now conducive to hold elections.
Addressing the media yesterday, he said: “I would like to let the Elections Commission Chairman know that the pitch is now ready for the match (election),”the Minister said, addressing the media yesterday at the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
Minister Mustapha said the President, Prime Minister and all political parties insisted that the elections be held as soon as possible and added that they are all working towards that goal.
The Minister assured that the elections would be held in January next year as previously planned.
The Zoning Plan of Ambagamuwa and Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabhas would also be issued parallel with the Gazette Notification pertaining to the holding of Local Government elections.
The Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhas will be divided into six Pradeshiya Sabhas, increasing the number of Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya district by another four. The Minister will also submit a detailed report based on the geographical location and demographic composition of the above Pradheshiya sabhas to the Cabinet on November 31.
Minister Mustapha explaining about the zoning process said the existing wards in those areas would be divided among the Pradehiya Sabhas and added they would not once again conduct the delimitation of the wards.
“Some think that this initiative would again become a reason for the delay in holding the elections. But neither the Ministry nor the government has any plans to delay the elections,” the Minister added.
I have taken all possible measures to hold the elections as soon as possible. Now both the pitch and the ball is ready,”Minister Mustapha said.
