Durdans Centre for Orthopaedics setting standards for exemplary care

Total joint replacement or arthroplasty, represents a significant advance in the treatment of painful and disabling joint pathologies.
Surgery can be performed on any joints of the body, including the hip, knee, ankle, foot, shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers. Among these procedures, hip and knee total joint replacements, are by far the most common.
The Durdans Hospital Centre for Orthopaedics has long been at the forefront of joint repair care, providing innovative and high-quality diagnosis and treatment that has helped it to become one of region’s best.
In addition to providing 24/7 immediate fracture operations, the hospital offers a spectrum of orthopaedic services ranging from minimally invasive outpatient procedures to comprehensive knee, hip and shoulder replacement. Outpatient services for orthopaedic patients include physical therapy and sports medicine.
“Through our team’s advanced surgical, anesthesia and rehabilitation expertise, our joint replacement program has become known for high-quality, patient-focused care,” said Dr. Wimal Karandagoda, Chief Operating Officer and Director Medical Services at Durdans Hospital. “Not only does our Center for Orthopaedics offer a wide range of joint replacement procedures, we are also privileged to have some of Sri Lanka’s most qualified and committed surgical professionals, including surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, and technologists, who collaborate in achieving excellent patient care coordination.”
“Durdans Center of Orthopaedics is the result of ongoing collaboration between the Orthopaedic team and hospital leaders to develop facilities, staffing and high surgical standards for patients of all ages. As a surgeon, it is gratifying to work in a facility that has demonstrated expertise in areas that matter most to patients: quality care, treatment expertise, and patient outcomes.” said Dr. Gnanasekeram, Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Durdans Hospital.
