Police deploy 6,000 officers for Modi’s security

The Police has taken special security measures for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka next week, IGP Pujith Jayasundara told the Daily News.
The IGP said nearly 6,000 Police officers have been deployed for the Indian Prime Minister’s visit to Sri Lanka and other related events during the international Vesak festival. “This includes ordinary Police officers, the Special Task Force (STF) and the officers who have specialized knowledge in VVIP security,” the IGP explained.
“There will be strict security measures in Colombo and Kandy district. In addition, a special security plan has been adopted covering the key Buddhist temples across the country where Vesak events will be held,” he added.
“No acts of sabotage can be carried out during the Indian Prime Minister’s visit. The Police have been strictly instructed to pay special attention to the matter,” the IGP said, alluding to remarks on ‘black flag’ campaigns during the Indian Prime Minister’s visit.
The Indian Prime Minister is due to officiate at the opening ceremony of the UN Vesak Day in Colombo on May 11, on the invitation of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He is expected to attend a series of religious and other events on the sidelines of the UN Vesak Day celebrations that will end in Kandy on the May 14.
This includes opening a new hospital in Dickoya, funded by the Indian government.
Although the Sri Lankan government has confirmed that Modi will not sign any bilateral agreements during the visit, he is expected to meet top-level leaders of the government, including the President and the Prime Minister.
