BMICH rewards 25 year  service employees

BMICH commenced the first working day of 2017 with a multi-ethnic, multi-religious inauguration to herald the New Year on an inspiring note designed to take the award winning success of the previous year to greater heights.
The highlight of the occasion was indeed a memorable event for the 19 employees who were employed at BMICH for over 25 years. Each of them received a gold sovereign as a valuable token of appreciation for their long service.
Best performers of 2016 were also recognized and presented with trophies and certificates. Recognition for the Employee of the Year took pride of place. The best performers at each quarter were evaluated in choosing the Employee of the Year.
“Everything we do at BMICH contributes to overall efficiencies and effectiveness that promotes customer-centric service delivery” explained the company Spokesperson. “Last year we were proud to become the winner of Gold Century International Quality ERA Award in Geneva and also become the Leading Meeting and Convention Venue at the South Asian Travel Awards. Both these awards endorse the high calibre of our staff as well as the excellent facilities offered by BMICH, the Spokesperson added.
