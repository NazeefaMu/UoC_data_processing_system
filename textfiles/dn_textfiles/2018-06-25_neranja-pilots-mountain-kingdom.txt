Neranja pilots in mountain kingdom

Surrounded by the majestic Himalayas, the small country of Bhutan, enveloped by India on three sides of the world map and China on the other, is not easy to get to. It is gifted with a natural environment that is aloof with its rivers and valleys and is the only country in the world that has achieved carbon dioxide–neutral status. The annual 1.5metric tons of carbon dioxide produced in Bhutan is absorbed completely by its vegetation that can absorb six metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.
Bhutan, which is fed by Mahayana Buddhism, plays an important role in religious matters. This country has five seasons, namely, Summer, Winter, Autumn, Spring and Monsoon. The only ways to get to Bhutan are by air and by small narrow roads. There are no railway or shipping lines available. Bhutan, known as the island of Lightning Dragons in the ancient past, is still under royal rule. The present government is ruled by the dynasty of Wangchuck.
According to their constitution, the forests should have an area of <U+200B><U+200B>60 percent of the country and to date it has increased to 72 percent. The kingdom provides free electricity to the people and is currently researching to supply electricity for Winter, Solar and Hibernation. They develop the country from the concept of “gross domestic happiness” instead of “gross domestic product” because of the natural environment and the health of the country.
Their target has been to produce 100 percent chemical-free organic food by the year 2020, and by 2030, the release of greenhouse gases and the dumping of waste.
There are four airports in this kingdom and the most special airport is Paro Airport, which is the only international airport in Bhutan. In 1968, the Indian border authority built the airport for helicopter operations. The airport is located on the very deep basal Paro river with the highest mountain range at 18,000 feet above sea level.
The runway is about 1,402 to 1,964 metres. In 2010, an Airbus A319 aircraft and ATR 42 light aircraft landed in this airport, making it the country’s only international airport. But on March 4, 2018, a Malaysian carrier’s A320neo landed on a test flight, giving it a positive result.
A dangerous airport
Among the world’s challenging airports, Paro Airport is the most dangerous and challenging airport - only eight pilots in the world have qualified to fly in and out of this airport. We, as Sri Lankans, should be proud that there is a Sri Lankan pilot among them - Captain Neranja Paul Tiranagama. Captain Tiranagama is well experienced and lucky enough to see the beauty of Paro International Airport, the most beautiful and dangerous airport covered by the beautiful Himalayan glaciers and rivers every day, as he cruises to 39,000 feet. No man is an island and he does not climb that mountain alone. As Tiranagama said, he is thankful to all those who have helped him in his life to get here. More importantly, he has cultivated a habit of not giving up, and he never gave up his dream or anything he believed in.
There are ten dangerous airports in the world and five of them are categorised as the ‘most dangerous’. Tiranagama, who operates an Airbus A319 to and from Paro International Airport, says none of these airports are dangerous and it’s wrong to use the word, ‘dangerous’; he calls them ‘very challenging’.
The most dangerous airport in the world is Lukla Airport in Nepal, but only small turbo propeller aircraft take off and land here. At number 2 stands Courchevel International Airport in France and again it only operates small twin and single-engined turbo propeller aircraft. At number 3 is Toncontín International Airport in the Honduras, but when you look at the terrain with airport elevation, it is 1,005m (3,297ft) and the runway length is 2,163m (7,096 ft). It is not as dangerous as Paro International Airport in Bhutan.
At number 4, we have Princess Juliana International Airport in St. Maarten and yes, they operate big jets, but the reason for this airport to be dangerous is that the runway is too close to the beach and the elevation of this airport is 14 feet, which is relatively safe.
At number 5 we have Paro International Airport in Bhutan. When comparing Paro International Airport with all the above airports, one feels that it should be made number one as it operates all big Airbus jets, the terrain surrounding the airport is at 18,000 ft, and the airport has a shorter runway which is just 6,450 ft, with an elevation of 7,400 ft above sea level.
From SLAF to commercial piloting
Tiranagama started his career as a Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) pilot and later became a commercial jet pilot.
After his father, Karu Tiranagama who was a former Sri Lanka Army Officer influenced him into flying, he started his flying career at age 17 at Upali Aviation Services in Ratmalana under Captain Hirantha Perera. After obtaining his private pilot licence, he joined the Sri Lanka Air Force as a twin turbo prop pilot and from there was sent to USA and Canada for further training and upgrade.
He left the Air Force to become a commercial pilot and went to Turkey as an Airbus pilot. He obtained his A320 type rating in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and after three years of flying, due to his daughter’s illness, he took a break. His daughter had been sick, and after her successful recovery, he joined Bhutan Airlines as a first officer flying the Airbus A319.
“Aviation itself is not dangerous but like the sea, it is unforgiving of those who are not capable, neglectful or careless”- these were the first words from his instructor Captain Hirantha Perera, during his initial flight training as a student pilot at Upali Aviation Services, said Tiranagama, and he has never forgotten these words.
He later obtained advanced training and guidance under the greatest and legendary pilot in Sri Lankan aviation history - Captain Elmo Jayawardena and his friend Captain Deepal Pinto Hewagama. He was also trained by Captain Dulip de Alwis, Captain Jawed Aleem, Captain Mohan Pragasam and Air Canada pilot Captain Steve St. Pierre and Bhutan Airlines’ pilots Captain Sangay Wanchuk, Captain Chenga, and Captain Karma Dupchu.
Tiranagama said that what thrills him most in his job was the ‘take-offs’ and ‘landings’, but mostly the take-off, because you used almost maximum power during the take-off and the agility and power the engines produce runs through your entire body, “The feeling you get from that is beyond words and it’s unimaginable.”
Having become one of the best pilots around, Tiranagama says he still has many dreams to accomplish. They are his responsibilities rather than dreams. He is determined to do something good before his time runs out. His dream after his retirement is to move to his hometown in Galle or someplace cold in Sri Lanka and build his own school for less-fortunate children and teach them everything he can with the help of the Canadian government and some close friends.
His life is simple, his story is clear.
