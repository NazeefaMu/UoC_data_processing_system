The book ‘Sri Lanka - Soviet Russia relations’ an introduction

 February 19, 1957 was a memorable day in the annals of state relations between the island of Sri Lanka or Ceylon as it was known then and the vast land of Russia, known as the Soviet Union or the USSR. It was on this very day 60 years ago, that diplomatic relations between these two states were officially established.
Sixty years is not a long period in the history of a country, but a long span in the life of a human being. It is our delight that there happens to be a person amongst us who relates the saga of the aforesaid relationship between these two countries in a gigantic literary work in Sinhala, titled ‘‘Sri Lanka-Soviet-Russia relations.’ He is none other than Sirimanna Karunatillake, now in his late seventies who had lived through these years and substantially contributed to building and strengthening Sri Lanka - Soviet-Russia relations over the years. He is the most experienced, knowledgeable and suited to relate this story.
It is a voluminous book comprising of four chapters running into 624 pages, elaborating the development of relations between the two countries in socio-political, economic and cultural spheres as well as people to people relations during the last 60 years. It was presented to President Maithripala Sirisena on the March 21, 2017 on the eve of his official visit to Russia as a useful hand book on Sri Lanka-Soviet-Russia relations.
The story begins with a brief description of the two countries, with their background and present standing and a narration of the Soviet tour of Ceylon’s team of emissaries, comprising senior diplomat Sir Claude Corea, T. B. Subasinghe, then Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and two others in September, 1956, at the direction of Premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, as elaborated in Part I of the first chapter.
It is said that after successful completion of negotiations and signing of necessary protocols the team embarked on a long tour of the Soviet Union, stretching from Moscow and Leningrad in the western end to lrkursk - Siberia, in the far eastern end of the Russian Republic, passing through Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakstan Republic, Dushanbe, the capital of Tajiksitan Republic and Novosibirsk in Siberia. Not only the history and the geography of these cities and republics, but also the mysterious Siberia, Lake Baikal and the Trans-Siberian Railway line as well as the historical events and personalities connected with these environs are vividly described herein.
Part II of the said chapter deals with the roles played by the Ambassadors of the two sides with special mention of the pioneers such as Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera, Ceylon’s first Ambassador to the Soviet Union,Vladimir Yakovlev, the first Soviet Ambassador to Ceylon and T.B. Subasinghe, nick-named ‘Troika of Sri Lanka-Soviet relations,’ meaning three substantive roles played by him, including the role of being Ceylon’s Ambassador in the Soviet Union on one occasion. It is emphasised herein that the pioneering roles played by these three stalwarts, greatly helped in laying the foundation in building and fostering a genuine and long lasting friendly relationship between the two countries which prevail up to this day.
Part III thereof narrates the most memorable events in the annals of the past 60 years, more so the bilateral visits of VVIPs to each others countries.
It begins with the visit of Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to Ceylon in December 1961, Ceylon’s Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike’s visit to the Soviet Union in October, 1963, Soviet woman Cosmonaut Valentina Thereskova’s visit to Ceylon in November, 1963 and others later on. Some of them are opposition leader J.R. Jayewardene’s visit to the Soviet Union in mid-1972, Minister Gamini Dissanayake’s visit in October 1978, Minister Lalith Athulathmudali’s visit in September 1980, Foreign Minister A.C.S. Hameed’s visit in April, 1982, Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgarmer’s visits in January 2001 and June 2004, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Sri Lanka in October 2009, President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s visits to Russia in February 2010 and June, 2011, culminated with the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to Russia in March 2017, on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations.
Chapter two deals with socio-economic and trade relations between the two countries wherein the enormous aid and assistance rendered to our country, particularly during Soviet times, is elaborated in detail. The aid so rendered were of two types, viz. social aid in furtherance of the development of human resources and material aid in furtherance of industrial and agricultural development of our country. It is stated here that the more valuable and long lasting one among the two, was the social aid by way of education and training provided to our student community to become engineers, doctors, scientists, etc. This process started in the year 1960 and over 5,000 Sri Lankans have graduated from Soviet Russian higher educational institutions so far. Sensational experiences of some of them have also been vividly narrated therein.
Meanwhile, material aid and assistance rendered were specifically in the spheres of housing and construction, refining and exploration of oil, irrigation and power and industrial development. The most prominent aid projects among them were the setting up of a Prefab concrete structure manufacturing complex in Narahenpita, Samanalawewa Hydro- Electric scheme, Steel factory in Oruwala, Tyre factory in Kelaniya and the Flour milling plant in Modera, as described therein. Chapter 3 deals with cultural relations in varied sectors such as Buddhist philosophy, literature, art & sculpture, music & dancing, theatre & drama etc. Far-sighted initiatives taken by Prof. Gunapala Malalasekara, Ceylon’s first Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Vladimir Yakovlev, first Soviet Ambassador to Ceylon, truly laid a solid foundation in building and consolidating a true and long lasting relationship in the cultural arena. Prof. Malalasekara’s interest in the teachings of Buddhist philosophy as well as Sinhala, Pali and Sanskrit languages at the Moscow State University and Yakovlev’s interest in associating with Buddhism, the main religion of the island and his acquaintance with Buddhist priests, right from the beginning are examples of such initiatives. Another example related with Yakovlev was the setting up of a cultural division under the Embassy, no sooner the first cultural agreement between the two countries was signed in January, 1958 in Colombo.This division eventually culminated with the setting up of the Soviet Cultural Centre in Colombo in December 1973 and later succeeded as the Russian Centre in Colombo which stands to this day as an open window on Russia.
It is highlighted herein that Martin Wickramasinghe’s passion for Russian literature from his adolescence and his close association with Vladimir Yakovlev, the first Soviet Ambassador during his tenure in Ceylon, made a significant influence in building mutual understanding and co-operation in bilateral relations in this sphere. His first visit to the Soviet Union in 1959 and the eventual publication of his book titled ‘Rise of the Soviet Union,’ eventually made a great impact in the furtherance of friendship and mutual understanding between the two countries in the course of time. It was aptly recollected at the commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the said visit held in Colombo in October 2014 with the participation of Prof. Nina Krasnadembskaya, (a post-graduate aspirant mastering the Sinhalese language in the Leningrad State University at that time), who arrived as a special guest from Russia for the occasion. Martin Wickramasinghe has visited the Soviet Union on three more occasions thereafter, in 1965, 1967 and 1973.
Another aspect vividly described herein is the steadfast flow of Sinhala & Tamil versions of Russian & Soviet literature into the island since the establishment of diplomatic relations. Hundreds of such literary works translated and printed in Moscow thus filled the book shelves of the country, making Russian literature the most popular foreign literature among the reading public of Sri Lanka.
