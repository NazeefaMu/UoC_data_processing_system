Minister Samarasinghe inspects Ports Authority food quality

Following a meeting with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Trade Unions, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe instructed the administration to upgrade the menu and the quality of the food provided to its workers.
The directions came on June 1 after Minister Samarasinghe conducted a sudden examination of the food provided to the workers by the Ports Authority cafeteria. Minister Samarasinghe said the menu should be prepared according to what the workers wanted, and requested the administration to receive proposals regarding the menu from the Trade Union representatives.
