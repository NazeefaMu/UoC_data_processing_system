Less women in employment

Only 39.5 percent of Sri Lankan women are employed. The percentage of Sri Lankan men at work is 71.5 percent, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
Seneviratne said there is a huge gap between Sri Lankan men and women when it comes to employment.The Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry has paid special attention towards the Government’s ‘One million employment programme’. He was addressing a seminar held at Battaramulla recently.
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that although the entire workforce of the country is 8.3 million, only 3.7 million is involved in formal employment while the rest is in various other employments. Out of this 3.7 million, only 2.6 million employees have obtained the membership in a social security scheme.
Researchers should pay attention towards foreign employment. The results of research can be used when enacting laws and taking decisions, Minister Seneviratne added.
Six research papers submitted by six researchers were discussed during the seminar.The research papers were on unnoticed areas of the labour sector.
