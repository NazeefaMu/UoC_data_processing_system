UGC requests to call off strike

The University Grants Commission (UGC) requested the university non-academic staff to call off their strike yesterday.
UGC Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva said the UGC has decided to discuss the strikers’ issues if they return to work.
Prof. de Silva said the decision was taken at an administrative meeting held between the UGC and Higher Education Ministry officials last Wednesday.
Prof. de Silva further said that the decision has been conveyed to the University Trade Union Joint Committee (UTUJC) president Edward Malwatta as well.
