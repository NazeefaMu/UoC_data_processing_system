‘AG’s absence spoils GMOA, Govt efforts’

All agreements reached by the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) and the Government remained futile as the Attorney General failed to appear before courts yesterday as scheduled, the GMOA said.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said the Attorney General defeated the efforts made by the Prime Minister and the President to solve the issue.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the Health Minister has appointed a Director of the Tobacco Company as a member of the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital. This was, he said, despite the discussion with the President and the Prime Minister in connection with the minimum standard of the medical education. He cited this as a reason for the GMOA decision to withdraw from the discussion.
According to Dr. Aluthge, it seems no matter how hard discussions with the President and Prime Minister, at the end, one person changes everything according to his requirements.
The GMOA will not let the patients’ lives be in danger by lowering the standard of medical education using the political clout of certain Ministers, he said. Appointing a person who holds a position of a Director in the Tobacco Company into the Director Board of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital is a disgrace for the Government, he said.
