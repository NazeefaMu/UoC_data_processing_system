New Act on Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital

The changeover of the management of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital was effected pending the enactment of a new Act, Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa issuing a media release said.
A tri-party Letter of Intent was signed among the ministry, management of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the Bank of Ceylon to facilitate the process.
According to the release, a more detailed agreement than the Letter of Intent involving three parties connected to SAITM is being worked out by the Attorney General’s Department. As the three parties came to an understanding on the issue, it was decided to take over the hospital on August 1 by way of entering into the ‘Letter of Intent’ signed by representatives of the parties. The legal instrument to this effect will be signed once the agreement drafted by the Attorney General is finalised, the release said.
The management and operations of the hospital was taken over by the government based on a decision by the Cabinet of Ministers, the release said.
