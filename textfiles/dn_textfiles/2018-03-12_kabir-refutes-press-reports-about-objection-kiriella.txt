Kabir refutes press reports about objection to Kiriella

Higher Education and Highways Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim yesterday rejected as completely false certain press reports that he had objected to the appointment of Lakshman Kiriella as the new Minister of Law and Order. In a press release issued yesterday, Minister Hashim said the majority opinion in the UNP, including himself, was that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka should be appointed as Law and Order Minister. Although they could not realise that idea, as partners of the government they are immensely happy to see that a seasoned and veteran leader in the UNP, Ranjith Madduma Bandara has been appointed as the Law and Order Minister. Minister Hashim said the full blessings and support of the UNP will be afforded to Ranjith Madduma Bandara to enable him to fulfil his responsibilities as the Minister of Law and Order.
