AB de Villiers records a rare golden duck via run out in Test history

AB de Villiers might be one of the fastest runners in the sport but the frequency of him getting run out, especially in the crunch moments, is quite high. His love with the run outs carried over his career due to poor judgement while running due to his partners or by himself.
A similar sight was repeated during the ongoing Test match as South Africa's No.4 had to depart without a run to his name. He walked out to bat when the Saffers were 39/2 while chasing 417 but couldn't last more than one over.
South Africa's last hope in this chase evaporated with De Villiers, who scored an unbeaten 71 in the first innings, getting run out facing only one ball. Aiden Markram pushed a Nathan Lyon's delivery towards David Warner at square leg and De Villiers raced for a single. By the time Markram sent back his senior partner, Warner fired a throw to Nathan Lyon who did no mistake in disturbing the stumps. The 34-year-old lost his balance in returning to the bowlers' end and even a dive couldn't save him from getting out.
This was the 6th time AB de Villiers got run out in the Test format; the joint 2nd most times by a South African. John Waite got out via run out in Test cricket on seven occasions. Overall, this was De Villiers' 29th dismissal in International cricket via run out which are the most such dismissals among South Africans surpassing Jacques Kallis' 28 runouts.
This was the 8th Test duck for AB de Villiers with four of them in the last 12 innings.
