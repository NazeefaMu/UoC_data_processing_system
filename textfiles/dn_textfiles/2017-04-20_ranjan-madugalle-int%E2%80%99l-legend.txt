Ranjan Madugalle -an Int’l legend

 He created an unique record as player and international administrator in cricket. Deeply respected in all cricket fora. He is the former Royal College, Nondescripts Cricket Club and Sri Lanka captain. And to cap it all he is ICC’s Chief of Match Referees, And he is that batsman DESHABANDU SENERATH RANJAN MADUGALLE who has done Sri Lanka proud. MADUGALLE had his early education at Trinity College, Kandy before coming down to Colombo and joining Royal College, where he laid the foundation for stardom, by not only excelling in studies, but turning out to be an excellent captain, brilliant right hand batsman in the classical mould. He was also a tantalizing off spin bowler. But for reasons best known to him he quit bowling and concentrated only on batting. He represented his school and had the distinction of captaining the school in the famous 100th ‘Battle of the Blues’ against S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia which would have been one of his cricketing dreams.
A batsman of the highest class
On leaving school he joined the Nondescripts Cricket Club where he scored an avalanche of runs. National honours were not long in coming. He made his international debut in the inaugural Test match against England at the Colombo Oval in 1982 and had a memorable beginning by knocking up a half century 65 to be exact. But unfortunately Sri Lanka had to swallow the bitter pill of defeat due to poor batting, unable to counter the tantalizing spin of ‘offie’ John Emburey.
In that Test MADUGALLE countered the pace of Ian Botham, Bob Willis and Paul Allot and the spin of Derek Underwood and Emburey in style, with good footwork, and great timing. It was a wonderful debut and the connoisseurs watching him bat predicted a great future for the young man.
However MADUGALLE’s most unforgettable game would have been playing in the country’s Test team that recorded its first ever Test victory against India in the Second Test played at the historic Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium from September 6 to 10, 1985 by 149 runs. He made stylish 54 in the first innings and did not bat in the second innings.
The scores were – Sri Lanka 385 and 206 for 3 dec. India 244 and 198. That historic Sri Lanka team was captained by Duleep Mendis and India by Kapil Dev. That unique SRI LANKA team needs mentioning. – Sidath Wettimuny, Amal Silva, Ranjan Madugalle, Roy Dias, Duleep Mendis, Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Asantha de Mel, Rumesh Ratnayake, Sanjeewa Weerasighe and Saliya Ahangama.
INDIA – Lal Rajput, Kris Srikanth, Mohomed Azharuddin, Dilip Vengaskar, Lakshman Sivaramakrishnan, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amaranth, Ravi Shastri, Kapil Dev, Sadanand Vishwanath and Chetan Sharma – umpires S. Ponnaduri and S. Vithanagamage.
It was nice to see and hear Ravi Shastri, Sunil Gavaskar and Sivaramakrishnan the threesome of that Indian team that lost to Sri Lanka doing TV commentary in the recently concluded Test series between India and Australia in India won 2-1 by India.
President J.R. Jayewardene who was himself a cricketer and who was soaking in the action declared a national holiday to mark the historic occasion. President of the Cricket Board was Gamini Dissanayake and the man who fashioned it all was former Sri Lanka off spinning all rounder Abu Fuard who was also known as the power behind the throne.
After this success MADUGALLE went on to captain Sri Lanka in Two Test matches and 13 one-day internationals. He played in 21 Tests scoring 1029 runs with one century and 7 fifties and in the 63 ODIs scored 950 runs with 3 half centuries. He also played in the 1979 World Cup in England.
MADUGALLE was a batsman of the highest class. He would not bash the ball but caress it to whatever nook and corner on the field or over it with good footwork, sweet timing and always by providing the full face of the bat to the ball. The ugly looking horizontal or the reverse sweep was not in his repertoire.
That he gave up the game at the early age of 29 was inexplicable. That is the age when batsmen reach the pinnacle in their career. His early quitting was a loss to the game, but it was the gain of the International Cricket Conference who embraced him as a match referee when he was nominated by the local board.
The merciless killing
That was the stepping stone to this easy going and like able guy who performed his job to the best of his ability which impressed the ICC. It was not long when the establishment appointed him chief of match referees over many other contestants.
In this responsible job he has had a good rapport with captains and players because he handled them with honesty and was easy going. They respected him and today he holds the record of having officiated in over 300 Test matches and 300 One day Internationals. A legendary achievement.
Incidentally Ranjan’s father Lionel was the secretary to arguably the best Sports Minister the country had K.B.Ratnayake. Together they formed a powerful two man team and steered sport in the country to great heights. That was the time when there was a lot of infighting in sports bodies on trivial matters.
Lionel who fronted up a straight bat, like his son did, together with KBR used their sporting backgrounds which came in handy, to solve all problems to the satisfaction of all and also for the betterment of the game. They were indeed a fine pair and were always available to the media and cultivated good rapport.
Lionel was par excellence in his job and can arguably be said that he too was one if not the best secretary that the Ministry of Sports was fortunate to have at that time. Secretaries of Lionel’s caliber will not come and will not be easy to find. He ruled and advised ‘KBR’ on sports matters with no fear or favour. That was the era when there were two stormy petrels in cricket Abu Fuard and J.S.N. Anandaraja in football.
Lionel used to tell me that the two were headaches. But he had the soothing balm to cure those headaches and sport was tickety boo. All sportsmen and women admired the good work done by Lionel and ‘KBR’. Lionel also served under Vincent Perera who was one time Minister of Sport.
I am eternally indebted to Lionel for making my first ever tour abroad possible to the Munich Olympics in 1972 and it was an unforgettable one because that was the Games where the merciless killing of some Israeli athletes took place by a terror group calling itself Black September.
Lionel served as chairman in the committee appointed by me when I was Sports Editor of the ‘Times of Ceylon’
in the 1970s and ‘80s to select the ‘Schoolboy cricketer of the year’ and other award winners and together with the other members of that committee made their picks strictly on merit and there was no query in or challenging from any quarter about the selections.
Lionel is still batting and we wish him many more happy years at the crease. His son RANJAN is no doubt a LEGEND.
Wijesinha passes away
it is with great sadness that i pen these few lines on the passing away of R.B. Wijesinha, my cricketing guru who i featured in my previous column ‘SPORTS LEGENDS’ captioned - Wjesinha - legend of legends-.
A few days after my previous column appeared, my team mate at SBC Ranjit Fernando informed me that Wijesinha who had been admitted to Sri Jayewardene Hospital after falling ill and he was lingering. The perennial hymn - Why should we linger when Jesus is calling - would have been on his lips when the call came from his creator.
Indeed as in the sport he loved so much, he responded to the call of the Eternal Umpire, who’s ruling we all need to respond with a clear conscience as Wijesinha did, thankful that he was allowed to grace our midst for his near 97 years ,three short of the century.
May the turf that he strode like a colossus with great love, respect and success lie softly on him.
