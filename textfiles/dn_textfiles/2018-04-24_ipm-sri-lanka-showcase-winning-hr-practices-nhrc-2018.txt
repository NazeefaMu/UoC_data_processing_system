IPM Sri Lanka to Showcase Winning HR Practices at NHRC 2018

IPM Sri Lanka – the Nation’s leader in human resource management, will be showcasing winning corporate HR practices at its popular “IPM Great HR Practices” for the second consecutive year at the IPM National HR Conference 2018 which is being held on June 6 and 7 at the BMICH in Colombo.
The IPM Great HR Practices which was held for the first time in 2017 is considered by the HR fraternity as vastly successful.
IPM Great HR Practices is a platform for both public and private sector organizations to showcase their great HR practices which address a crucial HR issue and is considered as a game changer in the ongoing success of the organization.
“Showcasing best HR practices amongst companies will help to bolster performance by way of enhancing efficiency, productivity and employee engagement.
The IPM Great HR Practices plays a role of catalyst in this endeavor, and offers a recognized and accepted platform for showcasing of great HR practices,” said Samantha Rathnayake-Chairman, Organizing Committee, IPM Great HR Practices 2018.
IPM Sri Lanka now accepts applications from organizations that are reaping the benefits from a unique and innovative out-of-the-box “great HR practice” that they have successfully designed and deployed to address a crucial organizational HR related issue for the purpose of evaluation and selection of the best HR practice amongst many.
The submissions will be evaluated by an eminent panel of judges and 5 selected companies will be recognized during the Great HR Practices at the IPM National HR Conference 2018.
The human resource management discipline plays a significant role in adding value to organizations and showcasing best practices for “benchmarking” is a growing trend in order to help transform companies to the next level.
Showcasing of best practices is also important from a national perspective in order to step up the process of development of the national economy.
