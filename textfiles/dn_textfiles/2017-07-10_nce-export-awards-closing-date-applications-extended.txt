NCE Export Awards  closing date of  applications extended

The Annual Export Awards of the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) which is the most awaited Business event related to exports and which is of national significance is scheduled to be held on September 29, 2017 at the Hilton Colombo.
The event this year is of special significance as it is the 25th Anniversary (Silver Jubilee) incorporating special features and additional Special Awards.
The NCE in its previous communications to members and other stakeholders has informed applicants that selection of award winners this year will not be based mainly on export performance, with special emphasis given to other aspects related to exports, including participation in Export Value Chains, Environmental aspects, Management aspects, Differentiation of products and services, impact on other stakeholders etc.
Further, due to the general Global downturn in International Trade, which is reflected in the general performance of Sri Lankan Exporters as well, may necessitate the Panel of Judges to reevaluate the benchmarks for the selection of Award winners to reflect Global Trading Conditions.
As such due to the unprecedented interest from prospective applicants the Chamber has extended the deadline for applicants to July 28, 2017, to provide a fair opportunity to showcase their achievements.
