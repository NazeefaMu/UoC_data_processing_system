“F1 is delighted to extend its relationship with Singapore Airlines. The strength of Singapore as a destination is an example of the excitement F1 is creating around the globe and having prestigious partners such as Singapore Airlines shows our ambitious vision is shared by the market leading companies around the world,” said Chairman and CEO of Formula 1 Chase Carey.
“We are delighted to have Singapore Airlines partner us once more as Title Sponsor for the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix.
