Always  already  alienated

The slow night mail coach to Maddakalappu from Colombo passed through Mannampitiya and was moving towards Welikanda.
I noticed a Sinhala girl smiling with me. I just smiled too without making it obvious. But she was not a middle-aged female for me to respond.
She was, in fact, a grown-up lass with a nice figure.
Until Sellathurai boarded the train at Gal Oya, I was deeply interested in reading the novel by Alberto Moravia. I spent the time chatting with Sellathurai and did not see the time passing Maybe that I didn’t see her first.
She was wearing a sarong-like dress leaving ample space bare to see her navel and a jacket. She was really a bombshell.
She must have been listening to the chat Sellathurai and I had had. That’s why we both didn’t notice her.
Rest of the passengers were half-asleep and were putting their heads on the shoulders of their neighbours It was not fair to expect them awake at 4.30 in the morning.
Her cheeks became reddish dimples. Her eyelids were moving up and down. Her eyes pierced through mine. At the end of her lips, a faint smile blossomed and bloomed widely over her face. Her chest went up and down-boombudy boom as Sophia Loren sang- I was shy to look at her.
Cha! Shame1.Why should I get enchanted over an ordinary Sinhala girl my thoughts lingered. But again, I comforted that God has created our eyes to appreciate pleasant things. Shedding my arrogance of middle-class superiority, I voluntarily smiled with her. She opened her purple-red lips and showed her pearl-like teeth.
Sellathurai smelt what was going on.
“What does that baby want from you?”, he asked.
“ Nothing special. She just smiles.” I said.
“ Yaa, Ya. She will smile”, she sarcastically said in frustration as if he was a saint. What he said made me interested in this girl.
“What?”
“Hkum! Look, after these people flooded Amparai, the flirting in Maddakkalappu too has come to stay. The so-called Thamil culture has vanished from the East. Those Tamil girls are imitating the Sinhala girls. They are all falling in love with unknown people”
“What are you saying Sellathurai? You are saying something like a dialogue in a film”
He laughed. She laughed. Me too laughed without not allowing my shoulders relaxed as if I am a joker.
What is this? Does that Sinhala girl in the train know Thamil for her to laugh? I told him in English that she seems to know Thamil, as she too laughed
She giggled in the manner of the sound of a waterfall.
“I have been listening to your conversation’, he babbled in English.
“I am a Tamil too,” – when she started talking in Thami, I was flabbergasted.
“So, why are you dressed like this?’, Sellathurai asked her boldly.
“Oh, this? That’s a big story”, she said.
“Why don’t you tell us briefly?’, Sellathurai intervened. I looked outside without any purpose. It was dawning rapidly. At a distance, I could see the Vaalaichenai Paper factory profusely illuminated. The train was pacing through the Oddamaavadi bridge. In one hours’ time, I could step down on the soil of the ‘Singing Fish’. The landscape was green with beautiful vistas. It reminded me of the ancient Tamils’ five kinds of lands.
Sellathurai distracted my attention saying “Listen, Chum, sister wants to tell us her story”
I didn’t reply him turning my face from the window and looked only at the face of Sellathurai. I felt shy to look at her. She was narrating: “My name is Vijaya Malar. Studying in Colombo. There was a fancy-dress competition in our school. I took part as a pretty Sinhala girl”
“I received a telegram that my mother was sick and to come to Maddakkalppu immediately. I didn’t have time I change into a new dress. No time to pack my luggage. Only a few minutes were left to catch the train. So, I rushed to the station with this dress.”
“I learn that this family was going Maddakkalappu. So, I joined with them.” The family she showed was a Sinhala family. I noticed that most of the passengers on the train was Sinhalese.
“Where do you live in Batti?” “Lake Road” – Sellathurai and that girl were chatting with each other enormously.
I was patiently listening to their conversation. I was dumbstruck. Maybe I was enchanted with the look of the girl.
Sellathurai who spoke disparagingly of her at first was now eagerly conversing with her. That was not surprising. The girl who smiled with me at first ignored me now thinking perhaps that I was useless., Bothe were all agog laughing and chatting. Both of them ignored me totally.
After all birds of a feather will flock together.
The train stopped at the Maddakkalppu railway station. They were still chatting. I got down and walked out of the station.
