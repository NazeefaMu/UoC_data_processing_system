On Monday, March 13 at the UN Human Rights Council, the United States and other members of the Friends of Sri Lanka Core Group tabled a draft resolution on promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka that reflects our enduring commitment to lasting peace and justice for all the people of Sri Lanka.
The United States worked in close consultation with the United Kingdom, Montenegro and Macedonia and in partnership with the Government of Sri Lanka, to draft the resolution.
We look forward to the adoption of the text, which will support reconciliation and justice in Sri Lanka, help ensure a non-recurrence of conflict and strengthen democratic governance and freedoms for all Sri Lankans.
The United States is pleased that Sri Lanka has agreed once again to co-sponsor the resolution, and invites like-minded UN members to demonstrate support for reconciliation and peace in Sri Lanka by adding their names to the list of co-sponsors.
