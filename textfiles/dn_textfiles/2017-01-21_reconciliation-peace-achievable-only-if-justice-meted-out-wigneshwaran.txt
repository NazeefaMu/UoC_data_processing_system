Reconciliation, peace achievable only if justice is meted out: Wigneshwaran

Reconciliation and sustainable peace can be achieved only if justice is meted out to the long standing injustice suffered by the people, Northern Chief Minister C.V. Wigneshwaran said.
The Northern Province Chief Minister was speaking during a discussion with Political, Trade and Communications Counsellor of the European Delegation in Sri Lanka and Maldives Paul Godfrey.
Godfrey along with several officials attached to the European Union visited Jaffna yesterday.
Chief Minister Wigneshwaran said he had informed the EU officials that there is a strong need to implement initiatives to uplift the lives of war widows and Ex-LTTE cadres and added that the officials had agreed to extend their support.
“No skills based training was provided to Ex- LTTE cadres during the reconciliation programmes. No opportunities were provided to continue their normal life.And if any problem occurred in the area, the police immediately arrested them. This situation has to change immediately. Measures have to be taken to give them recognition,” the Chief Minister said.
Wigneshwaran stressed that investigations related to the alleged war crimes have to be conducted and added only if justice is meted out to all, the injustice that occurred during the war that there would be sustainable peace and reconciliation. He further said many issues can be addressed if adequate political powers are given.
“Several people strongly oppose the concept of power devolution. I have told the officials that by creating awareness among the people about the positive aspects of devolution of power, many prevailing problems related to the Tamils can be easily solved,”he added.
