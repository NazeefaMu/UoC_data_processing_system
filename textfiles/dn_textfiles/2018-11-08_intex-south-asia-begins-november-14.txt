Intex South Asia begins November 14

The textile and apparel manufacturing industry from across the globe meets at Intex South Asia, the biggest international apparel textile sourcing show in the South Asian region.
The success of Intex South Asia 2017 has compelled the 2018 edition of South Asia’s largest textile sourcing show to secure more exhibition space at the grand Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre (BMICH) in Colombo, from November 14-16, 2018, to accommodate the international exhibitors and global buyers from apparel brands, retailers, sourcing and buying offices, apparel manufacturers, fashion designers and labels and industry experts in attendance.
In 2018, the 4th edition of Intex South Asia has transformed into a comprehensive trade show and business intelligence conference, attracting hundreds of apparel and textile entrepreneurs and manufacturers from around the world, including international buyers from 200+ companies of 15 countries and regions such as Twin-Set (Italy), ORN International (UK), Marks & Spencer (Bangladesh), Harp Textiles (UAE), Asmara Apparels (India), VIP Clothing (India), Cambridge Clothing (India), Trigger Jeans (India), Arvind Lifestyle Brands (India), Herma (Hong Kong), Chris Garments & Wear (Nigeria), Fu HsunFiber Industries (Taiwan) and Hung ThinhPhu (Vietnam) will have the opportunity to check out the latest cutting-edge Yarns, Apparel Fabrics, Denim Fabrics, Clothing Accessories and Allied Services at a single location.
This year, buyers will see country pavilions including the India Pavilion organised by FIEO (Federation of Indian Export Organisations); the Taiwan Pavilion organised by Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF) that would showcase innovative, functional and eco-friendly textiles for sports and the leisure sectors. Companies will showcase their latest textile developments and connect with existing and potential buyers from South Asia and other international markets at the event.
Intex South Asia’s market intelligence offering – the ‘Interactive Business Forum’ – will see a seminar by The Woolmark Company on ‘Merino Wool – Nature’s Performance Fiber’ and also a seminar on ‘Future Proofing For Business – The Sustainable Way’ by the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI).
The show is organised with the official endorsement and support of The Ministry of Industry and Commerce of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL), The National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (NCCSL), Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF), Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF), Export Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh (EPB), Malaysia Knitting Manufacturers Association (MKMA), The Textile Merchants Group (TEXMAS) and many other leading industry trade bodies across Asia.
