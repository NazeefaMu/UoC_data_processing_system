Over 50 Thalassemia patients contract hepatitis-C through blood transfusion

Over 50 thalassemia patients had contracted hepatitis-C virus through blood transfusion they received from state hospitals despite the claim that the virus has already been eliminated from Sri Lanka.
The Health Ministry has already been informed about the issue but still there is no response, Ragama Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Roy Perera said.
Addressing a programme held at Kadawatha yesterday, he said 20 thalassemia patients from Ragama and another 32 from Anuradhapura contracted the hepatitis-C virus, which is transmitted through blood. Every month, about two Hepatitis patients with hepatitis-C virus are being detected, he said.
