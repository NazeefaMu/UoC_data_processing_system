Australian govt supports professional development in SL’s tourism sector

The final component of the Australian Awards Short Course on ‘Sustainable Tourism Development’, a five-day workshop, was held in Colombo Galle Face Hotel from June 18 to 22.
The course brought together 25 representatives from government departments and tourism companies. This group began the short course with a workshop in February, followed by a ten-day study tour in Queensland in March.
Speaking at the June 21 symposium for the workshop, First Secretary (Development) of the Australian High Commission, Dr. Thomas Davis said the course has equipped participants with both the theory and practice to contribute to the implementation of Sri Lanka’s Tourism Strategic Plan 2017 - 2020. He emphasised that “tourism is a key sector for the Foreign Affairs and Trade Department’s development work in Sri Lanka.”
Also present at the symposium were senior officials from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management and officials from a wide range of reputed tourism institutions.
The course was delivered through Griffith University’s International Business Development Unit in coordination with Griffith University’s Institute for Tourism (GIFT) and the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC). Aligning with the core focus of the Sri Lanka Tourism Strategic Plan 2017 - 2020, the Short Course was developed to improve the economic benefits of Sri Lanka’s tourism sector by providing key technical knowhow to industry professionals.
