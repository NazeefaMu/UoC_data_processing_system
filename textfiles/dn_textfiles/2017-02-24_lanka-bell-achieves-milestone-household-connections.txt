Lanka Bell achieves milestone in household connections

Lanka Bell, Sri Lanka’s telecom operator has achieved a milestone by reaching 35,000+ households and businesses with its fourth-generation LTE internet connectivity branded as Bell4G.
Within a short duration, Bell4G has raised the bar from serving 15,000 to 35,000+ customers. Moreover, Bell4G enables Lanka Bell to be on par with or supersede the rest in this sphere, swiftly gaining ground as the preferred choice for 4G technology users islandwide.
“The demand for Lanka Bell’s Bell4G service has reached a staggering height and created a landmark victory as the preferred internet service provider in the island due to its speed, reliability, uninterrupted connectivity, and value for money”, said Managing Director of Lanka Bell Limited, Dr. Prasad Samarasinghe.   
Lanka Bell marked this milestone at the ART TV CEO Forum recently in the presence of Dr. Indrajith Coomraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka - who was the Guest Speaker at this forum, with Dr. Prasad Samarasinghe in attendance.
With attractive packages ranging from Starter, Intro and Family packs offering multiple-functionality, additional off-peak capacity and the lowest rates in the market, Bell4G is the preferred option in terms of internet connectivity. Furthermore, BELL 4G subscribers who have been with the network for a period of one year will receive an additional 5GB free monthly and with 2GB being added on monthly for every year for the following three years of subscription. At the end of 4 years, BELL 4G customers will receive 11GB absolutely free on a monthly- basis under this loyalty scheme.
Lanka Bell’s initial foray into the service began in February 2014  operating in band 40 on the frequency range of 2.3 GHz which is the preferred spectrum for LTE operations. This helps Bell4G subscribers to experience faster upload/download speeds in addition to a host of added advantages. 
The operation which began in Colombo per se, reached the suburbs and major towns with a rapid rate of acceleration due to its extensive coverage, and the Company’s reputation as a customer-oriented service provider.
“Lanka Bell’s commitment to innovation and research has resulted in achieving its targets in rapid succession within a brief period. Further, Bell4G, with its cutting-edge technology is five times faster than 3G technology, making it the number one choice in the market”, Dr. Samarasinghe added.
With a rapidly expanding coverage, flexibility, and simultaneous accessibility to over 20 smart devices, Lanka Bell’s Bell4G is the ideal option for homes and small businesses.
