Prison officers nab woman with heroin hidden in plantain

Anuradhapura Prison officials nabbed a woman when she was carrying a packet of heroin hidden in a banana for her husband.
She was handed over to the Anuradhapura Anti-vice Unit on December 10. The prison officers checked the plantains that the woman brought when they received a tip off in this regard.
The packet of heroin was put in a plastic tube and hidden in the plantain. The packet contained 210 mg of heroin, prison officials said. The 47-year-old suspect is a resident of Katukaliyawa, Galkadawala.
She was to be produced before the Anuradhapura Magistrate yesterday.
Investigations are continuing.
