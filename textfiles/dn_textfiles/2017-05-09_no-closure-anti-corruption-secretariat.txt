No closure of Anti-Corruption Secretariat

A Committee consisting of officials from the Commission to Investigate Acts of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC), Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and the Anti-Corruption Committee Secretariat, is looking at the future responsibilities and functions of the Secretariat.
A statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office yesterday denied media reports that the Secretariat faced closure and stated the above mentioned Committee was in the process of working out a special report on whether the Secretariat should continue functioning as before, should its activities be amended or whether the Secretariat should be given responsibilities and functions similar to that of CIABOC and the FCID.
The Prime Minister’s Office further stated that a final decision would be arrived at once the Committee finalizes its report.
A source within the Secretariat speaking to the Daily News, however, said they did not know much about the Committee but that there was a pending Cabinet paper forwarded by the Prime Minister to make it a statutory body.
“We were aware of a move to make it a stronger anti-corruption body and if it was a statutory body it would be more independent,” said the source within the Secretariat.
The Anti-Corruption Secretariat located next to Temple Trees was established in 2015 to investigate into public complaints of corruption and fraud and thereafter, direct genuine complaints to either the FCID or CIABOC.
