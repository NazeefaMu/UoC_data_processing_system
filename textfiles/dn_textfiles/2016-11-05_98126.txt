Boralu Boyz Mountain Trail Biking Skills Training Camp

Boralu Boyz a mountain biking group has organised a Mountain Trail Biking (MTB) skills training camp featuring Kerstin Kogler from Germany. Kerstin, an MTB pro rider and qualified coach is also a member of the BMC Swiss riding team and will be conducting a MTB skills training camp in Sri Lanka. Her extensive knowledge in coaching, racing and preparation for a race will be of benefit to all participants.

The training will be in three categories with basic, intermediate and advanced, spanning over three days.
The Boralu Boyz was formed in 2013 when a selected group of riders were invited to ride a freshly “carved out” trail from Beragala to Kuda Oya, through the Udawalve jungle. After successfully completing this fantastic and epic adventure, the riders and their bikes were all huddled up in a bus, on the return trip to Colombo.
During the long 5 hour bus ride from Udawalave to Colombo, this group of riders decided to come up with a name identifying them, in line with their passion, of Mountain Biking.
Many names were suggested and finally with much debate, it was decided unanimously that the name should be Boralu Boyz - fitting more so as they ride the “roller coaster” Boralu Trail very often.
The Primary objectives of the BB's are Health, fitness and fun. The Order of the day is to enjoy the ride with banter and laughter which is nothing short of making each ride memorable whilst of course keeping up the challenge of climbing, the long and steep uphill stretches, maintaining good balance and speed in downhill areas and off road tracks.
The BB's rides take place on weekdays and weekends starting 6 am. They also have specially organized rides out of Colombo on long weekends and special holidays.
Taking into consideration the growing number of MTB riders and the lack of skill and information available for good riding Boralu Boyz have the fine opportunity of securing a world-class rider cum coach to help Sri Lankan's attain a higher level of skill in riding mountain bikes. The event will be held on the 11th, 12th and 13th of November. The areas covered for the training of skills will include basic, intermediate and advance spanning over three days. The tickets are priced at a very nominal Rs. 5000 per day, which will include refreshments. All riders should take this opportunity and benefit from Kerstin and advance their riding skills. Furthermore the Boralu Boyz are offering a day of advance training to the very competitive riders some of them being Army, Navy and Air force personnel who can represent Sri Lanka at an international level free of charge.
