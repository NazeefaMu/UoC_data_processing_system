Fair administration, satisfied citizens

I was astonished to come across the front page news item (9.1.2017), ‘no one can topple the Government.’ It is absolutely true that no outside force can topple the legally formed democratic Government. Even internal force like the defeated political force cannot change the elected regime in power.
Neither foreign countries nor the conspirators will be able to capture the ruling power under the current situation in which Yahapalanaya is in progress and strong with promotion of economic development and ethnic harmony. Then what is wrong with the Good Governance? Even enemies of the coalition administration cannot utter a word of animosity since everything is fairly and reasonably done without leaving anything for discrimination and denial.
It must be mentioned to the credit of the president and the prime minister that the precaution and vigilance have been exercised in preventing the evils of corruption in all the fields.
Then the police, and military forces have been reformed with good morality while the judiciary has been made independent of political intervention.
As a result, an exemplary democracy has been firmly established within two years of honest and hard work by the coalition government.
Then, there is no reason for anyone to attempt disrupting the smooth process of the administration after all. It is the bounden duty of all to extend the fullest co-operation towards the successful journey of the regime.
