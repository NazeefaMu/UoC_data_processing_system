Construction of Landmark’s Park Residencies in progress

The construction of Park Residencies by Landmark (Pvt) Ltd project s in Pagoda is underway.
Designed by a young architect it comprises 16 apartments with a clear view of the jogging path. This complex also houses a yoga studio, fully-equipped gym, pool and a little café exclusively for residents.
Property developer, Landmark (Pvt) Ltd is a family run entity so the importance of family and community is a factor that is strongly associated with the company and its projects. The yoga studio, gymnasium, pool and café designed exclusively for residents was included in the plan in order to create the kind of atmosphere that would emphasize and highlight on the collective and communal factor that they wish to portray.
The property developers also focus on detail and the standards of their product. As the developers have all of their suppliers under one roof and ensuring that they are in perfect synchronization to the customer requirement, maintaining the quality and the standards of the construction process and installations is foolproof.
Landmark is led by Chairperson, Neelangi Hapangama, a businesswoman in both Sri Lanka and Australia who has dedicated a large portion of her life to designing children’s furniture and toys. Eksith Hapangama, is the Managing Director of Landmark (Pvt) Ltd.
