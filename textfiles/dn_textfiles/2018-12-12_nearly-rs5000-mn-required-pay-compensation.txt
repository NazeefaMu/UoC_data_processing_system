Yan Oya Reservoir Project:
Nearly Rs.5,000 mn required to pay compensation

The Deputy Project Director of the ‘Yan Oya Reservoir Project’ Engineer Palitha Wickramatilake, said that nearly Rs. 5000 million is required to pay compensation for lands acquired to construct the reservoir.
He referred to the protests staged by villagers demanding compensation for the lands they lost due to the construction of the reservoir.
‘Now the process of filling the Yan Oya reservoir is in progress. The reservoir’s water capacity is 149,000 acre feet and the government invested nearly Rs. 36,000 million to complete the project. There was a delay in paying compensation to evacuated families, but, we are currently investigating in to compensation inquiries. At the same time, 70 families have been paid compensation worth Rs. 150 million,’ the Deputy Project Director said.
We expect to complete compensation payments before May, next year. We also have made arrangements to pay compensations to farmers whose lands were destroyed during previous cultivation seasons, under the programme, ‘Ahimi Kanna Wandhi’.
Through the programme, they will receive compensations worth Rs. 35,000-50,000, he added.
