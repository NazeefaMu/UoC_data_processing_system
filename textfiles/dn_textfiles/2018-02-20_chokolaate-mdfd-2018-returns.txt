The much-awaited fashion spectacle for mothers and daughters the Chokolaate Mother Daughter Fashion Designer (MDFD) Contest returns for the ninth consecutive year in association with LiCC Jeans. This year’s gala event will take place on May 26 at SLECC.
The fashion show this year will in similar fashion to the previous years have designers create outfits in the casual, sports and evening wear segments for a mother and daughter duo.
The unique concept of the fashion show was the brainchild of Chokolaate’s Managing Editor Michelle Gunasekara who herself is a mother of three. The title sponsor for this year’s contest will be LiCC Jeans who will also showcase their brand in a special feature segment. The official agreement signing between Chokolaate and LiCC took place recently.

Twelve finalists will be picked for this year’s competition by a panel of preliminary resource persons from the fashion and apparel industry and the winner will be adjudged at the finale by an eminent panel of judges. The mothers and daughter walking the ramp will be trained and choreographed by Rozanne Diasz while hair and make-up will be handled by Salon Chrissy Rozairo. Moment of the event will be captured by the Official Photographer Praveen Mirando and Official Videographer Radicalz.
