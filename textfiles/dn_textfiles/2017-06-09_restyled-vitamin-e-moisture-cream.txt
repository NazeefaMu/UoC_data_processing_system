Restyled Vitamin E Moisture Cream

The Body Shop’s Vitamin E Moisture Cream is now available in a limited edition jar designed by Eley Kishimoto. 40 years since it was first introduced, the 48 hour Vitamin E Moisture Cream remains a best-seller in The Body Shop product arsenal, with figures suggesting that one sells every 18 seconds.
The product uses Vitamin E boosted by 100% natural origin hyaluronic acid and can be used on any skin type.
Inside, the Vitamin E formula is as potently moisturizing as ever.
This lightweight and easily absorbed facial moisturizer locks in moisture for 48 hour hydration. Formulated with Vitamin E, 100% natural origin hyaluronic acid and wheatgerm oil, it wards off dryness and brings back a fresh glow to plumped skin.
The hyaluronic acid is made from fermented and purified wheat stalks salvaged from the French wheat grain harvest; when used in cream, this acid generates a film on top of the natural skin barrier to create a reservoir on and within the skin surface, and retains moisture for up to 48 hours.
Eley Kishimoto has dressed up Vitamin E for 2017 with an exclusive new graphic look inspired by the vibrant pops of pink springing up in the new season’s catwalks.
The London based designer duo have a passion for pairing bold patterns with slow fashion and sustainable living-making them an ideal fit for The Body Shop’s ethical fashion philosophy.
