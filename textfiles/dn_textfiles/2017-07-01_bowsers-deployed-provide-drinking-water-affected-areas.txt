Bowsers deployed to provide drinking water for affected areas

Several highland areas and re-settlement villages in Ampara District are experiencing a severe drinking water problem due to the ongoing drought.
As a result, Local Government authorities have made arrangements to distribute water using bowsers.
Drinking water is distributed in affected areas by the Divisional Secretariat funded by the Disaster Management Ministry, said Ampara District Disaster Management Centre Assistant Director A. S. M. Ziyath said.
About 36,000 residents from 10,000 families were affected by the drought in the divisional secretariat areas of Lahugala, Maha- Oya, Pottuvil, Akkaraipattu, Navithanveli,, Thirukkovil and Alayadivembu in the Ampara district.
Consumers are provided water every other day. They however, request drinking water to be made available every day.
