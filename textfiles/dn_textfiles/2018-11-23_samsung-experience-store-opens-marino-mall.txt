Samsung Experience Store opens at Marino Mall

Samsung Sri Lanka unveiled the new Samsung Experience Showroom dedicated to mobiles at Marino Mall on Wdnesday.
The Samsung Experience Store offers an entirely new and unprecedented experience for shoppers who will be greeted and guided by friendly and professionally trained staff providing customers an opportunity to get a hands-on experience of the smartphones. Samsung’s Galaxy A series of mobile phones, including the newly launched Galaxy A7 and Galaxy Note9 and the full range of Galaxy J Series are available at the Experience Store along with a range of accessories.
This is the second Samsung concept store to make its mark at Marino Mall, with the first one dedicated to consumer electronic products which was launched at the Marino Mall earlier this year. “We hope to open another Samsung Experience Store at Shangri La Mall soon”, said General Manager and Head of Mobile Business of Samsung Sri Lanka, Shantha Fernando.

“The Samsung Experience Store opening further reinforces our presence in the market and strengthens our position as the market leading smartphone brand in the country. As a lifestyle hub, Marino Mall offers the right ambience and shopper profile who will appreciate the high quality and superlative performance of the recently-launched Samsung high value smartphones. Samsung is proud to partner with one of its national distributors, Damro, the owners of Marino Mall, to explore emerging opportunities.”
He also said that Samsung sales are rapidly increasing and the new cutting edge technology phones that are regularly launched by Samsung and the large dealer network and the superior after sales service is the key to this success.
He said that soon they will touch the 50% of the local handset market share for Samsung.
Besides Damro, Samsung’s portfolio of authorized distributors includes JKOA, Softlogic, Singer and Singhagiri. Samsung continues to expand its customer base by entering into strategic partnerships to develop its distribution network in Sri Lanka. As Sri Lanka’s most preferred mobile brand, Samsung has carved out a leadership position for itself in the local smartphone industry.
In keeping with this, the newly-launched store will showcase the brand’s latest smartphone models and the enhanced features each device offers.
