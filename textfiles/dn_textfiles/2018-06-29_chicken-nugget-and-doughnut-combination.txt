Chicken nugget and doughnut combination

When it comes to food trends, we've had it all.
From cronuts to rainbow bagels and ice cream burritos, there's been an array of wacky food hybrids gracing our Instagram feeds over the past year.
But now it's time for something new - and it's safe to say you're definitely going to want to try it. A businessman from Scotland has created a doughnut and chicken nugget hybrid he calls 'the Donug'.
The circular treat sees chicken shaped into a classic doughnut ring, before being covered in a cornflake and panko crumb and deep fried.
If that weren't enough, Donugs come with the option of three sauces - cheesy Dijon bechamel, hot chilli or golden Japanese curry with mozzarella. Or if you prefer, you can just enjoy it plain. Created by Crag Carrick, who hails from Glasgow but now lives in Australia, the Donug costs £5 a pop.
Speaking to Metro , Crag said: "It's about getting Donugs sold at every sporting ground, every service station, every fish and chip shop.
"I want this to be the crazy new food trend coming out of Melbourne."
He added: "I'm giving something that's fun, it's easy to understand, people get it straight away. There's nothing sweet about it. All savoury. It's 98 percent chicken that has our unique and top-secret spice mix."
Donugs took off online recently after Crag appeared on an Australian show called Shark Tank, which is similar to Dragon's Den.
On the show, he was given a £56,000 investment for the Donug business which will be used to pay a manufacturer to start producing Donugs in mass, as well as to cover storage and packing costs. So far the Donug is only available in Melbourne, but if business proves to be successful, Crag will be bringing the quirky creation to the UK and beyond very soon.
Food lovers on social media have gone wild for the savoury treat. Commenting on the @loveadonug Instagram account, users shared their excitement. One wrote: "I'm dreaming I'm eating this!" While another added: "I'm moving to Australia!"
