Sculpted intelligence

In oriental culture, especially in Hindu and Buddhist tradition, each direction is believed to be guarded by the guardians. Different guardians are given to different Lokas or Realms. The guardians of each Loka is called by a special terminology called Palas. According to Hinduism, each direction is allocated to one particular guardian-or deity. Each Pala has its own Loka. These guardians are called as Palas. The Palas are divided into categories. The main two categories are Dikpalas and Lokapalas.
Dikpalas mean guardians of different directions. The term Dikpalas is a Sanskirit term. The guardians are the deities who guard specific directions of space according to Hinduism. The group of eight deities is referred as Asta-Dikpalas, literally meaning guardians of eight directions. Sometimes they are often referred to additionally with two extra deities; hence altogether there are ten Dikpalas for ten different directions.
Nine directions
When altogether there are ten Dikpalas, they are called as Dasa-Dikpala. In Hinduism, these traditional images are often depicted on the walls and rooftops. In certain countries in South East Asian region like Java and Bali have altogether nine Dikpalas for nine directions. These nine Dikpalas are mentioned as Nava Dikpalas. Such faith could be seen in the Chinese faith also. According to Chinese tradition total number of Dikpalas are four, which are guarding four different directions.
Meanwhile, Lokapalas mean the guardians of a different kingdom. They are supposed to guard Nine Lokas. Altogether for nine Lokas, nine guardians are allocated. Different guardians are allocated for different directions. Kubera is the deity of Northern direction and he guards with the weapon of mace. Indra is believed to be the God of air and his direction is east. Yama is the God of South and his weapon is the staff. Varuna is the God of Water and his direction is the West. His guarding weapon is the noose. Besides Lord Brahma guards the zenith, (the highest point in the sky). Vishnu guards at Nadir the point just opposite the Zenith. His guarding weapon is chakra. The Ishana guards the northeast and his weapon is a trident. Agni guards the southeast and its weapon is spear. Vayu guards the northwest; Nirrti guards the southwest with the sword.
Temple entrance
In Buddhist tradition, the Lokpalas guardians are named as Dhrtarastra (East), Virupaksa (West) Vaisravana(North) and Virudhaka (South)l With these Lokapalas Lord Brahma and Vishnu are also included. Following this tradition, still, the Hindu religious temples install guards at the temple entrance. These Hindu temple guards are called as Duwarapalakas.
Similarly, in the Sri Lankan archaeological sites beautiful guard stones are found. The guard stones are found at the entrance of the important places such as Buddhist temples. Earlier guard stones were installed at royal palaces, important royal courts, water reservoirs and cultural chambers. In Sri Lanka, a variety of guard stones is found at different archaeological sites.
At the entrance of Hindu temples, two guards are always installed at the entrance. These guards are called either Dwarapalas or Dwarapalakas. They are always installed not only at the Hindu temple entrance but they also guard at the entrance of sanctum or sanatorium. A Pair of Dwarapalakas is installed not only as the entrance guards, but they are also regarded as servants or as warriors for protection. Normally these statues are installed as huge figures. Even in the South East Asian region at the entrance of the temples the guard figures are depicted with tuff and fearsome appearance.
Vaishnava cult
The nature and appearance of Vishnu temple Duwarapalakas are quite different from the Saiva temples. In the Vishnu temple, Duwarapalakas reflect the Vaishnava cult.
They resemble the artifacts or the symbols of Vaishnavaism. The temple guards of Vaishnava temples bear, Namam on the forehead and hold Chakara with the right upper hand and conch in the left hand. In the one lower hand the mace is held and in the other lower hand holds the noose (pasa cord, the coil of rope). In the Sakthism division in Hinduism which is strongly connected with Sakthi worship (Kaali worship). At the entrance of the Satkhi temples, two female guards are guarding the temples. These female guards are called Duwarapalakis. In certain Skanda temples, two Idumpan guards are installed to guard them at the outside temple entrance
Installing Duwrapalaka statues at the entrance of Hindu temples came into being following the ancient tradition of installing of Lokpalas and Dikpalas. A lot of bronze Dikpalas and Lokpalas sculptures are excavated from the Polonnaruwa area. Now all these sculptures are well preserved, housed and displayed in numerous different museums of Sri Lanka, especially in Colombo and Polonnaruva.
