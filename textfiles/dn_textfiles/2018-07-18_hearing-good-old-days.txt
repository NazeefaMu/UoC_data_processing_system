Hearing the good old days

There is an opportunity for the music lover who grew up listening to the music of the 60s and 70s that can only be described as glorious. It is a journey back in time replete with nostalgia and memories. Naturally, this star-studded show not only spells out the best in entertainment but will bring out the ultimate in enjoyment. This is what makes this show different and distinct from any other show in the past. The front line entertainers from an era that produced undying, perennial and evergreen melodies with simple but heartwarming lyrics, will share the stage at the BMICH on July 21 at 7 pm. It will indeed be an experience that will long be remembered when you see and hear Desmond De Silva, Mignonne Fernando, Conrad de Silva, Dalreen Suby, Maxie Rosario, Annesley Malawana, Mariazelle Goonetileke and Priya Peiris in action just like it used to be. Naturally, the show aptly carries the title "Those were the days."
When the curtains rise, Mignonne will do a medley of popular songs which she performed with the Jetliners. Maxi will do his signature song 'Bridge over troubled water" plus other songs he performed with The Fireflies and Spitfires. Dalreen will sing and sway to her signature song "I am a tiger" plus many other great favourites. Noeline will draw from her repertoire of hits as she performed them with the Spitfires. To enrich the flavour of the evening's music, Annesley will bring out a selection of finger clicking and toe-tapping music and song from the days of the Moonstones in the late 60's. Mariazelle will go back to her beginnings with the Junior Rhythmers and go on to get the audience singing along to her most popular renderings. Priya will bring out the best from La Bambas.
Conrad and Desmond have been flown down especially for the show. Conrad, with the power in his voice, will render the best of Englebert, Tom Jones and Frank Sinatra. Super entertainer, Desmond, will wind up the show with both Western hits from the 60s and 70s and the Sinhala bailas.
The show, which will be of a duration of 3 ½ hours, will start sharp at 7 pm and have as its Compere, the legendary and evergreen Vijaya Corea.
