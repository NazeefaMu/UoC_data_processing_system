Navy upgrades ‘Disaster Response Capabilities’

A ‘Disaster Response Unit’ was opened at SLNS Gemunu, Welisara by Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra C. Wijegunaratne.
The Navy Commander addressing the officers and sailors said, "At present we do not have a visible enemy like the LTTE we had before 2009. But, today we face yet another enemy that comes in the form of natural disasters and it is our prime duty to save the public from natural disasters like floods, landslide, etc. In doing so, we have to be prepared to meet the highest professional level."
He further stated that this unit would be able to swiftly respond to natural disasters especially in the Western and Southern areas. The DRU comprises Fibreglass Dinghy (FGDs) boats, Rubber Floatable Dinghies (RFDs), Outboard Motor (OBMs) engines, state of the art mobile kitchens, made using containers, all cooking utensils, tents, water pumps, high pressure water guns, and mobile toilets, among a host of other equipment that are essential for naval personnel to act as first responders during a disaster. He also mentioned that another two units of this nature would be established in the North Central and Eastern Areas where the community is battered by flash floods as a result of monsoonal rains.
This unit comes as a very important initiative by the Navy, and will be of immense value during the launching of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations, commonly referred to by military personnel as HA/DR operations. Especially during times of floods, the naval personnel have a major role to play as first responders, since access to inundated areas will be primarily by small FGDs and RFDs.
The Navy recently held a parade at the Colombo Port Eastern Container Terminal pier, in the presence of the Navy Commander to felicitate all those who actively participated in rescuing civilians in the aftermath of the recent severe weather.
Vice Admiral Wijegunaratne highlighted the role played by naval personnel and added, "as armed personnel who depend completely upon public money, we have a paramount responsibility in delivering our noble service at any cost for the protection of them."
All naval personnel who were involved in the flood relief operations, including the RABS, SBS, Navy Marines, Divers, Medical, Engineering and Supply components were rewarded at the function.
Natural disasters cannot be prevented, but we can avert a much bigger calamity if we are geared to encounter that.
This is an area where the preparedness and response will have a bigger role to play. At certain times, prompt reaction will not be good enough to mitigate the magnitude of the damage caused by natural disasters, unless you have necessary resources, men, and highly integrated follow up plans.
In this context, the responsibility of the Navy is of large dimension, as it is one of the front line forces to be engaged in disaster response missions with its men and resources.
