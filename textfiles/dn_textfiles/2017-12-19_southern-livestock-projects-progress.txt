Southern livestock projects in progress

Livestock development projects initiated in the southern region are on track to be improved, with the aim of economically empowering families engaged in animal husbandry and other livestock development activities.
Such development projects include: the establishment of dairy farm villages, cattle and buffalo reproduction centers; construction and reconstruction of cattle sheds; distribution of hybrid cows at concessionary rates to dairy farmers; development of grass land through the cultivation of quality grass; setting up of milk-collecting centers and sales points for marketing milk products; distribution of liquid milk-collecting appliances; development of small and medium scale poultry farms; and many other promotional activities, according to a senior spokesman of the SPC Department of Animal Production and Health.
Many of these projects have been successfully implemented this year in the Matara district, though officials are aiming to further enhance and improve these projects in the next year too, one official said.
The Central Government and Southern Provincial Council funds are to be utilized in this regard.
