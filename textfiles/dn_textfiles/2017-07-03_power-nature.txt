Power from Nature

Most of the world runs on oil or fossil fuels, but there is a catch - oil is a finite resource that could run dry before 2100 at the present rates of consumption. Oil and its related products such as coal and gas will certainly reach the end of the line sooner rather than later, even within the lifetime of the younger generations among us.
Despite having an abundance of hydropower resources, Sri Lanka relies heavily on thermal sources that meet over 70 per cent of the country's energy needs, thanks to the vagaries of weather and rainfall. This is clearly untenable in the long run, because we are a net importer of fossil fuels. With an oil import bill of US$ 6 billion (and rising), we need to find alternatives fast. Yes, we might strike gas and oil, but commercial exploitation is still decades away.
Our world is blessed with energy sources that are virtually infinite – solar and wind are the biggest two. Every day, the sun shines bright enough to power our world several times over for years on end, but we have not yet developed the technology to harness this energy properly. The same goes for wind power.
Sri Lanka, being a tropical country, is ideally positioned to take advantage of both these sources of renewable energy. While there had been half-hearted attempts to use more solar and wind energy for several decades, this Government has made it a matter of policy. The Government is committed towards adding more solar and wind energy to the national grid, and has promised to make the national grid a smart grid in another five years time, says Ajith Perera, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy. According to the Minister, Sri Lanka is to call tenders to purchase 875 Megawatts of power shortly, most of which is expected to come from renewables.
The Government has already started a “Soorya Bala Sangramaya” (Battle for Solar Power) an initiative that President Maithripala Sirisena launched last year to add 220 MW of solar power to the grid by 2020. The programme is already in full swing, where commercial establishments, factories, homes and even places of worship (Abhayaramaya in Colombo is the latest place of worship to install solar power panels) are encouraged to opt for solar power. Any excess power generated can be channelled back to the National Grid.
The Government has now started the ‘Green Energy 2017 Champion’ Campaign, in collaboration with the German Federal Foreign Office and project implementing partner Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH. The Power and Energy Ministry and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority will coordinate.
Germany is the ideal partner for a programme of this nature, being one of the few countries where more than 30 percent of the power requirement is already derived from renewable energy. Germany is planning to reach 50 percent renewable power in due course. We can learn a lot from Germany about renewable energy, which has the added benefit of being non-polluting.
However, in order to add more solar and wind energy to the national grid, it is necessary to have more storage capacity. Nevertheless, experts have estimated that even without advanced storage capacities, the country can add more than 500 Megawatts from solar energy. The Government plans to add extra capacity during the next 18 months.
The Government will invest in the infrastructure, but will not invest in power generation per se, which has been left to the private sector. The response to this drive is very promising. All possible concessions must be granted for the manufacture, import and installation of solar power systems which have come a long way since the first solar cells appeared in calculators.
The best sites in Sri Lanka for both solar and wind projects must be identified without delay, especially in the light of the Government saying ‘no’ to the proposed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power projects in Sampur. This is a shortfall of 500 MW. It can be bridged with the right combination of solar and wind power. Sri Lanka and India plan to coordinate on a 50 MW solar power plant at this site.
Such international cooperation is indeed vital to develop the local energy sector. Even more importantly, there should be a political consensus as well. As Jorn Rohde, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives, stated at the Green Champions ceremony, political consensus is crucial for implementing and persisting with renewal energy initiatives to meet targets in the energy sector of Sri Lanka.
If a future Government reneges on renewable energy and climate control pledges, all the present efforts would come to naught. This should not happen – hence the importance of having a bipartisan approach. In fact, energy should be recognized as a core policy, along with education, health, defence and foreign affairs that would not necessarily change when the Government changes. Sri Lanka is one of the few developing countries with 100 percent electricity penetration and a 24/7 power supply and we should aim to be in the forefront of the new energy equation.
