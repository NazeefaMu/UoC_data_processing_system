US jobs growth faster than expected

US employment rose by more than expected last month, but wage growth remained subdued, latest figures show.
The economy added 222,000 jobs in June, the US Department of Labor said, and job creation in April and May was higher than previously estimated.
However, despite the job gains and a low 4.4% unemployment rate, wage growth remained tepid.
Average wages rose 2.5% year-on-year, which analysts said was a sign the market still had room to improve. "Once again, the buzz kill on the jobs report is the lack of more substantial wage growth," said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. "This suggests that we've not yet checked off the 'full employment' box, meaning more progress can be extracted from the job market." Vote of confidence
Economists have expected job growth to slow and wages to rise, as more people are employed and firms have a harder time hiring.
Job growth had appeared to decelerate in April and May, but in its latest release the Labor Department revised the job creation estimates to 207,000 in April from 174,000, and to 152,000 in May from 138,000. (BBC)
