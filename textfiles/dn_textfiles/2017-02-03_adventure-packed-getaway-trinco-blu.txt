An adventure-packed getaway at Trinco Blu

Trinco Blu by Cinnamon offers guests a blend of rest, beach-side relaxation and adventure. As the Indian Ocean becomes increasingly tranquil and pleasant weather conditions prevail, guests visiting this hotel can opt to enjoy an array of thrilling nature and adventure-based activities with naturalists from Cinnamon Nature Trails (CNT).
Headed by renowned wildlife photographer and expert- Chitral Jayatilake, CNT is the award-winning wildlife and adventure tourism division of Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts, and also serves as one of Sri Lanka's leading eco-excursion providers.
In the early hours of the morning or evening, guests can opt to join the CNT team on their 18-foot fiber-glass motor boat for a few hours of catch and release fishing. This eco-friendly alternative to traditional fishing, enables you to indulge in the thrill of casting your line and reeling in your catch without causing significant harm to any fish. The fish that you catch on your trip, can safely be unhooked and returned to their natural environment. Safety jackets, rods and all of the necessary equipment are all provided on the 2-hour excursion.
According to a press release issued by Cinnamon Hotels and resorts from February onwards, the whale watching season will commence in Trincomalee and guests can embark on a memorable marine mammal safari with the CNT team. On a typical whale watching excursion, guests can expect to travel 18-20 miles into the ocean, where with some patience and luck, you will be able to spot an array of marine wildlife species including blue whales, common dolphins, sperm whales, spinner dolphins, Bryde's whales, bottlenose dolphins, pilot whales and Risso's dolphins along with several other species such as sea turtles and whale sharks.
Located a short 30-minute boat ride away from the hotel, Pigeon Island National Park is home to an abundance of saltwater fish and corals. The CNT team organizes guided snorkelling tours to this unique underwater park that is home to a rich biodiversity of marine life. The shallow waters that surround this pristine island are teeming with life and offer guests the rare chance to observe hundreds of marine fish in houses striking statues, intricately decorated pillars, well-crafted sculptures and beautiful, bright paintings.
Trinco Blu offers guests an adventure-packed getaway on one of the country's most beautiful stretches of beach. The hotel's bold, retro interiors, its relaxing ambiance, scrumptious dining options and interesting array of activities will ensure that guests enjoy a truly memorable holiday on Sri Lanka's east coast, the press release states further.
