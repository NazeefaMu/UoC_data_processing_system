The President’s former Chief of Staff I.H.K.Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P.Dissanayake who were in remand custody on bribery charges, were further remanded till September 18 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday.
The investigations initiated with the complaint that I.H.K.Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale Sugar Factory.
Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago, while he was the Land Ministry Secretary. However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded it be reduced.
Within several weeks, they had allegedly agreed to accept Rs.100 million. The two were arrested at a hotel car park in Colombo, on May 3, by Bribery Commission officers while accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million.
Attorney-at-Law Ajith Pathirana appearing on behalf of the P.Dissanayake informed the Magistrate that his client was suffering from a hearing problem and asthma for a long period of time.
President’s Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne appeared on behalf of the I.H.K.Mahanama.
After considering all the matters, the Magistrate ordered the prison authorities to pay attention regarding the suspects health condition.
The Magistrate also ordered the Prison authorities to submit the medical reports on the next hearing date.
