President invites SL expat intellectuals to work for motherland

Sri Lanka needs the services of Sri Lankan intellectuals living abroad to take the country forward, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He invited Sri Lankan intellectuals living abroad to return to the country and to serve the Motherland since freedom and democracy have been re-established.
"Being intellectuals in the higher education sector of the country, you are duty bound to create highly capable resource personnel, who are able to steer the country forward," he said.
"At the same time, it is the prime duty of the country to utilise them for the betterment of the forward march of the country," the President said.
President Sirisena made these remarks while addressing the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Directors (CVCD) at Blue Water Hotel, Wadduwa yesterday.
The knowledge, capabilities and abilities gained in various sectors, should not be misused but used for the uplift of the country, President Sirisena said.
"However, it is important to gain the latest knowledge in every sector not only for personal development but also for the country's development," the President said.
Capabilities such as knowledge and abilities are powers of a person but these powers should be well utilised without misusing them, the President noted while condemning certain reports in the social media regarding Venerable Sobhitha Thera after his passing away.
President Sirisena said anyone can perform their duties without suspicion or fear as a result of the peaceful atmosphere in the country.
"The time has come for everyone to serve the country without fear and mistrust. Being intellectuals, I believe you should do the coordination to get the expertise knowledge of intellectuals in foreign countries," the President added. He said the country inherited a brave and most advanced history.
"Many development programmes such as irrigation activities and massive constructions carried out in the past, represented the brave and significant history of the country," the President said.
"It has been revealed that we produced iron 5,000 years ago. In the field of agriculture, irrigation, technology and various other fields we achieved success.
The knowledge we obtained, should be shared with other people and other countries," he said. President Sirisena said after the passing away of Venerable Madoluwawe Sobhitha Thera, the behaviour of certain persons in the social media cannot be accepted.
"We must make use of this novel technology and not abuse it. All knowledge gathered by us should be used for the betterment of the country and nation without misusing it," he said.
The President while highlighting the responsibility of universities said universities should be responsible for bringing new technology into the country.
"Similar to introducing new technology to the country, the knowledge we gathered should be shared with our future generation," he said.
