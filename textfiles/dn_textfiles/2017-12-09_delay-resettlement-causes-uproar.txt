Yan Oya Reservoir Project
Delay in resettlement causes uproar

Delay in resettling nearly 300 families affected by the Yan Oya reservoir resulted in unrest among the people in the area.
They are waiting to rebuild their lives, but they say the proposed land for resettlement was not suitable for the purpose according to the environment impact evaluation report.
Therefore, alternative lands were selected with the approval of the Forest Conservation Department and reports were submitted to the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) for approval, they said.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said the delay in providing the approval by the CEA for the areas earmarked to resettle the people worsens the situation.
He said the Yan Oya Project Management, therefore, has taken steps to resettle the families in the proposed areas with the verbal approval of the FCD.
The FCD has granted approval only to remove the shrub jungle for resettlement and not to fell trees since the Forest Department has not approved the felling trees.
The Central Environmental Authority has to follow a long procedure before it approves deforestation in the area. This in turn hinders resettlement procedures. Providing electricity, drinking water, sanitation and common amenities for resettling people were extremely delayed as a result and the affected people have taken the issues with project officials, Wannianayake said. Nearly 4,000 hectares were acquired for the Yan Oya project and the government spent Rs. 35,000 million on the construction.
The Chinese CAMC company was entrusted the construction of the 3 km-long main dam and they have completed their task before a year from the scheduled time.
Filling the reservoir and supplying water to cultivate 20,000 hectares under the reservoir is yet to be done. "If it is not finished on time, a huge compensation has to be paid to the Chinese company according to the agreement reached by the two countries.
"I have already appraised the Secretary of the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry the situation," Wanninayake said.
