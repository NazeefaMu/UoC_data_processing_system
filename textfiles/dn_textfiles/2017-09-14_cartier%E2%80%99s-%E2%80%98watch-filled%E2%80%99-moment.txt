Cartier’s  ‘watch-filled’ moment

Cartier hosted a special evening in collaboration with the Maison’s partner, Chatham Luxury. An exclusive watches selection were presented for the first time in Sri Lanka to showcase stunning works of know-how, innovation and complications.
The pioneer spirit of Maison Cartier has defined style and precision in watchmaking throughout the last two centuries. Established in 1847 in Paris, the Maison has been patronized by royalty, world leaders, and personalities with a distinctive sense of classic style.
The guests also had the opportunity of conversing with Guillaume Alix, Regional Managing Director at Cartier for Middle East, India & Africa, ambassador of the collection in Sri Lanka.
Guillaume Alix, Regional Managing Director at Cartier for Middle East, India & Africa noted, “The pioneer spirit of the Maison has set the tone for watchmaking for almost 200 years and it is our privilege to bring this collection to Sri Lanka for the first time. This event is the perfect occasion to share with our clients the richness of our history and the beauty of the latest novelties, including very limited editions and exceptional creations.”

Cartier creations are among the most distinctive in the watchmaking industry. Highly recognizable display elements and unique shapes are the hallmark of the Maison ever since the creation of the Santos-Dumont watch in 1904. This was when pioneer Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont told his friend Louis Cartier of the impracticality of pocket watches when it came to flying; Cartier created the flat wristwatch with a distinctive square bezel for his friend. The rest is, of course, history. The Tank watch, created in 1917, also set the course for watchmaking for a century afterwards and continues to do so.
The rounded curves of the Tonneau, Tortue and the Baignoire set off the precise lines of the Tank Skeleton Watch, and the beauty of the various complications. All of which reflect the pursuit of perfection, and the timeless watchmaking philosophy of Maison Cartier.
