Cheaper petrol variety soon

A new cheaper variety of petrol will be introduced shortly to cushion the effect of high petrol prices, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said yesterday.
This can be given around Rs.8 less than the normal petrol price available in the country.
The Minister said the required tests to introduce this new petrol is now being conducted successfully. The results have already shown that this type of petrol is suitable for three-wheelers and further tests are being conducted to check whether it is suitable for the motorcycles. This cheaper version is expected to be distributed through 100 filling stations across the country which have already been identified.
