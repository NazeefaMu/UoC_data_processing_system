No truck with SLFP so long as marriage with UNP lasts: MR

The Joint Opposition group will be forced to stay away from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as long as the latter is in alliance with the United National Party (UNP), former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said upon his arrival to the country following a visit to Malaysia, yesterday.
The observation was made when a journalist questioned the former President about the non-appearance of JO MPs at the SLFP convention at Kurunegala on Sunday and SLFP leader and President Maithripala Sirisena’s invitation for all SLFP members to work in unity to further strengthen the party.
Addressing journalists at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), Rajapaksa said the policies of the SLFP and the UNP did not match and this was the reason why S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in the first place left the UNP to form a new party.
A visibly angry Rajapaksa also condemned the incident where Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner to Malaysia was assaulted by a group of persons at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Sunday.
He also urged the government to take appropriate action while noting that it was a very serious case.
Rajapaksa’s visit to Malaysia was marred by protests launched by a Tamil group and the Sri Lankan high commissioner had been attacked while he was returning after seeing off several Sri Lankan parliamentarians at the airport who were returning after attending a conference.
The Malaysian media reported that the mob had attacked the Ambassador with the notion that he was returning after dropping Rajapaksa at the airport.
