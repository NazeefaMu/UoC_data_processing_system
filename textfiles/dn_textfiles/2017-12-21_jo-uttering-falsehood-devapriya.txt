JO uttering falsehood - Devapriya

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya categorically denied that he had a deal with the Elections Commissioner to cancel the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) nomination list for Maharagama.
“One cannot influence the Elections Commission headed by the Commissioner, which is an independent institute,” Devapriya said.
He said the list was rejected because they had not nominated enough women as candidates. “There should have been four women candidates, but there were only three candidates,” he said.
In fact, it was the UNP which highlighted that there was an error in the list earlier. It is the Election Commissioner who has the power to deal on all matters pertaining to the election including any rejection or cancellation of nominations.
Since the SLPP cannot contest the upcoming local government election, the victory for the SLFP is certain. Thereby, both UNP and JO have started a mud-slinging campaign against me. The entire Maharagama city experienced development after I became the Western Province Chief Minister. Maharagama people know it very well. Since I am already a Chief Minister, if the
SLFP will won the Maharagama seat, the previous development process can be continued with no disruption,” he added.
