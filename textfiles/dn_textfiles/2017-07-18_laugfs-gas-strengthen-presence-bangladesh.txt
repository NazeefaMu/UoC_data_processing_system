LAUGFS Gas to strengthen presence in Bangladesh

LAUGFS Gas plans to strengthen its presence in Bangladesh with renewed commitment and further investments.
These views were expressed at a Corporate Dinner Reception hosted by the company at Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka, which was graced by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The event coincided with the State visit by President Sirisena and a high profile delegation to Bangladesh.
LAUGFS Gas entered the Bangladesh market in 2015 with the acquisition of PetredecElpiji Limited, and is one of the largest LPG downstream players in the country. The company imports and distributes over 50,000 MT of LPG every year in Bangladesh and operates an expansive and a fast growing distribution network across the country.
“Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have shared a rich history for hundreds of years, especially entwined with trade. We are delighted to be part of this rich legacy and to be able to enrich the lives of the people of Bangladesh with whom we share a unique camaraderie,” said LAUGFS Holdings Chairman W.K.H. Wegapitiya at the event.
LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh currently operates a world-class LPG import, bottling and distribution facility in Mongla Port. It serves the domestic and industrial segments with its 12kg cylinders for households and 12kg and 45kg cylinders for commercial and industrial customers under the brand name LAUGFS Gas. It is also the pioneer in Autogas in Bangladesh and supplies LPG to automobile service stations across the country. LAUGFS Gas, with its own vessel fleet, is able to provide LPG with the highest level of reliability.
“The LAUGFS Gas brand signifies quality, reliability and safety,” said LAUGFS Holdings Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.
