Wekirayagoda villagers clamour for drinking water

The people at Wekirayagoda in the Katuwana DS area have to travel a 5-km distance to fetch drinking water.
The Uruboku Oya flows near their village but the villagers suffer without drinking water.
They said about 40 families engaging in cinnamon peeling suffer without water. They had brought the issue to the authorities but still have not received a solution.
