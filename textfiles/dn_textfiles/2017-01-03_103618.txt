SLT manpower employees not after narrow  benefits: Appuhami

Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT) man power employees will not obtain narrow benefits such as salary increments. What they need is permanent employments, Consultant to the Consultative Committee of All Ceylon Telecommunication Employees’ Union (ACTEU) J.A.S.K. Appuhami said.
He said this speaking at a media briefing yesterday in front of SLT Head Office.
He said no actions were taken so far even after the recommendations of Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. J. Senewiratne and Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando agreed to absorb manpower employees to the SLT.
Appuhami said labour union actions were organised and implemented on December 26 last year. It would be further continued to obtain permanent staffing solutions for man power employees, he added. ACTEU President W.A.D.N.N. Wijesuriya also participated.
