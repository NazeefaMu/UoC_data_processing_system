‘SriLankan paid Rs. 4.18 bn, US $ 7.58 mn as loan interest’

SriLankan Airlines had paid Rs. 4.18 billion and US $ 7.58 million to the Bank of Ceylon as interest on rupee and dollar loans obtained from it, Bank of Ceylon Offshore Branch Chief Manager Upul Kumar Wijegoonawardane said.
He was testifying before the Presidential Commission Investigating alleged Fraud, Corruption and other misdeeds in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka.
Wijegoonawardane also submitted the data during his evidence.
When cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Pathirana, Wijegoonawardane said this payment was in lieu of interest due up to January 31, 2018.
The interest payment was regarding loans amounting to Rs. 12.9 billion and US $ 100 million obtained on six occasions. However, the principal loan had not been repaid to the Bank yet. As steps were being taken to salvage the SriLanka Airlines by converting it into a government – public sector joint venture, the bank had been notified that the principal amount would be paid back after this process. He said he believed that the government would settle this loan in due course. The Commission, chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Anil Gooneratne, comprises retired High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe and Sri Lanka Accounting and Auditing Standards Board Director General Wasantha Geeganage. Senior State Counsel Disna Warnakula was assisting the Commission.
