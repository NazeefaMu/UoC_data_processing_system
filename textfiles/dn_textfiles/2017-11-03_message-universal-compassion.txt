The Message of Universal compassion

“Charatha Bhikkawe Charikang, BahujanaHithaya, Bahujana Sukhaya, Lokanukampaya, Aththaya Hithaya Sukhaya Devamanussanang”.
After attaining enlightenment Sakyamuni Gautama Buddha proceeded to Saranath and preached his first sermon to the five ascetics.
Later Yasakulaputra and his 55 disciples too listened to his sermons with utmost faith and attained Arahantship.
Realising that there were now sufficient disciples to start the pioneer movement for the propagation of the Dhamma, he addressed the 60 Arahants to fulfil the sansaric tour for the wellbeing of the mankind.
The Buddha said “Go forth Bhikkus into the world taking the message to them, explain to them what I have explained for the well-being of the majority, for the solace of the majority, show them how one could be of service to all divine and human beings.
It was on Il full moon day that 60 disciples were sent in different directions on this great mission to spread the doctrine.
Great Mission
Having accomplished that task, the Buddha himself set out for the city of Rajagaha where on his way he met hermit monks the three brothers – Uruwela Kashyapa, Nadi and Gaya Kashyapa with their retinue at Uruwela Grama. They had all been miraculously won over by the Buddha helping them to attain arahantship after the deliverance of Aaditta-PariyaSutta. The Buddha with his supreme gift of Dhamma dispelled their version and taught them the Buddhist approach to life.
Bosat Maithriya
Another major event of this Poya is the receipt of permission (NiyathaVivarana) by Bosat Maithriya to be the next enlightened one. A wealthy Buddhist in Sankassapura known as Siriwardana had entered the order as Bhikku Ariya Maithriya offered his new robes to Sakyamuni on his arrival at Sonkassapura. The Buddha with his divine and insight predicted that he will be born as the next Buddha and he proclaimed it to the world for the benefit of generations to come. He is the best person to protect and foster the doctrine - Dhamma and disseminate it to the entire globe. Hence the emergence of the future Buddha was a signal for the Buddhists to have hope and await the great occasion.
Parinibhana of SariyuthThera
This poya is also related to the attainment of Sotapanna by Rupasara Matha, the mother of Ven. Sariputta Thera. His entire family had been pure Buddhists except the mother who was ignorant of true Dhamma Ven. Sariputta erudite and eminent scholar due his esteem in the Sasana was determined to come to her rescue on her death bed which he did before his Parinibhana. Thus the foremost disciple of the Buddha, fulfilled his duty by the mother and finally passed into Parinibhana which is said to have taken place on this day.
End of Vassana
Il Poya is rather the climax of the Vassana season which culminates in the Katina Cheevara Puja believed to be the highest merit bestowing ceremony in the Buddha Sasana. Further the practice of observing Vassana continues to this day as the fulfilment of a disciplinary requirement as instructed by the Buddha. The Vassana season comes to a close with the Katinanusasana delivered as the final event on the day of the Katina Pooja.
This plays a very significant role in lay life as well as giving them the unique opportunity to follow Dhamma to their hearts content. Dhamma have rakkatiDhammachari”.
