NSC appeals to let Gnanasara Thera wear robes in prison

The National Sangha Council (NSC) has appealed to the government to let Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera wear the robe while he serves his sentences.
NSC National Convener Ven. Waga Wijithawansa Thera said the Justice Minister or the Prison’s Commissioner has no right to force Ven. Gnanasara Thera to wear the prison jumper.
“We urge the Buddha Sasana Minister to intervene and discuss with the President and Maha Sangha to allow Ven. Gnanasara Thera to serve his sentences while wearing the robe,” the Thera said.
“We do not wish to criticize the judgement of the Homagama Magistrate against Ven. Gnanasara Thera. There is criticism over his behaviour and several harsh statements were made by him on several occasions. However, he has provided a service to society on many issues,” the Thera said.
“It is wrong to make a convicted Buddhist monk to wear normal prison attire, according to law and that power is vested with the Sasana Sabha to which he belongs. Kotte Sri Kalyani Samagri Maha Sangha Sabhawa, which represents the Ven. Thera, has also appealed to Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala to let him wear robes.
He added that there should be a clear opinion on the procedure followed by relevant authorities when a Bhikku is sentenced to imprisonment.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera has not committed a grave offence as mentioned in the Buddhist philosophy. So, he cannot be forced to give up the robe. Accordingly, we request in the name of Dhamma, that his robes be returned without destroying the traditional heritage and culture of this country which existed for the last 2500 years, the Thera added.
