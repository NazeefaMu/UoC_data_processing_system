No shortage of A(H1N1) drug: Health Ministry

A Health Ministry statement said `Oseltamivir’ (Tamiflu), the drug used to treat Influenza A(H1N1) patients is freely available countrywide and there is no shortage in this drug.
It said the demand for the drug increased by 15 percent due to the rapid spread of the disease during the past few weeks but the drug was available without any shortage.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had instructed to use the drug only for diagnosed patients in order to prevent misuse of the drug.
Meanwhile, addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoya said that there is a severe shortage of the drug in the country at the moment.
Both Influenza A (H1N1) patients and hospital staff treating them face various difficulties due to this drug shortage which shows the ineffectiveness of the Health Minister, he added.
