‘Underworld: Blood Wars’ puts Beckinsale in the picture again

2017 creeps in with the search for justice in the saga of the ‘Underworld’ series. Most movie goers will recall the daring and beautiful Selene (Kate Beckinsale) in the ‘Underworld’ saga leading up to this edge-of-the-seat film.
In the previous film ‘Underworld: Awakening’, her enhanced vampiric traits lead her to be imprisoned and frozen for twelve years, and finally making her way out of a high-tech facility.
The sultry British actress is back in action once again in the war against Lycans and Vampires in its latest sequel, ‘Underworld: Blood Wars’ an American action horror film directed by Anna Foerster (in her directorial debut). It is the fifth installment in the Underworld franchise.
Vampire death dealer Selene continues her struggle against the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction that betrayed her, with both sides trying to use the blood of her and her daughter to become Corvinus Strain hybrids.
After hiding her daughter, Selene, David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance), attempt to end the eternal war between Lycans and Vampires, even if it means Selene has to make the ultimate sacrifice.
The main cast also includes Theo James, Tobias Menzies, Lara Pulver, Peter Andersson, Clementine Nicholson, Bradley James and Charles Dance.
‘Underworld: Blood Wars’ will be screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.30 pm 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat a 10.30 pm.
