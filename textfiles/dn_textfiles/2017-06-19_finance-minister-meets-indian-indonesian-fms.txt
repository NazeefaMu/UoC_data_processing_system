Finance  Minister meets Indian, Indonesian FMs

Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera held bilateral discussions with Indian Minister of Finance Arun Jaitley and Indonesian Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati on the sidelines of the Board of Governors meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank’s (AIIB) Annual Meeting was held in Jeju Islands, South Korea and Minister Samaraweera took part in the Board of Governors roundtable discussion on ‘Financing Asia’s Infrastructure Priorities’.
The meeting is being held under the theme of “Sustainable Infrastructure”, seeking strategic directions of the global infrastructure bank and making major decisions on the bank’s management.
The Jeju meeting sought to set the course for AIIB, a body established in 2014 at the behest of Beijing and considered an alternative to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are dominated by the USA and the Asian Development Bank controlled by Japan. Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has committed to prioritize funding for projects that will increase access to clean energy and enhance the efficiency of existing power infrastructure.
