Nine Dolphin hunters arrested

Nine persons, including the owner of a ‘Madel’ fish net, were arrested by officers of the Trincomalee District Police Frauds Unit in connection with the death of 12 dolphins after getting caught to the fish net in the Trincomalee inner harbour on Wednesday.
Investigations revealed that the group had allegedly freed several other dolphins which had got caught to the net and tied up the 12 dolphins and hidden them under water when they had died.
The suspects were handed over to Trincomalee Harbour Police.
They were due to be produced before the Trincomalee Magistrate.
