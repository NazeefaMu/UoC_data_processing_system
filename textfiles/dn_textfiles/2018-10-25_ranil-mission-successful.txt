Ranil - A mission successful

The government was engulfed in a controversy over an alleged attempt to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and its handling of the matter left much to be desired, damaging relations not only between the constituents of the ‘National Unity’ government, the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) but also between Sri Lanka and its giant neighbour, India.
It was last week’s Cabinet meeting and subsequent media reports about the discussions that ensued at that meeting that led to the controversy. Although a website had also reported on the issue, it was a report in the mainstream Indian The Hindu newspaper that led to the crisis.
The Hindu reported that President alleged there was a conspiracy by the Indian intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (better known as ‘RAW’) to assassinate him. In a report by its correspondent Meera Sirinivasan, The Hindu stated that “Mr. Sirisena told Ministers that the Indian intelligence agency was trying to kill him, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi may not be aware of the plan”, quoting ‘sources present at the discussion’.
The report in The Hindu alluded to an Indian national arrested in connection with an alleged plot to assassinate the President and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The local inquiry into that alleged plot is ongoing and is regularly attracting headlines in the national media.
“The Indian national must be a RAW agent trying to kill me. The Indian PM may not be aware. That is often the case. Trump may not be aware of the CIA’s similar moves,” The Hindu report said and claimed it “spoke to multiple sources in government - across political parties - who attended the meeting, and they confirmed this”.
Indo-Lanka relations
Following the publication of this report, the government was left to deal with its fallout with the future of Indo-Lanka relations at stake. As a result, there was a concerted attempt to redress the issue. The very next day, Indian High Commissioner in Colombo, Taranjit Singh Sandhu called on President Sirisena and was assured that Sri Lanka did not suspect any involvement of the Indian government in an assassination attempt.
Issuing a statement after the meeting with the High Commissioner, the President’s office explained what transpired at the Cabinet meeting. “In the meeting, the President emphasised the need to conduct a comprehensive investigation into the alleged assassination plot”, the President’s Media Division said and added that President Sirisena did not mention any involvement of an Indian intelligence service in an alleged plot to assassinate him.
Thereafter, with the intervention of High Commissioner Sindhu, the matter was dealt with at the highest level of government. The President personally spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi by telephone for about 20 minutes where there was a free and frank exchange of views to ensure that there was no misunderstanding in New Delhi.
That all this happened on the eve of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s visit to India was a co-incidence. That visit had been scheduled previously. Had the damage control exercise in diplomacy not been undertaken, the Prime Minister would have had a challenging time explaining what transpired in Colombo. However Premier Wickremesinghe’s visit to India was a resounding success and the body language between the two leaders suggested that there was no ill-feeling as a result of the hullabaloo in Colombo.
However, Prime Minister Modi had expressed concern that Indian projects in Sri Lanka were not progressing at a brisk pace. “Mr. Narendra Modi has expressed his concern over the implementation of Indo-Sri Lanka joint development projects in accordance with the MoU signed between India and Sri Lanka in 2017. Mr. Modi said he was not satisfied with the response he had received from the Sri Lankan government to his overtures,” a statement issued at the conclusion of the Wickremesinghe-Modi meeting said. Interestingly, this statement was issued not by Prime Minister Modi’s office but by the Sri Lankan Premier’s office.
If it was thought that this was the end of the saga, subsequent events indicated otherwise. This is where the government could have acted to nip another looming crisis in the bud. Instead, it still appears to be a dispute gathering momentum. At stake are the growing differences between the UNP and the SLFP.
When the controversy over the alleged assassination attempt was still making headlines, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe told the media that four ministers who divulged the story to ‘The Hindu’ should be investigated and exposed.
“We have no intention to press journalists to reveal their source. But it is quite obvious that certain cabinet ministers have given this false information to the media. The government must go to the bottom of the false propaganda and expose the four Ministers who misled the media,” Samarasinghe declared and alleged that this was done deliberately with the intention of creating a misunderstanding between Colombo and New Delhi.
Differences of opinion
These remarks must be viewed in the context of the tensions that existed between the UNP and SLFP factions at the time. It was known that there had been differences of opinion between President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the Cabinet meeting. This also received wide publicity in the local media.
Around the same time, President Sirisena moved to remove the directors of the two major state banks- Bank of Ceylon and National Savings Bank- and the Board of Investment. This saw retorts from UNP ministers. Minister Lakshman Kiriella opined that this should be a function of the minister concerned while Minister Malik Samarawickrema lamented that the directors of the BOI were very competent professionals who were committed to serving their country.
If anything, Minister Samarasinghe’s remarks were seen as a thinly veiled reference to UNP ministers. Thereafter, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera joined the chorus. He ratcheted the rhetoric a notch higher by claiming that the ministers who are alleged to have ‘leaked’ Cabinet proceedings had links with RAW, the Indian intelligence agency.
Now, Joint Opposition (JO) parliamentarian and son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapaksa has continued the debate. “If some Cabinet ministers are in the pay list of the RAW, it is a national issue, it is the responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister to expose them,” Rajapaksa said.
If the President went to great lengths to convince Indian leaders that there were no concerns about the involvement of RAW in Sri Lanka, the statements of ministers Samarasinghe and Amaraweera defeats that very purpose. It only achieves the objective of needling the UNP but it comes with a price tag- that of losing credibility with Indian authorities.
It is no longer a secret that the President has been keen to appease the JO and Rajapaksa faction of his party who are demanding that he acts decisively against the UNP. However, the manner in which the drama regarding the alleged assassination plot has played out has not been to the President’s advantage.
The real test for the UNP-SLFP alliance will be when the Budget is presented and voted on next month. That will provide a better indication about how much of the current hype about a possible JO-SLFP alliance for the next national elections is real. It will also provide an insight into whether there is still a prospect of the UNP-SLFP coalition lasting until then.
