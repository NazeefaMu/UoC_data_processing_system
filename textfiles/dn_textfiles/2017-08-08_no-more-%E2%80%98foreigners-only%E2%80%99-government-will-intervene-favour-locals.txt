No more ‘Foreigners Only’: Government will intervene in favour of locals

 
The Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government Faiszer Musthapha has intervened to instruct Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva to ‘control’ the situation in the South in which foreign tourists are given preferential treatment over local tourists.
Referring in particular to beach resorts in Weligama and Mirissa which cater to ‘Foreigners Only’, the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister said he would take ‘every action in his power to correct this unhealthy situation’.
Issuing a statement the Minister said that he had come to hear of the issue at a meeting with top entrepreneurs in the tourism industry and had instructed officers to take immediate steps to control the issue through the Local Governments.
Several resorts in the Weligama and Mirissa area have discriminated against local residents by serving ‘Foreigners Only’ and segregating sections of the beach for the use of foreign tourists only.
