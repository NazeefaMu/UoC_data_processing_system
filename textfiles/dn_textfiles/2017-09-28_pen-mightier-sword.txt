Pen mightier than the sword

What great ones do the less will prattle of’’
The other day, I was just perusing through some great literature to find some solutions to our perennial national problems which have developed to a very disgusting level in the course of time. The ever stinking garbage problem is going to be eliminated with the active supervision of the President and the concerned authorities and it is a step in the right direction. It has been a long felt need. In the same manner, some other nagging problems are also going to be handled for the larger benefit of the nation, from various grapevines we come to know. Good.

My concern here is to put forward some literary findings I have laboriously made with the people in mind. It goes without saying that to most of the human problems, vast literature has everlasting solutions. It is because, the writers, not only in our country, but also in other countries wrote volumes and volumes in different genres such as poetry, drama, short stories, novels, prose, biographies, autobiographies, and also letters and travelogues of human significance. In other words, to pass a message to the human beings to tame them with the supreme intention of putting them on the corrective path. Yet, the corrupted man does not heed them.
Ill-gotten money
Due to mad rat race of money, they do not give due attention to morality. Money ruins the society, but total ignorance of man with regard to money, the magnetic effect of this substance drags him into the ditch. ‘AVARICE’ by George Herbert, and Augustan Poetry led by John Dryden and Alexander Poppe seem enough to rehabilitate the whole world in general and Sri Lanka in particular. It is very discernible in our country today most of the high ups are entangled in a vicious circle that they find it difficult to escape. The eagles on the legal landscape seem to drain away the ill-gotten money of the corrupted elements of the country and the henchmen of the pseudo patriots and the fake leaders give the necessary back up to eyewash the downtrodden masses. Our old red brigade is playing an ugly role to cover up the pestering wounds.
In the meanwhile, a new slogan has invaded the political arena in the name of valiant soldiers. Our soldiers are valiant to the hilt. Their dedication is so great and the writer finds his vocabulary not enough to describe it. It is indescribable.
Yet, “The pen is mightier than the sword.’’ The contribution made by the writers in different genres to build this human kingdom is greater than that of the soldiers. You may just imagine that a world without writers is impossible. These soldiers may have read “Charge of the light brigade by Alfred Lord Tennyson. It was very recently I read that Winstan Churchil had been reading Pride and Prejudice in wartime.
Patriotic writers
In our country what I have been observing during the recent past is that in almost all the spheres great and unimaginable feats are done, but the vulgar elements of the society grab the credit harping on it. This trend should be arrested and reverted. In numerous news conferences many a speaker that we didn’t see during the war time now has become their saviours overnight. The combined effort made by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka with the true dedication of the valiant soldiers is written in letters of gold in the annals of the history of the soil. Yet, our own writers also have contributed a lot to write our history. One day if this commotion of Ranaviru Dadayama would go on unabated orchestrated by some other elements to come to power on their shoulders, our patriotic writers would also come to the Lipton Circle to register their protest and anger.
William Shakespeare has not been profoundly studied as a political analyst, yet a deep study into his drama itself would prove that he was a subtle critic of politics of the day. Hence, prattling on others’ victories ought not to be the great talk of the pseudo patriots.
It is high time for the common man to have a vigilant eye over the current political scenario of our country.
‘Share and share alike.’
