Allegations of corruption and malpractices:
BASL urges attorney to provide evidence

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has urged Attorney–at-Law Sugandhika Fernando to supply information and evidence with regard to the allegations that she made against corruption and malpractices in the system of justice and law enforcement in Sri Lanka, within 14 days to the BASL in order that action can be instituted against any wrongdoers, Bar Association of Sri Lanka(BASL) President Attorney-at-Law, U.R.De Silva (PC) said yesterday.
The Association has urged her from the beginning to provide evidence to back her allegations.But,she did not do that and made a public announcement at a press conference held at the Public Library recently.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, the BASL President further said the BASL would like to work with her to find the truth about the people that such allegations are levelled against.
“If there any complaint against a lawyer, it can be initially probed through the BASL Ethics Committee while any complaint against Judges should be directed to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC),” the BASL President said.
“There could be corrupted individuals in all of these entities.But,it is wrong to tar the everyone with the same brush. There are many honest individuals,” he said.
Meanwhile, Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodiwaththu has called for a debate between him and the BASL President on several issues pertaining to justice and law enforcement in the country,but,the BASL Executive Committee has decided not to participate in any such debate.
“The BASL has decided that it is not worth debating these so called allegations. There is no point of debating these issues, but we plan to resolve all the issues pertaining to the justice and law enforcement system gradually one by one,” the BASL President added.
