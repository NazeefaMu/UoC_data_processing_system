Constitutional changes requiring referendum not mandated by the people: Chandima

The people did not give a mandate on January 8 to make changes to the Constitution that requires a referendum, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody said. The Minister also said, according to the peoples mandate,the only change that could be made to the Constitution is only an amendment to the Constitution that does not require a referendum.
“The election Manifesto of President Maithripala Sirisena clearly states that no amendments would be made to the Constitution that requires a referendum,” Minister Weerakkody said. “So, what we have to do is to stick to what was promised at the election,” he said. Minister Weerakkody made this observation at a press conference at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation auditorium head office in Dematagoda yesterday.
He also said that there were several features in the Executive Presidency that should be upheld for the security and the defence of the country. He also said that the Executive Presidency today is not the same it was and its power had been curtailed through setting up the independent commissions by way of the 19th amendment to the constitution. He added that the President could not act arbitrarily due to these independent commissions. That is what the people needed, he added. “The SLFP is committed to introducing changes to the Constitution within the existing frame work,” Minister Weerakkody said. “The changes will be made without causing any threat to the country’s security. The Constitutional Committees had been set up to get views of people and different political parties on the changes that should be made to the Constitution,” he said.
