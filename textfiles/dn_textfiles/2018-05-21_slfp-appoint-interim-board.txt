SLFP to appoint interim board

The SLFP Central Committee has decided to appoint a new temporary board of officials on June 3 to replace its present set of office-bearers party General Secretary and Emigration Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Speaking to the media after attending a meetings at Thambuttegama, Minister Dissanaayke said the party’s Central Committee met as usual on May 17 and discussed party re-organisation work at length and decided to mark the Party’s anniversary celebrations on September 2 with pride and honour after setting up party branches, Electoral and District organisations and re-organising the party machinery including the Samastha Lanka Karaka Sabha and the Executive Committee before August 30.
Dissanayake said even though they functioned as members of the SLFP, some of the party’s office bearers are seated in the Opposition in Parliament.
“Similarly, some persons calling themselves SLFPers who supported the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna and ensured its victory at the recent Local Government elections by even climbing on to its election stage were among the SLFP office bearers. As such the party could not be subjected to a complete re-organisation with such office bearers,” Dissananyake added.
“As such, we are getting ready to appoint a temporary board of office-bearers. A permanent board of office-bearers will be elected after a completing party reorganisation.
Dissanayake said that despite predictions made by certain people in the party that the SLFP would be doomed, it had never happened. But, it was the people who left the SLFP who were ultimately doomed and had to creep back into the party fold.
