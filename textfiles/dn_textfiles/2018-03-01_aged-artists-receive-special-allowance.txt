Aged artists to receive special allowance

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Culture and Wayamba Development Minister S. B. Nawinne has approved to pay a special allowance to 4,000 aged and low-income artists countrywide, with effect from this year.
Accordingly, they would receive a monthly allowance of Rs. 10,000 to meet their medical and other financial needs, said Cultural Department Director General Anusha Gokula Fernando, speaking at a meeting for provincial journalists of the Kurunegala district held recently in Kurunegala.
She said these artists were awarded only Rs. 5,000 so far during last year.
