Some of the folk and ritual dances are practised only for certain festivals and occasions. During the mid and last quarter of 20th century, a new trend has strongly emerged and penetrated in the dance world.
Some of the dance choreographers and dance teachers have introduced a new type of dance form to attract a maximum number of students and audience. Sometimes one particular dance form is mixed-up with numerous other classical dances, together without any well-established codes or basic norms. This new creativity dance form is called fusion dance.
Sometimes fusion dance is a mixture of classical and folk dances. For these dances, no proper music is adopted. Mostly fusion music or light music is adopted with a variety of instrumental music for fusion dances. The music is chosen in accordance with the rhythmic vibrancy of the dance and the dance movements.
The present trend of fusion dance choreographers is to attract the public and exploit the students’ interest. Choreographers introduce numerous self-styled methods with the combination and with the influence of classical and folk dances.
All these creativity dance forms come under the name of modern fusion dances. These dances are promoted by some fusion dance choreographers to gain popularity among the people and attract the youngsters for entertainment purposes. Fusion dance is only used for entertainment purposes.
