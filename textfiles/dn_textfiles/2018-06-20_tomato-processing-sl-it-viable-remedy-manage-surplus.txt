Tomato processing in SL: Is it a viable remedy to manage surplus?

Tomato is an important and seasonal cash crop for Sri Lankan farmers. Due to seasonality, there is a considerable surplus of production over consumer demand during the season. At the same time, a wide variety of processed products is also derived from tomato. These include canned tomatoes, paste, sauce, puree, juice and ketch-up. Therefore, policymakers, the media, farmers and even the general public question as to why there are no initiatives to use the excess during the season in any industry making tomato products. The objective of this article is to provide a critical view of tomato production, surplus and feasibility of using the surplus in any industry.
Production, uses and surplus
According to the Department of Census and Statistics, the tomato extent and production in 2000 have increased by 25 percent and 71 percent respectively, by 2010. This indicates there is an increasing trend of cultivating tomato over the years. At the same time, it can also be observed that the farmers were able to increase the production by 71 percent, increasing the extent by only 25 percent, shifting to high-yielding varieties. Of the production, 80 percent is confined to six districts and those major producing districts are Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Matale, Anuradhapura and Ratnapura. In 2010, 7,261ha of land were cultivated and a harvest of 75,335mt of tomatoes was obtained.
Of the total production, the majority is consumed locally. With respect to tomato exports, according to the Department of Customs, only 1,631kg of tomatoes were exported in 2005 and it has increased only up to 10,194kg in 2009. This shows that tomato exports are at a very low level compared to production. In addition, the only local destination for fresh tomatoes is the consumers who purchase tomatoes in the form of a fresh fruit.
The surplus can be calculated with the production, losses and consumption data. Therefore, data for the period 2006–2010 depict that there was an excess production of 27,894mt of tomatoes annually. The main reason for this surplus is farmers’ lack of vision. The type of vegetable to be grown is determined by the prices of the previous season. Most of the time, all farmers cultivate the same type which had a good price in the previous season.
This data therefore theoretically shows that annually there is a considerable amount of tomatoes that is not being used at the national level. Further, theoretically, there is potential to use these fresh tomatoes for any project. However, can we use this surplus? If so, how can we use it? That is the challenge we face and the latter part of this article tries to explore that challenge in detail.
Managing the tomato surplus
One of the remedies for the surplus is to use it in processing. In 2009, with the support of the state sector, a large-scale tomato processing factory was established in the Nalanda Industrial Zone, Matale, by a local investor with an investment of nearly Rs.60 million and the factory commenced its operations to make tomato pulp targeting the local producers of tomato pulp-based products, such as tomato sauce and tomato ketch-up. Even though the local investor commenced operations of the factory with much hope, the factory closed down just after the first trial operation in 2009.
In addition, medium-scale production was also carried out in the same industrial zone by another investor to make tomato sauce targeting the rural market. However, that was also not successful and they also stopped their product line after a few months of operations.
The aim of this article is to present the main factors that led to the closure of the tomato processing factories located in the NalandaIndustrial Zone and it would help identify guidelines for similar interventions in the future. The main factors that acted negatively on the sustainability of tomato processing were identified under six themes and are presented below.
i. Appropriate technology and production process
With regard to tomato processing, the opinion of a technical expert on the above theme is mentioned below.
“Normal evaporating machines are not suitable for tomato processing as it lowers the quality of the product specially the colour. Therefore, the suitable technology for tomato processing is vacuum concentration. Earlier, we did not have that technology in the country and recently, that new technology and machines have been imported for the use of that failed factory. However, in general, the capacity of machines of vacuum concentration is comparatively high.” (A technical expert in the state sector, 2013)
This indicates that though the technology is available, the operational capacity may not be able to manage easily.
This factor may result in negative impacts.
ii. Availability of raw material
Figure 1 shows the monthly tomato surplus based on the average data for the period of 2007–2011. This indicates that the surplus is not at a constant level throughout the year. The nature of the surplus has to be considered critically with respect to the tomato requirement of the industry.
Even if the surplus is compatible with the industry requirement, it does not imply that the industry can obtain that surplus easily.
A large number of farmers throughout the districts cultivating tomato and their plot size ranges between a quarter acre to large scale such as 20 acres. All these farmers are contributing to this availability and therefore, a well-established mechanism is required to obtain the surplus of raw material to a focal point which is not an easy task. The unavailability of a proper mechanism to get the surplus to a focal point was one of the reasons for the failure of the large-scale factory.
iii. Technical appropriateness of available raw material
According to technical experts, in tomato processing, the appropriateness of fresh tomatoes for processing mainly depends on the brix value, an important indicator which determines the ability of a tomato variety for processing. In general, almost all the farmers are cultivating imported hybrid varieties these days due to high yield and income. However, the suitability of the imported hybrid varieties for processing has not been tested yet. Therefore, there is uncertainty regarding the technical suitability of the available tomato varieties for processing.
Another quality required for processing is the lycopene content in ripe tomatoes. Lycopene is a pigment and it gives the red colour to the fruit and to the paste. The lycopene content of a fruit is very important to get the accepted colour of the paste as adding artificial colour to the tomato paste is not allowed.
Development of the pigment depends on the variety and the cultivated temperature and the desirable content can be obtained if cultivated in temperatures between 180C - 200C. This factor too, acts as a barrier as the majority of our tomato production does not come from the areas with that desirable temperature.
In addition, another practical issue is the excessive use of chemicals in cultivation. Field observations revealed that most of the farmers are using chemicals exceeding the recommended quantity. Therefore, it can affect the quality of the product of the industry at the end.
iv. Accessibility of raw material
Linkages between production and processing and production and marketing need to be further developed through the establishment and strengthening of supply arrangements with farmers.
Further, a systematic method is required to collect the scattered stocks of raw materials to a focal point. The study found that absence of a systematic and well-developed mechanism to collect the required quantity of tomatoes to the large-scale factory led to a failed project.
v. Affordability of raw material
Strong controls on the purchase price of raw materials need to be observed and strong affordability is one of the key success factors of an industry.
Figure 2 shows the monthly wholesale price of tomato at the Dambulla Dedicated Economic Centre (DDEC). The average minimum and the maximum monthly wholesale prices of tomato at the DDEC for the period 2000–2009 was Rs.19.61 and Rs.40.75 respectively. Two seasons had comparatively low prices and the seasons were January to April and August to October. For the period January to April, prices ranged between Rs.23.97 - 30.13 per kg and it was Rs. 19.61 - 24.77 per kg from August to October. The prices offered by the industry to purchase tomato should be compatible with these open market prices. If not, the farmers will not provide the raw material to the industry.
The prices offered by the factories were lower than the market prices and therefore, farmers had not provided tomato to the industry. If the factory increases the price, then it is not competitive to sell their produce as the price of imported tomato paste would be lower than the local product.
vi. Marketing of the product
With regard to tomato products, though there are no local producers, there are considerable numbers of international producers who have access to local buyers. Therefore, the failed factories had to meet the competition with the producers overseas especially with respect to price and quality. The study found that the importers of tomato paste, who would be the potential buyers of the product, were of the view that the imported paste was high in quality and low in price compared to the local paste.
This study indicates that using the tomato surplus in processing is not practical at large and medium scale and it may result in negative impacts than positive impacts. On the other hand, results show that the excess production is not the only criteria to go for processing and a lot of factors have to be considered before investing to have a viable, profitable and sustainable industry, while protecting valuable resources such as money, land, time and efforts.
Therefore, one of the practical recommendations to manage the surplus is to match the production with the demand. Production-oriented cultivation has to be converted into market-oriented cultivation considering the demand at the market. To support that, the production-oriented extension service has to be transformed into a market-oriented extension service.
