Cambrians triumph

The Under 17 deputy skipper and right arm leg spinner of Prince of Wales College Suwath Mendis had a very excellent spell of 5 for 4 enabled his alma-mater to defeat Waduwa Central College by nine wickets in their inter school division one tournament cricket match conducted by Sri Lanka Schools cricket Association and worked off at Wadduwa.
Batting first homesters collapsed for a paltry 89 runs and in reply Cambrians notched up the required score for the loss of one wicket with Fahad Faiz unbeaten on 28 runs.
Wadduwa Central – 89 in 32.3 overs (Kavinda Silva 25, Suwath Mendis 5/4, Dasan Samarasinghe 2/17).
Prince of Wales – 92/1 in 7.5 overs (Fahad Faiz 38 n/o, Suwath Mendis 23 n/o).
