Nestlé Milo to send six football players to FC Barcelona

Six young talented Sri Lankan football players stand the chance to win an opportunity of a lifetime; attending an all-expense paid trip by Milo to a four-day football coaching camp run by FC Barcelona - the FC Barcelona Barça Academy (Soccer School). FC Barcelona is one of the leading professional football clubs in the world.
Milo’s aim is to nourish the ambitions of kids through their participation in sports, and encourage well rounded personalities. FC Barcelona prides itself on five principal values, namely: ‘Humility’, ‘Effort’, ‘Ambition’, ‘Respect’, and ‘Teamwork’.
Building on these shared values, Milo and FC Barcelona formed a four-year global partnership to promote healthier lifestyles and the importance of physical activity to young people. Together, they are developing a series of sports programs to encourage more young people to take part in sports.
Committed to developing school sports in Sri Lanka for more than three decades, Milo is leveraging this global agreement to help develop football in Sri Lanka as well as develop and inspire young football stars through its ‘Road to Barcelona’ initiative.
‘Road to Barcelona’ will kick-off with an all-island U-12 Sri Lanka Schools Football Tournament, organised by the Sri Lanka Schools’ Football Association under the patronage of the Ministry of Education.
The tournament will be open to boys and girls born in 2007 and 2008. 250 girls’ teams and 800 boys’ teams will take part in the tournament, bringing the total number of participants to 12,600 children.
Based on the skills and values demonstrated at the tournament, the best children will be shortlisted to attend a selection camp, where an expert panel of coaches will select the most deserving six players to train in the FC Barcelona – Barça Academy.
Children not participating in the tournament will also have the chance to attend the selection camp by purchasing a 400g pack of Milo powder and SMSing a unique code (printed on the top flap) to 6456. More details can be found on the Milo Sri Lanka Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/MiloSriLanka). “Milo has always been about fuelling the winning spirit of talented athletes in Sri Lanka, and promoting a healthy, active lifestyle among school children. Over the last 30 years, we have been continually raising the bar in supporting school-level sports and nurturing young athletes, many of whom have gone on to represent the country internationally. We are proud to now offer young Sri Lankan athletes training and development opportunities at a global level,” said Norman Kannangara, Nestlé vice president – Beverages.
