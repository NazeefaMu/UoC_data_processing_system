Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom
Evolve or go extinct

Steven Spielberg’s ‘Jurassic Park’ was a trendsetter. It spawned a large number of Hollywood films based on dinosaurs and creatures resembling enormous beasts like Godzilla and King Kong.
Colin Trevorrow’s science fiction adventure series ‘Jurassic World’ too is a result of this trend. ‘Jurassic World’ portrays how a few dinosaurs have managed to survive in a remote island and then co-exist with human beings in the present world.
Isla Nublar is abandoned by humans while the surviving dinosaurs fend for themselves in the jungles. When the volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs. They find Blue, Owen’s lead raptor who was missing in the wild. However a group of men disguised as rescuers are on a money making mission to sell these beasts for combat purposes. They also design a new dinosaur species which becomes a threat to human existence.
‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’ is a good example of how special effects have come a long way since Spielberg’s time. A more realistic portrayal of the ever popular and terrifying T Rex is brought forth through J A Bayona work. New talent - Justice Smith as Franklin and Daniella Pineda as Zia - blended with the old - Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard reprising their roles as Owen and Claire, enthrall the viewers. The actors play their parts well and keep the audience at the edge of their seats in excitement. But the real let down is the originality of the tale. You get a lot of ‘been there done that’ moments in the film.
Logic too lets the movie down. When Claire and Owen set off to save a few of these endangered species, one wonders if all the trouble is worth it. It is clear that to let dinosaurs roam freely amid man in the modern world will create chaos. Letting them fall into the wrong hands - Rafe Spall’s in this case- is even more dangerous. When the last remaining dinosaurs are let loose into the world it is clear that the team intends it to lead to another movie. However one cannot help hoping that the next movie needs to possess some uniqueness rather than sell it out as old wine in new bottle.
