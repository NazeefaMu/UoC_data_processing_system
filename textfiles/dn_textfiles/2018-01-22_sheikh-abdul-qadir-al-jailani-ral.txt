Sheikh Abdul Qadir Al Jailani (Ral)

Sheikh Abdul Qadir Al Jailani is regarded by many of his co-religionists as the chief and prince of all saints. The venerable Sheikh who lived almost a thousand years ago is still followed, admired and honoured by the multitude of his adherents and admirers across the Muslim world. Commemorative ceremonies to mark his exemplary life and indelible contribution towards spiritual enrichment are held in this month corresponding to the Islamic month of ‘Rabi-us-Sani’.
The Sheikh is held in such esteem that his blessed mausoleum in Baghdad, Iraq, is still an active place of pious visitation. I too had the good fortune to be a frequent visitor to the tomb of this reverent saint, during my brief stint at the Sri Lanka Mission in Baghdad in 2014 – 15. It was indeed memorable and instills a sense of reverence and humility.
The cornerstone of his Message was his clarion call to people to reform themselves, to purify their hearts, to dispel the love of the world from their hearts and instead to fill them with the love of Almighty Allah. He exhorted them to follow the Messenger of Allah (Peace and Blessings be upon him), to abstain from affectation, rid themselves from arrogance, hatred, jealousy, envy, perfidy, hypocrisy and falsehood.
The noble Sheikh declared: “My brothers and sisters, I did not arrive in Union with God, by staying awake all night in worship, by staying aware all day fasting, or by staying engrossed acquiring knowledge; rather I arrived in union with God by generosity, humility and letting my breast at peace.”
Amazingly, the admirable Sheikh, whilst observing the religious edicts scrupulously, also seized time and opportunity to guide and admonish his followers.
He delivered numerous orations and also authored a number of books of guidance, in his inimitable style and scholarship, which provided a comprehensive exposition of the outer and inner aspects of Islam.
Amongst the invaluable and inspiring orations, now compiled in book form are ‘Al Fath ar Rabbani’ (‘The Sublime Revelation’).
Even a non-Muslim scholar like D.S. Margoliouth was so favourably impressed by the content and style of ‘Al Fath ar Rabbani’ that he wrote in his article ‘Abd al-Kadir’ in The Encyclopaedia of Islam, “The sermons included in this work are some of the very best in Muslim literature, the spirit which they breathe is one of charity and philanthropy: the preacher would like to close the gates of Hell and open those of Paradise to all mankind. He employs Sufi technicalities very rarely, and none that would occasion the ordinary reader much difficulty….”
I felt it may be pertinent and useful to make mention of a few of his wise sayings and admonitions.
Sheikh Abdul Qadir, also referred to as ‘Ghouth Al Azam’ (the Supreme Helper) declared: “The root, branch and consummation of all acts of worshipful obedience is modest humility.”
“Patience means giving up complaining.” “Contentment means the expulsion of disagreeable from the heart, so that nothing remains except happiness and joy.”
“Truthfulness means that no distinction is made between what is believed in private and what is professed in public.”
“The true nature of thankfulness is the act of praising the beneficent person by mentioning his beneficence.”
“Improve your hearts for when they are improved, you will experience improvement in all your circumstances.”
“Reckon that all you have left of your life is today and no more. Make ready for the hereafter.”
The renowned scholar Imam Ibn Kathir described the admonitions of Sheikh Abdul Qadir as follows. “He enjoined the people to do what is good and to abstain from what is evil. His admonitions addressed Caliphs, Ministers, people in authority, judges, companions and the masses….”
In his book Qata Idul Jawahir Harada stated, “I have never seen anyone of better character, more magnanimous, more generous, kinder at heart, more trustworthy and loyal to his promise and his friendships than our master Shiekh Abdul Qadir. Despite his revered status, he would stand and converse with the common people, honour the elders, initiate gatherings, sit with the meek and humble himself to the poor.”
In the words of Sheikh Muzaffar Ozak Effendi, “The venerable Sheikh Abdul Al Qadir Al Jailani passed on to the Realm of Divine Beauty in A.H. 561/1166 CE.
He is famed for his extraordinary spiritual experiences, miracles and exploits, as well as his memorable sayings and wise teachings. It is rightly said of him that he was born in love, grew in perfection and met his Lord in the perfection of love.”
