Simplest acts, greatest pleasures!

Want to be cheered up? Say hello to a stranger at 11:17am on a Monday morning
Making ourselves - and others feel good - is as simple as doing a good deed for someone else, a new survey says
We could all do with a pick-me-up from time to time, but if you could choose that one thing to make your day just that little bit better, what would it be?
A new survey has found that the greatest pleasures in life may be the simplest. According to new research conducted by Plusnet, saying hello to a stranger on a Monday morning could significantly brighten their day.
More specifically, saying that hello at 11.17am could be the difference between winning or losing the day. The reason for this, the survey found, is that this time is the point of the week at which we feel most unhappy.
But it's not all doom and gloom. Actually, it's pretty easy to keep us happy - and truly, it's the little things.
This research has revealed that 90 per cent us believe that it only takes something tiny to spice up a previously rubbish day. These include stumbling upon a bargain, a spontaneous hug and even having a car stop to let us cross the road.
Half of those surveyed said that taking the time to do a good deed for someone else cheers them up, suggesting that we're not merely a nation completely obsessed with me-me-me.
Psychologist Jo Hemmings isn't completely surprised by this. “We think it's the big things - the dream house, expensive holiday or flashy car - that make us the happy, but the secret is so much simpler,” she says.
“Holding open a door or saying “good morning” can make a real difference to someone's day; and the good news is that it will make you feel better too!”
These were the top 10 small things that Plusnet found would improve your day. But which one would make you feel good?
