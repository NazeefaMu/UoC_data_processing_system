Dengue Type 2 strain: Unfamiliar menace

Officials from the Dengue Control Unit are blaming the current dengue outbreak on the appearance of the type 2 dengue virus, which has newly arrived in the country.
“From 2009 until 2016, dengue virus types 1 and 4 were circulating in Sri Lanka. But in 2016, the type 2 virus appeared, which is a virulent strain. Our population is not immune to this variety of dengue, and that is why we are getting many more cases than usual,” said Dengue Control Unit Consultant Community Physician Dr. Preshila Samaraweera.

Sources from the Ministry of Health, Nutrition, and Indigenous Medicine also told the Daily News that the number of dengue cases is on the rise in the country and that the disease will likely cause more deaths in 2017 than it did last year.
This news comes alongside reports of overcrowding at various hospitals throughout the island, as some patients are sharing beds, while others are receiving treatment while seated in chairs or lying on the floor. “The overcrowding at the hospital where I work is getting more and more serious due to the dengue and flu outbreaks. There are often two people to a bed, and sometimes, still others sleeping on the floor. Despite these difficulties, I can say that we continue to deliver high quality care,” said a physician from a private hospital who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The rising numbers are causing concern in the medical and public health communities, as the country is on pace to have twice as many dengue cases than it did last year.
The first three months of 2017 saw 27,898 cases and 53 deaths, while there were just 55,150 cases and 90 deaths over the course of last year. Public health officials have also blamed irregular weather patterns on the increased prevalence of dengue.“Part of the problem is the unusual rain pattern that we are experiencing. Usually there are two peak dengue seasons: June through July and then November through January. But this year, we had increased cases in February and March because the monsoonal rains did not come as expected,” said Public Health Department Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Ruwan Wijayamuni.
“The rains have come every few days with heat increase in between the rains, and these conditions are ideal for mosquito breeding,” he added.
Various other South and Southeast Asian countries, such as India, Malaysia, and Singapore are also experiencing large dengue outbreaks that are testing public health and medical services.
“This year, there are more cases than there have been in the past. Because of the increase in cases, there are more patients who are dying, and the public gets alarmed when people die. The healthcare system is effectively treating people, but having some patients die is inevitable,” said an official from the Ministry of Health who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The official added that most hospitals have the proper facilities to deal with the outbreak, but that there are some that are understaffed and lack the proper equipment, especially in the remote and poor reaches of the island. “Some hospitals in rural areas lack the resources to treat people suffering from dengue, and we are working to get people with severe cases to better-equipped facilities located nearby.”
“We are doing all we can, and of course we wish we could do more to fight back against the disease, but the hospitals are geared to handle the current outbreak,” the official said.
The Dengue Control Unit and Public Health Department are stepping up mosquito fogging, surveillance, and container removal programmes to combat the surge in cases. “My team recently inspected 11,800 houses in the Colombo area, and we found potential breeding sites in 12 percent of those houses. We would like to see that number at five percent or less,” said Wijayamuni.
He added that it is finally up to the public to take action since his organization does not have the personnel to monitor the entire city. That being said, Wijayamuni noted that he started carrying out indoor mosquito fogging between 5:30 and 7:30 am, since that is when mosquitoes search for food.
Officials also bemoaned the fact that many people lack the knowledge of how to effectively limit their exposure to mosquitoes and remove breeding sites.
“We are ramping up awareness campaigns, both through the dengue control unit and the media, to teach the public how to identify and destroy the containers, used tires, and plastic cups that mosquitoes use to reproduce,” said Samaraweera.
Officials are confident, however, that they will be able to contain the current outbreak.
