Sri Lanka’s exchange rate moved the least among EM peers

After US elections in November most emerging markets (EM) currencies depreciated by sizable margins. In contrast, Sri Lanka’s exchange rate moved the least among EM peers despite similar movements in bond spreads.
The CBSL’s sizable FX purchase in December was not enough to make up for earlier losses.
The program’s end- December NIR target was missed by a substantial margin.
