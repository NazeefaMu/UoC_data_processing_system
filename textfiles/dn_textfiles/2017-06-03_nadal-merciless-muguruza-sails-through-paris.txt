Nadal merciless, Muguruza sails through in Paris

PARIS June 2: Nine-time champion Rafael Nadal lost just one game in a ruthless display to reach the French Open last 16 on Friday, while Garbine Muguruza gained further momentum in the defence of her title.
Nadal demonstrated why he is once more considered the overwhelming favourite at Roland Garros with a brutal demolition of Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili.
The Spaniard romped to a 6-0, 6-1, 6-0 win, narrowly missing out on becoming just the sixth man in the Open era to record a “triple bagel”.
“Perfection? I don't know about that,” said Nadal, who plans to celebrate his 31st birthday on Saturday by watching Real Madrid play Juventus in the Champions League final.
“I think I played very well today. The most important thing is to be through and I played my best match in a while.
“Tomorrow at 8.45 I'm going to be in front of the TV for sure supporting my team, hoping that Real Madrid will win another time.” Nadal will meet compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut for a spot in the quarter-finals.
Reigning champion Novak Djokovic faces Argentina's Diego Schwartzman later, with the world number 41 through to the third round of a major for the first time.
Muguruza swept into round four of the women's draw with a 7-5, 6-2 win over Kazakh 27th seed Yulia Putintseva.
The Spaniard closed out victory with an ace in a match that featured 11 breaks of serve in 20 games played.
“I think the more matches I play and the toughest victories I think gives you self-confidence, successful feeling out there,” said Muguruza.
“I think it's important with all the three matches that I played that are not easy at all.” Muguruza plays either French 13th seed Kristina Mladenovic or American Shelby Rogers, who she beat in last year's quarter-finals, for a place in the last eight. AFP
