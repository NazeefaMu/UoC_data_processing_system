New Year celebrations held in Sydney

The Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Sydney celebrated Sinhala and Tamil New Year on April 15 at the city's Royal Botanical Gardens with the participation of a section of Sri Lankan university students in Australia, including those who are under the Australian Awards scholarship programme.
The Sri Lankan flag was hoisted in the historic Royal Botanical Gardens overlooking the Opera House and the Habour Bridge - iconic landmarks of Sydney.
Consul General Lal Wickrematunge welcomed the gathering and highlighted the importance of celebrating the Sinhala and Tamil New Year in unison. He invited the guests to enjoy the widespread of traditional sweets, performances and the array of New Year games.
Varuni Wickremasinghe and Dushan Ranasinghe from the University of Sydney performed a New Year song while Ishi Yogya from the Western Sydney University performed a folk song. All guests took part in the Avurudu games such as identifying the hidden guest, lime and spoon race, blindfold feeding, musical hats and tug o’ war.
Undergraduate and postgraduate students from the University of Sydney, University of New South Wales, Macquarie University and the Western Sydney University, and members of the Sri Lankan community were also present. Last year too, the Consulate General celebrated the Sinhala and Tamil New Year with Sri Lankan university students, providing them with a platform for networking.
The main community event to celebrate the Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Sunfest, was held on April 14. The event was organised by the Sinhalese Cultural Forum of NSW Inc in collaboration with other community associations including the Sri Lanka Association and the Austra-Lanka Muslim Association.
Consul General Lal Wickrematunge attended the event as the Chief Guest and the Consulate General maintained a stall at the venue to provide information on consular services as well as on travel and trade in Sri Lanka.
