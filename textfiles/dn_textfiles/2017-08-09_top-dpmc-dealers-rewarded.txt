Top DPMC dealers rewarded

David Pieris Motor Company (DPMC) held its annual dealers meeting and get-together recognising the best of the best within its 337 strong dealer network at a glittering event at Sri Lanka Karting Circuit (SLKC) at Bandaragama recently.
Accordingly 23 dealers were rewarded for their long-term loyalty. The occasion was graced by Rohana Dissanayake, DPMC Director and Chief Operating Officer, Jagath Kulatunge, Director (Marketing), Shanaka Jayaweera Chief Marketing Officer and other officers of the company.
The participants were welcomed by Rohana Dissanayake while Shanaka Jayaweera delivered an informative speech on current business trends and challenges. A very interactive sharing session followed where dealers opened up with their ideas and views to the Company leadership.
A group of 52 dealers traveled to India to visit the Bajaj Auto Limited last year. This year too, the sales dealers who have made their annual targets were awarded a special tour to India to visit Bajaj Auto Limited. The names of those dealers were also revealed at the occasion and 52 DPMC dealers will be traveling to India in August.
