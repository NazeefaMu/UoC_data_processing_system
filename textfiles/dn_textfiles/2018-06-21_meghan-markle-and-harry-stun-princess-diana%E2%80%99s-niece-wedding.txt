Meghan Markle and Harry  stun at Princess Diana’s niece wedding

MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry were in fine spirits on Saturday as they arrived for the wedding of the Duke of Sussex’s cousin - exactly four weeks after their own Royal Wedding.
The newlyweds were seen smiling and laughing as they attended the wedding of Celia McCorquodale to George Woodhouse at St Andrew and St Mary’s Church in Stoke Rockford, Lincolnshire.
Celia, the younger daughter of the Princess of Wales’ sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, sported the tiara that Diana wore for her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981.
The bride attended Meghan and Harry’s glittering wedding at St George’s Chapel in Windsor exactly four weeks ago and returned the favour by inviting her cousin and his new wife to her own celebrations. Meghan and Harry looked delighted to be attending the wedding as they arrived at the picturesque country church, holding hands and smiling and laughing with other guests.
This came just 48 hours after the Duchess of Sussex joined the Queen in Cheshire for her first joint public engagement with the monarch, but without her new husband.
They had arrived in Runcorn following an overnight journey on the Royal Train, which Express.co.uk understands set off on Wednesday night and after arriving at its destination, the pair drove across the Mersey Gateway Bridge before heading to the Catalyst Museum in West Bank, widnes.
There, the Queen unveiled a plaque to officially open the £1.86 billion project, a six-lane toll bridge over the River Mersey, to ease traffic between Runcorn and Widnes.
As they left, the Queen and Duchess were presented with flowers by Savannah Cafferty, 11, and Alarni Wain, who was celebrating her eighth birthday.
The event at the Catalyst Museum offers a bird’s eye view of the new crossing from the glass top observation gallery.
The royal party were also treated to a performance by local school children there called ‘Bringing Communities Together: Halton’s river crossing over the ages’.
The Queen and duchess then got into a car together before heading to their next engagement in Chester, 20 miles away, for two more royal engagements.
Such an occasion marks the first time the Duchess of Sussex attended an event with her husband’s grandmother alone.
It came after the Queen and Meghan appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony together for the Trooping the Colour, which marks the monarch’s official birthday celebration.
