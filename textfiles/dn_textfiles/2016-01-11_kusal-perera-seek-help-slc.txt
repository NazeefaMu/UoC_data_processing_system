Kusal Perera to seek help from SLC

Kusal Perera who is under a cloud after being tested positive for a banned drug is to seek Sri Lanka Cricket help to clear his name and make an early return to international cricket.
"Kusal met me yesterday (Saturday) and said that he is going to appeal to Sri Lanka Cricket," said SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala.
"After he appeals to us we will try to find a solution. We have no idea what position he has taken, but once he writes to us we will have an ExCo meeting and the committee will take a decision how we will have to go through it," he said.
"The ICC's Anti-Doping Committee has conducted this test and found him guilty. He is fighting his case separately with the ICC but in the mean time he is appealing to me directly. I will take the matter up separately.
"We will have to look at the ICC position with regard to his case and the legal position and wee how best we can handle it. He has the right to appeal and he is doing that."
Decision on head coach after team returns
A decision on a head coach for the Sri Lanka team will be taken after they return from the tour of New Zealand on January 13.
"We want to talk to the national captain, current coach and the chairman of selectors, discuss with them and by about January 15 take a decision which road map we want to take," said Sumathipala.
"Until they return we are not going to make any decisions. We have no idea what internal decisions have been taken and what has gone wrong.
"I am in favour of a non Sri Lankan coach. If the current team is settled with the current coach before the World T20 we will have to look at it that way. We will make an assessment when they return and decide T20 World Cup as a short term and then someone for a long term," he said.
