Poisoning of ex-LTTE cadres; a canard: Sathyalingam

Former Northern Province Health Minister P. Sathyalingam said there was no truth to speculation that some ex-LTTE cadres at rehabilitation centres were injected with poison leading to their deaths.
When questioned by a fellow member of the Northern PC on Thursday about the outcome of an investigation carried out by a special team appointed during Sathyalingam’s time as health minister of the NCP, the former minister had replied that the special team had concluded their probe and they had found out the allegations were completely false.
Earlier media reports citing certain Tamil politicians in the north alleged that some LTTE cadres at rehabilitation centres were injected with poison leading to their deaths.
The government has vehemently rejected these claims vehemently, with Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene rejecting them as “false and baseless allegations.” Sathyalingam had said that the team had examined a large number of ex-LTTE cadres who were rehabilitated at the government run centres and they had not found a single instance of poison being used on them.
