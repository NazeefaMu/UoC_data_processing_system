Fitch Ratings assigns SL’s  upcoming US dollar-  denominated bonds ‘B+(EXP)’

Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka’s upcoming US dollar-denominated bonds an expected rating of ‘B+(EXP)’.
The expected rating is in line with Sri Lanka’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of ‘B+’ with a Stable Outlook.
The rating would be sensitive to any changes in Sri Lanka’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. In February 2018, Fitch affirmed Sri Lanka’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at ‘B+’ with a Stable Outlook. The Long-Term Local-Currency IDR is also ‘B+’ with a Stable Outlook.
