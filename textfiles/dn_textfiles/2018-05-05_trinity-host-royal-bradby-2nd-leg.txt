KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP:
Trinity host Royal in the Bradby 2nd leg

The confrontation between the two senior rugby playing schools - Trinity College and Royal College for school rugby's richest prize - the Bradby Shield will take place at the Palekelle grounds today. This school game is the much looked forward to encounter every year and from it develops some of the best and lasting friendships. This game produces rugby of a very high standard which thousands of rugby fans come a long way to see and enjoy. This year in their 1st leg played in Colombo on April 21 Royal had the golden opportunity to get the first victory under Sabith Feroz’s leadership against Trinity College led by Avishka Shiek 39-7. However recent history is very much on Royal’s side. They have now gone five games unbeaten and Trinity will be eager to avoid a whitewash in the 2nd leg, In the 1st leg Royal put the Trinity XV under serious pressure at numerous stages throughout the game and they showed plenty of heart and X-factor on attack.
Royal’s attack and defence was excellent. In today’s game Trinity need to improve on everything that they failed to put right in the last outing. Trinity should continue to defend well, for the full 70 minutes, convert their kicks at goal and ensure they continue their fine attacking form, they need to cut out the errors they make to complement their bravery in attack.
They must continue to dominate set pieces and be clinical when point-scoring opportunities present themselves. This season, though Trinity has a good side, they have failed to show their prowess. Royal has shown improvement this year and on present form should win today as well. Hopefully if Trinity can win today they can get some confidence for the second round matches.

Their next game is with St. Peter’s that too in Kandy with date not fixed most probably it will be on April 20.
FFSL meets KAFL
Three officials of the Football Federation had visited Kandy last Saturday, and had a meeting in a hotel along Dalada Veediya. They have met some of the members of the clubs in Kandy.
At the meeting they have decided to have the AGM of the league which was not held in 2017. For the last two years no inter club tournaments have been conducted.
Inter Police Athletics
Plans are afoot over here in the hills, to organize an athletics meets among the Central Province Police division.
The idea has come from the IGP Pujitha Jayasundara. The participating athletes will be from the divisions of Kandy, Hatton, Gampola, Matale and Nuwara Eliya. The problem here is there is no proper ground to hold the meet as Bogambara is the only grounds with athletics facilities, but it is not available.
Rajans, Antonians fail to win a single game
Dharmaraja College and St. Anthony’s College missed their chance to qualify for the 2018 inter school rugby second round “Cup” competition both falling to win a single game in the first round outings.
The Old boys who give a big hand are deeply disappointed. Both schools were coached by two experienced coaches, who gave their best but the players failed to deliver. .
Where is volleyball today in Kandy?
The game of volleyball is the national sport of Sri Lanka. In a certain era volleyball was a popular game in Kandy, but today sadly the much needed support for the game is missing. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making big news.
The first volleyball league was formed in Kandy in 1941. At one time there were tournaments held annually. Today it is not so, volleyball in Kandy needs a fillip. The game was introduced to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1916 by R. W. Camack.
Kandy Schools interested in Indoor Hockey
Kandy schools boys and girls who are doing well at hockey are keen to take up indoor hockey.
It will be ideal if Kandy schools too are given a break to take up to this sport at indoor level. Initially they need to organize a workshop for the schools. Kandy Schools are keen to get to know the rules and regulations of the game.
Weight lifting to come back
Weightlifting is one of the oldest sports which held sway in Kandy that produced several sportsmen who brought honor to their clubs, themselves and the country.
This is one of the prominent sports that could bring international fame to Sri Lanka if it is well supported.
The sport in Kandy prospered largely due to the immense support and helping hand extended by the Kandy YMCA who were backed by the National Olympic Committee and Sports Ministry. Once again it is refreshing to note, weightlifting is catching up in a big way in schools. Even girls are interested in taking to this sport for recognition.
Vidyartha Old boy Dilum makes Kandy proud
Old boy of Vidyartha College 21 year old Dilum Deeshana, a top rugger player made Kandy, his school and parents proud by refereeing the cup final of the Midnight 10 rugby tournament held in Singapore on April 27 at Turf Club grounds. The Cup final was between Borneo Eagle and Legiste, which was won by Borneo Eagles 22-0. Dilum played for Vidyartha College in 2016.
