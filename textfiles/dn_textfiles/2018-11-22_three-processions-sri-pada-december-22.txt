Three processions to Sri Pada on December 22

Marking the beginning of the Sri Pada pilgrimage season, three processions to the mountain will commence from the Galpoththawela Rajamaha Vihara on December 22. One procession would reach the destination via Nallathanni, on the Ratnapura - Avissawella road, while the other two would use the Balangoda - Bogawantalawa and Kuruwita roads.
