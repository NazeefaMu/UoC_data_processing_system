Enjoining order against Regent Property Developers extended

The enjoining order issued against Regent Property Developers Lanka has been extended by the Colombo Commercial High Court till November 28.
The order was issued at the instance of Construction Managers and Planners, the contractor of Regent Residencies apartment complex situated in Watarappola Road, Mount Lavinia. They claimed that Regent had failed to pay money due to them in respect of construction, in spite Construction Managers and Planners already having an adjudication decision in its favour against Regent in a sum exceeding Rs.74 million.
The order was delivered by Commercial High Court Judge Ruwan Fernando who held that in the cases, even where there is arbitration clause, court can support arbitral process by granting an interim relief until the constitution of the arbitral tribunal or an interim relief is either granted or refused.
The Colombo Commercial High Court had extended the interim relief against Regent Property Developers Lanka preventing it from alienating and transferring or selling of any further apartments in ‘Regent Residencies’ in Mount Lavinia.
