Lifeline to patients with blood disorders

Asiri Hospital’s Bone Marrow Transplant Unit located at Asiri Central Hospital conducted the first successful stem cell transplant in the island by securing a matching non related donor through an international bone marrow donor registry.
Blood cancers such as leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and other blood disorders such as thalassemia are on the rise and are considered the third most common cause of death in the country. A bone marrow transplant can mean life for people with blood cancers and related disorders, especially children.
“While our unit has been operational for about three years and we successfully conducted the first bone marrow transplant in Sri Lanka using a donor from an international donor registry. The donor from the registry was a South Asian national. The patient, a 13 year old child is now back at home, well and cured,” Consultant Haematologist, Dr.Lallindra Gooneratne said.
In the recent procedure conducted by the Unit, a 13 year old girl afflicted by Thalassemia underwent an allogeneic transplant.
“When stem cells are taken from a healthy donor, in this instance it was a non related but genetically matching donor. For allogeneic transplants, siblings and parents too are tested initially.However most patients do not have a genetically matched family donor,” he said.
The unit also offers autologous transplants - in which the patient's own stem cells are harvested prior to giving him/her high doses of chemotherapy and then re-infusing the patient with them. This is currently the standard of care for patients with myeloma. The Unit provides treatment for patients of all ages in need of a bone marrow transplant.
“There are international donor registries where they have several thousands of donors registered and their genetic makeup has been listed.
We can send our patient’s genetic reports to whatever country and they will check to see if there is a match. If there is match we can use those donor stem cells or bone marrow, to treat our patient in Sri Lanka,” Dr. Gooneratne said.
“Follow up is very important – minimum is one year while the first three months are extremely crucial. They have to be monitored very carefully and are on medication for a period of about one year.
The Unit also has a 24-hour hotline for patients to contact the nursing staff,” he added.
The unit has been accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI). The unit incorporates the latest technology and techniques for infection control. Patients are shifted to specially designed HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filtered rooms reducing the chances of infections, a high possibility in patients with a compromised immune status. Staff at Asiri’s Bone Marrow Unit was specially trained by an expert Italian team to take care of the patients.
