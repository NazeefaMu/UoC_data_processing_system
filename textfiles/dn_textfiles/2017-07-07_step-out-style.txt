Hameedia has introduced a variety of offers that will give you the chance to pick and choose the ultimate selection of ceremonial attire this wedding season.
“A total of three packages, The Basic Package, The Smart Package and The Exclusive package are available, and customers have to purchase a minimum of three suits and three shirts to be eligible for any package. The offers are available for all suits in the Ceremonial Collection.
Customers can make the most of these savings at any Hameedia showroom,” states a press release issued by Hameedia.
“We want grooms to be able to look their very best and step out in style on the most important day of their lives, and our packages enable them to achieve that keeping affordability in mind.
Weddings can be extremely expensive in their own right, so we hope that these offers will enable grooms to save on their ceremonial attire, without having to compromise on quality and style,” Hameedia, Managing Director, Fouzul Hameed states in the same press release..
