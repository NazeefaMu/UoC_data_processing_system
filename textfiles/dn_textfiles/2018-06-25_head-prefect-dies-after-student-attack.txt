Head prefect dies after student attack

Mohamed Rizvi Mohamed Faizul (16), Warana Muslim Maha Vidyalaya head prefect, who was receiving treatment at the Colombo National Hospital ICU for serious injuries sustained after being assaulted by a group of fellow students, succumbed to his injuries on June 23 morning, Chilaw police said.
Faizul, a grade 11 student of the school, was brutally attacked with clubs by a group of four fellow students who lay in ambush as he was on his way back home after attending prayers at the Sawarana Colony Mosque around 10 p.m. on June 15.
The attackers had fled the scene after threatening him not to divulge the incident to anyone.
Police said Faizul, who remained silent about the incident on his return home, had complained to his parents about an unbearable headache he had at the time.
He had been admitted to the Chilaw Hospital from where he had been transferred to the Colombo National Hospital in a critical condition. There, he had undergone an immediate surgery on the head and shifted to the ICU where he had died. Chilaw police said four students were arrested and one of them has been remanded while the other three were released on bail.
Further investigations are continuing.
