Prince Oscar of Sweden Makes First Public Appearance

Prince Oscar of Sweden looked adorable in a blue bonnet and matching warmers as he made his first public appearance with his parents, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel as well as his big sister Princess Estelle at the 70th birthday celebrations of his grandfather King Carl XVI Gustaf on Thursday. The baby prince was fast asleep throughout the festivities in his mom’s arms. He was joined by his family for the celebrations in Stockholm.
Baby Oscar, who is third-in-line to the Swedish throne after his mom and sister, was dressed in a blue bonnet complete with matching warmers and a pair of pale blue buckled shoes. He was wrapped up in a white blanket to protect from the cold weather. Oscar matched his sister completely in the all-blue outfit.
Four-year-old Estelle looked cute in a pale blue coat which she paired with white thigh high socks and matching pair of buckled shoes. The hyperactive royal wore her blonde locks down in a side part with a half up and half down braided “do.”
The stylish little princess sported one of the season’s biggest hair trends with her braided “do.”
Baby Oscar’s balcony appearance was in keeping with the tradition of the Bernadotte family. Even his sister Estelle made her public debut on the same balcony during the king’s birthday four years before. Though it was her baby brother’s debut appearance and her grandfather’s big day, Estelle stole the show greeting clergymen as she left the royal chapel, shook hands and kissed cheeks with other royal guests. Later, she joined in musical tributes to the king, enthusiastically clapping her hands.
After Estelle and Oscar were put to bed, King Carl XVI Gustaf hosted a lavish banquet at the palace. The king’s milestone birthday celebrations witnessed royal visitors from Japan, Spain, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark.
He was joined by his family including older daughter Victoria and her family, son and new parents Prince Carl Philip and his wife Princess Sofia and his youngest daughter Princes Madeleine and her husband Chris O’Neill who had flown down from their home in London.
His wife, Queen Silvia, was by his side as he celebrated the momentous occasion.
