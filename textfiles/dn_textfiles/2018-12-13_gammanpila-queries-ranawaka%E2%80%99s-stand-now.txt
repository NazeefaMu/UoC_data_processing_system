Gammanpila queries Ranawaka’s stand now

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila MP queried as to where Patali Champika Ranawaka now stands.
He was making reference to the decision of the TNA to support UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament and the much claimed agreement between the UNP and the TNA.The TNA which acted as the political arm of the LTTE then, is now out to realise their aspirations, that they could not achieve with guns. It was Champika who called the TNA as Tigers and said he wished to see that party banned.
That very party now supports the UNP and I wish to know where Champika Ranawaka stands now and the people are watching,” Gammanpila told the media.
Gammanpila went onto say that the Confidence Motion passed in Parliament has no bearing, even if has the support of the 225 Members and not 117.There is no vacancy for him to be Prime Minister for so far Mahinda Rajapaksa has not vacated the seat and there is no Court decision to remove him from the seat either. what the UNP should have done was bring a No Confidence Motion in through the proper channel and create a vacancy in the post.
