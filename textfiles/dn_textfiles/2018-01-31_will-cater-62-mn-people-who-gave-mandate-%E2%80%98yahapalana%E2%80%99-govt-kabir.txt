Will cater to 6.2 mn people who gave a mandate to the ‘Yahapalana’ Govt. - Kabir

UNP General Secretary and Minister Kabir Hashim, issuing a press statement yesterday, reiterated that those in the ruling coalition must cater to the aspirations of 6.2 million people who had given a mandate to the ‘Yahapalana’ Government in 2015.
He pointed out that it was a betrayal to turn your back on the mandate given by the people to the Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and empower the aspirations of defeated political elements.
He noted that the people’s mandate was to restore the supremacy of law by putting an end to the authoritarian rule which prevailed under the Rajapaksa regime.
He said taking steps for national reconciliation was another task the people entrusted on this Government as the country had been plagued with racial and religious extremism.
Rebuilding the economy was another key aspiration of the people, he said.
“The Yahapalana Government even amidst various challenges has been able to take many progressive steps in the last three years to realise the aspirations of the people. The passage of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution is one such giant step. The basic steps to formulate a new Constitution have also been taken. To empower the democratic governance, we have guaranteed the independence and freedom of judiciary,” he recalled.
He pointed out anti-government elements, who do not wish to see political stability under the Yahapalana Government, attempt to topple it and bring back the old authoritarian rule.
“Old weapons such as racism, religious disharmony, western conspiracies and secret projects of NGOs etc are being used for the purpose. They must realise that such attempts are futile. The path for development of village and town is now open. We have laid the foundation to realize the vision of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for a strong Sri Lanka. We need your support to finish the remaining work and you can do so by empowering the UNP more and more,” Minister Hashim added.
