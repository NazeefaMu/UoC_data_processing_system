SL to focus on export economy

Sri Lanka would move toward an export oriented economy and cut down on infrastructure development funded by high commercial borrowing, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Speaking at the Launch of ‘The Road Map on Investment Climate Reforms’ at Temple Trees yesterday, the Prime Minister said the country had suffered as a result of the loss of its competitive advantage.
“In those years, the economy did not generate sufficient high paying jobs. In addition, the volume of tradable goods reduced as a percentage and we lost the competitive advantage,”the Prime Minister said.
Wickremesinghe further said that the government also was focused on increasing Sri Lanka’s doing Business index ranking from the present 110th position.
“We want to bring this up to 70 by 2020,”he said.
The Prime Minister said this would bring Sri Lanka closer with several other Asian countries like Thailand, (46) Malaysia (23).
“However, we are not going to stop there and we want to move further up,” he said. He further said that the road map would help improve the private sector business environment by a great deal and also help woo more Foreign Direct Investment.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that the Road Map on Investment Climate Reforms would target several reforms like the Single Window corridor, new land ownership laws, One stop Shop, several new economic zones, digital economy and task forces in several areas.
“We will also change some legislation to simplify doing business in Sri Lanka and this in turn will help both local foreign investors,” the Prime Minister said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that this in turn would help generate ‘high paying stable jobs’.
He however said that to achieve the full potential of this initiative,inflation and the Cost of Living has to come down and the economic reform programme must continue. The Premier recalled that in 1977 when the Open Economy was introduced, Sri Lanka was ahead of several other countries and only countries like Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore were ahead of us.
“But today, I am afraid to look back since only a few countries are behind us and this is the last chance Sri Lanka has to move forward,”the Prime Minister said.
