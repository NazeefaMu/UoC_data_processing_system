New faces to adorn Cabinet

The National Unity Government will receive a facelift with young leaders assuming more responsibilities at a Cabinet reshuffle likely to take place over the week end.
“Reliable sources of the Government told the Daily News that the ministerial portfolios of the Law and Order, Highways, Public Enterprises Development and Foreign Employment, will undergo radical changes during the Cabinet reshuffle.
The changes to the Cabinet of Ministers will infuse young blood to the Government, enabling it to move forward with new vigour,” sources said.
The two main parties in the ruling coalition agreed to a Cabinet reshuffle following the outcome of Local Government Elections.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe held several rounds of talks to finalise the revisions to the Cabinet of Ministers.
State Ministe of International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe and State Minister of Labour and Trade Unions Ravindra Samaraweera are tipped to Cabinet Ministers, reliable sources told the Daily News.
Ravindra Samaraweera was also appointed Minister of Social Welfare in the UNP government in 2001. He was a deputy minister in former President Ranasinghe Premadasa’s government. He had also held a number of positions in the Uva Provincial Council too.
