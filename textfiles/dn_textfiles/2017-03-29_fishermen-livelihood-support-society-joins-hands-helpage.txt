Fishermen Livelihood Support Society joins hands with HelpAge

In an effort to improve the health and eye condition of underprivileged elderly citizens living among fisher families in Negombo and Surrounding villages, the Negombo Fishermen Livelihood support Society (FLSS) extended financial assistance to HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) for conducting Mobile Medical and Eye Care Camps.
Accordingly, the HelpAge Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) which consisted with a doctor, an optometrist, a nurse and supporting staff conducted medical camps at Wellaweediya and Pitipana in Negombo and Dikkovita in Wattala during the past few weeks.
The medical camps benefitted approximately 453 elders who were between the age group of 55 to 81 years. They were mainly screened for non- communicable diseases, eye diseases and for various other vision disabilities.
Thirty one patients were directed to HelpAge Eye Hospital at Sinsapa Road, Wellawatta to undergo free cataract surgeries, while other patients received medicines for various eye ailments. Patients who had low vision received high quality bifocal glasses from the HelpAge MMU.
In addition, large number of elderly people had their eyes tested free of charge by the HelpAge MMU. Patients who were unable to visit HelpAge Eye Hospital at Wellawatta , were referred to Government hospitals in the Negombo area for treatments with grants given by the HelpAge.
Project Manager, Fishermen livelihood Support Society Ranjan Fonseka said over the years , HelpAge Sri Lanka extended immense support to Senior Citizens in the country as a responsible institution and his Society was pleased to be part of this worthy cause.
He said his Society donated funds towards the programme under its Corporate Social Responsibility Fund and wish to conduct more medical and eye camps in the years to come. A number of Society officials attended the camps.
While highlighting the free cataract surgery programme , HASL, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said over 27,000 elders in the country have already benefitted under this programme from the inception of HelpAge Sri Lanka.
He also thanked the Society for their kind gesture extended towards a valuable programme and said HASL always uses donations to conduct cataract surgeries, medical and eye screening programmes and also to provide free spectacles for needy Senior Citizens.
He said there is a marked improvement in contributions made by private sector and individual donors towards the country’s health and eye care sector and thanked Fishermen livelihood Support Society, Project Manager Ranjan Fonseka and the Society management for partnering in this worthy cause.
