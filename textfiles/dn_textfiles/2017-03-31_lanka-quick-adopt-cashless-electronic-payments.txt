Lanka quick to adopt cashless electronic payments

Sri Lanka is the second fastest country in adopting cashless payments in the region after India Visa Sri Lanka and Maldives Country Manager Anthony Watson said.
Sri Lanka is a fast-developing economy and with the evolution of digital commerce, there is significant opportunity for the growth of electronic payments, he added.
“Electronic payments is on the rise in Sri Lanka with Visa payment volumes up 22% in 2016, Visa registered a12% growth in cards and a 61% growth in eCommerce transactions,” he said.
This growth comes off the back of a number of initiatives and investments made by the company in developing the acceptance infrastructure and driving awareness around the benefits of electronic payments in the country. He said that 23% of Sri Lankan card transactions are being done using credit cards and 21% via debit cards.
He said that the high internet penetration and increased use of Smart phones too is a reason for this.
He also said that currently most of the cashless transactions are being used in the leisure sector to make hotel, air ticket and restaurant purchases. In addition we also see an increase in cashless transactions for electric and household equipment purchases.”
He said that Sri Lanka though moving fast in this area surprisingly frauds are notably very low. “This may be because Sri Lankan banking sector has taken several meaningful steps against fraud.”
The payments industry in Sri Lanka is undergoing rapid change and the electronification of payments is marking the future of digital transactions. However, personal consumption expenditure on electronic payments remains around 4.2%, which indicates there is still considerable room for growth. Visa has been in Sri Lanka for the last 29 years, over which time there has been considerable growth in the uptake of electronic payments.
“We will continue to leverage our global payments network to bring the latest payment solutions to the Sri Lankan market, which is seeing a surge in the popularity of eCommerce transactions and will gradually move towards mobile payments.”
“Visa is committed to working with the government, merchants and financial institutions to continue to drive the growth and development of electronic payments across Sri Lanka,” Watson added.
