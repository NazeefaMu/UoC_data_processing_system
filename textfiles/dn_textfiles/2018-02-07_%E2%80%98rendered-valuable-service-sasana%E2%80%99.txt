‘Rendered valuable service to Sasana’

The late Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera was a pious, erudite and principled Bhikku, who earned national and international fame for the great service he rendered to society, said Most Ven Niyangoda Vijitha Siri Anunayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter in a condolence message yesterday.
Participating in international seminars in countries such as China, Japan, Cambodia, India, Laos and Myanmar, he provided an indefatigable service towards the propagation of Buddhism throughout the world, the Thera said.
The message added: "Ven. Prof. Wimalarathana Anunayake Thera worked hard to protect the Sasana, language and Bhikkhu Vinaya rules without taking any political sides.
"The loss created to the country and religion due to his untimely demise cannot be easily filled.
“Ven. Wimalarathana Thera who intervened in a practical way in the compilation of the Siyam Maha Nikaya Bhikkhu Kathikawatha, even made representations on behalf of Bhikkhu and Buddhist education before the Walpita Commission appointed by the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga government to probe the affairs of the Sri Lanka Buddhist and Pali University. "He also made a valuable contribution towards the work of the 2600 Sambuddha Jayanthi operation committee. The late Wimalarathana Thera was a great Sangha teacher who rendered a valuable Sasana service."
