Tax Liability of Foreigners to be revised

The Government intends to take the following steps on the Tax Liability of Foreigners on the Government Securities.
Under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, the interest or discount paid to non – resident persons and commercial banks in Sri Lanka on Sovereign Bonds denominated in foreign currency is exempt from payment of income tax.
In order to maintain the status quo in relation to tax liability of foreigners on Government securities, the exemption will be expanded to interest or discount paid to non-residents on Sovereign Bonds denominated in local currency (Rupee denominated Sovereign Bonds) under the Inland Revenue Act, no. 24 of 2017, as well.
