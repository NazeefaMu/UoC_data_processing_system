Book Review:  No Stone Unturned

Title: Isurumuni Rock TempleAuthor: J.B DisanayakaPhoto Artist: Panduka De SilvaPublisher: Sumitha Publishers
When I first set my eyes on him it felt as though he had seen me but turned his head away to tease me. His half-closed eyes, the slight smile hovering on his lips, the sinewy arms, the well built torso make it crystal clear (only it's not crystal) that he is the kind of man who would have won any fair maiden's heart. If so, on an evening many moons ago, did he sit there in front of the pond, gazing at the waves dancing to the music of the wind, with the last rays of the sun reluctantly bidding good bye to the Esela flowers on the trees around him, with his horse standing behind him, waiting for his lady love?
I think so. I hope so. I hope even as the first rays of the moon started to light his surroundings, a beautiful lady walked towards him, making those lazy eyes brighten up, turning those lips into a full smile. But I could be wrong. Just as everyone else who had gazed at him across the years and given him various names, predicted different dates of birth and written his life's story with many twists and turns, might be wrong.
If so, Dr. D.T Devendra who wrote in 'Sinhalese Classical Sculpture' (1958) that the man I believe to be waiting for his love is really Alexander the Great and the animal behind him, is his horse Bucephalus, might be wrong. Henry Parker, who in his book, 'Ancient Ceylon' identified him as a 'seated warrior wearing a helmet…' might also be wrong. So too, many others: L.T.P Manjushri, (who thought the figure represents Ananga-Kama- the Indian God of Love) Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy who calls him the sage Kapila mentioned in the Ramayana and Prof. J. E. Van Lohuizen who argues that he represents god Aiyanar. Who then, could be right? Who then knows the exact identity of the beautifully carved sculpture of the man and the horse at Isurumuniya in Anuradhapura that has drawn the attention of archaeologists, critics and romantic-dreamers alike for over two centuries?
The answer could be found in Prof. J.B Disanayaka's latest publication - 'Isurumuni Rock Temple'. Stepping on territory already covered with many footprints Prof. Disanayaka discusses the above identities attributed to this sculpture described as a 'tremendous work, impossible to forget once seen” (Laurence Binyon)with almost the same delicate manures as the unknown artist who weilded his chisel over the stone surface to create an everlasting masterpiece. He leaves the reader to decide whose argument best befits the stone figure and ends the chapter giving his own interpretation. While not wishing to give away the clues that would help you to solve the curious case of the man and his horse and spoil the fun, I think it is safe to say Prof. Disanayaka's answer is the most plausible of the lot. But, thankfully, even as he shows his view is surely the most logical, Prof Disanayaka generously leaves ample room in his narrative for those like me with a more wild imagination to hold on to our own interpretations as well. (So, even though I know the Professor might be right, I will continue to believe the man carved in stone is a writer who lived in Anuradhapura and was waiting to meet his love to explain to her the plot of his newest story!)
Speculation apart, from the awesome grandeur of the Great Stupa – Ruwanveli Saya to the delicate gestures of the two lovers at Isurumuniya, Prof. Disanayaka's 'Isurumuni Rock Temple' with its beautifully illustrated history offers a thorough and delightfully readable introduction to the spellbinding power of ancient Anuradhapura.
Describing how the city was first designed Prof. Disanayaka quotes from Prof. G. P Malalasekera's 'Dictionary of Pali Proper Names' in which Prof. Malalasekera writes of what the Mahavamsa says about Anuradhapura. “ Pandukabhaya beautified the city with the artificial lakes Jayavapi and Abhayavapi. It was round the last-named lake that the king laid out the city, including four suburbs, a cemetery, special villages for huntsmen and scavengers, temples...and residences for engineers and other officials. Abodes were also provided for devotees of various sects...there were also hospitals and lying-in-homes.”
Prof. Disanayaka concludes his introduction with the reminder that the modern city of Anuradhapura is divided into two: the Sacred City and the New Town. “The Sacred City includes the so-called 'A ta mas ta na' (The Eight Sacred Sites) and I su ru mu ni Temple, the subject matter of this book.”
Sites you would expect to read about— the six stupas, the sacred tree, the chapter house, and the Tissa vava —are here, as well as plenty of surprises, such as the description about the sculpture of a royal family (where King Dutu Gemunu meets his son in the presence of his wife and Asokamala), the Goldfish Park (where Duttagamini's only son Prince Saliya met the untouchable woman Asokamala and renounced the throne out of love for her), or the Mystic Diagram (could this be the first map of the universe?); less obvious artifacts that, together with the more well-known sites, collectively tell the story of our first kings and queens, prince and princesses, and the glory of the city they helped build.
From Thuparama to Lankarama to the arch of the Dragon to the Footprints of the Buddha to the sculpture of elephants playing in water to the stone sculptures of mythical beings and comical figures, 'Isurumuni Rock Temple' is guaranteed to take you on a fascinating journey through the first royal capital of our nation’s history. Sharing the inside stories of a kingdom that saw the rise and fall of 113 kings as well as illustrating the recent developments (the stone Buddha image now plastered in gold, the Buddha images in the new shrine), Professor Disanayaka with photo artist Panduka de Silva leaves no stone unturned. Exploring the ancient sites of Anuradhapura by connecting places, people, and events of the past he weaves a national narrative that is often surprising, sometimes sad, but always engaging.
A one-of-a-kind guide to the most important cultural and historic sites in Anuradhapura, 'Isurumuni Rock Temple' is guaranteed to fascinate, educate, and entertain both the rationalists and the dreamers.
By the time you reach the last page of the book you will realize what Harry Williams wrote in his ' Ceylon, Pearl of the East', about the temple at Isurumuniya is perfectly true. Here is a place that 'reeks of romance and of the past, with that particular atmosphere which clings to the rocks and caves and calls to something atavistic in the most prosaic of men.”
Thank you, Prof Disanayaka for preserving the romance in spite of the logical arguments that surrounds ancient Anuradhapura through this book, for bringing the ancient capital to us in such a way that we see it as a place that is comfortably familiar and intriguingly exotic.
