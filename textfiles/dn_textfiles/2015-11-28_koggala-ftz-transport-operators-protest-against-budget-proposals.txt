Koggala FTZ transport operators protest against Budget Proposals

 
Transport operators of the Koggala Free Trade Zone in Ahangama, Galle demonstrated in front of the main entrance to the FTZ on Tuesday (24),
protesting the increase on the annual Vehicle Emission Testing and vehicle registration, as envisioned in the Budget proposals for 2106.
Carrying placards, cutouts and black flags, the FTZ transport operators conducted their demonstration for over two hours.
As they encroached on the Colombo- Matara Highway, they were advised by the Police not to to obstruct traffic causing inconvenience to the public, to which they complied, climbing thereafter atop a bus.
They said they were prepared to launch island wide protests if their demands were not met.
