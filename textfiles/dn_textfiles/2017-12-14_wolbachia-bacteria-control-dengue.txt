Wolbachia bacteria to control dengue?

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is to submit a Cabinet paper to use the Wolbachia bacteria to control dengue, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the Australian Government will provide AUS $ one million for the pilot project to be implemented with the approval of the National Committee of Experts for Biodiversity, attached to the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry.
The Monash University of Australia will provide technical assistance to carry out a field study in selected areas in Sri Lanka.
Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil and Colombia successfully use Wolbachia-infected Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes to control dengue. The Wolbachia bacteria naturally live in bodies of over 60 insects including mosquitoes, he said.
When dengue mosquitoes are infected with the Wolbachia bacteria, the dengue virus does not develop inside their bodies up to the level of spreading it, he added. A total of 177,000 dengue patients and around 400 dengue deaths were reported during this year which is the highest recorded.
Minister Senaratne has instructed to implement a mosquito control programme before commencing the new school term on January 2, he added.
