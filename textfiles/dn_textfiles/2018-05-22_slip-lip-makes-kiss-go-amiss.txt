A slip of the  lip makes  the kiss  go amiss!

A kiss is a lovely trick, designed by nature, to stop words when speech becomes superfluous. - Ingrid Bergmen
No! No! No! I am not referring to Ms. Bergman’s witty analogy of a passionate ‘smackeroo.’ What I really want to focus on is the problem of the forced social norm of cheek kissing as a greeting. A smooch on the cheek, when executed properly is usually between family, friends, relatives or couples that have been together a long time.
Also, grandmas and aunts like this kind of buss which is a form of filial affection. Ok, but when is a kiss not technically a kiss? That is when two people lean in close near each other’s face and make a kissing noise but don’t actually make contact. This is reserved for annoying friends and acquaintances considered too gross to greet with a smack on the cheek.
And when we kiss someone from above such as kissing their forehead - it’s a symbol for patronage and protection. That’s why we can see it in situations where one side comforts and supports the other. Very much like a parent soothing a distressed child.
The whole thing can be deucedly awkward for the uninitiated. It occurs mostly when one person swings his or her head then tries to anticipate the reaction. The next step is crucial because one has to carefully lean in and execute a kiss on the perfect spot of the cheek.
And remember it should be not too near the eye, ear or nose by being careful to signal this is not a romantic advance. But accidents can happen especially when one will misidentify which cheek the other is heading for and oops! There will bound to be a near kiss on the kisser.
It can happen to us all, this type of uncoordinated misconnection. And sometimes you can be quite lucky when the kiss goes awry and you start puckering your lips while you kiss thin air. That’s what is known as the accidental kiss and miss.
My childhood friend Malka explains with clarity what happened to her once when this guy tried to kiss her cheek. “I offered him my cheek but we went in opposite directions and Blamo!” Actually you can avoid this type of mishap by moving your face far to the side signifying a kiss on the cheek. But make sure you avoid the face collision which is also in the family of the accidental kiss, only this smooch is intended.
The collision kiss happens when one or both of the people miscalculate the angle and noses collide or you get a jaw in your eye socket or teeth clack together like Spanish castanets. Whatever face parts manage to get in the way, this kiss is never fun. It can even be painful. There is another type of accidental kiss I shall describe. It relates to this exasperating Asian journalist named Sammy Jacks about who I once wrote an entire column which was neither flattering nor charitable.
Agreed, Sammy used to enjoy his tipple in excess. He now confines his drinks to a modest couple following a monumental binge in which he made a proper jackass of himself. Sammy was so sloshed that he lost his bearings while seated on a barstool in the Hong Kong Press club between a hulking bald-headed male New Zealand editor and a comely woman feature writer he fancied.
Completely sloshed and disorientated, he stood tiptoe on the bar foot-rail and planted a wet, frothy smooch on the bald napper of the male editor. Which simply goes prove that when you are off target, a miss is as good as a mister?
A former British colleague, Tom Kennedy once described an accidental buss with his characteristic wit and elegant prose: “I was at a wedding reception when a woman with whom I had a very friendly but entirely platonic relationship leaned in to kiss me on the cheek. I zigged when I should have zagged and we smacked right on the lips.
In our mutual awkwardness, and without a word, we tried again to get it right. This time I zagged when I should have zigged. Awkwardness increased tenfold. This was in front of a significant crowd comprising lots or friends. Of course, I should have said something cool like, “I’m sorry, that was unintended and completely my fault.”
We have ceremonial kisses, affectionate kisses, clumsy off target air kisses, Judas kisses, kisses of death and at least in fairytales, pecks that revive princesses. And talking of princesses here’s another fascinating yarn from Tom who had worked on several British newspapers and spun this yarn which he had actually chronicled for his newspaper.
It was about Britain’s most blue-blooded male and the late Princess Diana on the brink of the royal marriage breakup. To keep up pretences at a fundraiser Charles moved in to plant a seemingly affectionate kiss on his wife’s cheek.
Diana was having none of it. She made a point of ducking her head away at the last moment, leaving Charles to land the awkward ‘smackeroo’ somewhere behind the Princess’s ear.
But when she handed an award to Charles he committed yet another inexplicable faux pas — and forgot to kiss her. When he attempted to make up for the painful gaffe, returning to kiss Diana on the cheek, the Princess chose that moment to take her public revenge, leaving Prince Charles hanging with his puckered lips in the air.
And there was my good pal Dommie who always tried to curry favour with his affluent grandmother.
He never failed to pay her a birthday and Christmas visit. But he was so excited in her presence that he threw his arms around like a twirling windmill while approaching her with his falsetto voice hitting the high Cs. Screeching “Graneeeeee” he would begin his greeting smooches about six feet away all blowing fruitlessly in the air until he finally hit cheek target.
His siblings and cousins whispered that Dommie appeared to be playing Russian roulette with the family matriarch while firing more than a dozen kiss and miss blanks before finally scoring a single bull’s-eye.
