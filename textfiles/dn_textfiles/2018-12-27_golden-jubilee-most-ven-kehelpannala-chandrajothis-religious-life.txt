Golden jubilee of most Ven. Kehelpannala  Chandrajothi's religious life

Usually villagers belong to a temple offer ‘dhaney’ to the monks. But this is something very unusual. Most Ven. Kehelpannala  Chandrajothi, the incumbent Monk of the historical Gaewatta  Nagagiri, purana vihara invited the pregnant mothers to the temple and  they came in a very beautiful  procession to the temple. Once they are at the temple premises, this Buddhist Monk distribute healthy food items to them all, chant the Angulimala piritha, tie the “pirith noola” in the form of a blessing. The Ven. Monk has been performing this pinkama – meritorious act, for a number of years. This year was the ninth year, a very rear event with full of meaning. This year the pinkama was organized to mark the golden Jubilee -50-years of his religious life.
