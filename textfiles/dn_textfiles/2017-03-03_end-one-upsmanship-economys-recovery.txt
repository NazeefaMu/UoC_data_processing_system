'End One-Upsmanship  for economy's  recovery'

Sri Lanka's political leadership has to get real by making every effort to put an end to One-Upsmanship in order to get the economy out of its mess, KPMG Managing Partner Riyaz Mihular said.
Speaking at a conference on capital markets 2017 held in Colombo, he stressed that government must govern rather than doing businesses while creating a conductive environment for the private sector to take off.
He however noted the government has been successful in managing the activities of both Customs and Inland Revenue Department which has led to an increase in revenue collection. Noting that New Customs Act , amendments to Inland revenue Act and the proposed credit guarantee scheme are good measures that need to be seen through, he further added the both political parties should come to a consensus when it comes to implementing these proposals to achieve set economic targets,.
“The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's economic policies have widely been acclaimed by both home and home, the vision has been solid; but , it is a question of implementation.”
While apprising the government efforts to promote Public Private Partnership ( PPP) projects in Sri Lanka, Mihular said that PPPs would be an effective way in which Sri Lanka could leverage on its asset base using the private sector management.
