Jumbo menace in East

Damage due to wild elephants' is on the rise in the Eastern Province. They are invading interior villages in search of food and water.
Earlier, elephants were entering the villages only during the night, but now, they are entering these villages even during the day. Officials have noticed that wild elephants have found their way into interior villages of the Ampara, Batticaloa, and Trincomalee districts.
Residents are in a state of fear. Last week, a house in the Iqbal Nagar 30 housing scheme at Thoppur, in the Trincomalee district, was destroyed by an elephant. Some villagers leave their villages to spend the night elsewhere.
People light and throw crackers to chase the wild elephants. Elephants had entered the premises of a farmer and caused damages to paddy bags stocked in his veranda, household goods, the parapet wall, etc.
Wild elephants also damaged standing paddy crops in fields, home gardens and other arable crops (highland crops). As a result, the daily income of the rural community has also been considerably reduced.
In order to chase these wild elephants out of the residential areas, villagers have resorted to setting fire to various parts of the village. Males stay on watch during the night whilst females stay on watch during the day.
As a result, the livelihood of the people is affected. These activities of wild elephants have considerably increased in the recent past, and parents complain that the education of their children are badly affected due to it.
