Sangakkara hits eighth ton of season

LONDON: Kumar Sangakkara continued his remarkable form with an eighth County Championship century of the season for Surrey against relegation rivals Somerset.
Sangakkara hit 119 not out as his side ended day two on 328-6, a lead of 59.
The Sri Lankan, 39, now has eight centuries and three half-centuries from his 13 innings this season and tons in his last two innings.
Mark Stoneman (51) and Ollie Pope (50) also hit half-centuries, while Peter Trego took 4-53 at The Oval.
Trego had Stoneman caught behind and dismissed Rory Burns (43), Ben Foakes (23) and Sam Curran (17), but Sangakkara's innings means the visitors are facing a large first-innings deficit.
Sangakkara is set to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the season but averages 124.45 and is Division One's leading run-scorer with 1,369 runs.
His 189-ball knock against Somerset has included 15 fours and a six, and has helped Surrey collect three batting bonus points from the five available so far.
Somerset started the match sixth, 13 points behind third-placed Surrey, but both sides are one of five that could join Warwickshire in being relegated from Division One.
New champions Essex were bowled out for just 76 by Hampshire but fared better after following on at the Ageas Bowl.
Essex were 33-5 overnight and Hampshire chose to make them bat again after the efforts of Kyle Abbott (6-20) gave the hosts a first-innings lead of 178. The visitors' total was the second-lowest in the Championship this season.
Second time around, Dan Lawrence (78 not out) and Ravi Bopara (52 not out) added 127 together as Essex reached 208-3 at the close, leading by 30.
Hampshire began the penultimate round of fixtures fourth in Division One and only 12 points above the relegation zone, although any fears of them dropping into the second tier are likely to disappear if they can inflict a first loss of the season on Essex.
South African pace bowler Abbott reached 50 Championship wickets this season with his two scalps late on day one and he added four more to his tally on the second morning, including Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner, both trapped lbw in successive balls.
By then Essex had avoided the potential ignominy of posting the lowest total in this season's competition, passing Gloucestershire's 61 all out against Kent at Canterbury in April.
Relegation-threatened Yorkshire just missed out on a third batting bonus point, but still gained a first-innings lead over Warwickshire at Headingley.
The Tykes, who began the game one point clear of the bottom two, looked in further bother when, despite Adam Lyth's 62, they slumped to 179-6.
But Tim Bresnan (47) and Matthew Fisher (37) helped them reach 296 - a lead of 77 over the already relegated Warwickshire.
The visitors then closed on 49-1, with debutant Liam Banks unbeaten on 22.
Lancashire seamer Tom Bailey claimed match-figures of 10-98 as the Red Rose county were left a target of 221 to beat relegation-threatened Middlesex.
On a second day which saw 16 wickets fall at Lord's, the visitors lost their lower order quickly to be bowled out for 165 in their first innings. But Bailey's second-innings' 5-44 helped skittle Middlesex for 152 with only Sam Robson (58) resisting.
Lancashire reached 46-1 at stumps, needing another 175 for victory.
Middlesex will be without England paceman Toby Roland-Jones for the rest of the game after he pulled up with a back injury on Tuesday. But their first-innings score of 233 remains the highest in the match and the surface has provided plenty of assistance to the seamers.
Middlesex, the 2016 county champions, started this penultimate round of fixtures in a five-way battle to avoid relegation from Division One and would have been hopeful of setting a bigger target for their opponents.
Northants all-rounder Rory Kleinveldt took a career-best 9-65 to give his side an excellent chance of victory in their game against Nottinghamshire.
In a match Northants need to win to stay in the promotion hunt, Kleinveldt took the remaining five Notts wickets on day two to bowl them out for 151.
Richard Levi then smashed 115 as Northants made 270 in their second innings with Ben Duckett unable to bat.
Set a target of 314 for victory, Notts reached 33-2 at the close of play.
A fine innings of 96 not out from stand-in opener Benny Howell helped Gloucestershire to a solid 161-1 in reply to Glamorgan's 442 all out.
Kiran Carlson, 19, was last out for 191, falling just short of becoming Glamorgan's youngest-ever double-centurion. But Howell made the most of a flat pitch as he moved smoothly within six runs of a career-best score. Bad light halted play at 16:15 BST, cutting 25 overs from the second day.
Graham Clark's unbeaten 73 ensured Durham closed just 25 runs behind Sussex on day two at Chester-le-Street.
Tom Latham (77) and Cameron Steel (73) also hit half-centuries but both fell to seamer Ollie Robinson (4-69) as Sussex took four wickets in the afternoon session. Clarke and Carse were unbeaten when bad light stopped play with Durham 321-6.
