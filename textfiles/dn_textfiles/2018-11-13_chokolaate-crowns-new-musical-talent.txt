Chokolaate crowns new musical talent

The most sought after teen magazine in Sri Lanka Chokolaate for the third consecutive year created a platform for young musical talent to emerge through Centerstage 2018. After grueling semi-finals in four categories, namely Solo Singing, Group Singing, Band and the latest Beat-Boxing category, the Grand Finale was held on October 26 at the Bishops College Auditorium.
An eminent panel of judges including Lelum Rathnayake, Yashan De Silva, Naresh Sathasivam, Kumudini David, Suresh De Silva and Azlan Sheriffdeen selected the top spots of the four categories while the Most Popular Performer was picked by audience voting.
Shenuka Gunatilleke sang his way to solo glory with a fine rendition of Josh Groban’s You Raise Me Up. Cousins Malithra and Oshara won the Group category while a young but extremely talented band JukeBox walked away with the top prize in the band category. The inaugural beat box champion was Allister Abeywardene.
Centerstage 2018 was supported by Urban Records (Official Record Label Partner), AOD (Official Design Engagement Partner), Radicalz (Official Video Production Partner), RevPort (Official Online Media Partner), Pulse (Official Lifestyle Partner), Art TV (Official TV Partner), Dynamic AV (Official Sounds and Lights), AD Solutions (Out of Home Advertising Partner), Salon Naturals (Official Hair and Make Up) and Nehemiah Consultants (Official PR Partner). This year’s Official Radio Station was Sun FM.
