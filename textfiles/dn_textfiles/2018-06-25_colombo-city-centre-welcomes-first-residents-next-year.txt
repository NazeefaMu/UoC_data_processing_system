Colombo City Centre welcomes first residents next year

Colombo City Centre is rapidly taking shape as an ultramodern vertical neighbourhood that is set to welcome its first residents next year.
“It is all coming together beautifully,” said Anand Sundaram, CEO of Colombo City Centre. “Our construction, design, and development partners all share the same vision, to redefine luxury living in the capital with the Residences at Colombo City Centre and they are doing a fantastic job at it.”
With over 60% of units sold, The Residences at Colombo City Centre have already been established as a popular future home for a number of Sri Lankan professionals living both locally and abroad.
The 2-bedroom apartments, 3-bedroom townhouse style residences and 4 or 5-room penthouses only begin from the 18th floor, guaranteeing panoramic views from every unit, and also feature a private elevator to the lower floors where Sri Lanka’s first international shopping mall is set to open in August 2018.
A highly anticipated addition to the capital’s fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is Sri Lanka’s first BOI-approved mixed development project, slated for completion in early 2019.
The USD 175 million joint venture between local retail giant, Abans and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign direct investments in recent times and rises 47-storeys above the heart of the city.
Honored as the ‘Most Promising Mixed Use Development’ by CMO Asia, ‘Asia’s Greatest Brand’ by Asia One Magazine and ‘Upcoming Mall of the Year’ among several other accolades by the Golden Globe Tigers, Colombo City Centre is a multi award-winning skyscraper dedicated towards transforming Sri Lanka’s capital into a global metropolis with the first integrated lifestyle complex of its kind.
