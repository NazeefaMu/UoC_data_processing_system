China-SL project to end CKDu launched

The construction of a state-of-the-art water testing laboratory will begin tomorrow at the Peradeniya University premises as a China-Sri Lanka joint project to finding a scientific solution to the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDu).
The USD 20-million project is carried out with a Chinese grant of Rs. 1,950 million and a Rs. 880 million contribution from the Sri Lankan Government.
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem said the ‘China Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology’ would be the largest drinking water testing laboratory in South Asia.
He was addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department, yesterday.
The University of Peradeniya, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry are partners of the project, which includes a 5,000 square metre building with advanced technology. The project is expected to be completed by May 2020.
The minister said the project grant was a result of President Maithripala Sirisena’s visit to China in 2015.
The minister said the water testing laboratory together with the fully-fledged Nephrology Hospital in Polonnaruwa, being built with another Chinese grant, would help to deliver the President’s pre-election pledge to fight CKDu.
Chinese Academy of Sciences Vice President Hou Jianguo said this project is the first China-aided project in the field of science and technology in Sri Lanka.
The project construction was undertaken by China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (CTCE).
Responding to a question by a journalist, the minister said the Cabinet decided to set up a separate authority to protect the country’s water resources.
“At present, water bodies come under various institutions such as the Forest Conservation Department, Wildlife Department, Mahaweli Development Authority, Irrigation Department and National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
As the responsibilities are shared, the task has become difficult.
The new authority will act as the central body to protect the water resources,” said the minister. Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake, Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka Commercial Counselor Yang Zuoyuan and CTCE Board Chairman Zhang Hechuan were also present.
