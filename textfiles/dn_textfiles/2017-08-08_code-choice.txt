Code of choice

The freedom of association for purposes or objects which are lawful is an aspect of pluralism which underpins the concept of democracy. It is natural that in labour relations in a pluralistic society, collective bargaining is recognized as a fundamental tool through which stability is maintained while the freedom of association is the sine qua non because without the right of association, the interest group in a society – employees and employers – cannot function efficiently.
Among the basic principles of the International Labour Code are the freedom of association and collective bargaining in the conduct of industrial relations. The freedom of association is of little procedural value unless there is a concomitant right to act collectively. Therefore, the link between ILO Conventions Nos. 87 and 98 to which Sri Lanka is a signatory above key Conventions is a substantial one. The study noted that restrictions exist in the Trade Unions Ordinance regarding membership and other rights to federate.
Social justice and human rights
Social justice and human rights are intimately connected. Without human rights guaranteed by civil liberties, social rights have no meaning. Political freedom, civil liberties, social justice and cultural vitality are the mutual complementary expression of the freedom of human spirit. Freedom of Association provides the fundamental ground for the formation of any kind of organisation with lawful objects. The recognition of this right under the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka authorizes for the formation of non-governmental organisations and trade unions under the basic law of the country.
The present Constitution of 1978 deals with the right to freedom of association more explicitly. The following guarantees relevant to this freedom receiving specific mention are as follows:
(a) Freedom from Torture, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment (Article 11);
(b) Prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, language, caste, sex, place of birth, political opinion or anyone of such grounds (Article 12 (2));
(c) Freedom from arrest, custody, detention and personal liberty, the deprivation of which shall be only in accordance with established legal procedure (Article 13); and
(d) Freedom of speech, the expression including publication, the freedom of peaceful assembly, the freedom of association, the freedom to form and join a trade union and the freedom of movement (Article 14).
These rights are however, subject to restrictions prescribed by law in the interests of national security, public order, the protection of public health or morality, or for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others, or meeting the just requirements of the general welfare of a democratic society (Article 15(7)). The use of the word ‘law’ includes regulations relating to public security. Freedom of Association is subject to restrictions prescribed by law in the interests of racial and religious harmony or national economy. Article 15(4)). Exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine a question relating to the infringement or imminent infringement of a fundamental right is vested in the Supreme Court (Article 17, Article 118 (b) and 126(1)). The 1978 Constitution also states that the freedom of speech, expression, peaceful assembly, association and the right to join a trade union shall, in respect of the armed forces, police and other forces charged with the maintenance of public order, be subject to such restrictions as may be prescribed by law in the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them. (Article 15(8)).
The Scope of the Fundamental Rights is guaranteed by Article 14(1) (c) and (d).
Fundamental rights
The Courts in Sri Lanka have defined, clarified, and extended the application of those fundamental rights in various decisions handed down from time to time. In De Alwis v. Attorney General, the petitioner, the Secretary of the relevant trade union, disputed his transfer on the ground that it was to discourage the trade union work of petitioner, and alleged a violation of his fundamental right to association under Article 14(1)(d). It was submitted on behalf of the State that Article 14(1)(d) only guaranteed the freedom to form and join a trade union and that as the petitioner did not complain that he had been prevented from joining a trade union, there was no infringement of his fundamental right. Tambiah J. held that:
“Article 14(1)(d) should not be read so narrowly and literally, and if [this] narrow interpretation is accepted, the enshrined fundamental right would remain an empty right. The words “form” and “join” must refer not only to the initial commencement of the Trade Union and the initial admission to membership but also to the continuance of the Trade Union and membership. The right ….. also carries with it the concomitant right to freely engage in lawful Trade Union activity. If a Trade Union member or official is penalized or victimised for indulging in legitimate Trade Union activity, he would be entitled to complain to this court that his fundamental right under Article 14(1) (d) has been violated”.
In Wijeratne v. AG, where the petitioners complained that the Police had seized posters (containing demands, inter alia, for salary increases and permanency of employment), which had been prepared by members of a trade union for a picketing campaign, the Supreme Court held that:
“The planned protest was clearly not a hasty, strident, over-reaction to a trifling or transient grievance, but a patient, subdued and dignified plea to the conscience of the community for a living wage……[The Petitioner’s] freedom of speech and expression was violated by the seizure of his posters….. by preventing the non-violent demonstration, his freedom of peaceful assembly was infringed; and since that protest and assembly was a legitimate activity of a lawful association ….. his freedom of association was also impaired…..”
