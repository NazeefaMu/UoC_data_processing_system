GMOA request President’s final resolution on SAITM issue

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President requesting him to offer the final solution for the SAITM issue based on the five proposals presented to him by the Deans of state medical faculties with the consent of the other stake holders, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo today he said that in the letter sent to the President, the GMOA wished him strength and courage to offer a real solution based on the five proposals.
‘The entire country is eagerly waiting for the final solution for the SAITM issue promised by the President last week’, he said.
According to Dr. Aluthge, recently Maha Nayaka Theras of the three Chapters sent a letter to the President stating the same fact which is the requirement to find a final acceptable solution for the SAITM considering the five proposals presented by the Deans of state Medical Faculties.
‘The GMOA mentioned this fact in the letter’, he said.                
All previous efforts made by the President to solve the SAITM issue with the consent of all parties failed because of the pressures put on him by the Health Minister, Higher Education Minister and few other persons.
The entire country knows this fact. The GMOA included this fact in the letter sent to the President, he added.
 Federation of Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations, Sri Lanka (FFMTA) has also sent a letter to the President requesting him to seek the final solution for the SAITM issue based on the five proposals given to him by the Deans of the State Medical Faculties.
