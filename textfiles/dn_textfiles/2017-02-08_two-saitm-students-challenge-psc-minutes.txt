Two SAITM students challenge PSC Minutes

A Fundamental Rights petition filed by two students of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) including a student who was recommended by the University Grants Commission, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Higher Education Minister for an award of full scholarship to follow an MBBS Degree programme with the SAITM for achieving three grade ‘A’s at the G.C.E. A/L examination was yesterday fixed for support on March 27 by the Supreme Court.
The two students are seeking a declaration to null and void a Medical Service Minute issued dated 11/10/2014 by the Public Service Commission recommending that only graduates of state universities and foreign universities are eligible to join the government service.
The first petitioner W.K. Dilshan Sampath stated that he completed the G.C.E. A/L examination in August 2011 as a student of Ananda Maha Vidyalaya, Colombo 10 achieving three grade ‘A’s. In September 2011, the petitioner participated in the Sri Lanka Biology Olympiad 2011 conducted by the Institute of Biology Sri Lanka and was awarded the Silver Medal and performance certificate for achieving a Grade A result at that competition. The first petitioner was recommended by the UGC and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for an award of full scholarship to follow an MBBS Degree programme with the SAITM for the March 2013 intake.
The second petitioner H.K.Thushani Charitha stated that she completed her G.C.E. A/L examination in 2007 as a student of Devi Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo achieving three Grade ‘B’s and she was enrolled as a student of the first batch at the SAITM.The petitioners cited the Higher Education Minister, Higher Education Ministry Secretary, University Grant Commission, Public Service Commission, Attorney General and several others as respondents.The petitioners stated that by restricting the qualifications for Medical Officers to holders of degrees of state or foreign universities, the Medical Service Minute has excluded graduates from degree awarding institutes from being eligible to be recruited as medical officers. The petitioners stated that consequently, the petitioners do not have any prospects of being eligible to be recruited as Medical Officers.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Upaly Abeyratne fixed the matter for support on March 27.
President’s Counsel Faiz Mustapha appeared for the petitioners. Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appeared for the Attorney General.
