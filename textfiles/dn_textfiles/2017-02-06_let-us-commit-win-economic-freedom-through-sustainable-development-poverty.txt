Let us commit to win economic freedom through sustainable development, poverty alleviation: President

President Maithripala Sirisena called upon all sections of the society to work with determination and commitment to win economic freedom through achieving the goal of sustainable development and poverty alleviation.
“This goal will be achieved through the commitment of intellectuals, the strength of the labour force of workers and peasants, active participation of the youth of the nation as well as efficient utilisation of innovative human resource force,” the President said.
Addressing the nation on the 69th Independence Anniversary at the Galle Face on Saturday, the President said economic freedom could be achieved through a knowledge based economy with innovative technical skills development.
He pointed out that the nation had the capacity and strength of skilled human resources and intellectuals as well as resourceful young generations to carry out such development endeavours.
The President said that in the 21st Century, the nation's need knowledge based education, knowledge economy, innovative economy, digital economy and in this process the youths should play a pivotal role. Stating that the youth of Sri Lanka has the determination and desire for absorbing new technology and innovative skills, he said the government would provide all requirements essential for the youths to obtain that knowledge.
“The young generation are the inheritors and custodians of the building process of the knowledge based economy. I trust that the youths, intellectuals, politicians and all other sections of society would fulfill their responsibilities and duties with absolute commitment and determination to build the Motherland,” President Sirisena said.
He said there is a new meaning in today’s freedom as we are talking about a freedom that blows freely across the skies.
“This is an era in which the human freedom, media freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of thought and freedom to assemble, freely blow across the skies.”
The President, pointing out that there are strengths and weaknesses in social democracy and market economy, said we should understand those strengths and weaknesses to adopt a mixed system by obtaining positive segments of both the systems.
He emphasised the imperative need for eliminating corruption, bribery, malpractices, waste and fraud and said it is essential for the politicians and public servants to work honestly and with commitment.
“When we attempt to achieve economic prosperity, it is essential for the politician to be a character of honesty and commitment. Furthermore, I trust the politicians and public servants to fulfill the responsibilities and duties honestly and with commitment to build the Motherland”.
The President recalled the sacrifices made by all the communities to gain independence during various struggles from 1505 to 1948.
“We have to remember that sweet fragrance of their great sacrifices with gratitude today. During the 30-year old conflict to liberate the country from the LTTE, the heroic soldiers made many sacrifices. Hundreds of thousands people sacrificed lives and limbs and their families also suffered immense difficulties. The economy was ruined. Today we have to ask the question whether all those who died were the losers and all those who are living are the victors? I believe that all of us should learn a lesson from that,” he said.
The President pointed out that the government’s endeavour for reconciliation and communal harmony has been praised locally as well as internationally.
He said that he considers the opportunistic forces that are against reconciliation process as the forces against the country.
President Sirisena called upon everybody to fulfill the responsibilities and duties to build a nation which is economically prosperous, fortified in knowledge and maintains international goodwill.
