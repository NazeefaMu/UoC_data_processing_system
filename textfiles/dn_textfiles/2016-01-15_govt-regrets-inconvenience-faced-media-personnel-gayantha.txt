Embilipitiya incident
Govt regrets inconvenience faced by media personnel - Gayantha

The government regrets over the inconveniences faced by the media personnel who went to court to report the Embilipitiya incident, Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
He said that he contacted Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake over the phone and inquired about the incident. Karunathilake said following an inquiry he would reveal the developments about the incident. He made this observation yesterday at the cabinet briefing at the Information Department auditorium.
Minister Karunathilake said that media personnel have been issued a separate media identity card by the Information Department to create an environment for them to render their service to the society without any trouble. The minister said he learnt that there was no such a notice preventing the media personnel covering the proceedings.
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that action will also be taken against several police officers of the Embilipitiya Police who were involved in the incident that resulted in the death to a youth on January 4.
Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the Attorney General would request the Chief Justice to hold a Trial-at-Bar into the Vidya's murder in Kytes and added that it was what President Maithripala Sirisena promised to the parents of Vidya.
