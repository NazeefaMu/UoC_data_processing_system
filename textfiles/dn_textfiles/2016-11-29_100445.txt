“Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them has had the biggest UK box office opening weekend of the year so far.
The film took a total of £15.3m. It is the third highest opening weekend from the JK Rowling series, behind the two final Harry Potter films. Warner Bros executive Josh Berger said: “We are thrilled with the huge response from British and Irish audiences.”
The film also worked its magic at North American cinemas, taking an estimated $75m (£61m) over the weekend - more than the rest of the US box office top 10 combined.” -BBC News.
Bustling 1920s New York is gorgeously realized by a judicious teaming of regular Potter designer Stuart Craig and urban dystopia specialist James Hambridge (Hellboy, The Dark Knight), while four-time Potter director David Yates transitions effortlessly from Hogwarts to the wider world, thanks in part to a deft screenplay by JK Rowling. – The Guardian
‘The new movie Fantastic Beastsand Whereto Find Them is the first full-length Harry Potter franchise story that leaves behind childhood adventure and teen angst, and expressly deals with adult characters living in an adult world.” – The Verge
“This time the wizarding world isn’t about a boy on the verge of manhood, but a man idling in boyhood.” – The New York Times
Comments on Rotten Tomatoes website: “Yates has fresh tricks up his sleeve as he preps for four more planned films. Five years after the last Potter movie, his 20-something fans can age alongside wizards and witches again. It’s Purely Magical.”
“It is always a pleasure to return to this universe full of wonders and fantastic beings conceived by J. K. Rowling, dazzles us once again with her usual astonishing imagination and a delightful adventure that also works as another intelligent allegory about prejudice and acceptance.”
For those who orbited in Harry Potter Universe it definitely is a must watch.
