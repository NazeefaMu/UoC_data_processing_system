Enchanting Devians

The theatrical fairytale which portrayed a young girl overcoming a cursed spell in order to save her true love with her will-power and inner strength,"Ella Disenchanted" was staged by students of theSenior and Junior English Literary Associations (ELA) of Devi BalikaVidyalaya, Colombo on 12th February at BMICH auditorium.
Ella Disenchanted is an English drama featured by the ELA of Devi BalikaVidyalaya which was staged for the first time in 2008, then directed by the veteran theatre personality Dr. Gamini Haththotuwegama.
After eight years of silence the drama was re-produced by ELA under the guidance of NirmalaKaluarachchi, the teacher-in-charge and also assisted by the past drama crews of the school.
The drama was re-directed by the young drama director and fashion designer, Mr. VishanGunawaradena, to adapt to the modern theatre with the exemplary message, 'what's inside you is stronger than any spell.' Helping handswere also given by Javin Thomas in production, Shehan Wijayamanna in Voice Training and Ms. ShalaAmarasuriya in Choreography.
"The drama was excellent in whole and very much professional and mere performance wasbeyond the standards for their own age." said the veteran thespian, director and producer Namel Weeramuni who attended as the chief guest at the audience.
"The play was very nicely directed. It had the touch of professionalism to a great extent. The blockings/positioning of the actors were in excellent status. The use of music,dancing, sounds, lighting, setting up etc., were intact. I never felt bored for a single second during the play. The cast was very well drilled and trained," added Weeramuni. "I would suggest the drama to perform again for the public as I can highly recommend it," he further said.
The drama portrayed a great success due to the joint commitment of the entire student cast, who took part by practicing every day and trained especially on every holiday from morning till late night, and also because ofthe support and guidance given by the principal, teachers and the parents of the children.
