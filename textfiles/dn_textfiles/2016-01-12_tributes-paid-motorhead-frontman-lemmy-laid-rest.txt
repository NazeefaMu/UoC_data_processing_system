Tributes paid as Motorhead frontman Lemmy laid to rest

 
Dave Grohl and Slash from Guns N' Roses were among those paying tribute to Motorhead frontman Lemmy at his funeral in Los Angeles on Saturday (09Jan16).
The Brit rocker died at the age of 70 on 28 December last year (15), just two days after discovering he had an aggressive form of cancer. Lemmy, real name Ian Fraser Kilmister, died while sitting with his family in front of his favourite computer game, BBC News report.
Motorhead's manager Todd Singerman said that at the time of his death, Lemmy had cancer in his brain and neck, and his sudden death was "a massive shock".

The funeral service at Forest Lawn Memorial Cemetery began with an introduction by Todd, and a photograph of the band was on display at the chapel, alongside a set of speakers, Lemmy's boots and an urn shaped like the rocker's brimmed hat.
"He was one of the last true rock stars left, this guy lived it every day," Todd said. "He was one of the kindest men I ever met - he was the people's man."
Lemmy's son Paul Inder praised his father as a "stage warrior" and a free spirit, and added, "Travel well, my dear father. You are back out on the road for a longest tour to the great gig in the sky."
Slash told the rocker's family and friends gathered in the chapel, "Lemmy was somebody I just feel so honoured to have been friends with. He lived his life the way he wanted to... his music and personality will last forever."
Foo Fighters frontman Dave gave an emotional speech at the end of the service, during which he recalled meeting the rocker for the first time more than 20 years ago. He described Lemmy as his "hero", and "the one true rock 'n' roller".
Then Lemmy's bass guitar was plugged into a set of amplifiers and the volume turned right up, leading the congregation to stand up and applause as the feedback from the speakers filled the room.
Robert Trujillo and Lars Ulrich from Metallica, Judas Priest singer Rob Halford and Anthrax frontman Scott Ian also paid tribute to the rocker during the service, while Ozzy Osbourne, Queen's Brian May and Kiss star Gene Simmons were among the mourners in the star-studded congregation. Music-News
