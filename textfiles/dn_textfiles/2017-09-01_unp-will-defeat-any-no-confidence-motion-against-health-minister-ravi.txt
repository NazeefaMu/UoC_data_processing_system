UNP will defeat any no confidence motion against Health Minister: Ravi Karunanayake

 
Former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the UNP will defeat any no confidence motion presented in Parliament against Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne by a two thirds vote.
He said this at a ceremony held to hand over a clean drinking water supply project to Anuradhapura yesterday.
MP Karunnayake also said that it is important to note that the Joint Opposition has resolved to bring a no confidence motion against a Minister who has brought down the price of drugs and medical equipment.
“When we are making a change in the country, some parties cannot stand it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s creative development plan has expedited our economic growth. Some who cannot stand this rapid development process are attempting to hinder it many ways.” MP Karunanayake said.
MP Karunanayake said their dedication is towards the country and for the good governance for which he gave up his post.
“Who dared to bring this no confidence motion against the Health Minister? One of the MPs who have resolved to draft the no confidence motion has paid Rs. 500 million for his divorce case. Another has two passports. No confidence motions have turn into a joke now,” he said.
