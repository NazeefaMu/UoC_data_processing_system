Boost your face value!

Nothing is more annoying than finding blackheads dotting your face, putting a damper on your dream to achieve bright and glowing skin. And the more you clear them, the more they reappear. No matter how well you take care of your skin, they just show up sometimes - usually at the worst possible time. If you’re finally ready to rid yourself of this pesky little black dots, be sure to keep on reading.
Blackheads symptoms
Blackheads are small bumps that appear on your skin due to clogged hair follicles. These bumps are called blackheads because the surface looks dark or black. Blackheads are a mild type of acne that usually forms on the face, but they can also appear on other parts of the body.

Different causes of blackheads
Blackheads form when a clog or plug develops in the opening of hair follicles in your skin. Each follicle contains one hair and a sebaceous gland that produces oil. This oil, called sebum, helps keep your skin soft. Dead skin cells and oils collect in the opening to the skin follicle, producing a bump called a comedo. If the skin over the bump stays closed, the bump is called a whitehead. When the skin over the bump opens, exposure to the air causes it to look black and a blackhead forms.
Defining comedones
Skin comedones are not a fun problem to deal with. These little bumps that are so common in teenagers and people with oily, acne-prone skin can be a source of annoyance for anyone who wants a smooth, healthy looking complexion.

Comedones are another term for whiteheads and blackheads. Blackheads are referred to as open comedones, and whiteheads are called closed comedones. Comedones arise when pores become blocked with an oily substance called sebum -a sticky substance produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin.
Dark spots on nose
Black pores, or comedones, form when dust and debris embed into openings in the skin that excrete oil. The discoloration is the result of dark matter trapped near the surface of the clog, giving the pore a blackish appearance, or blackhead. Remove the blackheads on your nose of blackheads by using a number of cleansing steps to loosen the clog and clear the pore. Once the pores clear, you can take steps to keep them from clogging again.
Different causes of whiteheads
Although they may look different, pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads are all a result of clogged pores. To understand what a pimple is, you need to understand the difference between whiteheads and blackheads. If that pore is completely clogged and remains closed at the surface, it’s what we call a whitehead.
Whiteheads are known as closed comedones. The follicles beneath your skin become filled with bacteria and have a very small opening at the top of your skin. Air isn’t able to enter the follicle. The bacteria inside of it doesn’t undergo a chemical reaction, so it stays white in colour. This type of acne is also found on your back, shoulders, and face.

Blackheads turning into pimples
In reality, acne has nothing to do with dirt, and trying to scrub blackheads away could actually turn them into whiteheads. Blackheads are just open pores that are clogged with excess skin oil, also called sebum, and dead skin cells. Unlike popping a pimple, popping a blackhead really can make acne worse.
Getting rid of blackheads
To get rid of blackheads for good, you need to prevent them from forming. One of the biggest pore-clogging culprits is sleeping in your makeup. Stock up on cleansing oil, to wash away makeup residue, gunk, and grime.
Tea tree oil touts antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties that make it savior for unblocking sebaceous glands, combating breakouts, and banishing blackheads simultaneously.
While it’s certainly tempting to grab an extracting tool and magnifying mirror, and get up close and personal with your pores, resist the urge. Instead, schedule an appointment with a professional. Experts have the right tools and training to extract those pesky pore intruders without doing damage to your skin.
