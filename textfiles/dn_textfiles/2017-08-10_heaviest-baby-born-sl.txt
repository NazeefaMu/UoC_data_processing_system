Heaviest baby born in SL

A mother gave birth to a baby boy weighing five kilos and 700 grammes at the Maternity Ward of the Balapitiya Base hospital on August 8 afternoon, said Consultant Dr. Kapila Vithanachchi.
This is the heaviest newborn recorded in Sri Lanka so far.
The lucky mother is 28-year-old Nadeesha Nilmini, an employee at the Elpitiya SP's office.
Dr. Vithanachchi said when he examined the mother on admission to his ward, he noticed that she was carrying an unusual baby. As such, they kept her under close examination and made her deliver the baby in 38 weeks.
Nilmini, proudly gazing at her bundle of joy, said she got admitted to the Balapitiya Base hospital for her confinement with great confidence about its medical staff and facilities.
Expert care given by the medical team led by Dr. Vithanachchi enabled her to ensure a safe and perfect delivery.
