Chevron to produce Yamaha Genuine Oil

Chevron Lubricants Lanka announced a strategic partnership with Japan’s Yamaha Motor Company where Chevron will be producing Yamaha Genuine Oil under the brand “Yamalube” for the Sri Lankan market.
With similar arrangements in place between Yamaha Motor Company Japan and Chevron in various other markets, this represents a first for Sri Lanka where Yamalube 4 Stroke Motor Oil will be produced at the state of the art blending and manufacturing plant of Chevron Lubricants Lanka in Sapugaskanda.
Yamalube Oil is specifically meant for use in Yamaha Motor Cycles sold in the Sri Lankan market and is available in 2 viscosity grades of 10W-40 and 20W-40 conforming to API SL/JASO MA specifications.
Yamaha Motor Company officials Masakazu Suzuki and Mitsuru Masayasu were in Sri Lanka in 2016 for the audit of the Chevron Blending and Manufacturing Plant at Sapugaskanda and after an exhaustive check of systems and processes, cleared the plant as conforming to the high standards required by Yamaha Japan to manufacture their Genuine Oil.
“We are pleased to partner with Chevron Sri Lanka in introducing Yamaha Genuine Oils for Yamaha Motor Cycles in Sri Lanka, in the same way that we work with them in several other Regional markets” said Masakazu Suzuki, Manager – Yamalube Support Group, Overseas Marketing Division of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. Japan.
Kishu Gomes – Managing Director/CEO of Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC stated that the relatively new blending and manufacturing plant of Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC built with an investment of US$ 15 Million in 2014 has a capacity of more than double the total market potential of Sri Lanka and was therefore also meant to cater to the demand of regional markets. “Toll Blending for major OEMs such as Yamaha is therefore very much part of this vision” added Gomes.
