Applications called for hangman post

The Prison Department will soon call for applications for the post of hangman from the citizens of Sri Lanka as the Cabinet has given the nod to implement the death penalty for hardcore drug traffickers on death row.
Spokesman from the Prison Department said there are two vacancies for the post of hangman.
Meanwhile, the Prison Department has submitted the names of 18 drug traffickers including a woman on the death row to the Justice and Prison Reforms Ministry.
He further said the security inside the Prisons has strengthened to curb drug smuggling by convicted drug dealers.
The Department will also ban visitors from bringing outside food and other essential items to the inmates. This is to prevent visitors bringing narcotics and SIM cards inside food and other items like toothpaste and soups. If prisoner has to be supplied with outside food, the visitor will have to deposit money with the relevant prison office and then they will take steps to deliver food to required inmates.
The Department had also separated the convicted drug traffickers from other inmates to stop their supplies and connections with other prisoners. He added that the Department expects to commence an awareness programme to educate convicted drug traffickers about the harm of narcotics and discourage them from drug-trafficking.
