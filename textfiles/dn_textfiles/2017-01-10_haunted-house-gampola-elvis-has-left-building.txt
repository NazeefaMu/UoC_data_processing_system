Haunted house in Gampola: Elvis has left the building!

Police in Gampola are investigating reports of an apparent poltergeist fires in a house.
A father had reported to the police that mysterious and spontaneous fires have been springing up in their home, Gampola Police OIC Upali Senarath Yapa said yesterday.
The police recorded it under miscellaneous complaints and are looking into it, he said.
The house is in Umagiri Uyana area of the Gampola Atabage Gramaseva Division. The complainant, whose job is carpentry, lives there with his wife and two boys.
The fires mostly caught up the clothes of the children, he had told the police.
“There were some marks of fire inside the house,” Gampola Police MisceIleneous Unit OIC IP Gamanayaka said.
Our sources in Gampaha said several residents in the neighborhood told them they too have seen the fires appearing and smoldering the clothes lying around inside the house.
“The owner of the house said yesterday that he felt things were returning to normal after they had made a prayer to a certain devamaniyo,” IP Gamanayaka said. “That is what he believes, but the police cannot form any theories on that,” he said.
Our sources in Gampola said that the house owner is refusing to allow anyone inside the house to witness it or to make any photographs of the house on the advice of a voodoo doctor (kattadiya).
