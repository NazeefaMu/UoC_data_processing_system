‘FDI is increasingly active in SL construction sector’

Sri Lanka’s construction sector is increasingly played by foreign investments (FDI), rather than locally generated funds. The sector’s annual output value is now totalling to $3 Bn without even counting values of such mega projects as the Colombo Port City or Hambantota Port constructions, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
He was addressing the gathering at the launch of the seventh construction industry exhibition, ‘Construction Expo 2018’ held at BMICH on June 29.
“Sri Lankan construction sector has become increasingly responsive to our FDI flows,” the Minister said.
Sri Lanka’s premier construction exhibition brings together local, international suppliers and service organisations in the building, construction, engineering and architecture industries. It is a collaborative efforts of Lanka Exhibition and Conference Services (Pvt.) Limited and Ceylon Institute of Builders 9CIOB). It ends on July 1.“Green building” is a major theme at this year’s expo. Over 240 local and international vendors, including 20 Indian companies by the Export Promotion Council of India (at India Pavilion) and 30 Chinese firms in the Chinese pavilion (mostly from Liaoning Province- China’s industrial and steel province) are displaying a wide spectrum of construction products, services and information for the local construction sector.
A China Liaoning –Sri Lanka Business Forum was also held on the sidelines of the expo opening at BMICH on June 29.
Liaoning Province Commerce Department Section Chief Qyu Wanliang addressing the Forum said Sri Lanka is an important stopover of China’s One Belt One Road (OBOR) and an important trade partner of China. “Liaoning-Sri Lanka total trade in the first five months of this year was US $51 Million. Liaoning Province believes it has opportunities to partner with Sri Lanka’s economy which is growing steadily,” he said.
“Though Sri Lanka’s construction sector declined somewhat in the first three months of this year by 5 per cent, it still has an important place in our economy at 7.4 per cent in our GDP,” Minister Bathiudeen said
:“This is a larger share than our agricultural sector. More importantly this sector has increasingly become responsive to our FDI flows. The sector grew by 6.6 per cent in 2014 but thereafter, slowed down recently, syncing with somewhat weaker FDI inflow to Sri Lanka. The Construction Expo 2018 will therefore be a great step and in fact the much needed promotional effort that this sector urgently calls for. I commend the organisers and all the stakeholders for their commitment in highlighting our construction sector’s capacities to the international, local participants and visitors especially at a time when such an event is really needed to uplift it,” the Minister said.
Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIoB) President Dr. Rohan Karunarathna said the CIOB has given a new lease of life to the Sri Lanka construction sector. It has become very competitive due to foreign contractors. At present almost 40 per cent of Sri Lankan construction projects have been taken up by Chinese firms. The China International Contractors Association (CHINCA) is bidding and winning them. These projects are other projects apart from the Port City and the Hambantota Port area related projects. In the next three years, CHINCA wants to increase their stake in Sri Lankan construction industry to 70 per cent of total projects. This can be detrimental to our local firms. As a result, the Construction Chamber of Sri Lanka has signed an MoU with CHINCA to share all their projects here with Lankan construction firms, so that the risk is mitigated. We have also moved a cabinet paper-all such projects by foreign firms from any country should have a Sri Lankan partner from now on,” he said.
CIoB’s Dr. Karunarathna said the total output value of Sri Lankan construction industry in 2017 is now estimated at $3.03 Bn (SL Rs 480 Billion).
