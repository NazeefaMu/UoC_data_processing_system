Decades of wisdom

The 75th anniversary of the founding of Elpitiya Ananda Central College, the national school in the Southern part of the island, falls on March 24, 2017.
One of the significant events in British colonial Ceylon was the establishment of Ananda College, Colombo on November 1, 1886 by the Buddhist Theosophical Society. Elpitiya Ananda Central College was founded as a sister school in down south by the Buddhist Society, during the World War II after the Japanese dropped bombs in Colombo, on March 20 1942. Before that in January 1942 Ceylon was put on a war footing and Colombo city and the country had to be prepared for any contingency. Staff had to be quickly recruited, fire-fighting and emergency workers trained and equipped, and food provisions and distribution systems were established. Fire gaps, wardens’ posts, trenches, shelters and water tanks were constructed; buildings protected by sandbags, and emergency kitchens and hospitals had to be set up to prepare the city in the event of bombing.
On Sunday, April 5 1942, the attack on Sri Lanka (the then Ceylon) began. A fleet of Japanese aircraft raided Colombo, targeting the harbour and Ratmalana airport, followed by an attack on Trincomalee harbour. In both attacks, only a few ships were destroyed, and there were relatively few civilian casualties.
The attack on Colombo, which was short but intense, turned the city into a ghost town overnight. As soon as the raid ended, a procession of cars started moving out of Colombo by all the main roads.
Those who had bullock carts piled up their baggage, packed in their families, their worldly goods upon their heads. One-third of the population of Colombo left the city that day, some went back to their villages. The country would be kept on a war-footing for another three years until the Japanese were defeated in 1945.
As a result people who left the city needed to find a way to teach their children.
Some families settled for a short period around the Elpitiya, discussed with kind people living in the area and started a small education ‘hut.’
Great personalities
Finally it was established and situated in 11th mile post near the town. For the school a small bare land was given by Mr. Gunasekara.
Great personalities like Ven. Galuwamulle Rathanalankara Thera, S. T. Molligoda and Sembukutti Arachchige too contributed to this worthy cause. When the school was officially registered, there were only 20 students. W. Karunananda who worked in Ananda College, Colombo was appointed as the first principal. On March 30, 1955, the school was shifted to a more spacious premises at the heart of Elpitiya.
The school continued to progress with Principals such as W. Thambawita, P. Jinadasa and P. A. Somadasa who were well educated gurus in their time.
The College also became more active in national issues beyond education, a role it was to increasingly assume with the passage of time. Ananda Central College attracted an ever-expanding team of excellent teachers to add to its image. Most importantly Ananda produced a stream of educated Sri Lankans with national aspirations, proficient in local languages that went on to fill the various technical and intellectual positions in the country. Ananda Central College is a venerated national institution, with a hard-earned and unparalleled reputation among the vast majority of Sri Lankans for education and inculcation of national values.
