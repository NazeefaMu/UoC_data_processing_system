Lord Naseby urges West to support Sri Lanka

British Parliamentarian Lord Naseby in a convincing speech at the UK Parliament last Thursday, urged the West, and in particular the US and UK, to remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans and their leaders.
Taking part in a debate on Sri Lanka, Neseby at the outset reminded the House that he has known Sri Lanka for over 50 years and is the current President of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka which he initiated in 1975. His speech gave a vivid narration on the history of Sri Lanka from the time of colonization to the end of war in 2009.
“I hope and pray that as a result of this debate, UK will recognise the truth that no one in the Sri Lankan Government ever wanted to kill Tamil civilians. Furthermore, UK must now get the UN and the UNHCR in Geneva to accept a civilian casualty level of 7,000 to 8,000, not 40,000. On top of that, UK must recognise that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights,” he stressed.
“We in the UK should reflect on the sacrifices of thousands of young Sri Lankan soldiers who died to create peace in that country,” Naseby told the UK Parliament while adding that it was quite clear to him that the Sri Lankan Government was addressing all the issues raised in the UN resolution 30/1of 1 October 2015.
“What is not on track and needs urgent attention is the war crimes allegations hanging over the country. These flow from the Darusman report, which, on a best-guess basis, two years after the end of the war, stated, ‘there is still no reliable figure for civilian deaths’, but then guessed at 40,000. This figure is bandied about by virtually every human rights organisation and the thousands of Tamil diaspora throughout the world, many of whom were LTTE Tamil Tiger supporters and still are, inflamed by Tamil Net and those ghastly Channel 4 ‘Killing Fields’ films, which so influenced the previous Prime Minister,” he said.
“I reflect that Sri Lanka came to our need in two world wars and had casualties, and it was one of just a handful of countries who supported the UK over the Falklands. Now is the time to offer the hand of friendship and act to lead the international community to recognise what the truth really was,” Naseby said.
