Ahead of South African Test series
Karunaratne captains  ‘A’ team to Bangladesh  to regain match fitness

Sri Lanka’s regular Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne was made captain of the Sri Lanka ‘A’ team to tour Bangladesh to prepare himself to match fitness ahead of the two-Test series against South Africa starting on July 12.
The left-handed opener was one of the few batsmen to show consistency last year scoring over a 1000 Test runs for the calendar year. He has been ruled out of the ongoing Test series in the West Indies after fracturing his index finger in May. His place has been filled by another southpaw Kusal Perera.
Karunaratne although he is the captain it is learnt will play only in the first two 4-day unofficial tests against Bangladesh before the South African series.
All-rounder Dasun Shanaka has been given the responsibility of vice-captain. The month long Bangladesh tour which runs from June 23 to July 23 runs overlaps the South African Test series which is from July 12 to 24.
The second 4-day unofficial test ends on July 6 which gives Karunaratne ample time to prove to the selectors of his match fitness and form.
The Sri Lanka ‘A’ team also features Sadeera Samarawickrama, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dasun Shanaka, Lakshan Sandakan and Danushka Gunathilaka – all of whom have played Tests for Sri Lanka.
Fast bowler Shehan Madushanka who recovered from an injury has also been named in the squad.
Sri Lanka ‘A’ are due to play a series of three 4-day unofficial tests and three unofficial one-day internationals in Bangladesh.
The team is due to depart for Bangladesh on June 23.
