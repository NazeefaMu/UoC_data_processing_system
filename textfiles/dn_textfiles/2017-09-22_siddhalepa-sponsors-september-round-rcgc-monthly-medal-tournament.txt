Siddhalepa sponsors September round of RCGC Monthly Medal Tournament

Golfers participating in the September round of the Monthly Medal Tournament at the Royal Ceylon Golf Club (RCGC) discovered or rediscovered the healing touch of an authentic ayurveda therapy when the country’s leading ayurveda company, the Siddhalepa Group hosted the monthly medal tournament in September.
The monthly tournament held on the 8 and 9th September was a golden opportunity for the Company to introduce some of their signature ayurveda treatments and products to the golfing fraternity in a most effective and convincing manner.
All participants received a complimentary “Golf Booster” – a neck and shoulder massage quick treatment to loosen up before heading for the golf course.
The two day tournament ended with an awards presentation, where the company introduced an ayurveda style cocktail called ayur shooter. The company’s new drink AyurLive was also served during the tournament.
Siddhalepa Group sponsored all 15 trophies and medals awarded by their Chairman, Deshabandu, Dr. Victor Hettigoda and MD, Mr. Asoka Hettigoda.
While the winners also received vouchers for an all expense paid stay at the Group’s Ayurveda Resort in Wadduwa, all participants of the tournament received discount vouchers on Spa gifts packs.
The new partnership between two of the oldest establishments in Sri Lanka, is a unique way of promoting good health.
