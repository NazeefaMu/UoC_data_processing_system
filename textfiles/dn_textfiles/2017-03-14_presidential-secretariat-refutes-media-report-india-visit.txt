Presidential Secretariat refutes media report on India visit

The Presidential Secretariat yesterday refuted media reports that President Maithripala Sirisena was scheduled to participate in an international Buddhist Conclave organised by the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara in Bihar with Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama.
A Presidential Secretariat release said that the President is not scheduled to undertake any visit to India within the next few days.
“The news has been published in an English daily without getting it confirmed from the relevant parties,” the release said.
