England wins second Test and takes winning lead in series : Chandimal leads superb rearguard action with century

DURHAM: Dinesh Chandimal led a splendid rearguard action by Sri Lanka with his sixth Test century but could not prevent England from winning the second Test by nine wickets and taking a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series on the fourth day at Chester-le-Street here Monday.
Chandimal who was unbeaten on 54 the previous day went onto score a brilliant 126 off 207 balls (13 fours, 1 six) to take Sri Lanka to an impressive second innings total of 475 after being forced to follow-on 397 runs in arrears. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 101 in their first innings in reply to England’s 498-9 declared.
England left with 79 runs to chase scored 80 for one wicket with Alastair Cook finally reaching that elusive 10,000 runs mark to become the first Englishman to cross the figure in Test cricket.
Cook needing five runs to reach the milestone was unbeaten on 47 and Nick Compton was 22 not out when England finally achieved victory 42 minutes after tea in brilliant sunshine that gave way to chilly, overcast skies and strong winds at the start of play that saw play take place under floodlights.
However the day belonged to Chandimal who played a terrific innings to keep the England bowlers at bay. In Rangana Herath he found an able ally and the pair stayed together for over two hours as they forged a seventh wicket partnership of 116 off 170 balls.
Herath played some wonderful sweep shots and reverse sweeps as he made a plucky half century (61 off 99 balls with 8 fours). He received a standing ovation from the crowd when he was dismissed lbw to Jimmy Anderson to give the England spearhead his 450th Test wicket. It was Herath second fifty in Test cricket and the third occasion he had been involved in a rearguard century partnership.
The previous two instances – 115 for the eighth wicket with Lasith Malinga against India at Galle in 2010 and 149 with Angelo Mathews also for the eighth wicket against England at Leeds in 2014 both resulted in Sri Lanka winning. But unfortunately it was not to be the case here.
Sri Lanka starting the day at 309-5 lost Milinda Siriwardana as early as the fifth over of the day for 35 without adding to his overnight score. His dismissal by Anderson ended a 92-run stand for the sixth wicket with Chandimal.
England’s lack of a quality spinner in the side was exposed on this slow pitch which afforded turn when their seamers failed separate Chandimal and Herath for the next two hours or so.
Moeen Ali, more or less a part time spinner was hit for 136 runs for his solitary wicket.
Following Herath’s dismissal, Anderson picked up his 21st five-for in an innings when he bowled Shaminda Eranga for one.
Chandimal’s marvelous innings coming to an end in the first hour after lunch when he went for a big heave against Stuart Broad and had his off stump clipped. It was his sixth Test hundred, first against England and the first outside Asia.
Spurred by the heroics of Herath and Chandimal, the Lankan tail wagged with Suranga Lakmal (11) and Nuwan Pradeep (13 n.o.) adding a further 22 for the last wicket before Woakes ended it by having Lakmal caught by Broad at mid-on.
On the face of the stern resistance put up by the Lankan batsmen for the first time in the series England’s fielding began to falter as they missed both Chandimal and Herath to easy catches.
Wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow failed to hold onto an inside edge off Chandimal when he was 69 and Herath at 46 was dropped by James Vince at backward point – in both instances Anderson was the bowler.
With the partnership growing into threaten proportions England had to depend on their most experienced bowler for the breakthrough and did not fail them.
Anderson ended with figures of five 58 and with eight wickets in the match he is easily the leading bowler in the series with 18 wickets.
Sri Lanka lost 33 wickets in the series without a single 50-run partnership but they produced three for the last seven wickets. Sri Lanka took 128.2 overs for their entire second innings which was nearly 13 overs more than they had batted in their first three innings of the series.
Sri Lanka’s fabulous batting performance would certainly brought a great deal of confidence into the dressing room and made them all geared up for the third and final Test beginning in ten days from now at Lord’s.
Anderson was named Man of the Match.
