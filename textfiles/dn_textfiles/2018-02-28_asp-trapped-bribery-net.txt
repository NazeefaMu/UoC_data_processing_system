ASP TRAPPED IN BRIBERY NET

An Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) was arrested by the officers of the Bribery Commission around 9.00 am yesterday, while obtaining a bribe.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director, SSP Priyantha Chandrasiri said the suspect ASP had demanded a bribe of Rs. 40,000 initially to allow the operation of a brothel under the disguise of an ayurvedic massage parlour in the Wennappuwa area. However, the amount was subsequently negotiated to Rs. 30,000.
The ASP was nabbed by Bribery Commission officers when he was accepting the money last morning.
The arrested ASP was produced before the Negombo Magistrate yesterday.
