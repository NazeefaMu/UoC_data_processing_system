Sports Ministry orders fresh election for boxing

The Ministry of Sports has ordered the Boxing Association of Sri Lanka to hold fresh elections declaring the recently held election as null and void as the audited accounts had not been submitted at the AGM.
The Ministry has decided to issue a special gazette notification to cancel the list of office bearers elected at the AGM. The director of sports has been appointed as the Competent Authority to carry out the functions of the Association. All office bearers were elected uncontested at the recently held AGM. The election of office bearers of the Sri Lanka Badminton Association was also cancelled by Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera for the same reason and they are to be banned from contesting the new election of office bearers. The office bearers of the Boxing Association of Sri Lanka might also be banned from contesting for posts at the new election.
