Non-violence, compassion take centre stage in Poson

Poson message:
The visit of Arahat Mahinda to Sri Lanka heralded in a new chapter in the country’s history, with the hallowed principles of non-violence and compassion as enshrined in Buddhism, taking centre stage, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
It not only transformed the Sri Lankan way of life but also made a strong impact on our social discourse; agriculture, hydro civilisation, cultural pursuits and governance were some of the key areas that were influenced by Buddhist values and traditions.
Today, Sri Lanka is recognised as a strategic centre for Theravada Buddhism, the principles of which have been central to its people and their way of thinking. As a result, we have had the honour of hosting the International Vesak Festival and the International Buddhist Congress.
May the true doctrine of Buddhism, its compassion and non-violent principles encourage us to live in harmony and peaceful co-existance, while respecting other religions and other cultures.
This Poson, may we be able to set our hearts and minds to making such a vision a reality,the Premier said in his Poson message.
