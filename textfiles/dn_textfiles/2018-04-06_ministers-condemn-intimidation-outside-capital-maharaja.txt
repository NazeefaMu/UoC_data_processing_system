Ministers condemn intimidation outside Capital Maharaja

SLFP ministers yesterday unequivocally condemned the intimidation of employees at the Capital Maharaja Organisation on Wednesday night by a group of people carrying green flags.
Both Ministers Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa and Dilan Perera addressing two separate media briefings at SLFP Headquarters yesterday said Yahapalanaya promised media freedom and that should be ensured at all times.
“We ask that the UNPers restrain themselves, otherwise they are going to make the Prime Minister look bad in his victory”, Minsiter Soysa said.
A large gathering of people who had surrounded Capital Maharaja protested outside its gates and lit firecrackers before the police were sent in to control the situation.The government will not tolerate such actions and the President immediately despatched the STF for security, Soysa said.
“Many people and media organisations took various sides on the No Confidence Motion but that does not mean that they should be attacked for that”.
