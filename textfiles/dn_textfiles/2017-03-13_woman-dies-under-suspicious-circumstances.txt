Woman dies under suspicious circumstances

An investigation has been launched by the police into the suspicious death of a 25-year-old woman who is said to have died after receiving medication prior to a surgical intervention at a private hospital in the Katugastota area, Kandy.
The woman, a mother of three, had died after receiving medicines 30 minutes prior to the operation.
A tense situation prevailed in the area yesterday following the incident and later police took steps to provide security to the hospital.
Woman’s husband M.Irshad said his wife had a sudden illness on Saturday night, and she was taken to see a consultant doctor in Aniwatte.
The doctor who had obtained Rs.5000 as his fee had advised the patient be admitted to the hospital for surgery the next day.
Irshad said he had taken his wife to a private hospital in Mahiyyawa under the doctor’s advise and paid Rs.20,000 on admittance.
According to the consultant doctor, the woman was to be subjected to a small surgical intervention to relieve her condition. She had been given two medicines prior to surgery. The doctor also said the patient was directly taken to the operating theatre to minimise the expenses for her family. Police are investigating the incident.
