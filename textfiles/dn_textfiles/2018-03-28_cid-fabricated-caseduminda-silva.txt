CID fabricated case:Duminda Silva

Former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva’s lawyer yesterday informed Supreme Court that the Criminal Investigation Department (CIC) had fabricated a case against his client.
President’s Counsel Anil de Silva appearing for Duminda Silva who had been convicted of committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra made these remarks when the appeal filed by five accused including Duminda Silva challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court was taken up for argument.
The President’s Counsel stated that the omissions and contradictions of the evidence had not been taken into consideration by the High Court Trial-at-Bar.
He said the Trial-at-Bar bench had issued the judgment without considering defence’s version.
When the appeal came up before the five-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, further argument was fixed for May 8.
Five accused including former Defence Ministry Monitoring MP Duminda Silva who were sentenced to death by Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra had filed appeal petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the judgment of Colombo High Court.
At a previous occasion, Duminda Silva, the eleventh accused in the murder case filed an acceleration petition in the Supreme Court requesting that the hearing on the appeal be accelerated on medical grounds.
Through his appeal, Duminda Silva stated that he was seeking the jurisdiction of Supreme Court to review and set aside their conviction and the death sentence imposed by High Court on September 8, 2015.
Five accused including former MP Duminda Silva were on September 8, 2015 sentenced to death by Colombo High Court for committing the murder of four persons including former MP Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra on October 8, 2011. However, the verdict was divided two to one with judges Pathmini N. Ranawaka and M.C.B.S. Morais finding five accused guilty for ten charges including committing and conspiring to commit murder of four people while Justice Shiran Gunaratne the President of Colombo High Court Trial-at-Bar found the thirteen accused not guilty of all seventeen charges.
The five-judge Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Prasanna Jayawardena, Justice Nalin Perera and Justice Vijith Malalgoda.
