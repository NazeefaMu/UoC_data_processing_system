Illegal moonshine brewery raided

The Welipenna Police yesterday raided a warehouse which was running a mass scale illegal moonshine brewery. Two suspects have been arrested during the raid.
The police took into custody 1,800,000 ml goda and 18,750 ml moonshine at the place. They had been storing the illicit liquor in massive tanks used to store water.
The raid was conducted through information given to a Western Province Intelligence officer who in turn tipped off Welipenna Police station acting OIC, Police Inspector Damith Jayathilake and his team.
The team found the brewery being run in an abandoned plot of land in the Iththapana area in the Welipenna Police division.
A large tank of goda, seven iron barrels, copper funnels and equipment used to make moonshine and 25 bottles with moonshine from another place (28,750 ml) were apprehended.
The arrested suspects are expected to be produced before the courts.
