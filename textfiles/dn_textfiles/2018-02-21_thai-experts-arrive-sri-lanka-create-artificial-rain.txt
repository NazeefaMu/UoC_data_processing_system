Thai experts arrive in Sri Lanka to create artificial rain

 
A team of Thai experts arrived in Sri Lanka to look at the possibility of creating artificial rain in severe drought-affected areas of the island country, today. The group consisting of Thai engineers visited the Castelereagh and Maussakele Reservoirs in the catchment areas of the Central Highlands to seek the possibilities of creating artificial rain as water levels in these reservoirs had seen a drastic drop. Officials from the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry said that the team also planned to visit the main Victoria, Randenigala and Kotmale reservoirs. Local media reports said the Thai engineers represent the only company in the world that has the patent to create artificial rain. The company had created artificial rain when the island country was severely affected by a drought in 1981. Hundreds of families remain affected by months of severe drought due to the lack of rains and delayed monsoonal rains in the central parts of Sri Lanka.
