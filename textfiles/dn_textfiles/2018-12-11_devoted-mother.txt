A.D.N. Lelawathi
A devoted mother

Our mother passed away 16 yeas ago on December 13, 2002, having lived up to the age of 92.
She was the mother of three sons, two daughters, three daughters-in-law and one son-in-law, as well as a grandmother of nine. She was an accomplished and gracious lady who helped those who sought her assistance—and was loved by all. She brought us up as useful citizens in society.
Our gratitude to her is beyond all boundaries and today we pay homage with Mathupadan Namamahan.
She was the loving wife of A.D. Benjamin of Wadduwa, and as a devoted wife, she fulfilled all duties.
Their family life was excellent. She was a devout Buddhist and worked for the development of Sri Lankaramaya temple in Wadduwa.
She was a wonderful, devoted, loving and kind personality who endeavoured to keep everybody happy. She is immortalised in our memories as a source of pride to our family. She was a simple, unassuming, upright, calm and honest person. Aggression was never in her vocabulary; she was a a loving personality with a beautiful heart.
The flower blossoms and fades, the sun rises and descends; but the memories dignified and gracious deeds and accomplishments of our mother, would linger on never to fade away.
It is the fervent hope of all that her journey through Sansara be swift and short until she attains the Supreme Bliss of Nirvana.
