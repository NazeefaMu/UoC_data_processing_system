The day Ceylon became a republic

May 22 should be a solemnizing day to the nation’s history that was the day the Ceylon became independent Republic of Sri Lanka. Until then, the legal authority of the monarch controlled the governmental activities of the then Ceylon.
0n February 4, 1948, British Government transferred the power to newly dominion of Ceylon. The Governor of Ceylon Sir Andrew Caldecott sent good news to the Board of Ministers in May 1943 promising that a commission would be appointed to examine a complete constitutional scheme towards granting a fully responsible government to Ceylon.
The State Council headed by DS Senanayake drafted a constitutional scheme and presented to Governor on February 2, 1944. Based on that ministerial draft, the king in council approved the new constitution on May 15 in 1946. Afterwards Ceylon (Constitutional) order in Council 1946, Ceylon (Constitutional) (Amendment) order in Council 1947, Ceylon (Constitution) (Amendment No.2) Order in Council 1947, Ceylon (Constitution) (Amendment No.3) Order in Council 1947, presented to the UK Parliament and finally Ceylon Independence Order in Council 1947, was made by the king in order to remove the responsibility of UK Government which continued under Soulbury Constitution. This is how the Ceylon became to dominion status in 1948.
Since then Sri Lanka was a Commonwealth realm. The Office of the Governor also changed as Governor General until the Constitution of 1972 established on May 22, 1972. The Queen of England remained the nominal head of the executive.
New Constitution
The victory of united fronts in elections held in 1970 paved the path to the Republic Constitution of Sri Lanka. Prior to the election of 1970, the united front signed a “common programme”. The parties comprised were “the Lanka Samasamaja Party” (LSSP), and the “Communist Party”. The electoral mandate of the United Front in May 1970, was as follows,
“We seek your mandate to permit the members of parliament you elect to function simultaneously as a Constituent Assembly to draft, adopt and operate a new Constitution. This Constitution will declare Ceylon to be a free, sovereign and Independent Republic pledged to realize the objectives of a socialist democracy: and it will also secure fundamental rights and freedoms of all citizens.”
After coming to the power at the election, the united front introduced a bill of parliament to abolish the Senate. On October 2, 1971, the royal assent was received to the Ceylon (Constitution and Independent) Amendment Act o.36 of 191 and Senate was abolished after 23 years.
Dr. Colvin R de Silva, the mastermind of the1972 Constitution, described the process as “laying a new foundation for a new building, which people of this country could occupy”. (M J A Cooray (1982) Judicial Role under the Constitution of Ceylon/Sri Lanka)
The Constitutional Assembly drafted the Republican Constitution and promulgated on May 22, 1972. There were many debates regarding the legality of the Constitutional Assembly. In creating a home-grown constitution, countries have been followed by different types of tactics. As like those countries Sri Lanka also followed a unique way to draft the new republic constitution.
The members of the Constitutional Council were representatives of people. They met for the first time at “Navarangahala” not as the members of the house but as the representatives of the people summoned to draft and proclaim a constitution. At the first meeting, the Prime Minister said, “in the name of the people in Sri Lanka, I have called upon you as members of the House of Representatives to assemble here today….we have met in order to constitute, declare and proclaim ourselves the Constitutional Assembly of the people in Sri Lanka… to adopt, enact and establish a constitution”.
National State Assembly
The main components of the constitution were the National State Assembly, the President as nominal head and a Cabinet of ministers headed by the Prime Minister responsible to the National State Assembly. Willam Gopallawa served as the last Governor General of Ceylon and became the first non-executive President in Sri Lanka.
Two salient features underscore the transition from a dominion to a Republican Constitution namely the principle of autochthony and the doctrine of the supremacy of parliament (V K Nanayakkara, in search of a new Sri Lankan Constitution).
Section 3 of the Constitution stated that the Sovereignty of the Republic of Sri Lanka was in the people and was inalienable. Another important feature was the chapter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. Although there was no procedure for enforcement, a safeguard was the very first attempt at providing a wider and clearer Fundamental Rights Guarantee.
The chapter v of the Constitution mentions the objectives of the republic as safeguard the independence sovereignty, national unity, territorial integrity, and elimination of economic and social disparities and the democratization of the administration. Accordingly, objectives of the state policy are also included in the constitution.
The 1972 Republic Constitution of Sri Lanka is a constitution embodied the indigenous values of the country. Chapter II of the Constitution is headed as “Buddhism”. It states as “the Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the state to protect and foster Buddhism while assuring to all religions the rights granted by section 18(1) (d).” The idea of a secular state was abandoned by the 1972 Republican Constitution.
Therefore May 22 is a remarkable day for Sri Lankans. It should be understood that the way of being solely independent was a result of a long journey with many hazards.
