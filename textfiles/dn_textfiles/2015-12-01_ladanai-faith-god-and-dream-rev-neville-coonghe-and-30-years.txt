Ladanai: faith in God and dream of Rev. Neville Coonghe and 30 years on

Thirty years of dedicated service by a gentle missionary has brought Ladani to the threshold of the dawn of a new year, a new decade and the dawn of the years to come.
Given to reason Ladani is required to ponder and itself the question - which way forward? or should Ladani be obstinate and be in the disposition of his baser instincts to the easier passage of complacency and vaunt achievements.
The main Ladani Home in the
Diocese of Chilaw
 
It must be remembered that the first Ladani home founded in 1985, was established with meager resources and amidst many a challenging circumstance of that time.
It was a 'challenge of burden rather a burdening challenge', no ordinary man would have taken up - in those difficult times.
As succinctly put in the foreword, 'it is out of prophetic vision that someone would embark on work of this nature', the tribute and accolades go to Fr. Neville, for embarking on a project of this nature and magnitude and continuing to see it work for 30 long years, facing the trials and tribulation single handedly along the way.
In the process, seven Ladani Homes provide shelter, child-nutrition health-care, educational scholarship, education for all children and awareness programme for pre-school teachers and animated by a leadership of a Rev. Sister to run the Homes.
All these responsibilities upon Rev. Neville's shoulders are run smoothly because of his dedication not only to children but first to God.
It is a gigantic task he handles and believes that God is always there to provide him strength.
Fr. Neville's Ladani took upon itself the duty to protect, care and nurture these lost children and provide a decent future and admirably, he has done so.
The first Ladani Home was inaugurated on November 15, 1985. Ladani also acquiesces in the values embodied in the Universal Rights of Children as well as in other Charters pertinent to children.
Within this framework, Fr. Neville's dream has materialised. Ladani's footprints in the sands of time seems well embedded, and leaves him humble. It is with great contentment and humility that he reminisces in the work of the last 30 years. It was definitely a task that he embarked on, for the only reason that he believed in, that is this work was animated with Divine providence.
It was not simply the work to provide the necessities- shelter, clothing etc to the children who accosted Ladani. It was a work beyond the teachings. It was a manifestation of work Divine, it sometimes called on him to temper the hardest of hearts and the dreadful of men, it was like transforming the deserts into verdant fields.
He saw in his work, not only his God as commonly seen - as the most compassionate, but also beyond the interpretations written by scholars. He saw his God, as a Father beyond all these, he saw God animate himself in his work, and his work was an oblation.
Today, Ladani is an extended service of work to the children. It is sustained by well wishers of whom most are local donors from the middle income earning families, who have stood by us, in our endeavour; equally worthy of mention are foreign donors who have augmented the support to us in a considerable manner.
He holds with deep gratitude their contribution to this cause. Currently Ladani runs seven homes in number, and they are spread out in the island. Ladani incurs a large sum as expenditure on a daily basis for the benefit of its children. He believe this is possible only because of the transparency and commitment.
As for the orphans, he see them in anguish and despair. He see them as children, not only without love and care. He also see in them the lack of social values. Living with these children and inculcating in them the humane values have not been an easy task. At times his staff at Ladani, and his experienced failures in their system - to achieve their objectives, nevertheless they have striven to accomplish their mission - undeterred. In this 30th year, when He look back, he has the pleasure to say that Ladani has surmounted these impediments and seen great success by greater tolerance, confidence, wisdom and the steadfast belief in the Almighty, without which he will not be where we are today.
To this, he must also attribute that he had the good fortune to strengthen the operations at Ladani, by persuading the staff to espouse the value of mutual trust, confidence and unity. He take this opportunity to say that he can rely on his staff and they in turn have the assurance in his leadership. He has and pay deep gratitude to his staff and the management team of Ladani for their continued and able support.
At all times children are made to be mindful that every cent and item that is received as a contribution to Ladani is the produce of great sweat and toil of mind and body of donors. The privilege the children enjoy in our homes is considered 'Manna' from the Heaven, which has thus paved the way for Ladani and its children to endure this long and meaningful journey.
Man by nature has many a shortcoming, however normal it may be, it is yet odd; it is incumbent on any management to look for the pitfalls to avoid a calamity of events. It is with this responsibility that he harness the resources at Ladani to work at its optimum. He is happy he has had the blessings, and also the cooperation of every member of Ladani's administration in the last three decades to make what Ladani is today.
This is the beautiful story of LADANI and its founder, Rev.Fr. Don Neville Coonghe, a God-sent angel to children.
