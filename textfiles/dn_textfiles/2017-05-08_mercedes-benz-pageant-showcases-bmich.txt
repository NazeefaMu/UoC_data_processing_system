Mercedes-Benz  Pageant showcases at BMICH

Mercedes-Benz, a number one luxury car brand in the globe, celebrated its fellowship in Sri Lanka with the Mercedes-Benz Pageant, held from 7 am to 1 pm at the BMICH, on April 30.
This showcase event of Mercedes-Benz Sri Lanka created a new record with the participation of 753 three-pointed stars. This most probably is a record in this part of the region, if not in the world.
Organised by the Mercedes-Benz Club of Sri Lanka and sponsored by the only authorised distributor for Mercedes-Benz in Sri Lanka, DIMO, the Pageant was not the ordinary parade. For those who took part in the many fun activities in it, it became a veritable experience to be lived and relived through for days and months to come.
Mercedes-Benz owners from across the island arrived at the BMICH and were greeted with a commemorative mug, with their children being given a Mercedes-Benz cap to enrich their day away from home.
The cars, the showcase items in the Pageant, were meticulously displayed according to several categories. Those who came and enjoyed themselves at the Pageant managed to witness the evolution of intelligence in Mercedes-Benz, spanning pre-war era to the modern day latest models.
The Pageant was divided into three main halls - Hall A was dedicated to Mercedes-Benz, Hall B for Mercedes-Benz AMG, and Hall C for a Kids that kept the children engaged with fun and games.
Two discernible highlights of this year’s Pageant were the AMG line and the Vito Corner. Mercedes-Benz AMG, which has come to symbolise the blend of power and performance, celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year, with a range of F1 technology powered automobiles.
The Mercedes-Benz Vito, a powerhouse van that combines comfort and luxury, was featured in its own Vito Corner. This particular vehicle was branded with Shangri-La Hotel’s beautiful design.
With over 750 cars set down in various categories, the judges no doubt had a tough ride to get through before deciding on the winners, all of whom were lavishly recognised with awards and certificates.
The Mercedes-Benz Club of Sri Lanka is a veritable fellowship, comprising passionate fans and owners throughout the nation.
