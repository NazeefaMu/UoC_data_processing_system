Scouting the way forward

In 1917 the Vice Principal of Wesley College, Rev. Percy T. Cash M.A. B.Sc., who was acting for the principal introduced boy scouting to the school, and thus was founded the Wesley College Scout Troop which was registered as the 14th Colombo Scout Troop.
Rev. Cash served as the first Scout Master and was assisted by S. Wijesooriya, a Kings Scout from Galle who was the Instructor. That year the school had a collective strength of 64 Scouts forming nine patrols. The keenness of the scouts was amply demonstrated, as before long the troop produced five Kings Scouts.
It was in March 1918 that the Troop made its first public appearance, when they formed a Guard of honour to the Colonial Secretary, R. Edward Stubbs, who was Chief Guest at the college prize day that year. Another important event was the celebration of the Troop's anniversary on the July 25, 1918, with the Director of Education E. B. Denham declaring open the 14th Colombo Scout den and distributing badges to the scouts. At this event the Chief Guest was welcomed by the Deputy Colonial Scout Commissioner, Vernon Grenier and the Scout Master of Wesley, Rev. Percy T. Cash. The occasion was presided by the Principal, Rev. Henry Highfield who was back from furlough.
The name of J. E. de Silva a member of the tutorial staff is synonymous with scouting at Wesley. De Silva, who later became known to the Scout World as "Blue Feather” due to his dedication and keenness rested the 14th Colombo for over 20 years was a keen Scout Master.
B. R. Blaze was also a Scout Master in 1947 and 1948. The 14th Colombo also remembers with gratitude the untiring efforts of Rev. James Cartman, Wesley's vibrant Principal during the Second World War era.
J. E. de Silva too left Wesley in March 1949 and Shelton Peiris, a former Senior Prefect of Wesley took over as Scout Master at a time when the Troop was without a Staff Adviser and he had Edmund Dissanayake, yet another former Senior Prefect acting as his Assistant.
During this period the 14th Colombo also had I. G. K. Chandrasena, an old Wesleyite and Scout Field Commissioner amongst many other trained Scouters. In 1960 we had R E Abraham of the tutorial staff, and brother of former District Scout Commissioner Ratnam Abraham, as the Chief Scout Master.
In the Golden Jubilee year the 14th Colombo had eight representatives out of a total contingent of 28 representing the Colombo contingent at the Golden Jubilee jamboree 1962.
In 1963, the Cub Master E. L. Rodrigo of the tutorial staff stepped in to help the troop and was assisted by N.R. Dhanapala from Richmond College Galle who was also from the tutorial staff.
Towards the end of the 60’s decade and in 1970, the 14th Colombo was fortunate to obtain the services of George Peiris as Group Scout Master. He was a Head Quarters Commissioner. The College Chaplain, Rev. John Trevanna too was associated with the Scout troop during his tenure at Wesley in the early 70’s. It was in the 60’s decade that the 14th Colombo produced her last batch of Queen's Scouts that included Shanti Mclelland(Former Principal at Wesley), A. K. Nazimudeen and Rohana de Silva. After a brief lull in scouting activity, in October 1972 we saw a revival of the 14th Colombo Troop with A. H. G. Ameen, a past Scout from 28th Colombo -Don Bosco Scout troop taking over the reins as Group Scout Master. Ameen infused a spirit of activity. Investitures, Camps and Parents Day were a regular feature in the 14th Colombo calendar.
With Ameen moving out in 1974 Brig. Sarath Fernando, an old boy of Wesley who was an Instructor under the tutelage of Ameen became the Scout Master.
By 1976, once again the 14th Colombo was left without a Scout Master and it was during this period of time that the14th Colombo began building a very strong, independent and capable group of scouts. The troops Court of Honour at that time had the past District Commissioner, Riza Azoor as the Troop Leader together with Sharir Azoor and Elmo Jones as the senior patrol members whilst, Riya Azoor together with Shankar Ratnadurai, Ben Manickam, Nadarajah Logeswaran -the first President Scout produced by Wesley.
In 1978, having completed the initial Scout Leaders training course, the responsibility of guiding the troop fell on the hands of Riza Azoor. After a few years - 1982 to be precise, he was fortunate to obtain the services of his brother Riya Azoor who by then had completed his school career and had undergone initial training in scout leadership to help run the 14th Colombo. From the mid 1980’s, there have been many past 14th Colombo scouts lending their hand to support the Azoor brothers as Assistant Scout Masters and Instructors of the troop.
Wesley scouts have participated in international scout events and some of the many scouts who have attended international jamborees representing Sri Lanka from the 14th Colombo.
Traditions have been strongly observed and maintained over the years at the 14th Colombo, and without fail the scouts have provided their services year in, year out at the College Prize Day by according a Guard of Honour to the Chief Guest, and by providing first aid services during the college sports meet and by providing assistance in organizing and conducting the schools Founder Day program. The troop also carries out a service project at school to mark their Troop Founders Day.
Traditionally, the 14th Colombo undertakes 3 scout camps annually. A Group camp held over 3-4 nights, the senior troop ‘Adventure’ camp and the junior troop camp over a weekend usually undertaken towards the latter part of the year. Since the early 1980’s, the 14th Colombo troop has produced 35 President Scouts.
In conclusion it must be placed on record the encouragement, support and confidence provided by all the Principals who steered Wesley College from the 1917’s, particularly her current principal, Avanka Fernando and specially the Teacher in charge Shamalee Perera and the Scout leaders Deshaka Perera and Riza Azoor. At present there are 60 scouts with the six patrols named as King Fishers, Eagles, Leopards, Peacocks, Cheetahs and Wood peckers.
