A 50-year-old man, a resident of Tabbowa, Nattandiya, who tried to sexually abuse two underage boys by luring them into a forest in Galmuruwa, Madampe, was caught by a group of youth and handed over to Madampe Police. He was produced before the Chilaw Magistrate on Tuesday and remanded until September 7.

The boys are aged 12 and 6 years. The elder boy was admitted to Chilaw hospital for a medical examination.
Investigations are continuing.
