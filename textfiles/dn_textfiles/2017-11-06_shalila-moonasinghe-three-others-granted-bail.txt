Shalila Moonasinghe, three others granted bail

 
Four suspects including Litro Gas former Chairman Shalila Moonasinghe, who was arrested in connection with the alleged transferring of USD 1.1 million from Far Eastern International Bank of Taiwan to their personal account in Sri Lanka were ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Fort Magistrate, today.
 Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne ordered that the suspects be released on a cash bail of Rs.50,000 with three sureties of Rs.500,000 each. 
Meanwhile, the Magistrate issued an order directing the Controller General of Immigration and Emigration that four suspects be prevented from leaving the country.
 On October 6, the CID arrested the first suspect Janaka Chaminda Nammuni of Rajagiriya regarding the incident when he was attempting to withdraw Rs. 80 million from a local bank account.
The second suspect Shalila Moonasinghe was arrested on October 9, on the charge of misappropriating Rs.30 million.  
According to CID reports, the Far Eastern International Bank was hacked by means of a computer virus and some US$60 million was wired to the accounts of the suspects at a Sri Lanka bank in Colombo.
The CID initiated an investigation following a complaint made by Bank of Ceylon about this fraudulent money transaction on October 6.
The Taiwanese government had also taken a decision to send investigators to Sri Lanka to probe the cyber money heist.
Defence counsel Nalinda Indatissa appeared for the suspects.
