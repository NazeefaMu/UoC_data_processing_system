Asma Jehangir
An icon of courage and wisdom

The news of the passing away of Asma Jehangir in Lahore at the age of 66 came as a shock having got to know her in 1988 when she famously sent us a telegram asking for Election Observers for elections scheduled for the National Assembly after Gen Zia died in an air crash.
A towering figure
She was called to the Lahore High Court in 1980 and to the Supreme Court in 1982. She later went on to become the first woman to serve as president of the Supreme Court Bar Association. She became a pro-democracy activist and was jailed in 1983 for participating in the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, which agitated against military dictator Zia-ul-Haq’s regime. She was also active in the 2007 Lawyers’ Movement, for which she was put under house arrest.
She co-founded the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, and the Women’s Action Forum. She received several awards, including a Hilal-i-Imtiaz in 2010 and a Sitara-i-Imtiaz. She was also awarded a UNESCO/Bilbao Prize for the Promotion of a Culture of Human Rights and an Officier de la Légiond’honneur by France. She also received the 2014 Right Livelihood Award and the 2010 Freedom Award from the International Rescue Committee. The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Mian SaqibNisar, and other Supreme Court judges expressed deep sorrow and grief on her demise in a statement. The Pakistan Bar Council announced three days of mourning across the country.
We had known each other for close on three decades. She leaves behind a shocked group of colleagues at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. She followed in the footsteps of an equally famous mentor Dorab Framrose Patel lawmaker who served as a former Chief Justice of Supreme Court of Pakistan and former Chief Justice of Sindh High Court.
Justice Patel was a prominent campaigner for the human rights, and was a founding member of the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) in 1987 and the co-founder of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. A Parsee by faith, he rose up the ranks of the judiciary to become one of Pakistan’s most senior most judges, only to resign on principle after refusing to take an oath of allegiance to Chief Martial Law Administrator and Chief of Army Staff at that time, General Zia-ul-Haq in 1981. He was an acquaintance for whom I had the highest respect.
Much has been written and said about her. I could only add she knew no fear.
As a result of our association with Asma, a renaissance around Track two work in South Asia began. It led amongst others to work with I.K. Gujral.
The Gujral doctrine
The Gujral Doctrine is a set of five principles to guide the conduct of foreign relations with India’s immediate neighbours as spelt out by I.K. Gujral, first as India’s foreign minister and later as the prime minister. Among other factors, these five principles arise from the belief that India’s stature and strength cannot be divorced from the quality of its relations with its neighbours. These principles are: first, with neighbours like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, India does not ask for reciprocity, but gives and accommodates what it can in good faith and trust; second, no South Asian country should allow its territory to be used against the interest of another country of the region; third, no country should interfere in the internal affairs of another; fourth, all South Asian countries must respect each other’s territorial integrity and sovereignty; and, finally, they should settle all their disputes through peaceful bilateral negotiations.
According to Gujral, these five principles, scrupulously adhered to, would achieve a fundamental recasting of South Asia’s regional relationships, including the difficult relationship between India and Pakistan. Further, the implementation of these principles would generate a climate of close and mutually benign cooperation in the region, where the weight and size of India is regarded positively and as an asset by these countries.
Neem Rana initiative
Days after the Lahore Summit, in a modest hotel room in Delhi, unknown to anyone but their respective prime ministers, NiazNaik and R K Mishra conducted a dialogue on the Kashmir problem.
In 1997, Nawaz Sharif was elected prime minister on a platform that included a proposal to improve relations with India. In February 1998 behind closed doors, without the knowledge of their advisors or Foreign Offices, Vajpayee and Sharif were ironing out a daring initiative to tackle the thorniest issue of all: Kashmir. The two leaders agreed on three points: first, the status quo was inadequate and the Kashmir issue must be resolved; second, both sides must try to solve the problem by the end of the century (ie by 2000); and third, given the publicity glare of the press, especially considering the emotive nature of the Kashmir dispute, any preliminary negotiation must operate discreetly through quiet ‘back-channel’ diplomacy.
Based on the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo model of negotiations, the two prime ministers agreed to select one personal emissary each to meet on a one-on-one basis to solely negotiate on Kashmir.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee in early March, Vajpayee telephoned Sharif with his choice: R K Mishra, editorial board chairman of the Mumbai-based Observer group of newspapers. When Sharif’s first appointee – his principal secretary – passed away, the PM called upon a former diplomat outside his trusted circle: Niaz A. Naik a veteran diplomat and a leading player in various Track II initiatives.
In mid-March, Mishra arrived in Islamabad for an initial meeting with Sharif and Naik. Naik and Mishra agreed to meet in New Delhi for their first discussion on Kashmir.
On March 27, 1999, Naik traveled to Delhi as a private citizen and checked into a tourist hotel. There, he and Mishra met daily for several consecutive days in Naik’s hotel room. The two emissaries agreed on four initial elements: first, both would move beyond the rigid publicly stated government positions on Kashmir. Mishra would not refer to Kashmir as an integral part of India; Naik would not mouth Pakistan’s demand for a plebiscite based on the 1948 UN resolution.
Second, any solution had to be balanced and take into account the interests of India, Pakistan as well as that of the Kashmiri people.
Third, the solution had to be “just, equitable, feasible and implementable.” Finally, as per Mishra’s suggestion, it was decided that any solution had to be final, not partial. The mistake of the 1972 Simla Accord, which deferred a final settlement, would not be repeated.
The fourth clause ruled out all proposals that would place contentious regions under temporary UN trusteeship or joint Indo-Pakistani control for 5 to 10 years without a final plan.
Governed by these four elements, over the next few days, the duo discussed all possible solutions to the Kashmir dispute.
First, Mishra suggested the proposal common in Indian circles: to convert the Line of Control – which had been established by the 1972 Simla Accord that ended the third Indo-Pakistani war – into a permanent border. Naik predictably rejected the proposal. “It’s the status quo. Then why did we fight two wars?” Naik asked.
Communal factor
Second, Mishra suggested increased autonomy within Kashmir through fairer elections. “It won’t work. Elections are not a substitute for the Kashmiri demand for a plebiscite,” Naik countered.
In turn, Naik offered the Owen Dixon Plan, drawn up by UN mediator Owen Dixon in 1950, which recommended the redrawing of regions of the state as majority-Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim. “Why not use the same criteria of Partition to divide Kashmir?” Naik suggested. Mishra said India could not afford to introduce the communal factor, especially with the Hindu-nationalist BJP in power. “It will result in a blood bath,” he said.
Finally, both discussed the option championed by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, the original, secular organisation which had launched the Kashmiri secessionist movement in the late 1980s: an independent Kashmir. Both rejected the idea.
From there, Naik and Mishra rapidly went through the Indian journalist Kuldip Nayar’s proposal, the Finnish-Sweden model over a disputed island, the recent power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland, and other plans, without success. Discussions had reached a dead-end. Mishra reported to Vajpayee that all existing possibilities had been exhausted. “You are working on the right lines,” Vajpayee told Mishra, “Ask Mr. Naik to come up with a new initiative.”
Pressed to innovate, Naik proposed that the duo explore easily identifiable geographical boundaries as possibilities for establishing a new border. He suggested the Chenab River, which flows through southwestern Kashmir, as one potential new border. Mishra said he didn’t know the river’s location. Naik went down to the hotel lobby and bought a map.
Mishra still had many more questions about Naik’s proposal, especially regarding the percentages of Hindus and Muslims in the area. On April 1, the day Naik returned to Islamabad, Mishra asked his counterpart to send detailed, blown-up maps of the Chenab. He neither rejected nor accepted Naik’s proposal.
Days later, bunkers were spotted on the Indian side of the LoC. Soon, the Indian external affairs office discovered the surreptitious communications between Naik and Mishra. All through, only Naik, Mishra, Vajpayee and Sharif had known of the existence of these talks. The back-channel initiative on Kashmir – the first such exercise in recent history – had run dry. The two never discussed Kashmir again.
In the coming months, as the world’s two newest nuclear powers inched towards an all out war, Naik materialised in Delhi on several occasions, carrying messages from Sharif to Vajpayee. Naik traveled to Delhi for the last time on June 26, 1999. India had readied tanks along the border in Rajasthan and looked to be hunkering down for a protracted conflict.
“Things were really getting out of hand,” Naik said. Sharif had dispatched Naik with four points: first, restore sanctity of the LoC, second, cease all aerial bombing, third, reaffirm a commitment to the Lahore process, and fourth, take concrete steps to resolve all issues, including Kashmir, as agreed in Lahore. After a half hour meeting with Naik, Vajpayee agreed to all four points.
The next day, Sharif was set to fly to China in a last-ditch effort to shore up support for Pakistan’s flagging campaign. Naik had a plan: The Pakistani PM would fly over Indian airspace, and send a diplomatic greeting from the aircraft to the Indian PM. Vajpayee would reciprocate and invite Sharif to make a technical halt in Delhi on his flight back from China. The two would meet in Delhi, and jointly declare an agreement to end the conflict.
The two sides had agreed to exchange drafts by fax of the politically loaded salutations beforehand. That evening, Naik faxed a copy of what would have been Sharif’s airborne greeting to Vajpayee. But, Vajpayee’s invitation never came. Instead, the Indians sent back a fax of a ‘statement of war.’ The next day, Sharif’s flight never went over Indian airspace. The plan collapsed.
A little over a week later, Sharif travelled to Washington DC to sign a joint agreement with US President Bill Clinton. According to Naik, aside from one paragraph in which Clinton promised to take a personal interest in the sub-continental dispute, the Washington agreement mirrored the four points Vajpayee had accepted a week before.
We at present have no such vision to bind the region nor persons able to articulate and coax the region in to coming together as one.
