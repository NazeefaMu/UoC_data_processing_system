Asian Sevens Series Men’s Rugby Tournament - Hong Kong:
Sri Lanka makes four changes, Srinath Sooriyabandara to captain

Sri Lanka made four changes to their squad and appointed nippy utility three quarter Srinath Sooriyabandara to lead the team for the upcoming first leg of the Asian Sevens Series Men’s rugby tournament which will get underway on September 14 and 15 at the Hong Kong Football Club in Hong Kong.
Regular captain cum forward Sudarshana Muthuthanthri and former captain Danushka Ranjan have been ruled out due to a wrist dislocation and hamstring injury respectively. Forward Jason Dissanayake is reported to have opted to represent Kandy SC XVs team against Bahrain RFC in the West Asia Club championship to be held in UAE shortly and utility player Tarinda Ratwatte leaves for New Zealand for rugby training as well as to pursue higher studies.
It is learnt that the selectors have not considered the four players for selection hence replaced them with utility three quarter Kevin Dixon, speedster Naveen Henakankanamage, utility player Dinuk Amerasinghe and forward Adeesha Weeratunga.
In the first leg Sri Lanka has been drawn in Pool A, alongside Japan, China and Chinese Taipei while Pool B will feature Hong Kong, South Korea, Philippines and Malaysia.
