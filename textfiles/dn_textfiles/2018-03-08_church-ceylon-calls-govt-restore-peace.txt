Church of Ceylon calls on the Govt to restore peace

Presiding Bishop of the Church of Ceylon Rt Rev. Dhiloraj Canagasabey in a statement yesterday called on the government to take urgent steps to bring a halt to the criminal activities taking place in several parts of the country.
The Bishop of Colombo also urged the government to take stern actions against those who are involved in thuggery and violence .
“Those who suffered harm and damages must be compensated and minority groups reassured that they cannot be used as scapegoats and pushed to desperation”, Rt Rev. Dhiloraj Canagasabey said.
The full statement:
Barely had the nation recovered from the aftermath of the local government election, its political fall out and the confusion created, that violence broke out in two areas, Amapara and Digana, where from all accounts, personal disputes have been deliberately twisted to inflame hatred and violence against minorities, in this case the Muslim community.
Both incidents demonstrate how fragile inter-communal and inter- religious harmony is in this country and how little it takes for matters to spin out of control. The ugly pictures of rampaging mobs brandishing rods and poles setting fire to property and vehicles recalls to us the frightening images of the many riots that have torn this country apart and the irreparable damage it has caused our nation.
Social harmony is the bedrock on which all else is built. It is foolish to imagine that anyone gains by this kind of mob violence. It is the responsibility of all religious, community leaders and politicians to speak and act to ensure that we maintain understanding and peace amongst communities despite our differences.
The slow reaction of the authorities to the violence and arson is greatly disappointing. If there
has been lethargy, inaction or collusion at any level these must be investigated. The primary duty of any government is to ensure the public peace and come down strongly on anyone who attempts to take the law into their own hands.
I call on the government to take urgent steps to bring an immediate halt to these criminal acts and to take stringent action against all those who use thuggery and violence and who incite them, including those who use social media for this purpose. Those who suffered harm and damages must be compensated and minority groups reassured that they cannot be used as scapegoats and pushed to desperation.
