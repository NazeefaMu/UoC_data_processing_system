Chastain speaks up for women

Even in the year 2017, the representation of women in the films screened at a platform as reputed as the Cannes Film Festival is shockingly disturbing, and Jessica Chastain, who was one of the jury members at the festival did not hesitate to point it out. JustJared.com reports that during a press conference after the closing ceremony, the Oscar-nominated actress said, “This is the first time I watched 20 films in 10 days, and I love movies, and the one thing I really took away from this experience is how the world views women.
“It was quite disturbing to me, to be honest. There are some exceptions. For the most part, I was surprised with the representation of female characters on screen in these films,” she said and added, “I do hope that when we include more female storytellers, we will have more women that I recognize in my day-to-day life. Ones who are pro-active, have their own agencies, just don’t react to the men around them. They have their own point-of-view.” Notably, the Best Director award went to Sofia Coppola for the film Beguiled, which has a string cast of women. Agencies
