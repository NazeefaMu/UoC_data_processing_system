A show like no other

May 9, 1975 was a key day at the Navaragahala which accommodated an overflowing full house for the first ever solo concert by the singing heart throb of thousands, Milton Mallawarachchi. It was also simultaneously another grand first ever for the successful showbiz entrepreneur, Damayantha Kuruppu who organized and produced the show Super concert with Milton Mallawarachchi.
Milton Mallwaarachchi was accompanied by the ever popular Super Golden Chimes led by the late and great Clarence Wijewardena. Here began a friendship and relationship that created a bond between Clarence and Milton. Re-activating that bond and reflecting on that friendship and relationship, 43 years later, DK promotions will present "Super Concert 2018" at the BMICH at 7 pm on Saturday, August 4. This show will be like no other, as it lends itself with an aura to pay tribute to the memory of two unforgettable men of music, Clarence and Milton.
Annesley Malawana, the oldest surviving member of the Moonstones and the Super Golden Chimes, will lend his singing prowess to bring back memories of that musical genius, Clarence Wijewardana at this show which has been organised to coincide with Clarence's 75th birthday. Ranil Mallawarachchi is being specially flown out from Australia to hark back in time and to remember his father in his exclusive tone and tenor of song. It will indeed be an unforgettable evening. Indrani Perera will make her appearance as a special guest on this show for which the musical accompaniment will be provided by the Super Chimes.
The Compere will be the same as the one who was at the helm of the first 'Super concert' and who was mainly responsible for the formation of the musical careers of both Clarence and Milton, the evergreen legendary master with the microphone, Vijaya Corea. Tickets are naturally selling fast as everyone is longing to be there when this musical package is unwrapped.
