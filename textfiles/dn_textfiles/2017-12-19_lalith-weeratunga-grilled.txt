Lalith Weeratunga grilled

Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga was summoned to the Special Investigation Unit of Police yesterday morning to give a statement with regard to a misappropriation of state funds when purchasing six vehicles for the Presidential Secretariat.
Weeratunga was questioned for over four hours and a lengthy statement was recorded by the investigators, police sources said.
Investigations are on against Weeratunga for allegedly approving the purchase of seven vehicles at Rs. 8.3 million when the market value of them is only Rs. 4 million each.
