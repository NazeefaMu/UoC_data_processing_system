EWIS ranked as a Top 25 company by 'Great Place to Work 2017'

The EWIS Group was ranked for the third consecutive year as one of Sri Lanka’s 25 best companies to work for by the Great Place to Work Institute in partnership with the LMD and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
EWIS Information Systems, together with EWIS Peripherals collectively have over 400 employees who are driven by leadership, trust in their employers, show pride in their work and enjoy the camaraderie of their workplace.
“We are honoured to be ranked as ‘Best Places to Work,” said Chairman Sanjeewa Wickremanayake. “Despite being one of Sri Lanka’s largest and oldest IT companies, we consider each and every employee equally important to making us successful and strong. They are essential to the continued success of our customers and partners and we take great pride in cultivating an environment and culture for employees to thrive.”
Wickremanayake added, “In our company, many of the senior management are relatively young and they play a huge role in encouraging and empowering their staff and dedicate a lot of their time and effort in making their team members feel appreciated and happy.
These people understand how to get the best out of their teams and what needs to be done to motivate and incentivise their teams.”
The EWIS Group is a 30-year old organization providing products, services and solutions in diversified sectors including education, banking financial and insurance, public sector, telecommunications, utilities, healthcare and retail and manufacturing.
