Carrier Celebrates New Local Entity  in Sri Lanka

Carrier announced the grand opening of its new office and newly expanded product offering in Sri Lanka.
Leveraging global expertise and an extensive portfolio, this newly formed entity will increase the accessibility of Carrier staff and services and the availability of their end-to-end air conditioning solutions, enabling shorter lead times and better customer service.
“The key reason for opening an office in Sri Lanka was to be closer to our customers and offer them energy efficient air conditioning solutions from Carrier and Toshiba”, said Arun Bhatia, Managing Director, UTC Climate, Controls & Security, India Region. “Carrier’s philosophy over the years has been to offer the right heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) solutions”.
Carrier Aircon Lanka Pvt Ltd is a fully owned subsidiary of United Technologies International Corporation Asia Pte Limited. Carrier, a world leader in high-technology heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration solutions, is a part of UTC Climate, Controls & Security, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX).
“Carrier has been focused on Sri Lanka for some time and is now investing locally by launching full-fledged operations to serve its customers,” said Arun Bhatia, managing director, UTC Climate, Controls & Security, India Region. “Carrier’s philosophy over the years has been to offer the right heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) solutions for the right applications, which ensures that our customers benefit over the complete life cycle of our products.”
In Sri Lanka, Carrier will offer air conditioning products from two brands – Carrier and Toshiba, which operate through a joint venture. Carrier, the inventor of modern air conditioning, will bring world-class products, and Toshiba, the inventor of inverter air-conditioning technology, will offer top-of-the-line, high-quality products with Japanese technology. The products and service offerings are differentiated based on customer segments and needs with a complete range available for residential, light commercial and commercial applications. Both brands will cater to all customer segments including commercial buildings, hotels, hospitals, residential projects, small offices, banks and retail shops.
“We will offer top-of-the-line, superior quality products from Carrier and Toshiba in Sri Lanka,” said Farokh Madan, director, marketing, UTC Climate, Controls & Security, India. “All products will be fit for local use in Sri Lanka, while we bring Carrier’s global expertise in offering high-efficiency, advanced solutions for modern buildings.”
“Customer care is one of the core values of Carrier and will remain a focus in Sri Lanka,” said Aditya Bharadwaj, who is leading the Sri Lanka operations. “In particular, we will bring the latest technologies in connected services, where HVAC equipment is connected to command centres. In addition, with the use of data analytics, we will offer enhanced services, including prognostics, to deliver higher up time and energy optimization.” At Carrier, sustainability is a high priority and is incorporated into many of the products and services that will be available in Sri Lanka.
Whether it’s reducing greenhouse gas impact, leading the phase-out of ozone-depleting refrigerants or introducing many of the world’s most energy-efficient building solutions, Carrier has led and been a part of green building movements across the globe.
In fact, Carrier is the founding member of green building councils in countries across the world including the U.S., China, France, Argentina, India and Singapore, among others. On energy efficiency, the Company takes a holistic view, looking at building-level energy efficiency rather than just for our equipment itself. They also assist customers with existing buildings with old HVAC equipment by conducting detailed audits and suggesting interventions that can reduce energy consumption substantially.
“Energy needs will always be a problem for any country and hence it is important to move to new technologies like Invertors air conditioners and green buildings”, said Bhatia.
