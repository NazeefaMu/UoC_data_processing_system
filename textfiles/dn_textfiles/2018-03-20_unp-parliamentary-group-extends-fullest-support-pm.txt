UNP Parliamentary Group extends fullest support to PM

The United National Party (UNP) Parliamentary Group met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees yesterday and extended their fullest support to him to continue in his post.
The UNP Parliamentary Group during the meeting with the Prime Minister had said that if the Joint Opposition were to bring a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister in Parliament, they were prepared to defeat it.
“Apart from the 10 UNP Parliamentarians who are currently overseas on official visits, all other UNP Ministers and MP’s took part in the meeting,” a UNP member said.
The Premier had told the United National Party MP’s, as the JO has not brought a No-Confidence Motion in Parliament as yet, there was no need to get perturbed over it.
The MP’s had pointed out that in the event of the JO presenting a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister it should be debated at the earliest and defeated.
The UNP Parliamentary Group had also discussed about bringing necessary reforms to the party at the earliest.
