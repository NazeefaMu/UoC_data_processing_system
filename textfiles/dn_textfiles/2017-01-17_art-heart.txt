Art from the heart

One place, many perspectives - this is the vision behind Kala Pola which unfolds annually along the sidewalks of Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, Colombo 7.
This year marks the 24th edition of Sri Lanka’s renowned open-air art fair which will begin on January 22 at 8 am. Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson will be the Chief Guest at the event. Presented by The George Keyt Foundation in association with John Keells Group Kala Pola has become one of the most prominent events in the country’s art calendar in terms of celebrating art as well as drawing in tourists. Opening free of charge to its visitors Kala Pola sees gifted artistes from all over the island on one street displaying their talent to the world.
“I was there since the inception of the event in 1993. I believe that I got my big break then and I grew up as an artist with Kala Pola. We also got an opportunity to deal with foreigners face to face. We made many contacts and began a network. Such experiences are invaluable,” said Ramani Silva.
She notes that around 15 artists were given the chance to be a part of the first Kala Pola. Many of them still come to take part in this event each year.
“Though I do art in all types of media I specialize in oil paint. However there will be several water colour and line drawings at my stall at Kala Pola. Around 25 to 30 paintings will be on display. Most of them are landscapes,” she said.
Ramani says that she has seen the art fair growing from strength to strength each year.
“We did not even have a roof over our head when we started off in the maiden Kala Pola. Then we were given more and more facilities as the event became a success. We are given beautiful stalls now with other facilities. I got this opportunity through The George Keyt foundation,” she said.
Sameera Kalupahana has been a part of Kala Pola since 1997. Hailing from Beruwala he says that Kala Pola breaks the barriers for artists to approach the modern world.
“An open-air art fair was an unfamiliar concept for the public. Art used to be limited to places like the temples and shrine as well as inside buildings then. At times artists who have only inborn talent but no academic knowledge too is brought before the limelight through various means.
I believe that a certain academic knowledge matters to enhance the quality of the art. The situation is quite different now. More and more artists are seeking academic knowledge. It is the performance of the artists which are highlighted by the media but I believe that discussions are equally important. I see the modern face of Kala Pola as a step toward that direction,” he noted.
Sameera is a figurative artist. A member of Vibhavi Academy of Fine Art he says that his art is rooted in the realistic qualities of life. He is versed in many media but water colours are his favourite.
Janaki Nadeeshani is from Delgoda. She is a graduate of the University of Fine Arts. She specializes on sculptures and has her own art shop in her home town.
“I have made many contacts by taking part in Kala Pola. I will be presenting about seven sculptures at this year’s event. My art comprises portraits, traditional art and assemble art,” she said adding that sculptures can be done in clay, bronze, copper and metal.
Rasika de Silva is from Ambalangoda. He too has been a regular member of Kala Pola.
“This is the only event in which artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts get together. We can feast our eyes upon the art that artists have been doing throughout the year. Artists can also make a few bucks for their efforts at this event,” Rasika said.
He hopes to present around 25 paintings for the event under the theme of the battle between man and nature as well as the collusion between man and man. He has also displayed his work at eight solo exhibitions and 10 group exhibitions.
