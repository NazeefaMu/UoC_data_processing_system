Amaraweera dismisses allegations against him
‘Death threats  from gang of MPs’

UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said his life had been threatened by a gang of MPs who have been planning to tarnish his political image.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Amaraweera also denied that he sent a letter to Court requesting to reject the bail applications made by the suspects involved in the protest campaign against the Mattala Airport project.
He said he was the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and the Mahaweli Development State Minister and had no relation with the Mattala Airport controversy.
The minister added that the government would be taking effective measures to develop the 35,000-acre Mattala Airport with local or foreign investments and they have no intention to sell the airport.
He assured that he would be the first to stand against any arrangement to sell the airport.
The minister also said he would take legal action against false allegations.
“The report of the Presidential Commission to inquire into the Bond Scam would be produced before Court immediately as the sessions of the Commission concluded,” Amaraweera added.
The General Secretary said, “Plans are in progress to establish a SLFP Government and no force will be allowed to split the SLFP and give advantage to other political parties.” Picture by Thushara Fernando
