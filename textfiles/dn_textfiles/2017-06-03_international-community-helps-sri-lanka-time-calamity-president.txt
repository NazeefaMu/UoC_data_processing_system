International community helps Sri Lanka in time of calamity: President

President Maithripala Sirisena thanked the government and people of Maldives for the assistance provided for flood relief work.
Speaking with Maldivian Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Mohamed Asim, who called on him at the President’s official residence in Colombo yesterday, the President said Sri Lanka received generous support from the international community during this time of calamity because of the government's policy of maintaining good relations with all the nations.
Foreign Minister Dr. Mohamed Asim in his capacity as the Special Envoy of the President of Maldives has conveyed condolences from the government and the people of Maldives to Sri Lanka following recent floods and landslides resulting in the loss of lives, damages to infrastructure and a disruption of the lives of hundreds of people. He said the Maldives stands with Sri Lanka during this difficult time.
Dr Asim briefed the President on political developments in the Maldives. President Sirisena said a small group of unscrupulous elements travel between the two countries and indulge in nefarious activities and emphasised the need for joint action to curb such activities.
The Foreign Minister assured the President that his country would extend fullest cooperation to immigration and law and order authorities in Sri Lanka in this regard.
