Tales of an accidental cricketer

My good friend Ravi Jayasuriya from Melbourne had this interesting article which the readers might find amusing.
His most memorable cricketing experience was playing against one of Sri Lanka’s greatest cricketers, the late C.I. Gunasekera, on the SSC turf. He only faced two overs from him; well actually about 10 balls since he bowled him or had him stumped before the end of the second over, he further adds. He believed C.I. was well past his prime at that time but being able to counter his high class leg spin gave him enormous self-confidence.
So how did this unforgettable experience come about? Well quite by accident he states.
One fine day way back in 1966 as a 17 year old, he made his first visit to the SSC grounds to watch a cricket match. Ravi, not being of an academic bent, had lots of time to spare those days. He was not sure who was playing whom but probably he wanted to get away from parental scrutiny for a while. As it happened SSC was playing Negombo SC (with apologies to the denizens of Negombo, it was not an outfit you heard much those days) and he had got there in the lunch break. Negombo SC was to bat after the break and their top order was outside having a ‘hit’ to get their ‘eyes in’. One of their batters didn’t have anyone to bowl to him and noticing Ravi gaping, threw the ball at him. Well obviously he impressed the batter, because he asked Ravi if he would not mind making up the numbers for the day, as they were short of a player.
No prizes for guessing, what his answer was! Before long he found himself walking out to the turf, in his best ‘test batsman manner, to face a legend. The late great C.I., tall, fair and handsome, looking down the wicket and no doubt licking his lips at the prospect of adding another scalp to his already formidable tally. Memorable though it was, he could not remember each and every delivery. Suffice to say he managed to fight back negative thoughts and reminded himself what a batsman is supposed to do in those situations. “Don’t look at the bowlers face; look at the wrist at the moment of delivery.” Keep your eyes on the ball and follow it all the way to the bat etc. “His old school coach, during his under 16 school cricket (he didn’t make it to the first 1st Eleven) would have been proud of him!
There he was, playing at one of Colombo’s premier venues, putting bat to ball and smothering the wily spin of one of Sri Lanka’s greats. Many an international player, he states, for sure would have struggled to come to grips with C.I., when they tried to ‘read’ C.I... Well as he said earlier, the magic did not last long and soon he was back in the pavilion, comforted by his new found team mates. Tea was taken on the top floor of the pavilion and he thoroughly enjoyed the ‘Lingus ‘sausages and sandwiches which was laid out for them in style. It was not his daily team time snack those days. However the real treat was sitting at the same table with C.I who he was told, had in his day, played with as well as against the legendary Keith Miller, one of his idols.
However he was happy to say that his new team liked what they saw in his efforts and invited him to join them at their next game the following week end at the Moors ground in Colpetty. This was sheer magic but not for long. I was soon brought crashing down to earth!
The Moors game ended his promising career as a serious club cricketer in Sri Lanka. He was promoted to open batting, which was flattering but although he scored a few runs, he did not last long enough to see the shine off the new ball.
A well-built pacey scattered his stumps all over the place and with them, his dreams of making of an innings to remember. It was a serious dereliction of duty!
To make matters worse, he dropped a catch, which was unforgivable. No matter it was high and he had to cover lots of ground from deep square leg. “Catches win matches and you are not supposed to drop them.” His one consolation was to see his name in print the following day and being able to show off to his buddies.
In 1969 he went to England and had the good fortune to play the great game to his heart’s content, practically every summer for 20 years. But when he looked back, he felt his time would have been better spent living and playing in Colombo, the city of his birth.
