because after considering other equivalent institutes, for me personally this institution stood out from the rest. I’ve been studying here as a full-time student under the 2nd year of LLB (Hons) Degree programme and I can honestly say that it has always been up to the expectations and more. The lecturers are very friendly and well qualified industry specialists. Everything is taught in a way that keeps us engaged and active and they also give their best individual attention to everyone and never makes anyone feel left out.
They organise many events and activities to help us interact and introduce us to people from different fields to give us a better overall learning experience. The environment is very tidy and has all the required facilities. Based on my personal experience the main reason I absolutely love and adore IDM college of legal studies is because they always put the students first and never fail to live up our expectations. If anyone is looking for a college to pursue their dream as a lawyer I would greatly recommend IDM college of legal studies, it truly is the best environment for anyone to continue their higher studies in the stream of Law,” Kavindya Bopearachchi said.
