Battling Breast Cancer

This week Oncologists, Consultant Community Physicians and other health professionals attached to the National Cancer Control Programme of the Health Ministry speak about breast cancer which is the commonest cancer among Sri Lankan women.
Women with high risk of developing breast cancer
The women with a past history of breast cancer/breast condition, a family history of breast or ovarian cancers, infertility, first child birth after 35 years, low parity, not breast fed or breast fed only for a short period, attended puberty before 11 years, menopause after 55 years, use of oral contraceptive pills 5 years or more (slight increase in risk), higher breast density, prolonged hormone replacement therapy during menopause, obesity after menopause, less exercise/sedentary life style, consumption of more alcohol, active or passive smoking and the women who underwent ionizing radiation are at high risk of developing breast cancer.
The main signs and symptoms of breast cancer
Breast cancer does not show any clinical features during early stages. Clinical features appear only with the advancement of the cancer. These clinical features include;
* Skin changes of the breast
* Colour changes of the breast
* Change in shape of the breast
* Orange peel (Pseudo orange) appearance of breast
* Ulceration on the breast
* Late occurrence of breast asymmetry (usually both breasts are not of equal size. Therefore, a long standing breast asymmetry is not a sign of a cancer)
* Nipple change/discharge other than breast milk (Having inverted nipples from birth is not a sign of a cancer)
* Breast lump or thickening of the breast skin
* Lumps in the arm pit or around the neck
* Breast pain
Early Detection
A breast cancer can be detected through breast self examination, a clinical breast examination by a health care worker, or through a mammography and/or Ultrasound Scan, Non Excision Biopsy - Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) and or cone biopsy.
Clinical breast examination should be done by all women between the ages of 20 – 40 once in every three years and annually by all women above the age of 40. Mammography should not be done for women bellow the age of 35 unless asked by the doctor. All women between the ages of 50 – 69 should get done a mammography once in every two years.
Breast Self Examination
Breast self examination on monthly basis is very important for early detection of breast cancers. This should be carried out once a month by all women over 20 years of age. This should be conducted on a fixed date every month. It is better to conduct this, one week after the start of menstruation.
If she is not menstruating, a fixed date in every month should be used. A woman can use any place that suites her. It can be conducted in a lying down, sitting or a standing position or while bathing. Breast self examination has two components. They are Inspection and Palpation.
