Meethotamulla death toll rises to 31

The number of deaths reported following the collapse of a part of the Meethotamulla garbage dump, had increased to 31, said Army Media Spokesperson Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne.
He further said it was no longer a rescue mission, since more than 72 hours have passed. “We are working to find the bodies now and 1,060 members of the Tri Forces, along with 500 police personnel are stationed at Meethotamulla,” he said.
Brigadier Seneviratne said although the landfill is stable now, according to the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), plans are being made to further reinforce it before the heavy rains that are expected towards the end of the month.
As reported earlier, garbage is no longer being dumped in Meethotamulla, but the military has not started removing any of the waste.
“We have not been informed of any plans for shifting the garbage to another site. "Right now we are concentrating on simply excavating the debris under which there are houses,” said Brigadier Seneviratne.
