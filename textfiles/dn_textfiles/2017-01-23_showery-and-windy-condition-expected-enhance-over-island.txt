Showery and windy condition expected to enhance over the island

 
Showery and windy conditions are expected to enhance over the country and adjacent sea areas, the Meteorological Department said today.
‘The wave type atmospheric disturbance is expected to affect the weather over the country and surrounding sea area. Under its influence showery and windy condition are expected to enhance over the country and adjacent sea areas,’ it said.
‘Showers or thundershowers will occur over most parts of the island. Very heavy showers (around 150mm) are possible in the Eastern part of the country and heavy showers (more than 100mm) are likely at some places elsewhere.’
It also said that while there may be temporary localized strong winds during thundershowers, fairly strong winds (about 40-50kmph) could be expected over the Northern half of the island.
