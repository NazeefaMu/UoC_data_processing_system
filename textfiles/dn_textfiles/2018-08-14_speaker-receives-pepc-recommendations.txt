Alleged misconduct of Wimal, Prasanna
Speaker receives PEPC recommendations

The Parliament Ethics and Privileges Committee (PEPC) concluded the inquiries into the alleged misconduct of Joint Opposition MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Prasanna Ranaweera and sent recommendations to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya last week for further action.
A Committee member told the Daily News yesterday that the Speaker would have to convene a Party Leaders’ Meeting and take a final decision based on the committee’s observations.
The inquiries were following a formal complaint by Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera into the un-Parliamentary conduct of the two members in the House on July 3.
Deputy Minister Perera brought to the attention of the House that the two JO MPs with their foul language and aggressive behaviour threatened the Chair and ridiculed Parliament. According to Committee sources, MP Weerawansa, when he was summoned before the Committee last Thursday, had denied any wrongdoing, adding that he did not intentionally disrespect the Speaker. He had refused to express regrets over the incident.
However, the sources said disciplinary action is likely against MP Ranaweera. Sources pointed out that MP Ranaweera tried to grab the Mace and the new set of Standing Orders of Parliament adopted from April 15 has the provision to impose four weeks suspension on any member who touches the Mace during the sittings. The Committee perused the CCTV footage of the incident on July 5.
“The Committee has sent its observations with the responses of the two members, but it is upto the Speaker to take the final decision after discussing with the party leaders,” a Committee member said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also previously expressed his deep displeasure on the unruly behaviour of MPs Weerawansa and Ranaweera in the House.
Ministers Thilak Marapana, Ranjith Maddumabandara, Gayantha Karunathilake, Mano Ganesan and Faiszer Musthapha, MPs Susil Premajayantha, Douglas Devananda, Anura Dissanayake, E.Saravanapavan and Shanthi Sri Skandarasa are members of the Privileges and Ethics Committee.
