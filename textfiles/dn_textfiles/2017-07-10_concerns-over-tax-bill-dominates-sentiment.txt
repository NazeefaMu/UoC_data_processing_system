Point of view
Equities ended in the red this week as the benchmark price index slipped by ~10 points to end at 6,737.50 points.
The ASPI which slipped from an 18M high on Monday (losing 14 points) fell a further ~23 points by Wednesday before it managed to wipe-off some losses on Thursday & Friday as it recovered by ~28 points.
The tabling of the new Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament contributed towards thin volumes as investors continued to remain watchful ahead of the parliament’s decision on the new bill.
The daily average turnover level was consequently lower than that of last week, falling ~40% W-o-W to end at LKR 0.70Bn, ~20% lower than 2017 daily average turnover of LKR 0.92Bn.
Crossings over the week meanwhile, accounted for ~28% of total market turnover, amid strong interest in JKH(20% of crossings), Lion Brewery (15% of crossings) and Ceylon Beverages (14% of crossings).
Foreign investors however continued to be net buyers over the week, to end at LKR 0.55bn this week (~48% lower than last week), helping push the Y-T-D net inflow position to the Colombo bourse to over LKR 22Bn. Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for clarity from the proposed new inland revenue act.
Higher revenue supports Q1’17 fiscal deficit
In its mid-year assessment of the country’s fiscal position, the Ministry of Finance noted that both tax and non-tax revenue rose over the 1st four months of 2017, helping the budget deficit remain at a sustainable level of Rs. 233.2Bn (cf. Rs. 233.4Bn in Jan-Apr 16).
Total revenue over the period rose 24.6% Y-o-Y (Rs. 589.0Bn cf. Rs.472.7Bn) as tax revenue rose 25.6% Y-o-Y and non-tax revenue rose 10.3% Y-o-Y.
Tax revenue rose on the back of higher indirect tax receipts as domestic consumption based tax rose +32.3% Y-o-Y and import-based tax rose +22.5% Y-o-Y as revenue collection from VAT rose over the period. Direct tax receipts also rose 30.2% Y-o-Y with personal and corporate income tax rising 13.3% Y-o-Y between Jan-Apr’17 particularly from the Banking and Financial services, Wholesale trade and Manufacturing sectors. Non-tax revenue over the Jan-Apr 17 period meanwhile rose 10.3% Y-o-Y as most sources of non-tax revenue (sales and charges, social security contribution and rent income) increased.
The profit and dividend contribution from State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs) however, declined 44.1% Y-o-Y as overall performance of the SOBE has been mixed.
Major SOBEs such as CEB and CPC for instance incurred losses over Jan-Apr’17 as drought conditions along with higher global oil prices impacted performance.
The ROI from the SOBEs over the period consequently declined to Rs. 4.4 Bn cf. Rs. 7.9Bn in the comparable period last year.
