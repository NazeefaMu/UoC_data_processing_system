International body to propagate Theravada Buddhism – President

A delegation of 2OR Buddhist Charity Organization called on President Maithripala Sirisena to discuss about its future philanthropic activities in Sri Lanka at the President’s official residence in Colombo on Saturday (May 13).
The leader of the delegation Master Jun Hong Lu, President of Australia Oriental Radio and Television announced a contribution of Rs 7.5 million for any Buddhist educational activities for youth. “This could be used for any youth educational activity of the President’s choice,” he said.
He said his charity organization is linked to more than 50 Buddhist charity institutions all over the world and would like to contribute to promote Buddhism and carry forward the message of the Buddha to the younger generation.
He said that his organization has already donated towards constructing the Museum in Polonnaruwa.
The President said delegates from more than 70 countries attended the 14th UN Vesak Day celebrations and the Buddhist Conference being held in Sri Lanka.
He said the government would explore the possibility of setting up an International Buddhist organization to propagate Theravada Buddhism to the world.
Endorsing Master Jung Hon Lu’s efforts for educating Buddhism to youths, the President said the endeavour of his government is to improve the moral values of the younger generation through the teachings of the Buddha. He thanked the 2OR Charity Organization for the generous donations given for Buddhist educational activities and for the Polonnaruwa Museum and said he was a proud resident of Polonnaruwa, the ancient kingdom in which the vast majority of people are occupied in agriculture and live a simple life in accordance with the teachings of the Buddha.
President Sirisena said the Buddha’s teachings are relevant for the conflict ridden world today as Buddhism has answers to any socio political issues in the present era.
