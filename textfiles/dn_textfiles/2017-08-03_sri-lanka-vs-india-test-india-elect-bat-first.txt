Sri Lanka Vs. India Test: India elect to bat first

 
Indian Cricket Captain Virat Kohli won the toss and chose to bat first in today’s second Test match against Sri Lanka, at the SSC grounds in Colombo.
Out of the three matches, Sri Lanka lost the first Test match held in Galle.
A couple of milestones are to be kept in this game. Cheteshwar Pujara is playing his 50th Test for India. Rangana Herath will be playing his 100th First-Class game.
