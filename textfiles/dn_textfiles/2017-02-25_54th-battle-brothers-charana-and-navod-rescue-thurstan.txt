54th Battle of the Brothers: Charana and Navod rescue Thurstan

A fine sixth wicket stand of 98 runs between Charana Nanayakkara (58) and Navod Samarakoon (34) helped Thurstan College to recover and make a reasonable total of 228 runs in their first innings on the first day of the 54th Battle of the Brothers which began at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Thurstan who were put into bat by Isipathana could not cope with the pace attack of Niranjan Wanniarachchi and Lisura Vineth and were reeling at 56 for 5 wickets before Nanayakkara joined by Samarakoon and the pair with some sensible batting repaired the damage. Nanayakkara had nine hits to the ropes while Samarakoon had four boundaries.
Earlier skipper Kasun Abeyratne made a well compiled 43 with 6 fours. Wanniarachchi was the pick of the Isipathana bowlers with three wickets for 66 while spinner Lahiru Dilshan took three wickets for 53.
Isipathana going into bat after tea were given a good start by Kalana Perera and Harsha Ratnayake before the latter was run out for 16.
Two runs later Perera departed being caught by Kasun Abeyratne off the bowling of Nanayakkara for 20. At the close the lads from Havelock Town were 78 for 3 with Pathum Nissanka unbeaten on 17 and skipper Sanjula Abeywickrama not out on 1. Nissanka was given a life when Nimesh Lakshan dropped him when he was 16.
