Formulating education policies not up to students: Kiriella

Students cannot formulate education policies. It is the government that must make decisions regarding policies, Leader of the House and Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. The minister stated these views at the opening ceremony of ‘Tissamaharama Pubuduwa’ of the Marga Sathi Programme.
Implemented under a concept of the minister, the eighth stage of the Marga Sathi Programme is carried out across five electorates, namely Tissamaharama, Lunugamwehera, Sooriyawewa, Hambantota and Ambalanthota.
Over 30 roads will be improved through interlocking and150km of rural roads will be improved through gravelling. The cost of the Marga Sathi Programme is Rs.600 million.
The minister said, “MP Dinesh Gunawardena submitted a proposal in Parliament stating that the Health Ministry was attacked when medical students went to have a discussion with them. Can you say that they went to have a discussion after seeing the videos shown on television? Is there a custom to take iron bars when going to a discussion?”
“Professors of a few universities held a vote last week asking students if they would attend lectures or not.
"A total of 98 percent of students said they would attend lectures instead of boycotting. Students cannot create educational policies,” the minister said.
He added: “It is the government that must create policies. Students cannot protest demanding the change of education policies.
"Why are these doctors against private universities being formed in Sri Lanka? About Rs. 900 million goes out of the country annually for students’ higher education.” Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa and other guests attended.
