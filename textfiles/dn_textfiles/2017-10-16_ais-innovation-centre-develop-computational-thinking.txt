AIS Innovation Centre to develop computational thinking

Asian International School (AIS), Colombo, in partnership with IgniterSpace and Create Lab of Singapore, last week unveiled its AIS Innovation Centre aimed at augmenting computational thinking and creative problem solving in students.
The Centre will house facilities for science, technology, robotics, engineering, architecture and mathematics (STREAM) education and its state-of-the-art maker-space lab has been custom built to suit the needs of the school providing a hands-on learning experience to the student population.
AIS has carefully mapped out a curriculum where innovation teaching has been cleverly integrated to the classroom curriculum, thereby providing a seamless flow of information and knowledge.
In keeping with its philosophy of providing education measuring up to global standards, AIS has partnered with Create Lab of Singapore for the program on coding and robotics and IgniterSpace for the innovation teaching program.
The school has already recorded tremendous success in art and design where more than 50% of the students obtained A* grades for Fine Arts at the Edexcel IGCSE examinations.

Principal of AIS Harshana Perera said: “The AIS Innovation Centre is the logical next step in our drive to integrate creative, technological thinking to our bright students from a young age. It goes hand-in-hand with our curriculum that encourages students to not only think but actually live outside the proverbial box. Needless to say, the results speak for themselves.”
Create Lab CEO Thilan Wickremasinghe was also highly optimistic. “We’re thrilled to have partnered with AIS to facilitate this high-tech innovation hub, keeping in line with our vision of delivering a 100% student-focused learning experience while not forgetting to have fun.”
Create Lab works with educators from Oxford, Singapore University of Technology and Design (a collaboration with MIT), Singapore Management University, IMDA Labs and NUS Enterprise to inspire children to become creators with technology and prepare them to become 21st century leaders.
Co-partner IgniterSpace is a fully-fledged tech-education institute backed by state-run tech giants such as COSTI, SLASSCOM and ICTA and employs over 15 full-time and 30 part-time instructors.
Founder Hasith Yaagahawita said: “At IgniterSpace we believe that knowledge is a perishable commodity, in that what one learns today may be invalidated by a new discovery made tomorrow. This is specifically true in the rapidly advancing tech-era today. Just holding knowledge does not guarantee the usefulness of it. So when we were invited to be part of this initiative by AIS, we didn’t hesitate.”
The distinguished gathering of strategic partners, parents and teachers were very excited in looking forward to the value addition and quality enrichment which the students will experience as a result of the new initiative of the Innovation Centre.
