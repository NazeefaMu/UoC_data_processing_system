IUSF complains to IGP regarding Ven Sobitha's death

Members of the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) lodged a complaint with the IGP yesterday noon in connection with the death of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, IUSF convener Lahiru Weerasekara said.
Weerasekara said copies of the complaint were handed over to the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). "The main reason for lodging the complaint is the issue connected to some of the doctors who treated the Thera. These doctors did not have the SLMC registration to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka. They have not renewed their registrations which should be renewed every five years," he said.
These doctors are Sri Lankans and practicing as doctors in other private health institutions. This may pose a great danger to the other patients obtaining treatment from them, Weerasekara added.
