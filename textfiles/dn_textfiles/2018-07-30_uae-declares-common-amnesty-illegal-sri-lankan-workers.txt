UAE declares common amnesty for illegal Sri Lankan workers

The United Arab Emirates government has declared a common amnesty for Sri Lankans who are illegally working in UAE, to leave the country without facing any legal actions, the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment said.
The UAE had declared an amnesty period starting from August 1, for Sri Lankan expatriates who do not possess valid working Visas, to rectify their status or leave the country.
Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando and Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara yesterday urged Lankans illegally staying in the UAE, to use the amnesty period to rectify their status or leave the country.
The amnesty allows illegal residents to leave the country during that period through any port without paying penalties; or to legalize their status and continue residing in the UAE. Sri Lankans who have expired passports are urged to report to the Sri Lankan Consul General Office in Dubai, to acquire new passports.
