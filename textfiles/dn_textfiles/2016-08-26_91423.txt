Powering the  Seventh  Season

 
Hutch partnered with the popular TV show Sirasa Super Star for their 7th season that recently concluded with a glamour filled grand finale night at Stein studio. Sirasa Super Star is the pioneering Sinhala musical reality show followed and enjoyed by everyone young and old from all walks of life.
Hutch Sri Lanka has always been leading from the front in supporting events that empower the youth of Sri Lanka - and help them reach their fullest potential. It is widely known to be a youthful brand that provides a constant stream of innovative products and solutions geared to meet the varying needs of each and every individual.
Sirasa Super Star was created to discover new singing sensations from across the island and provide them a platform to showcase their talents to a national TV audience. Millions of ardent viewers who watch the show on a regular basis pick the winner at the final stages through a voting mechanism. Initially, through a series of auditions held in several locations across the island and adjudicated by an expert panel of judges specializing in music, the programme reaches out to thousands of aspiring singers far and wide. Over a period of several months and several rounds of auditions and training, these talented contestants were whittled down to a handful that performed at the Grand Finale to vie for the Sirasa Super Star Season 7 title.
