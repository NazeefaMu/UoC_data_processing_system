Minister Arjuna gives evidence in Bharti Airtel Lanka case

Giving evidence in Colombo District Court, Minister of Ports and Naval Affairs Arjuna Ranatunga said that Bharti Airtel Lanka Private Limited had produced and published a commercial advertisement depicting his image receiving the 1999 Wills World Cup, without his consent.
Minister Arjuna Ranatunga, the 1999 Cricket World Cup winning captain had filed a lawsuit in the Colombo District Court against the Airtel Lanka Company claiming a compensation of Rs.500 million as damages.
Minister Ranatunga told District Court Judge T.D. Gunasekara that as a policy, he himself had never appeared for a commercial advertisement as a cricketer and further stated that he never reached an oral or written agreement with the defendant company to produce or publish a commercial advertisement.
He stated that in 2010, the defendant company had produced a TV advertisement in order to promote its mobile phone connection services and he learnt that the concerned advertisement had been telecast over several television channels creating a wrong impression of him.
Further trial was fixed for February 9.
Counsel Athula Bandara and Sashika de Silva on the instructions of Counsel Prasath Sirimanna appeared for the plaintiff. President's Counsel Prasanna Jayawardane with Milinda Jayatilleke appeared for the defendant company.
