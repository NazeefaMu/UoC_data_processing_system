Darin clocks fastest time at Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb

 
Darin Weerasinghe clocked the fastest time in the 83 year old history of the Mahagastota Speed Hill Climb with a timing of 33.46 seconds to break the existing course record of 34.17 seconds held by hill stormer Nishan Weerasoriya since last year at the Annual Mahagastota Speed Climb organized by the oldest motor racing club in Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Motor Sports Club titled the Mahagastota Festival of Speed and sponsored by Mobil, McFoil, Ceat, Mahindra and supported by Blackpool Hotel and worked off at the picturesque Mahagastota Track on Sunday before a large and enthusiastic crowd.
In breaking the record young Darin Weerasinghe also became the first competitor to time less than 34 seconds - a long way ahead of Bill Fowkes who timed 68.34 seconds in his Austin Trophy way back in 1934 which was the fastest timing at the first speed climb organized by an enthusiastic band of expatriate British Planters to break the boredom on Sundays but since it has gained a lot of status and momentum to be dubbed as the national festival of speed.
The day belonged to Darin Weerasinghe son of the famous Bandula Weerasinghe who is the only racing driver to holy three class records simultaneously and one of them stood for a very long time till the advent of the Japanese cars with the latest technology lowered it a few years back.
Darin Weerasinghe driving behind a Subaru STI 10 in the high powered event of SLGT finding the track conditions much to hiking made a flawless screeching run. It was delightful display with a quick change of gears and did not lose any time at the tricky corners as he had the complete control of the machine.
Darin Weerasinghe is a versatile sportsman as he had represented the country at international meets at Powerlifting and brought gold medals and he was one time holder of the Overall Course record with a timing of 34.348 seconds in 2014 till it was lowered by Nishan Weerasooriya in his Alpha Mitsubishi Evolution in 2015.
Darin Weerasinghe's second run was slightly slower and by that the time had the course record wrapped up. Nishan Weerasooriya did not participate this year as his machine was not ready for the event but was an interested spectator and was happy that his course record was broken and he vowed to return next year and scale down the record further.
Another record to go was the course record for motor cycles was by Ananda Sampath Weerasinghe astride a Ananda Special timed 34.628 seconds to lower his own record for motor cycles 36.364 seconds.
Ever green maestro Rohan de Silva was once again is top form to win the event for Modified Ford Formula 1665 cc giving an object lesson to young drivers what is motor racing and age does not matter as long as you have complete control of the machine. He beat some of the competitors who were half his age. Rohan de Silva now in the twilight of his career has won the most number of events in a Modified Formula and has been the holder of the Course Record on a number of occasions. He was also placed second in the McLarens Formula 1300 cc.
This was also a day in which veteran driver Dhammika Peiris beat his son Kushan in one event but only to be beaten by the little one in the next event.
It was also nice to see the Mason brothers Jeffrey and Rodney driving their Minis and they participated at this event after 25 years. The drivers from the old vintage who participated at this racing event was 74 year old Sumanapala Manpperuma, Kumar Samarasinghe and maestro Rohan de Silva all pushing in their sixties but their love for motor racing will not just keep them away.
