Tougher action against unruly students: Minister to be kept in the loop

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed school principals to inform him of disciplinary action taken against students who behave in an unruly manner during the big match season.
Earlier, the Education Minister instructed principals to take all measure to ensure the calm and safety of the educational environment in schools during the big match season.
However, due to reports of several students of some boys’ schools in Colombo behaving in an unruly manner, the minister instructed principals to take tough action against them including obtaining police assistance if necessary.
