Power of a  planted seed

A home garden provides us a continuous source of nutritious and healthy food. Yet in order to maintain a successful and productive home garden we need to build a controlled environment. We call this controlled Environment – A Nursery. Green Thumbs speaks to District Agriculture Instructor, Office of Deputy Provincial Agriculture Rathmalana G.D. Udaya Kumara on Nurseries where plants are nurtured to perfection and introduced into the Home Garden.
One of the main reasons in maintaining a Home Garden is to provide the family with a continuous supply of Vegetables, Spices, root crops and fruits. The stock must be of good quality and it needs to be healthy. There has to be a daily supply of food from a variety of crops.
“A Home Garden must be sustainable. Nurseries are vital to the growth of plants for home gardens and commercially. For commercial purposes plants are grown to be marketed, so farmers can earn an income. In a Home Garden, though the produce can be sold to shops, the main reason behind a home garden is to provide the family with their daily intake of food,” said Udaya Kumara.
The idea behind a nursery is to develop the plant material which would otherwise grow poorly if immediately planted in the home garden.
“A small nursery can be maintained in your home garden where the planting material can be developed. Raising a good crop depends on how good your nursery is. The nursery can protect the small plants grown within its confines from weather conditions, pests and diseases and it can ensure a high quality yield. The plants growing in the beds or in the pots can be observed so we can supervise its growth,” stated Udaya Kumara.A nursery can be built in a place where there is ample sunshine, where it can be irrigated and in a place where there is no flooding. There could be vegetable nurseries, fruit nurseries and flower nurseries. However normally in a home garden we pay more attention to fruits and vegetables.
“There are some vegetables that require a nursery – Tomato, Green Chili, Brinjals, Cabbage, leeks and beet. We need to keep in mind that some plants originate in small seeds. Because the seeds are small we need nurseries. They are not hardy plants that can survive if directly introduced into the home garden. The seeds are attacked by pests. Ants can eat the seeds. Also weather conditions can have an adverse effect. However there are plants that don’t require a nursery. They can be immediately introduced to the garden. These are beans, ladies fingers and Dambala. They have large seeds,” explained Udaya Kumara.
There are two types of nurseries – beds and pots. If you take pots there are different types. Polythene, Yoghurt Cups, Coconut husks, curd pots and ice cream containers. There is also new technology such as Sponge Pots and Geffy Pots.
“When you take nursery beds if you add 1kg of top soil you need to add 1kg of organic manure. You can also mix 250g of sand and 250g of coir fiber. However this soil mixture has to be prepared further. This is because you need to destroy the bacteria, fungus and nematodes.
First we need to prepare the above soil medium when creating the nursery bed. Then we need to pour water on the bed. Then we cover the bed with polythene. Then we allow sunlight to fall. The heat that results will kill the bacteria and fungus. We keep it in this state for one week,” pointed out Udaya Kumara.
Another technique we can use is to burn the soil. As before we prepare the nursery bed and the soil medium. Again we pour water. Then we apply a paddy husk layer 1 – 2 inches. We then apply straw over the bed. Then we again apply another second layer of paddy husk. Then we apply a second layer of straw. And we set fire to it. That should kill the bacteria and fungus.
“After both these methods we plant the seeds in the beds. After planting these seeds we use the mulch to cover the beds. This mulch could be goniya or poly sack bag. When the plants appear the mulch is taken off and you have an active nursery. However it needs watering, weeding, fertilizer needs to be applied and pests and diseases need to be controlled. The plants then can be removed from the nursery and planted in the home garden.
There are of course additional advantages to planting in pots. Here the medium is prepared separately (1kg of top soil: 1kg of organic manure. Mix 250g of sand and 250g of coir fiber) and filled into the pots.
“Here the root damage is less. When you grow the plants in the beds and remove them to re- plant them in the home garden, when removing them from the beds the roots get damaged. But when growing in pots the soil mound is removed from the pots and planted in the home garden so the roots do not get damaged at all. Also because the roots do not get damaged when growing in pots, the plant is not vulnerable to soil borne diseases. We know that when the roots are damaged there is a wound and bacteria and fungus enter into the plants because of the wound – through the wound,” explained Udaya Kumara.
Also because roots do not get damaged, environmental conditions do not have that much of an adverse effect on the plants. Also because roots do not get damaged you can reap a good harvest in shorter time.
