Citizens' Mail

Religious places cause no discord among ethnicities
There was a past when religious harm had been almost unheard of. Enter Mahinda Rajapaksa, and then we came to know of religious discord. Now, this is quite ironic, as religions are meant to offer solace to humans not otherwise. The Buddhists, Muslims, Christians and Hindus got along quite well in the past.
Sri Lanka was under the rule of the great statesmen such as Don Stephen Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Junius Richard Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The communal hatred never reached press. The temples, churches, mosques and kovils had never faced any threat. The communities had no reason at all to fight among each other. Religious sanity prevailed more than enough during the tenures of these statesmen.
Of course there could be malpractices going on in these religious places. However, what we must keep in mind is that the people visit these religious places. The people visit these religious places especially because they need peace of mind. It is not humane to create discord in places where helpless humans seek mental solace.
For some unseen reason, the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency paved the way to religious discord. Let us forgive whoever, be it Muslim clergy or Buddhist clergy, carried out religious discord and move forward with the true meaning of religious reconciliation.
Let every human in this country have a chance to follow the religion of their choice.
