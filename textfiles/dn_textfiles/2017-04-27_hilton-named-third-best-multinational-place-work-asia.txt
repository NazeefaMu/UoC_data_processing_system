Hilton named third best multinational place to work in Asia

 
Hilton has been ranked third in the Asia's Best Multinational Workplaces 2017 list, according to global research and consulting firm Great Place To Work, Travel Daily News reported.
Hilton is also the top-ranking hospitality company on the 2017 list.
The latest award is a result of positive feedback from Team Members across Asia and Middle East where Hilton was ranked in national Best Workplaces lists, including China, India, and Sri Lanka, as well as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.
 Great Place to Work's annual study of Asia's Best Workplaces research reveals that employees at the top 60 Best Workplaces in Asia indicate that managers behaving in a respectful way is the most significant factor for employees to have the desire to remain in the current jobs. 
 "We are thrilled to be recognized as one of Asia's Best Multinational Workplaces," said Martin Rinck, Area President of Asia Pacific, Hilton. "Our Team Members are at the core of our success -- the heart and soul of Hilton. I am extremely proud of our Team Members in Asia Pacific and the incredible culture that we have built together which allows us to deliver the world's best hospitality - both to our guests as well as to our amazing Team Members."
 Hilton offers leading programs that deliver Team Members great environments, careers and rewards.
Opportunities for development through Hilton University, an online learning resource that helps Team Members plan, manage and develop skills to support their career advancement, as well as E3 (Elevate, Engage, Excel), a development framework dedicated to help leaders hone their leadership skills.
Go Hilton, a program that provides exclusive travel discounts and perks for Team Members, as well as their family and friends.
Opportunities for recognition through programs such as Catch Me at My Best, the CEO Light & Warmth Awards and Team Member Appreciation Week that acknowledge Team Members at all levels from guests, peers and managers.
In announcing the Best Companies in Asia, Great Place to Work CEO Michael Bush said, "Being on the list is more than being recognized as a Great Place to Work. A high-trust culture helps you attract people, improves your performance, retains your top talent, fosters innovation, and assures a sustainable business. Bottom-line, a Great Place to Work for All is better for business, because you're developing the full human potential of everyone on your team."
