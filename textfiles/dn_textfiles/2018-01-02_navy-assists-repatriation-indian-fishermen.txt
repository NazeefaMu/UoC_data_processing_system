The Sri Lanka Navy assisted in the repatriation of 69 Indian fishermen after they were released from custody, on Sunday.
The fishermen from Tamil Nadu were arrested for trespassing into Sri Lankan territorial waters and engaging in illegal fishing activities.
The Sri Lanka Coast Guard facilitated the repatriation of the Indian fishermen on Sunday, a Navy spokesman said.
Sri Lanka Navy ship Ranagaja and Sri Lanka Coast Guard’s Patrol Craft CG 404 were deployed for the repatriation mission. The repatriated Indian fishermen were handed over to the Indian Coast Guard Ship Ameya at the International Maritime Boundary Line north of Kankesanthurai.
