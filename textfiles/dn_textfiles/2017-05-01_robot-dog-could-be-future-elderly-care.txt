Robot dog  could be the future  of elderly care

MiRo is the world's first commercial biomimetic robot, according to its creators, meaning it is a manmade device that mimics nature. It has been built by Consequential Robotics and the University of Sheffield .
MiRo is fitted with mini sensors so it can tell when it is being stroked or patted. It also has a sonar sensor in its nose so it can move around without crashing into things. The robo-pet could also have a number of practical functions, such as recognising people at the door or reminding its owner of diary events. The robot is designed to live among humans and provide emotional engagement, according to cbs46.com .
Maria Favre, studio manager of Consequential Robotics, said: "It has a companionship effect so when it's on and around you it really gives you that warm, buzzy feeling." "That seems to me an interesting approach.
"I don't want to take the human being out of care. Don't let's see robots as being replacements. Let's see them being add ons." Mirror
