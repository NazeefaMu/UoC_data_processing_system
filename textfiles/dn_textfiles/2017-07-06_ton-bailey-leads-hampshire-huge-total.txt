Ton-up Bailey leads Hampshire to huge total

LONDON, Tuesday: Australia's George Bailey led from the front on Tuesday, with the Hampshire captain's century the centerpiece of a huge total against Surrey in the First Division of the English County Championship.
Bailey's 161 was the third and largest hundred in the visitors' imposing first-innings score of 648 for seven declared on the second day of four at The Oval.
Title-chasers Hampshire also saw former Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Ervine make 83 and Ian Holland an unbeaten 58. Surrey closed on 113 for one, with the in-form Mark Stoneman out for 57.
There was an even bigger total in the Second Division as Sean Dickson's triple century took Kent to 701 for seven declared against Northamptonshire at Beckenham.
The 25-year-old South Africa-born opener became the first Kent batsman since the Second World War to pass 300 while his partnership of 382 with former England batsman Joe Denly, who scored 182, was a club record for any wicket.
Having started the day on 210, Dickson was eventually out for 318 - having hit 31 fours and three sixes in nearly eight-and-a half hours at the crease.
Meanwhile South Africa leg-spinner Imran Tahir ensured batsmen were not the only ones enjoying themselves on Tuesday by taking five for 98 as Durham were reduced to 274 for eight in reply to Derbyshire's 368 in a Second Division clash at Chesterfield.
