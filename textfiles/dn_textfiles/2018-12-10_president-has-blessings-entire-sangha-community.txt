Buddhashrawaka Sangha Chapter  Chief Registrar says
President has blessings of the entire Sangha community

Chief Registrar of the Buddashrawaka Sangha Chapter Ven. Dimbulagala Dewalankara Thera said that President Maithripala Sirisena has the blessings of the entire Sangha community for his untiring efforts to steer the country forward while taking bold decisions for the well-being of the people.
“The country has faced a difficult situation as a result of the narrow sighted behaviour of certain persons and politicians,” the Thera said.
“The Maha Sangha greatly appreciates the dedicated services rendered by President Sirisena for the uplift of the people and the motherland,” Ven. Dewalankara Thera said. The Thera was speaking at an event organised to unveil the newly constructed Buddha Statue and a Bodhi Prakaraya at the Sri Valukarama Buddhist Centre near the Manampitiya bridge.
President Maithripala Sirisena was the Chief Guest on the occasion. Ven. Dimbulagala Dewalankara Thera said that the people would never forget the invaluable service rendered to Buddhism by President Sirisena.
The President unveiled the Buddha statue and Bodhi Prakaraya by offering flowers after after participating in religious observances.
