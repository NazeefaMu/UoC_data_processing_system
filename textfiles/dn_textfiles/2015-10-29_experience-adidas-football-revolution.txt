Experience the adidas football revolution

The world renowned sports brand adidas recently launched its latest football boots promotion at selected outlets across Sri Lanka. Now when you spend over a certain amount on the new Ace, X15 and Messi range of football boots, you will receive a special voucher which can be utilized at the Havelock Road, Crescat, Rajagiriya and Kandy City Centre adidas outlets.
The promotion is valid until December 6 and is giving Sri Lankan sports enthusiasts the chance to be a part of the adidas football revolution.

The Ace X15 provides optimal control enabling you to perform exceptionally well in all aspects of the game. The Messi15 range was created in close collaboration with football legend Lionel Messi and provides ultimate grip, stability and comfort. The range is inspired by the colours of the Argentinian flag and the outsole and stud-construction are specially built to withstand the strain of playing on artificial grass. You can therefore safely wear this pair of boots on different surfaces and rest assured that wear and tear will be minimized.
“Football is a game that is loved and played across the world and is rapidly gaining popularity in Sri Lanka. This promotion will provide football enthusiasts with added value via a special voucher, which they will receive when they invest in a pair of Ace X15 or Messi15 football boots. Both these ranges offer world-class quality and exceptional design at an affordable price and give Sri Lankan consumers the chance to join the football hype and play the game in style”, Adidas Sri Lanka Assistant Brand Manager Vadivel Suthakaran stated.
The adidas outlets offer the best footwear for sports professionals and enthusiasts in Sri Lanka, who seek exceptional design that enhances performance. Hameedia is the sole agent of adidas footwear in Sri Lanka and offers the Ace X15 and Messi 15 range in a variety of colours and sizes.
