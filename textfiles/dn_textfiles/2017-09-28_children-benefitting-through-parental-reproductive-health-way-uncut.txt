Children benefitting through Parental Reproductive Health: Way of the uncut diamond

October 1st is the World Children's Day and coincidentally, also the Elder's Day. In the year 1924, the League of Nations, currently known as the United Nations (UN) made a universal declaration titled Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child. Sections of the Declaration were extended with many improvements from time to time by the UN, and was duly adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1959. This Declaration was followed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, adopted by the UN in 1989, to which Sri Lanka subscribed in 1991.
The basic concepts of the Declaration emphasise on the benefits that should be accrued to the child in many ways for his/her development. Some of them are:
a. Promoting mental and physical development,
b. Feeding the hungry, nursing the sick, helping the backward, reclaiming the delinquent, sheltering and providing succour for the orphan and the waif,
c. Prioritising for relief,
d. Protecting against exploitation,
e. Recognising talents and lending support to enhance them.
In the family context, all these and many more become the first and the last responsibility and the bounden duty of the parents towards their children, irrespective of the number of children in the family. The most vital requisite to enable parents to discharge such responsibility towards their children is their sustained status of general health.
General health of a family, in its simplest definition, is the well-being of the father, mother and their children in all aspects of their life, be it hygienically, economically, socially, environmentally or else-wise and most significantly in the context of a family's close positive relationships. Primarily it is a fundamental human right for all - which include parents - to attain the highest level of general health. It is, also a valuable social and economic imperative, because the physical energy and the mental capacity the parents derive through sound general health are the driving forces that help in the progressive development of their children. It is common knowledge that mentally sick and physically ailing father or/and mother will guide their children too to the same style of life.
Reproductive system
Among the long list of elements that comprise general health, the concept of Reproductive Health (RH) is the most important component, according to World Health Organization (WHO). It says, “RH is the state of complete physical, mental and social well-being in all matters related to the Reproductive System, and to its functions and processes in the body of a male and a female. RH is definitely not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Thus, parents with ill-functioning or mal-functioning Reproductive System will not be able to enjoy the said state of complete well-being, which in turn will affect the growth and the progress of their children. Hence, knowledge about RH and accessing services related to RH should be the top-most priority in the life of a father or a mother with children.
Reproductive Health issues are related to the fulfillment of the joys of a family life and the avoidance of risks that hamper the prospects of development of the children. Good RH promotes the opportunity to have the desired children by the parents and to eliminate chances of unwanted or unsafe pregnancies. Besides, it contributes enormously to physical and psychosocial comfort and closeness of the husband and wife, thereby enhancing the happiness of their children as a family unit. On the other hand, poor RH is frequently associated with diseases, unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, exploitation, and even death, all of which reflect serious implications on the children.
Knowledge on RH helps parents to decide freely and responsibly the number of children they desire, spacing and timing of the arrival of their children free of discrimination, coercion and violence - an important factor which brings proven benefits to the children already living and to those to be born. The Interactive Population Centre, a renowned organisation promoting RH knowledge, says ‘The neglect of reproductive health and the lack of its awareness are the main causes of many family problems”. This is clearly evident from what takes place everyday in the country and as reported in media, in the form of gender-based violence, HIV/AIDS, maternal mortality, teenage pregnancy, abortions, and abandoned children.
“In terms of the female partners in families, failure to access RH information and services by every third such partner in the world has made her incapable of making decisions in regard to her private life behaviour, which lead her to unsafe practices and negative consequence and bad RH status” reports the WHO. It further states, “Yet, this does not signify that male partners are free from similar problems. On the contrary, they are advised to pay more attention to their role in RH, taking into consideration that they can be carriers of various infections and problems of the same type. They too, therefore, need to access RH information and services along with their wives,” This again is a clear indication that both parents in a family should invariably follow best practices in HR, if they are to provide positive benefits and comprehensive support towards the growth of their children.
Decision-making in RH matters
Between the spouses, RH concerns and needs of the husband are of lesser serious nature than those of the wife. But he has particular roles and responsibilities in terms of the RH of his wife, because of the reliance the wife places on him for decision-making in RH matters, which also impacts the developmental needs of their children. He is, therefore expected to be involved up-front in the promotion of RH knowledge and best practices in the family for themselves and as a supporter of his partner, by encouraging and enabling her to access RH services. Such involvement will help both partners to share responsibility for family health, which includes the health of the children as well.
“Sound RH of the parents is a central feature of the general health of a family. It is a reflection of the health of children during childhood, and crucial during adolescence and adulthood, and sets the stage for health beyond the reproductive years for both men and women, and affects the health of even the next generation,” states the UN Population Information Network.
This reveals that the health of the new born is largely a function of the mother's health based on her RH status, and how important it is during her reproductive years and throughout the lifespan of all children in her family, irrespective of their number. In other words, failure to address the RH problems at any stage of life of parents sets the scene for later health and developmental problems, not only for the husband and wife, but even for their children and their generations.
