Sri Lanka enjoy mixed fortunes

Sri Lanka sport enjoyed mixed fortunes during the year 2015. As the curtain comes down ending another calendar year, it’s time to take a stock and evaluate how our sportsmen and women have fared during the year.
Although Sri Lanka did not figure in the biggest sporting event of the year – Rugby World Cup 2015 worked off in the UK, there was tremendous interest on the tournament among local sports fans.
Although a World Cup berth remains a distant dream for Sri Lanka, its national rugby team put up a blistering performance to win the 2015 Asian Rugby Championship Division 1 title. Sri Lanka became the biggest climbers in the World Rugby Rankings moving up nine places from 47th to 38th in the world to equal their highest ever position since the IRB rankings were introduced in October 2003.
Anuradha Indrajith Cooray
The newly-crowned Asia Rugby Championship Division 1 champions earned 2.84 rating points after they overcame Kazakhstan in midweek before beating the hosts Philippines 27-14 in the final worked off in Bulacan on May 9.
Marathon runners in WC
History was created at the 15th IAAF World Championship when two Sri Lankan marathon runners – Anuradha Indrajith Cooray and Niluka Geethani Rajasekera qualified to compete at the 2015 Championships in Beijing, China.
Cooray figured on the opening day of the meet on August 21 and secured 29th place clocking an unimpressive two hours, 25 minutes and four seconds, well behind his Sri Lanka record of 2:13.47 registered at 2015 London Marathon last April.
Rajasekara, who came fifth in the women’s event of the 2015 Hong Kong marathon with a time of two hours, 40 minutes and seven seconds last January, set a new Sri Lanka mark. Her feat also bettered the qualifying time to participate in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, along with Cooray who booked his passage to Rio at the 2015 London Marathon. However, Rajasekera returned a timing of only two hours, 50 minutes and 40 seconds to finish 49th at the IAAF World Championship women’s marathon worked off in Beijing on August 30.
Long jumper N. Chamali Dilrukshi Priyadarshani and hammer thrower Ayesha Maduwanthi maintained their superb form this year, establishing new Sri Lanka records at the 41st National Sports Festival in Diyagama this month.
South Asian Games gold medallist Priyadarshani had a record-breaking jump of 6.43m in her fifth attempt to better the previous mark of 6.35m held by Nayanthi Chandrasena in 2002. Maduwanthi threw 43.18m to account for the other Sri Lanka mark.
Earlier in September, Ishara Sandaruwan of Sri Lanka Air Force cleared 4.90m to set a new Sri Lanka record in pole vault at the Thailand Open Athletics Championship.
He narrowly missed the bronze medal, finishing fourth after he erased the previous Sri Lanka record for the event - 4.85m by Ruwan Pradeep Perera in 1999.
Bronze for Nimali
Middle distance runner Nimali Liyanarachchi secured women’s 800m bronze medal at the Asian Athletics Championships in Wuhan, China last June. She clocked two minutes and 39.4 seconds. It was Sri Lanka’s first Asian Championship medal in women’s 800m after Sriyani Dhammika Menike’s dream run in Manila, 1993.
In May, former Asian Games gold medallist Sugath Tillakaratne was elected President of the Athletic Association of Sri Lanka. Tillakaratne who won men’s 400m gold medal at the 1998 Bangkok Asian Gmaes is only the second Asian Games gold medallist to become Sri Lanka athletic chief after Sunil Gunawardena, a member of the men’s 4 x 400m relay team that won the gold medal at the 1974 Teheran Games.
On October 10, Olympic Silver medallist Susanthika Jayasinghe launched her athletic training academy, her official website and her autobiography to coincide with the 15th anniversary of winning the Olympic medal at the Sydney Games in 2000. She also received a token presentation of one million rupees from President Maithripala Sirisena to flag-off her project in the company of Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and her ex-coach and manager during her illustrious athletic career, American Tony Campbell.
Asian youth netball champs
Sri Lanka emerged champions at the 9th Asian Youth Netball Championships worked off at the Macpherson Stadium in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. Sri Lanka registered an exciting 53-48 win over Malaysia in the final. Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore and host Hong Kong were in the trophy cup, the main event of the tournament.
Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore are the three teams that will be competing at the world meet in Botswana in August 2017. Malaysia were the defending champions, having edged out Sri Lanka 59-50 in the final of the previous tournament.
Ransilu Jayatillake
The Lankan seniors however failed to make their presence felt at the 2015 Netball World Cup worked off in Sydney, Australia in August. Sri Lanka finished last (16th) in the tournament, losing their 15th place play-off match to Singapore 59-32.
Singapore enjoyed two wins out of eight matches in the 10-day NWC2015 campaign, with both wins coming against Asian rivals Sri Lanka. Singapore beat Sri Lanka 56-43 in the opening day and put up a stronger performance in the placing match to cement their kingpin status in Asia.
Playing in pool C in their ninth world cup, Sri Lanka opened with a defeat at the hands of Singapore 43-56. The Lankan lasses suffered a humiliating defeat in the next game as Malawi scored a smashing 101-18 victory. In the last Pool C qualifier, South Africa crushed Sri Lanka 89-17.
Wisden honours Sanga
Sri Lanka star batsman Kumar Sangakkara was named the cricketer of the year in the 2015 Wisden Cricketers’ Almanack. The former Sri Lanka captain, who retired from international cricket this year, joined India’s Virender Sehwag as the only two players to be named as Wisden’s Leading Cricketer in the World for a second occasion.
The 37-year-old wicket keeper batsman won the award after a stellar 2014 that saw him score an all-time record 2,868 international runs in the calendar year, including a triple century. Sanga’s feats, which added to an already brilliant career, included a man-of-the-match performance in Sri Lanka’s World Twenty20 final win over India last year. He later endorsed Wisden’s judgment by scoring a record four successive hundreds at the last World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
Gold in weightlifting
Former national weightlifting champion Ransilu Jayatillake brought glory to Sri Lanka when he won the gold medal in the 120kg category at the Singapore Open Power Lifting Championships in Singapore. |He had a total lift of 685kg consisting of 305.5kg Dead Lift. It was the highest lift by a Sri Lankan in the history of this sport. He also lifted 260kg in squat and 122.5 in bench press.
Sports Ministry-NOC patch-up differences
It was heartening to see the Sports Ministry and the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka (NOC) shedding their differences to reach an understanding to get rid of the controversial amendments to the National Sports Law, which have been highly criticized by many international sports governing bodies, including the International Olympic Committee.
Thanks to the broad vision of the new Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who assumed office last September, the NOC and the Sports Ministry have already declared that they would soon reverse the controversial amendments brought during the tenure of former minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
The new sports minister has taken steps to amend the sports law and regulations according to the principles of International Olympic charter. He has also taken action to submit the issues arising in relation to amending the sports law and regulations to the Olympic committee. He has agreed to amend the sports regulations at a discussion in Lausanne with the deputy director General of the International Olympic committee Pero Miro and NOC Secretary General Maxwell de Silva in October.
As a result of the new laws, which also barred officials serving in any executive committee position of a national sports association for more than four successive years, almost all senior sports administrated were disqualified from seeking re-election to their respective sports governing bodies. Hence, this year’s election to most national associations saw amateur officials being elected to top positions, thereby seriously affecting the smooth functioning of those bodies.
Three sports ministers served during the year 2015 - only the second time since the formation of the Ministry of Sports that it has happened. The previous instance was in 2010 when ministers Gamini Lokuge, C.B. Ratnayake and Mahindananda Aluthgamage served the ministry. Since Minister Aluthgamage’s tenure ended on January 12 this year, Minister Navin Dissanayake served for a brief period until September 4 before Minister Jayasekera succeeded him on September 4 as the country’s 13th sports minister.
