Not your everyday story !

Eager hearts, impatiently waiting till it’s finally time to ride the magic carpet. But beforehand, the young cast of Aladdin from St. Thomas’ Catholic International College, Seeduwa has quite a way to cross. Aladdin, an adaption of the much loved musical will be staged on December 14 at Ave Maria Auditorium, Negombo at 6 pm together with the annual Christmas Concert, “Rhythm of Thomians.”
“Theater is not something that one should consider as unimportant,” said Director and Choreographer of the play Nigel White. “Theatre makes one understand life and makes them smile. If it happens at the end of your performance, that’s what matters,” he said.
“This year’s performance of the widely-loved tale, the elegant princess and her street boy admirer’s transformation, is “not your everyday story,” says the. “The characters are not conventional and we are taking a new approach to the story. Getting the cast to absorb the idea of a musical was a challenge but once the children realized their own skills, they were 

more eager to perform. The students practice to act, sing and dance and there is a lot of interest in them. I let the cast members build their own characters and there is something new every day. They keep on surprising you,” White added.
 
“The cast of Aladdin has 44 members from age 8 to 14. This is the second time the students of the College perform for the public. The students are tremendous,” said Teacher in charge, Theatre Circle, STIC, Dilrukshi Perera.
“They are capable, talented and well-trained. The play is colorful and full of activity,” Perera noted. “All cast members play a major role and it is lively throughout because it is a musical. The choral directing for the play is done by Emesh Wijewardene,” she added.
Glowing brighter
For 14 year old Philip Francis, who is counting days to conquer the stage as Aladdin, the play reflects his life. “It all feels familiar and I understand everything because I, myself, was born in an Arabic country,” he said.
“When I’m in my character, I think and behave like Aladdin. It’s like I’m gone completely but only my character exists,” said Francis.“I have gained things in my life. But this is the biggest thing I received with which I can change the hearts of people,” he stated.
“When I’m free, I read my script and Google for tips on acting,” said Francis. “Balancing school work and theatre is natural to me and I want to continue in theater because it opens up people’s hearts and shows them a different side of the world,” he pointed out.
And he added with a nervous laugh that when he auditioned, he had a feeling he wouldn’t get the role. “But I feel there is something out there, paving me the way to do this.”
Showcase talents
“I just love theater!” exclaimed fourteen year old Ishani Subasinghe with a wide smile. She gives life to the role of Jasmine. “In theater, you get to express your emotions.
We all have talents and we get to showcase them on stage and show the world who we really are. Aladdin is not any drama. It is a musical. It’s got comedy, adventure, romance and it’s an amazing opportunity to show your talents,” Subasinghe stated.
Having studied in the United States when she was younger, and having acted in theater in the country, Subasinghe noted that compared to the US, theater experience here is different because “we put out heart and soul to it. We practice day and night and we put all effort into making it a great success. Being in the play changed me a lot. I was a shy girl before but now I am braver and more confident. It is exciting when you perform to a large audience, it is an amazing feeling,” she added.
Let out emotions
Shen Perera, with his lanky frame and mischievous grin, is sure that he is very much suited for the role of Jafar because “I have this great, rough voice and the height for a bad guy. I had to amplify my voice so high to show a lot of emotions,” said the 14 year old. “My biggest challenge was to express the emotion of evil. After joining the play, I began to walk straighter, like a gentleman. The way I talk changed, as well. I also learned a lot of new words,” Perera said.
 
Overcome challenges
Tharushi Salgadu, 13 year old student playing Genie, learned to overcome challenges through the drama. “At first I couldn’t sing well. I cried and cried but the director encouraged me and I practiced note by note. There is a scene where I have to jump quite high and I practiced for days before I could finally do it right,” she explained with adorable solemnness.
Improving skills
Fifteen year old Nathan William, who is anticipating acting as the Sultan, enjoys the play because he gets to express all his emotions. “When I perform, I feel like I am free and that the stage is my home. Theater improved my pronunciation, memorizing skills and even spellings,” he said further. To William, carrying out his studying together with theatre is a challenge but he confirmed that he enjoys engaging in sports as well as theatre while doing his academic work. I wanted to try acting because I thought it would be fun to get to know others who shared the same interests.
Drama love
“I love, love, love drama!” exclaimed 12 year old Elizabeth Blackett. “I forced my mom to let me act in Aladdin,” she seems quite proud of her victory. She is a dancer in the play and said, “When I am on stage, I feel like a different person. I feel so amazing, like I can do anything.”
More disciplined
Twelve year old Omaya Perera recalled how she practiced hard to secure her role. “In last year’s production, I came only once on stage, so, this time, I put in more effort and practiced very hard so I can have the role of Iago,” she said.
“Theatre has helped me be more disciplined. I talk a lot but when I am practicing, my teacher and the director disciplined me to concentrate,” she added. “I get good marks in school and I can balance my school life with theater. It helps me a lot in studies. When it comes to English, I’m very fluent, now,” Omaya said.
Teacher in charge, Perera added that the students in the theater circle are marvelous at studies. “The best in academic studies are the children in the theater circle. They are stressful during lessons and this is a way to relax their minds. They are so enthusiastic. They practice till late night but they never seem to feel tired,” Perera said.
The College theatre circle is hoping to participate in Inter-School Shakespeare competitions in 2018. “My students are capable of it,” said Perera and she added that the support given by parents should be appreciated.
Young hearts, bubbling with life and freedom thus learns to unfurl their wings on the radiant stage. It is a pleasant relief, indeed, to see them being guided in the right path.
Hope relies on the future that they will flourish as bright citizens who will love and respect art and endeavors such as this is a sign of that coming true.
