The task before Minister Marapana

New Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana appears set to clean the Augean Stables. Soon after assuming office, the well known lawyer and President's Counsel assured that he would initiate action to probe allegations against Sri Lankan diplomats, including charges of corruption and misbehaviour. The Minister was responding to concerns raised by Chief Incumbent of Nalandaramaya, Ven.Thiniyawala Palitha Thera that there were many charges against the conduct of some personnel posted to foreign missions but none of them have been brought to book. The Ven. Thera prevailed on the minister that the corrupt and the unqualified be recalled from their foreign postings. The Thera said that there were 37 non career diplomats in Sri Lankan missions worldwide and that was enough for the downfall of the Foreign Service.
Minister Marapana, known for his honesty and integrity and who would not hesitate to call a spade a spade, we are certain, would not brook any political interference in the matter of diplomatic appointments and will no doubt act in the best interest of the country and our foreign relations. Needless to say, our foreign service has reached a scandalous state with square pegs in round holes occupying important positions in overseas missions. Things reached the nadir when our Ambassador to the Court of St. James, no less, was assaulted by a political thug of the Rajapaksa regime who is still roaming free with no action taken. Not only that, another envoy, a nephew of the former President, is today on the run from the law in connection with a murder and a multimillion dollar arms deal. Can anything be more worse for the country's reputation?
Minister Marapana, it is hoped, would undertake a full cleanup of the foreign service and weed out the misfits and undesirables. His, of course, will be a tough job, given that there are still elements of the Rajapaksa regime manning important positions in the Foreign Ministry wielding influence and clout and who work against the interests of the Yahapalanaya government.
It (the foreign service) has also acquired the reputation of being an employments agency and a refuge for the boys and the gals of political panjandrums. All governments are guilty for this state of affairs, with the country losing on the long run. Political rejects and those requested to stand down from contesting elections are more often than not the first choice preferences for foreign postings, with the country not benefiting in any way. It is also party time for the kith and kin of politicians, their friends, relatives who are given plum appointments in our foreign missions. A close kinsman of the former President, with no qualification whatsoever, was made ambassador to the US, no less. That worthy, it is said, was concentrating his energies in furthering his business interests in that country with the least attention being paid to his job, for which he was being paid by the tax payer. The outcrop of this was that the Sri Lankan government being compelled to enlist the services of PR firms in the US to promote the image of the country spending millions of dollars. The individual in question also had the ignominy of having to spend a stint at the state guest house for a large scale swindle while being our ambassador to the US. There was also an instance where a Lankan diplomat had decamped after serving his stint oversees, sullying the image of the country.
It is hoped that Minister Marapana will stand up to political pressure and desist from appointing misfits to man our foreign missions. Career diplomats should receive priority in foreign postings. Today, it is no secret that our career diplomats are a disillusioned lot, having being overlooked for important assignments in preference to political favourites. There should be a clearly laid down ratio for foreign postings between career and non career diplomats, with the former receiving the lion's share, as was adopted during the time of Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. This is not to say diplomatic posts should not be filled with those outside the foreign service. In the past there have been non career diplomats who have excelled in the job and served the country with distinction. It has also been the trend to appoint misfits and political stooges for second tier positions in our foreign missions. These persons serve no purpose other than being a burden on the tax payer and are open to corrupt practices. They, more often than not, make use of the opportunity to educate their children in the destination country and are wont to stay put once their tour of duty is over. There was once such a specimen who sought asylum in a western country on the grounds that he was being persecuted in his own country.
Minister Marapana, no doubt, will have a tough job in bringing order out of chaos in our foreign service. He will also have to overcome the intrigue latent in the service, particular among those who have dug in their heels and resent intrusion into their well guarded preserves.
