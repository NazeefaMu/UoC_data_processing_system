AIA declares strong 9.63% dividend

AIA Sri Lanka has declared another year of consistent policyholder dividend rate, with the declared dividend of 9.63%.
AIA Sri Lanka CEO Pankaj Banerjee added, “Our continued endeavour has been to manage our assets prudently with the objective of helping our customers in building their long-term savings in a sustained manner. The consistent performance of our underlying fund is also a testimony to our research- backed and long-term objectives driven fund management philosophy.”“Our continued endeavour has been to manage our assets prudently with the objective of helping our customers in building their long-term savings in a sustained manner.

This consistency is testament to the strength and outstanding investment strategy of AIA’s life fund, which now stands at Rs. 40 Billion (Market value and rounded up as at 31 December 2017, and prior to any surplus transfers out).
AIA’s annual dividend amount declared every year has always been well above the minimum guaranteed rates declared for the respective year.
In 2013 the dividend was 9.62% and it rose to 9.88% in 2014.
