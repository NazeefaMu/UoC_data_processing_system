Immigration offences: two Lankans to be deported from UK

Two Sri Lankan men will be deported from the UK after committing immigration offences.
Home Office Immigration Enforcement officers made the arrests at Sabeeh Mini Market, Gurnards Avenue where both men work.
A 33-year-old man was found to have overstayed his student visa and a 23-year-old man was found to be a failed asylum seeker.
The business was served with a notice warning that a financial penalty of up to £20,000 per illegal worker will be imposed unless they can demonstrate that appropriate right to work document checks were carried out, such as seeing a passport or Home Office document.
Home Office Inspector Robert Tompkins said: "We are working hard to identify, arrest and remove people who are abusing the UK's immigration system.
"All of our operations are intelligence led and information from the public is a vital part of this work. I would encourage people with detailed and specific information about illegal immigration to contact us.
"Employers who use illegal labour are cheating the taxpayer, undercutting businesses who play by the rules and depriving legitimate job seekers of employment opportunities. "Those who ignore the rules, and do not carry out the simple checks to ensure their employees have the right to work in the UK, will face the consequences."
