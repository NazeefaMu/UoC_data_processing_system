Court grants special leave to appeal filed by SLMC

Challenging Appeal Court judgement to register student::
A majority of a divided Three-Judge-Supreme Court Bench yesterday, granted special leave to appeal a petition filed by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), challenging the judgement of the Court of Appeal to register a student of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of Section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court fixed the matter for argument on November 13.
The Bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Gooneratne.
The Supreme Court made order taking into consideration the lengthy submissions made by all parties in the appeal.
At a previous occasion, the Supreme Court had allowed the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) to intervene into the appeal filed by the SLMC.
Through this appeal petition, the SLMC sought an order to set aside the judgement dated January 31, 2017 by the Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgement made in the writ application bearing No. CA Writ 187/2016 by the Court of Appeal.
Delivering its judgement on the writ petition filed by a MBBS graduate of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe, the Court of Appeal on January 31, held that SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees and further held that the petitioner has legal rights to register at the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a medical practitioner in accordance with the Medical Ordinance.
The Court of Appeal had observed that the petitioner, a MBBS graduate of SAITM had no obstacle to register at the SLMC as a medical practitioner in terms of the Section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance. The Court of Appeal observed that on or around August 30, 2011, the former Higher Education Minister recognised SAITM as a degree awarding institute in terms of Section 25 (A) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. The Court of Appeal further observed that the Higher Education Minister had not taken any steps to revoke the concerned decision in terms of the Section 27 of the said Act.
“SAITM is empowered to grant MBBS degrees,” the Court observed.
In its judgment, the Court of Appeal observed that the SLMC had no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister and further observed that the SLMC had acted in violation of Section 19 of the Medical Ordinance when making regulations relating to SAITM. The Court further held that the SLMC had acted in violation of the Medical Ordinance without having any powers to do so.
