Richmond re-obtains land to construct playground

The land belonging to Richmond College, Galle, allocated for the construction of Ocean University, was handed over to Richmond College again by Science, Technology and Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama on the request of Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena.Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena was addressing the media yesterday.
He said there were over 80,000 children living in Galle and suburban areas and around 250,000 children in the entire Galle district. The main problem faced by them in addition to the students of Richmond College, was the lack of a playground.
When everything was ready to construct a playground in Kaduruduwa by Richmond College, the land was taken over for the Ocean University in 2017.
Even though we opposed it, our request was neglected. Then, the problem was discussed with Vocational Training Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and he promised to solve the matter.
