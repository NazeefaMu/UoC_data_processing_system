Contract employees to be absorbed into SLT: Harin

In answer to several protests launched by contract employees of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), asking to be absorbed into SLT, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando has proposed that the experienced and qualified among them be absorbed into the permanent cadre under four stages from 2017 to 2020.
His proposal received Cabinet approval this week.
These contract employees were being employed from Human Capital Solutions (PVT) LTD, a company set up to provide human resources to SLT.
“Their staffs are consisted of 2650 employees and 2180 of them are attached to SLT. They are paid by HCS and 1331 permanent employees are receiving a monthly salary between Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 100,000 with other benefits,”stated the Cabinet deliberations on the matter.
“Some of these employees demand that they be absorbed into SLT and if they are absorbed, SLT would have to spend an additional cost of Rs. 1.6 billion”, it further pointed out.
These SLT contract employees who have been engaged in a strike for over 80 days however point out that there is a vast gap between the salaries of permanent and contract workers for the same job and that this salary anomaly needs to be addressed.
