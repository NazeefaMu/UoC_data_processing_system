Government Medical Officers' Association calls off strike

 
The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has called off the strike it launched in the morning, after talks with Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.
Speaking to Daily News Online, GMOA Spokesperson Samantha Ananda said talks had resulted in a favourable response from the Law and Order Minister.
Earlier today at the weekly Cabinet meeting, subject ministers were entrusted with negotiating an end to ongoing trade union action.
The GMOA launched a 24-hour token strike in protest of demands unmet by the government within a stipulated period.
The demands by the GMOA are eight, and include:
All details pertaining to white van number NP – 0410 – used in the abduction attempt on Ryan Jayalath - should be disclosed to the public. Identity of those who arrived in the van to abduct Ryan Jayalath, those that gave the order and any other connection between the police and those that came in the van.
Legal action should be taken against all those that arrived in the van to abduct Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee (MFSAC) Convener Ryan Jayalath on Thursday (27). 
Assurance from the government that incidents such as Ryan Jayalath abduction will not be repeated in the future.
Government should publicly apologise to the nation for attempting to suppress the work of a student activist by attempting to abduct him.
To release all students attached to the MFSAC without charges, arrested at a protest on the weekend
Government should give written assurance to appoint an ‘acceptable’ Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President
Minimum standards on medical education should be gazetted 
Recruitment of students to SAITM should be discontinued
