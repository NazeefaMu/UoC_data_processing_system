In this regard, the Bachelor of Science Honors (Nursing) degree (128 Credits) program was implemented to bridge the gap in knowledge of the existing Sri Lankan Nursing to be a profession on par with global nursing.
Currently, twelve (12) batches consisting of nearly 1500 practicing undergraduate nurses follow the BSc (Hons) in Nursing at KIU. In 2017 KIU held the first convocation and 52 nursing undergraduates were awarded BSc (Hons) in Nursing upon successful completion of their degree. The very first nursing batch commenced in 2015. This year as KIU holds its second convocation 94 nursing students of Batch 2 and 3 will graduate with a BSc. (Hons) in Nursing. As promised, KIU has kept in the scheduled time frame and this is a testament to its capability as a trustworthy and reputable organization.
