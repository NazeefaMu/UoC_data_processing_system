To meet seed paddy requirements of Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts for the 2017/18 ‘maha season,’ about 300 seed paddy nurseries will be set up in and around the Magalla water project of the Kurunegala District.
Kurunegala Agricultural Officer R.M.A.E. Chandraratne told the Daily News, high-yielding seed paddy varieties such as BG 352, BG 366, BG 300 and BW 367 are to be grown and seed paddy would be provided to farmers at concessionary rates by the NWP Ministry of Agriculture in the future.
