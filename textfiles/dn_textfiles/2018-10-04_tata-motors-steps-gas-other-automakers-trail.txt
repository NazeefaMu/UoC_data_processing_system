Tata Motors steps on gas as other automakers trail

Even as most car manufacturers witnessed a decline in domestic sales in September due to high fuel and product prices, Tata Motors’ performance was significant.
The passenger vehicles (PV) division of Tata Motors reported 7% growth in domestic sales as compared to the same period last year. All carmakers other than Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Kirloskar reported contraction in passenger vehicle sales in the latest period, from a year earlier.
Maruti Suzuki reported 0.7% growth in passenger vehicles sales, which included multi purpose vehicles and passenger cars. During the period, Maruti sold 1.4% less passenger cars as compared to the same period last year.
Hyundai reported a decline of 4.5%, while Mahindra sold 16% less passenger vehicles in the domestic market.
The domestic sales of Honda Motors were down 19%, while Ford Motors sold 6.4% less cars in India as compared with the same period last year. Toyota Kirloskar reported a growth of 1.43%.
The spectacular show by Tata Motors in September clearly indicates that the company’s new generation cars are now finding buyers even in difficult times. It also gives credence to the company’s submission that the turnaround plan is panning out well.
The company’s PV division reported domestic sales of 18,429 units compared with 17,286 units in September last year, a 7% rise. This is the third consecutive month when sales at the passenger vehicles division grew significantly, while the industry sales shrank. “The continuous strong demand for our new generation vehicles has led to this consistent month-on-month growth,” Tata Motors said.
The small hatchback Tiago continues to attract new customers with the recent introduction of Tiago NRG. Tiago sales have crossed 300 units per day. SUV Nexon has been accepted well. So has Hexa. “Nexon AMT and Nexon KRAZ limited edition have received an overwhelming response, witnessing good traction in the market,” Tata Motors said.
