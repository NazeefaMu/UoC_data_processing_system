Ranjith Soyza laments removal as party organiser

Joint Opposition parliamentarian Ranjith Soyza yesterday expressed regret over his removal from the post of Rakwana Organiser at the behest of UNPers.
He said he had worked for the party tirelessly. “I am a committed member of the party and worked for the party's victory at elections”, he said.
Addressing a press conference organized by SLPP in Colombo, Soyza said two of his family members were killed and their houses and vehicles were burnt in the night of December 31, 2001 during former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga's tenure.
He further said people are no longer with the SLFP as the party has deviated from its longstanding policies and over 95 per cent of SLFP members are supporting the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna.
