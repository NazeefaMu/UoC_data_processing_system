Last-gasp Savea gives Canes win over Highlanders

WELLINGTON, FRIDAY: Ardie Savea returned from suspension to score a crucial, last-gasp try as the Wellington Hurricanes beat the Otago Highlanders 27-20 to boost their Super Rugby play-off hopes on Friday.
Savea, one of five players dropped last week for missing a team curfew, scored twice, his second in the final minute, as the Hurricanes ran in three tries to two in a rematch of last year's final.
The win puts the Hurricanes two points ahead of the Highlanders in the ultra-competitive New Zealand conference, where the battle for finals spots is set to go down to the wire.
It also gives the Hurricanes some revenge after their heartbreaking loss to the Highlanders in the 2015 final, the last time they hosted Otago at Westpac Stadium.
Skipper Dane Coles said the Hurricanes were finally finding last year's red-hot form and it was a shame Super Rugby was heading into an international break after this round. “It's unfortunate we have a break but we'll take a lot of confidence from this,” he said, after the high-tempo contest despite wet conditions in Wellington. “Once we come back we've got a big challenge and every game's a must-win for us.”
The Hurricanes were bolstered by the return of the five suspended players, who included Julian Savea and his uncapped brother Ardie. Both appear set to be named Sunday in the All Blacks squad for the upcoming three-Test series against Wales.
Cory Jane, another returnee from the naughty corner, also excelled, playing a part in the Hurricanes first two tries. The 53-Test winger, who last played for the All Blacks in November 2014, is tipped to head to Japan at the end of the season if he is omitted from the squad to face Wales.
He sparked the opening try in the 13th minute when his break on the wing started an attack that culminated in Ardie Savea racing past his markers to dot down between the posts.
Jane was involved again when TJ Perenara burst from the back of a scrum and the winger flicked the ball on to Brad Shields for the Hurricanes’ second five-pointer.
Lima Sopoaga clawed one back for the Highlanders, powering through Victor Vito's tackle after Malakai Fekitoa's run set him up.
Sopoaga almost created another with an audacious backwards chip kick but the Highlanders lost possession and went into the break trailing 17-7.They caught the Hurricanes napping early in the second half, with Dan Lienert-Brown scoring a try two minutes after the restart.
With the scores locked at 20-20 in the final minutes, a wayward Beauden Barrett penalty kick appeared to have squandered the Hurricanes’ chance of victory. AFP
