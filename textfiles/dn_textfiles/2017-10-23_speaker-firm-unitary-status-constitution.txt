Speaker firm on unitary status of Constitution

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, vowed that he will never give his consent to any constitutional reform that will put the country, its people, Buddhism or any other religion into jeopardy.
The Speaker, allaying anxieties and fears in some sections of society over the constitutional making process, stressed that people should rely on him and that he will never endorse any law that is detrimental to the country.
Speaking at a ceremony at a Catholic church in Mirigama, he assured that there was no secret draft of the Constitution,adding that the interim report only contains proposals of various parties.
“Various proposals may come up including those of dividing the country. Parliament collectively will decide on them and the final draft copy will be presented to each and every religious leader. It will only be finalised after that.
Thereafter, I have to approve it as the Chairman of the Constitutional Assembly. I hereby pledge that I will not approve anything detrimental to the country, its people or any religion,” he said.
The Speaker, pointing out that no legislation would pass into law without his signature, requested the people not to be carried away by misinformation on constitutional making.
The Constitutional Assembly is to take up a three-day debate on constitutional reforms based on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee from October 30 to November 1.
