Increase in dentists

At present, around 2,000 dentists serve in Sri Lanka. When I entered university, the number was around 35, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, only 10 or 12 students were recruited to the Dental Faculty in the late 1940s. The Peradeniya University had produced around 2,500 dentists during the past seven years, he said.
The minister was addressing the Annual Scientific Sessions of the Sri Lanka Dental Association, in Colombo, recently. Minister Senaratne pointed out that the dentist profession commenced over 100 years ago. Post intern programmes for dentists will commence soon in Sri Lanka, he said, adding that Sri Lanka has dental institutes with all modern medical equipment and technology.
The association maintains a close relationship with dentists in the country which helps their educational and professional development, the minister added.
