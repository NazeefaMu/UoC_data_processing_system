Pitt’s ‘World War Z’ sequel to not release in 2017

Actor Brad Pitt’s ‘World War Z 2’ has been pulled off the 2017 release calendar.
Paramount and Skydance will not release the sequel of the 2013-film this year, confirmed The Hollywood Reporter.
The movie was previously slated to hit the theatres on June 9. But the date was pushed further when the project lost director JA Bayona last year.
Sources say Paramount now hopes to have the film ready for 2018 or 2019.
Along with ‘World War Z 2,’ the producers have also removed ‘Friday the 13th,’ which was set to hit theatres on October 13 earlier, has also been struck off from the schedule. PTI
