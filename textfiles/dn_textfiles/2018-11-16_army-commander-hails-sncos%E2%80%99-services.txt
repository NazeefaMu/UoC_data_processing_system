Army Commander hails SNCOs’ services

The Sri Lanka Army organised a ceremony to appreciate and award the services of retired and potential retiring Regimental Sergeant Majors (RSMs) and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs), at the Defence Services College (DSC) auditorium on Wednesday.
The ceremony, held for this category of SNCOs for the first time in the Army’s history, also coincided with the release of the maiden Army Drill Manual to those attendees with necessary guidelines for drills and physical training, largely executed by SNCOs as Drill Instructors (DIs) in the Army.
“It is you who are quite close to the heart of the soldier at ground level and can be a model to the junior soldier who would be always imitating you. When you behave and work protecting the dignity of your position, the junior soldier would also admire you and aspire to be what you are one day,” said Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, speaking at the event.
The Chief Guest awarded service appreciation certificates to a representative group of former SNCOs and potential retirees, after which the Army Commander was invited to release the maiden Army Drill Manual (Sinhala Edition), produced by the Directorate of Personnel Administration as the first instructional booklet of this nature on drill training.
Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force Commandant Major General Rukmal Dias, Principal Staff Officers, Senior Officers, Colonel of the Regiments and Colonel Commandants, Centre Commandants, Officers, Other Rankers were among those who attended the ceremony.
