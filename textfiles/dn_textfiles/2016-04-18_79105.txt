Two more wins for Lankan men's team

The Sri Lankans hockey team scored two more wins to secure a berth in the men's championship of the World League first round hockey tournament now being played in Singapore.
Sri Lankan men stickers scored their second win of the tournament when they trounced Thailand by the big margin 5-0 after lending 3-0 at the breather. The coach of the men's hockey team Anuruddha Herath Bandara said that the men stickers were in excellent spirit and kept attacking from the word go, thus giving the opponents no chance whatsoever to recover.
Some of the new comers in the team were in good form and should consolidate their places in the future.
It was centre forward Anuradha Ratnayake who made early in roads into the opponents by scoring two quick goals which upset them and made it difficult to stage a rally.
