World Suicide Prevention Day Sept. 10    -‘Take a minute – change a life’

Suicides have become a common occurrence which is a threat to the world today. As it is a global problem, everybody’s wish had been to reduce the rate of suicides or completely stop suicides.
It has been reported that during the year 1995, Sri Lanka had recorded the highest number of suicides. Even the Presidential Task Force was set up during that period to mitigate this situation.
According to global statistics, nearly 800,000 suicides are reported from various countries annually, while this number was higher than those killed by wars or homicides. The locally established Sumithrayo organization which is located in Colombo, is very keen on this subject and their sole objective is to completely stop the committing of suicides. They travel throughout the country and conduct various programmes to reduce the rate of suicides.
The Sumithrayo will commemorate the day to coincide with the `World Suicide Prevention Day’ on September 10 under the theme ‘Take a minute – change a life’ at the Independence Square, Colombo . The objective of the programme is to motivate the whole nation on the negative side of suicides and reduce the number of suicides. The Day is endorsed by the World Health Organization.
This is an evening programme and it would commence from 5.00 pm to 8.00pm. The programme is open to the general public.
