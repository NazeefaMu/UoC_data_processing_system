ICC U19 Cricket World Cup Super League
Pakistan beat South Africa for place in semi-finals

A composed 74 not out from Ali Zaryab ensured that the hard work of fast bowlers Muhamad Musa and Shaheen Afridi did not go waste when he guided Pakistan to a three-wicket victory over South Africa in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup Super League quarter-final in Christchurch.
In front of broadcast cameras, left-handed Zaryab compiled a cautious but attractive 111-ball knock, with five fours, that took two-time champions Pakistan to their target of 190 in 47.5 overs after the pace-duo of Musa and Shaheen had shared five scalps to help restrict South Africa to 189 for nine.
The victory over the 2014 champions means Pakistan will now play the winners of Friday’s quarter-final between India and Bangladesh in the second semi-final in Christchurch on 30 January.
The 2004 and 2006 champions have to be thankful to Zaryab, who was not perturbed even as the Asian side was reduced to 111 for five after all-rounder Jason Niemand gave South Africa a glimmer of a hope with the wickets of captain Hassan Khan and Muhammad Taha.
But in Saad Khan (26, 62b, 3x4), Zaryab found an able partner and added 65 crucial runs for the sixth wicket, which proved to be decisive in a low-scoring affair.
This was Zaryab’s third half-century in the tournament and second successive player of the match award after his 59 in another low-scoring match against Sri Lanka had ensured Pakistan not only qualified for the Super League but eventually topped their group ahead of Afghanistan.
South Africa 189-9 in 50 overs (Wandile Makwetu 60, Jason Niemand 36; Muhammad Musa 3-29, Shaheen Afridi 2-30)
Pakistan 190-7 in 47.5 overs (Ali Zaryab 74 n.o., Saad Khan 26; Jason Niemand 2-31)
Player of the match: Ali Zaryab (Pakistan)
