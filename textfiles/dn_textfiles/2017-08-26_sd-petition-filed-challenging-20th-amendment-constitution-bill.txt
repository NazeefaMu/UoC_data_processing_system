SD petition filed challenging 20th Amendment to the Constitution bill

A Special Determination petition challenging the Bill titled “Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution” was filed before the Supreme Court by Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila seeking a declaration that the Bill shall become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner stated that a Bill titled “Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution” was presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on August 22, 2017.
The petitioner stated that Clauses 02, 03 and 04 of the Bill are inconsistent with Article 3, 4, 83 and Chapter 17, more fully Article 154E, 154C, 154G of the constitution in as much as: clause 2 and 3 of the bill has the effect of postponing the date of the Provincial Council elections which is to be held in any province and therefore would affect the franchise of the people. Clause 4 of the bill will have the effect of depriving the power of the Provincial Council and transferring the same to the Parliament.
This special determination petition was filed through counsel Anusha Perusinghe.
