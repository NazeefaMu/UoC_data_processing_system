Grand  conclusions and islanders skills

What a fabulous and gruelling season this league has been ...right from the word go ...decent match scripts crafted by seasoned experts carefully concealed in their tested armchairs Ö? And performance levels that showed a degree of meticulous preparation.
There was little doubt or hesitation about the inform quality or ability to change gears as required....or to motor up the park, win the turnover and plenty for that bank of expert finishers to seal the deal.
Kandy quite pleasingly averaged 30+ per game and 40+ if at home inside the Nittawela cauldron. Their fanatical fans enjoying the form whatever the weather or special magic the visiting opposition, threw at them. The inevitability of the big W Ögrowing stronger with each game they played and gelled as a team.
What a grand season for skipper Gayan, grabbing the double and good news at home too ...his personal performance level marching up together with his team's ...and closing the challenge without breaking a sweat ...half time scores mighty misleading...
except for CH&FC and Havelocks pushing them down to the wire ...Life was pleasing ...with nothing missing, both sides of the pitch.
The achievement a telling testament to the lionís passion for the code and discipline to keep wracking ....up the big {W's}...with solid tactics to finish as they had planned ...fundamentally, a degree of patience that clearly set them apart from all clubs in Sri.
Both league and Clifford Cup Öthe glittering Dialog/Sri Lanka rugby partnership shining bright into the Colombo skyline...with the game stepping up past all issues that sounded a few alarms?
The TMO and referee button, always good to wire up our soapbox brigade and pundits with lots to chew. All part of the game and much glamour to boot ...with our warriors on film.
Much will waxed about how we get this game to the next level...and can our islanders league step up to match the pro Japanese or Hong Kong league structure anytime soon?
Will expatriates be allowed back to boost gates and balloon the season at the highest altitude of quality?
Will there be separate investment for clubs to handle the facility and player upgrades next season?
Will there be more floodlit games next season....which really make it a telling experience for players and fans?
Will the other clubs install floodlights and TV facilities?
Will there be giant screen replays at all matches in division 1 2018/19?
A few relevant thoughts that need careful scrutiny and a good kick upstairs to add to our islanders league....progress must be the beacon to guide our rugby thru troubled waters and calm winds to see us home.
The school season looms with mega anticipation and a lot more besides...it's billed to be the most competitive ever and old boy association season, bigger than ever!
The phenomenon of school rugby is beyond conventional contemplation...it's really a magical mystery tour of our rugby rich stables ...parents, teachers, school old boys and coaching staff to complete the holy alliance.
The endurance of craft and strategy, the most vital components for a successful campaign in division 1 ...player and injury management sharing the same priority for the duration, on the same platform.
Much is being said about teams with traditional strength ...but expect everything...an all or nothing theory each game this season...starting March 2.
I am impressed with the rest of our rugby family about the quality and set up for all the top division teams ...even more telling is the fans and following...serious numbers to support and inspire performance every subsequent week ...irrespective it is a massive adrenaline charged fixture list and food to everyone there...family and school kids to see their colours stand up under pressure...
Let's wish all the stables islandwide for the best competition ever. It's all about skills, heart, fitness and mind that separate the better team in the middle. Preparation is key and arming these young warriors with principles and respect is vital ...the essence of clean hard natural is key to everyone being a winner.
I understand it is a difficult concept to grasp ...but I rather think it a vital intravenous shot of pure rugby values be inculcated and drilled into all school players from U12 up ...that way we breed a generation of true pure rugby knights, who live the code and the values that stand us islanders apart from day 1.
The stage is set ...the international 7s season bids our national squad a warm welcome to the Hong Kong 7s...my mind racing with intimidating impact and heaps of colours that made the trip absolutely unforgettable...9 player visits and the mind still warmed up for more!
Blessings to our 7s team and hopes for inspiration after the club season, let's get our 7s muscles twitching as required, the mind performance ready and the body armed for the tour.
Bula bula Sri islanders...big hearts, bigger minds!
