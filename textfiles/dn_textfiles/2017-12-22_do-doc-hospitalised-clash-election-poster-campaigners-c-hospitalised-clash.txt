Do Doc hospitalised in clash with election poster campaigners c hospitalised in clash with election poster campaigners

A doctor attached to the Mahiyangana Base Hospital was injured following a clash which erupted between him and a group of persons engaged in a poster campaign of a Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna’s election candidate contesting for the Minipe Pradeshiya Saba.
According to Hasalaka Police sources, the doctor was attacked by the group at the Weragoda, Paalama Handiya area at 11.50 p.m on the 19th. Following the attack, he had been admitted to the Mahiyangana Base Hospital and later transferred to the Badulla General Hospital for further treatment.
Following the incident, doctors on of the OPD section of the Mahiyangana hospital, have been refraining from their services demanding the Police to take the suspects into custody.
However, it was reported that the patients faced immense hardships with the boycott of the doctors. Patients pointed out that the doctors’ action was not ethical, since the Police should be given a reasonable time to take the suspects into custody. It is not justifiable for doctors to go for trade union action immediately after the clash, without giving reasonable time for the Police to take the suspects into custody.
