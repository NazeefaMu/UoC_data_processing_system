Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority Director General Gotabaya Jayaratne told the Daily News that 295,000 Mahaweli farmer families will contribute in this venture. President Maithripala Sirisena declared the Food Production Year 2018 programme at the Vap Magul ceremony held recently at Thibbatuwawa paddy field in Kekirawa in Huruluwewa Mahaweli Zone. This paddy field, extending 11 acres, will be maintained as a permanent model paddy cultivation area.
“Our target is to grow paddy in 105,000 hectares in the Mahaweli development zones during the Maha season. Already, we have launched a programme to distribute agriculture appliances, seeds etc. to our farmer community on a 50 percent subsidized basis. Every officer, including the unit managers, as well as farmers have been given a target to be achieved at the zonal level,” the Director General said.Meanwhile, it is planned to select the Best All-rounder Mahaweli Farmer of the 2017/2018 Maha season under the theme ‘Let’s go together - standup - let's fill our granaries.’ The ceremony will be held in August 2018 at Galnewa Mahaweli esplanade.
Referring to the current Maha cultivation seasonal activities, Jayaratne said the highest percentage of paddy harvest per hectare in the agricultural history was recorded in Mahaweli H area during the 2015/2016 Maha cultivation season. The Mahaweli farmers are being encouraged to achieve the target of seven metric tons per hectare in the Maha season. Mahaweli farmers are striving dedicatedly to enhance the harvest. During the recent drought, farmers in Mahaweli H area were able to produce 350,000 metric tons of soya, adequate to fulfill the country's seed soya requirement, Jayaratne pointed out.
