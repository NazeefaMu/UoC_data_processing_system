Kittel claims first stage in Dubai

DUBAI: Germany’s Marcel Kittel claimed the Tour of Dubai’s opening stage in a sprint from Dutch rival Dylan Groenewegen on Tuesday.
Quick Step rider Kittel won two stages of the race last year on his way to overall victory. Briton Mark Cavendish came in third after the 181 kilometre stage which finished on the man-made archipelago of Palm Jumeirah. Wednesday’s second of five stages is a 188km ride from Dubai to Ras al-Khaimah, one of the seven-member United Arab Emirates. AFP
