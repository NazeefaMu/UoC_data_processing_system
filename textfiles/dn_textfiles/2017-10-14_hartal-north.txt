Hartal in North

A Hartal was launched in the Northern Province demanding that the authorities release political prisoners who have been detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act without cases being filed in courts.
Shops in the Mullaitivu, Killinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar and Jaffna districts were kept closed and public transport service came to a standstill yesterday.
A number of protests were held in Jaffna, Killinochchi and many other areas yesterday with the support of Tamil political parties and civil societies.
Thousands of people seeking services from government institutions were inconvenienced as a few officials turned up for duty yesterday. All schools in the province were virtually closed due to poor attendance of students and teachers.
