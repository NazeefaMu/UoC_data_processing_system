Halt this trend

Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is generally known for speaking his mind, an attribute which most cite as the cause for his loss at the 2010 Presidential Election. He is known to call a spade a spade and make sweeping statements not caring whom he rubs on the wrong side. However some of his utterances ought to be taken seriously by the authorities, lest the Government leaders be held in ridicule by the public.
Responding to journalists the other day on the fate that awaits IGP Pujith Jayasundera and if there was any truth in the speculation the controversial Police Chief was to receive a posting as Sri Lanka’s envoy to South Korea, Field Marshal Fonseka said that the country has a history of sending sacked IGPs as Foreign Ambassadors.
Of course, the Minister may have had in mind the posting received by a former IGP as the country’s envoy to Brazil under the Rajapaksa regime. This was after a youth who was among the participants of a massive protest in Katunayake against the Government’s move to fiddle with their EPF benefits was killed in a police shooting. The Police Chief, instead of being hauled over the coals and subjected to a disgraceful exit, was given a kick upstairs, so to speak, and provided with a pleasant life in the exotic land of the Samba, at the cost of the taxpayer. It was the same mode that was applied for giving a diplomatic post to the Army Officer responsible for firing into the Rathupaswala protestors that killed three youths.
To any rational thinking mind this indeed is a dangerous trend. For, we will soon have a scenario where an IGP who enjoys the patronage of the powers that be ordering his personnel to deploy criminal force in dispersing protests knowing that a diplomatic post is there for the asking if things happen to go wrong. Needless to say, these ex-police or military officers who had so been privileged to serve as diplomats, without any qualifications for the job, would only feel obliged to serve their leaders who were responsible for affording such a privilege. The Ex-Army commanders and top military officers now disporting themselves with prominence at the “Eliya” and “Viyath Maga” political shows of aspiring Pohottuwa Presidential candidate Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, tell a tale.
The practice of appointing police or military personnel suspected of criminal acts, for diplomatic posts should be halted. Sri Lanka has already suffered the ignominy of some of its diplomatic postings of retired military personnel being rejected by the host country, whether the accusations against them were valid or not. This would not only be damaging to the country but liable for the country’s leaders to be viewed in poor light (for making such appointments).
It is incumbent for the Government to demonstrate its gratitude to the servicemen for their sacrifices made for the country, but such personnel could be provided with suitable occupations at home. Sri Lanka’s diplomatic service has already earned a bad name, for the appointment of misfits and relatives and cronies of certain politicians.
A trend also had emerged during the Rajapaksa era where Supreme Court Judges were made Ambassadors upon retirement. This led to much controversy, with the whole question of the independence of the judiciary called into question. Will any Judge act independently in a case challenging the State, when the prospect of an Ambassadorship is being dangled before his/her eyes. There was an instance where a former Chief Justice was appointed to the Court of St. James under the Rajapaksa Presidency, while another ex-CJ was made legal advisor to the President.
While no aspersions can be cast on the two retired CJ’s, how this will reflect on the public perception of the independence of the judiciary is the question. That our Judiciary is not without judicial officers with mettle was brought home by the defiant stand of the country’s first Lady Chief Justice, who stood up to the might of the Rajapaksas.
It is time that the whole matter of our Ambassadorial appointments be made transparent and above board. The routine rubber-stamping of appointments by the Parliamentary High Posts Committee (PHPC) should be brought under scrutiny. How such individuals such as Jaliya Wickamasuriya (USA) and Udayanga Weeratunga (Russia) passed muster with the PHPC is anybody’s guess. With the Right to Information Laws now being made use by various civil society groups and individuals to bring irregularities to light, this aspect too should engage their attention.
It is not suggested that only career diplomatic should be called upon to man our Foreign Desks. There have been outstanding individuals, outside the Foreign Service, in the past, who held themselves with aplomb and brought credit to the country. It is however regrettable that our diplomatic service had turned out to be a veritable employment agency for the kith and kin of politicians, favoured businessmen and also political rejects. This administration has by and large avoided this situation and it should continue to be so. A professional Foreign Service is essential to project a good image of the country to the world.
