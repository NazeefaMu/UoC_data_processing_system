‘JVP only political party with no corruption charges’

Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Propaganda Secretary Tilvin Silva yesterday said that the JVP is the only political party with no corruption charges and the people should take that matter into consideration before they cast their votes to elect members for the local government bodies.
‘Free from fraud and corruption’ has become the hot campaign slogan of most of the local government election candidates, Silva said, urging the public to identify true anti-corruption voices since most of the politicians who raise their voices against fraud and corruption are not genuine.
JVP Propaganda Secretary charged that most of the members of the local government bodies use their membership as a licence to engage in illegal practices.
He told the media, after handing over nominations, that he would urge the people to use their votes wisely and put an end to the corrupt political culture in the country.
All the political parties which ruled the country had proved that they cannot do anything to eliminate fraud and corruption.
Even the present government which came in to power promising to make a country free from fraud and corruption also engaged in massive corruption and they failed to take action against persons with corruption charges, Silva said.
