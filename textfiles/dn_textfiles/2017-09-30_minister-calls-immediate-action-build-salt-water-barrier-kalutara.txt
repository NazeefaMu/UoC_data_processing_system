Minister calls for immediate action to build salt water barrier in Kalutara

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has instructed officials to accelerate planning and constructing the barrier to be established at a cost of Rs. 3 billion to prevent salt water from mixing to drinking water in the Kalutara district, Health Ministry spokesman said.

Around 135,000 people in the Kalutara district receive drinking water from the Kethhena Water Supply Scheme and over 60,000 people undergo severe difficulties due to lack of drinking water for over six months since drinking water gets mix up with sea water through the Kalu ganga, he said.
The Water Supply Board provided drinking water for the affected people during the last five months.
The barrier will be constructed 4.5 km above the estuary of Kalu ganga, he said.
