Make life less difficult

The four broad dimensions in the world of Dr M Scott Peck, titled as ‘The Road Less Travelled’ go as follows: discipline, love, growth and religion, grace. In these dimensions, Dr Scott Peck, a practising clinical psychologist and pyschotherapist has drawn material from his observations, readings, research, notes, clinical diagnosis and teachings over a period of four decades.
At the outset, Dr Scott Peck states that through psychotherapy it is possible to trace the etiology and development of a neurosis in exactitude and precision that is seldom matched elsewhere in medical sciences. The work is subtitled as the new psychology of love, traditional values, and spiritual growth.
According to Dr Scott Peck, it is possible to come to know exactly and precisely when and where and why an individual develops particular neurotic ions as laid down by the symptom or behaviour pattern. It is also possible to know with equal exactitude and precision, how, when and where and why a particular neurosis can be cured or has been healed. From a synoptic point of view the book titled as ‘The Road Less Travelled’ is an many ways and a readable narrative on the human existence.
Subsequently each of the dimensions embody the interpretations as laid down by the writer cum psychologist M Scott Peck. As he notes in the preface, the ideas and interpretations as laid down herein presented stem for the most part, from his day to day clinical work with patients as they struggled to avoid or to gain ever great levels of maturity as a result the work embraces portions of actual case histories, confidential notes and dialogues that ensued between the patient and the doctor.
In many ways, the reader of my calibre will gain insights into creative modes of psychotherapy, which is noted not as a brief process, but an ongoing medico-theatric treatment. The work too resembles socio spiritual interpretations to individual social behaviour.
At the outset two assumptions according to the writer underlie the book. One is that the writer makes no distinction between the mind and the spirit, and therefore no distinction between the process of achieving spiritual growth and achieving mental growth. They are one at the same. The other assumption is that the process is a complex, arduous and lifelong task. The work as a whole is not meant to be a pedagogical function for a special group of readers.
It is meant for the general reader who wishes to know of himself and how he exists in a social group. As such, the moving pages bring to light quite a number of human experiences of varying types that could be browsed as sensitive narratives resembling narrative poems, parables and dictums. At times reference is made to poems of Khalil Gibran and to evangelical hymns of America. They go to express the ways of living of human groups and the way the individuals, facial struggles to overcome barriers both mental and physical.
In the very first opening chapter the learned writer refers to the first of the four noble truths which the Buddha taught as life is suffering. The writer sets forth with a short sentence, life is difficult, and interpret it as a great truth. Then he states that it is a great truth because once we see the truth, we transcend it. Once we truly know that life is difficult and once we truly understand and accept it, then life is no longer difficult. Because once it is accepted, the fact that life is a difficult no longer matters.
In the introductory chapter, facts and situations pertaining to such matters as gratification, repertoire, escape from freedom, dedication to reality, openness to challenge, facts pertaining to depression, problem-solving processes, nature of neurosis and chamber disorders are brought to the forefront. They are further analysed and interpreted in the social dimension titled as love. This embraces topics such as love defined, falling in love, the myth of romantic love, ego boundaries, dependency, self sacrifice, is love a mere feeling, love as a discipline mystery of love etc. With a lot of human interest stories, the writer utilizes examples drawn from his case studies of young lovers as well as married ones who have faced issues pertaining to the subject.
As a writer, he seems to be fascinated by source material drawn from religious sources. For example clarifying the concept of the nature of power, the writer says:
“It is a much misunderstood subject. One reason for the misunderstanding is that there are two kinds of power – political and spiritual religious mythology takes pains to draw the distinction between the two. Prior to the birth of the Buddha, for instance, the soothsayers informed his father that the Buddha would grow up to become the most powerful king in the land or else a poor man who would be the greatest spiritual leader the world ever known.”
Either or, but not both.
Three significant case studies pertaining to the subject of psychotherapy are ‘the case of Kathy’, ‘the case of Marcia’ and ‘the case of Theodore’. These case studies revolve round varying types of mental disorders caused as a result of varying circumstantial problems. Having laid down the solutions, the writer says that as human being grow in discipline and love and life experience their understanding of the world and their place in it naturally grows apace. Conversely, as people fail to grow in discipline, love and experience, so does their understanding fail to grow.
The writer emphasised that the understanding could be deemed as our religion. Since everyone has some understanding – some world view – no matter how limited or primitive or inaccurate – everyone has a religion of his or her own. This fact, not widely recognized, is of the utmost importance, as everyone has a religion.
The writer cum psychiatrist takes us form the mundane plane of living to a superior state of thinking on the various aspects of living. This view reaches a climax in the last dimension titled as ‘grace’. He attempts to introduce the aspect of the miracle of health. The miracle of the unconscious, the miracle of serendipity, the miracle of evolution in the light of new discoveries in traditional social values and its impact on spiritual growth valid in a new social order.
The writer attempts to interpret some of the salient aspects of mental illnesses via the age old Greek and Indian myths. One such example is drawn from the Greek source of the myth of Orestes and the Fairies giving reference to many a verse as laid down in Edith Hamilton’s Mythology. The factor of the god-given punishment for a crime is interpreted via new discoveries in human behaviour patterns.
The closing lines of the learned writer go as follows:
“The best therapist for one person may not be the best for another. Each person, therapist and patient is unique, and you must rely on your own unique intuitive judgment. Because there is some rush involved, I wish you luck!”
