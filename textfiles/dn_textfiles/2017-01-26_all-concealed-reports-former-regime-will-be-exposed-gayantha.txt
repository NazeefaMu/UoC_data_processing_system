All concealed reports of former regime will be exposed: Gayantha

The government will go into all the reports that were concealed by the former government with regard to its financial dealings, Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
Stating that the Bond issue proved the Government’s transparency, the Minister said investigations are being conducted regarding the reports that were concealed by the former regime and they will be disclosed to the public.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department he said the Cope Committee Report has been presented to the Attorney General’s department to take legal action and a presidential commission also has been appointed to investigate into the issue.
“Under the former government none of the reports were presented for an open discussion and they were all locked up. The chairmanship of any committee was not given to the opposition member. Today, many ask if the the government forgotten as to what happened to those reports. We are very well aware what happened to the Greek Bond, Hedging bond, the DEW Gunasekara report and many others”, he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the delay in prosecution of wrongdoers , the Minister said there has been a delay but measures are being taken to quicken the process by appointing a commission.
Deputy Minister of Parliamantary Reforms & Mass Media Karunarathna Paranawithana said the investigations are being conducted to a greater extent. And added that the Attorney General’s department and the courts are responsible for it.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said several cases have been handed over to the Bribery commission, FCID and CID.
“There is a delay in conducting the investigations. The Government does not interfere into these matters and this could be one of the reasons for the delay. Independent commissions carry out their duties independently under the present government”, he said.
Minister Senaratne said the commissions failed to give prominence to the important cases but started investigating all the cases adding that this wasx one of points that even the Attorney General raised.
The Attorney General’s department had to face immense problems under the former government and it was fully controlled by the former president and it is not the same now, he said.
He further said the loss due to the Greek Bond was around 20 Billion and loss due Hedging agreement must be more than that.
