'Bhikkhu Kathikawatha' Bill will be debated in Parliament'

President Maithripala Sirisena said the 'Bhikkhu Kathikawatha' Bill to be presented in Parliament, is not the ultimate Bill and the acceptance, rejection or amendments to it will be prepared with the consent of the Nayaka Theras of the Tri Nikayas.
He made these remarks addressing a felicitation ceremony to honour Bhikkhus and lay people of Amarapura Chapter as well as the Remembrance of Pioneers of the Amarapura Chapter, held at the BMICH on Monday.
The President said that the drafting of this Bill did not take place following the establishment of the new government and it has been drafted according to a request made by the Maha Sangha 25 years ago.
He also said that every government that came to the power had taken certain steps in this regard and the present government is also engaged in a similar task with the advice and guidance of the Maha Sangha.
President Sirisena said that after completing the drafting of the Bill, and before the Bill is presented to Parliament, it will be sent to the Maha Sangha. He said he has given instructions to the Ministers, including the Prime Minister and the Minister of Buddha Sasana to present the Bill to the Tri Nikayas' Sanga Nayaka Theras to seek their consent in this regard.
"While further strengthening the existing provisions regarding Buddhism in the Constitution, the government will take every possible step to develop the Buddha Sasanaya," he added.
Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya, the Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammawasa Anunayaka Thero and Ven. Professor Kandegoda Wimaladhamma Thera, were felicitated at this ceremony for their immense contribution in developing the Amarapura Nikaya and the Buddha Sasanaya. Prof. M. U. de Silva and L. H Piyasena were also felicitated at this ceremony for their service to the Amarapura Nikaya.
More than 1,000 bhikkus, Ministers Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Patali Champaka Ranawaka and others participated.
