Agro Nutrition honored at Most Innovative Exporter Category National Chamber of Exporters awards

Agro Nutrition (Pvt) Limited an exporter of medicine for animal husbandry sector was honored at the recently held Most Innovative Exporter Category National Chamber of Exporters awards ceremony in Colombo Hilton. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was the chief guest at the event.
Managing Director, Agro Nutrition (Pvt) Limited Prabath Fonseka said that his products are made out of more natural material and herbal products and due to this there is an increase demand in the world.
"Sri Lanka has rich bio-diversity but sadly authorities are paying less attention to R&D. However in contrast our company has taken an initiative and hired University graduates and as a result we have come out with new products.”
Fonseka said that the European Union countries expect extensive clinical reports for all natural products, which are very expensive to carry out in those countries. 'The lack of facilities to do extensive clinical research in our laboratories has resulted in our losing many opportunities to tap unexploited areas in herbal exports, he said.
"We can develop new herbal products but the biggest problem is getting validations for our researched products from local research institutions. Therefore, we have to either go to Singapore or to Europe for such certification, which is very costly, Fonseka added.
His products include, Vitamin Mineral Premixes, Water Soluble Powders, Oral Liquids, Wound Healing Spray Multivitamin Amino Oral Liquids, Antibiotics, Acidifiers, Dewormers and Toxin Binder.
