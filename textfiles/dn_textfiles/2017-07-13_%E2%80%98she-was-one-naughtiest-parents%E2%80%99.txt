‘She was one of the naughtiest parents’

Princes William and Harry remember their mother Princess Diana
Millions remember her as the fairy tale Royal bride arriving at St Paul’s Cathedral for her marriage to Prince Charles, or in sadder times, revealing on television how “there were three of us in this marriage”.
But for her two sons Princess Diana will always be their mischievous mother, whose love of life and fun was infectious.
The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry speak for the first time about Diana, Princess of Wales, as a mother, in a documentary to be shown later this month, to mark the 20th anniversary of her death.
In it Prince Harry says: “This is the first time that the two of us have ever spoken about her as a mother. She was our mum. She still is our mum.
“And of course, as a son I would say this, she was the best mum in the world. She smothered us with love, that’s for sure.” He adds: “She was one of the naughtiest parents.”
Prince William appears to suggest in the documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, that his mother’s sense of fun came in part from her awareness of life beyond the confines of Royal protocol and duty.
The Princes looking through old family albums
“She was very informal and really enjoyed the laughter and the fun,” says William. “She understood that there was a real life outside of Palace walls.”
In one particularly poignant scene the two princes are shown leafing through a treasured photograph album put together by their mother and recall some of the most joyful and touching moments from their childhood.
Studying a photo of Diana holding him whilst pregnant with Prince Harry, William says: "Believe it or not, you and I are both in this photograph, you’re in the tummy!”
In April William and Prince Harry admitted that they failed to talk to each other enough about the death of their mother and that not doing so only made matters worse.
Speaking about the trauma they endured as children when Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris, the Princes urged people to be more open with their emotions.
The princes acknowledged in a video with the Duchess of Cambridge, released as part of their campaign to tackle mental health in Britain, that they had bottled up their feelings about her death in 1997 rather than sharing them.
The new documentary has been made by Oxford Film and Television, producers of ITV’s ‘Our Queen at 90’ and was commissioned for ITV by Jo Clinton-Davis, Controller of Factual and Sue Murphy, Head of Factual Entertainment.
Ms Clinton-Davis said: “This new ITV film will offer viewers a fresh and revealing insight into Princess Diana through the personal and intimate reflections of her two sons and of her friends and family, many of whom have never spoken before, to bring together a definitive portrait of a unique person who touched the lives of millions.”
Nick Kent, the documentary executive producer, added: “This film will show Princess Diana in a way she has never been seen before, through the eyes of the two people who knew her best.”
