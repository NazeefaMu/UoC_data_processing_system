Bangladesh beat India by 3 wickets to clinch Women's Asia Cup

KUALA LUMPUR, Sunday - Six-time defending champions India suffered a three-wicket defeat against Bangladesh in the final of the Women's Asia Cup Twenty20 cricket tournament at the Kinrara Academy Oval in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday.
After India scored 112/9, thanks to Harmanpreet Kaur's 56, Bangladesh managed to get over the line in the final ball of their innings.
Bangladesh were in control for the major part of the match. Even after Nigar Sultana (27 off 24) got out in the second ball of the 16th over, when Bangladesh were 83/4, Rumana Ahmed (23 off 22) did well to bring down the required runs to 13 off the last two overs.
In the penultimate over, Deepti Sharma gave away only four runs, keeping India in the match. In the first three deliveries of the final over, delivered by Harmanpreet, Bangladesh got six runs, including a boundary from Rumana.
Harmanpreet made it a pulsating affair by removing Sanjida Islam (7) and Rumana -- a victim of run out, in the fourth and fifth deliveries. Rumana was stopped from reaching for her second run in the penultimate delivery, meaning Bangladesh needed two runs from the last ball.
Jahanara Alam scampered for two runs off the final ball to seal Bangladesh's first title in the continental championship which had seen India winning every title since its inception in 2004.
Bangladesh had earlier in the week defeated India by seven wickets -- which was their first win over the sub-continental giants in any format.
India 112/9 in 20 overs (Harmanpreet Kaur 56; Rumana Ahmed 2/22, Khadija Tul Kubra 2/23)
Bangladesh 113-7 in 20 overs (Nigar Sultana 27, Rumana Ahmed 23; Poonam Yadav 4/9, Harmanpreet Kaur 2/19).
