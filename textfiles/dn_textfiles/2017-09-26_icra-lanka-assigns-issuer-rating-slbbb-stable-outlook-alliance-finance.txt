ICRA Lanka assigns issuer rating of [SL]BBB- with stable outlook to Alliance Finance

ICRA Lanka Limited, subsidiary of ICRA Limited, group company of Moody’s Investors Service, has assigned the issuer rating of [SL]BBB- (pronounced SL triple B minus) with a stable outlook to Alliance Finance Company PLC (“AFCP” or “the Company”). ICRA Lanka has also assigned the issue rating of [SL]BBB- (pronounced SL triple B minus) with a stable outlook to the Rs 1,000 Mn Senior Unsecured Redeemable debentures programme of the Company, currently listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
ICRA Lanka has also assigned issue ratings of [SL]BB+ (pronounced SL double B plus) with stable outlook to the Rs 480.17 Mn Subordinated Unsecured Redeemable Debentures programme and the Rs 613.14 Mn Subordinated Unsecured Redeemable Debentures programme of the company currently listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The ratings factor in the established track record of the company in the financing business, a fairly diversified lending portfolio, comfortable asset quality and a fairly diversified funding profile.
The ratings are however constrained by its high gearing and moderate profitability indicators.
The ratings take note of the strict Loan to Value (“LTV”) ratio for vehicle financing, which is expected to increase competitive pressure and impact business growth and margin expansion for the players including AFCP. ICRA Lanka takes note of the company’s initiative to diversify its portfolio, which could reduce the share of vehicle financing going forward from current levels; however, ability to grow at an optimal pace in the new target segments, namely, mortgage loans and business loans, etc., without impacting its asset quality and generating good risk adjusted returns would be critical.
AFCP is one of the older finance companies in Sri Lanka with a track record of more than 60 years. The company has presence in 89 locations (39 branches, 21 microfinance service locations, 12 gold loan centers and 17 collection centers) covering all 25 districts of the country.
The company’s key products are leasing, which accounts for 67% of the total portfolio as on June 30, 2017, followed by loans (23%), micro finance (7%,) gold loans/pawning (2%) and hire purchase (1%). In terms of asset classes, three-wheeler financing (21%), car financing (18%), lorry financing (12%), mortgage loans (9%) and van financing (8%) were the key constituents of AFCP’s portfolio.
The other key asset classes include micro finance (group lending), equipment financing, two-wheeler financing, which account for 13% of the portfolio. ICRA Lanka notes that the portfolio growth is expected to remain at about 20-25% over the near to medium term with focus on four-wheeler financing.
The company’s gross NPA ratio increased to 17.4% on March 31, 2014, from 2.2% on March 31, 2013 because of the stress on its pawning exposures. The same however improved over FY2015 and FY2016, largely on account of the large write-offs and recoveries made during the period.
As on March 31, 2017, the company reported a gross NPA of 2.1% and a net NPA of 0.8%when compared to gross NPA of 2.5% and net NPA of 0.7% in March 2016. The gross and net NPA stood at 2.6% and 1.3% as on June 30, 2017.
ICRA Lanka notes that while the asset quality indicators are comfortable presently, ability to control incremental slippages, especially in the target business segments for growth, would be a key monitorable. The ratings nevertheless take note of the strengthening in the company’s management team and internal control process and systems, which provide some comfort.
AFCP has a fairly diversified funding profile comprising retail fixed deposits, debentures and term loans from banks.
As on June 30, 2017, around 42% of the company’s funding was from deposits, while the balance was through debentures and bank loans. Going forward, the company is expecting to maintain a 45:55 share between deposits and other borrowings.
ICRA Lanka notes that Top 10 depositors accounting for 15% of the company’s total deposits as on June 30, 2017, indicates concentration in its deposits profile.
However, funding lines from 12 banks and good deposit renewal rate of 80% provides comfort from a liquidity perspective.
