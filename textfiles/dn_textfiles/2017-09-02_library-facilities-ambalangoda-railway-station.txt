Library facilities at Ambalangoda Railway Station

Ambalangoda Railway Station Master S.M.L. Siriwardena has launched a novel library project for the benefit of commuters, first buying newspapers on daily basis spending his own money.
Railway authorities have appreciated the project and have taken measures to introduce the project to other leading railway stations in the country.
Those who appreciated the project donated more books to the Railway Library of Ambalangoda. There are nearly 2,000 books on various subjects in the library now.
Lending facility became popular among the government servants who visit the station regularly. Station master Siriwardena said train passengers who had become the members of the library donate books to expand the library project.
Several organisations and the Railway Department had extended their cooperation to expand the library at the Ambalangoda Railway Station. The Railway General Manager has planned to start similar libraries in 12 leading railway stations in the country.
