Voice for all seasons

There are some who are born with a silver spoon in their mouth. Yet there are some who are born talented. Annesley Malawana was born to entertain. Beginning his musical stint from Ratnapura which also happened to be his hometown, Malawana joined hands with Clarence Wijewardena and took the Sri Lankan music scene by storm. The 1960s, 70s and 80s marked their height of success. Now around two decades later Malawana is still very much in demand and his songs are evergreen. His name is a household word today and if one were to go back to history it is a story that is embellished with achievements that speaks volumes for a voice that is a God-given gift that cannot easily be matched!
He will be celebrating his Golden Jubilee in music with a grand musical show titled ‘50 Year Reflection’. It will be held on August 6 at the BMICH at 7pm. Some original members of the Moonstones - Indrani Perera, Lankika, Chanaka and Anil of the Golden Chimes, Rukshan, Dixon, Sunil, Chandral and Paul from Super Golden Chimes, a Calypso medley featuring Priya Pieris, Merrill, Milroy, Raymond, Errol and Christine will perform at the event. The Guest Artistes will be Corrine, Keerthie and Chitral Somapala. Musical backing will be provided by my band Super Chimes with Channa-Upuli Dancers providing the dance acts. The MC for the evening will be Vijaya Corea.
Q: 50 years in the field is no small triumph. How do you feel when you look back on your journey?
A: I can’t believe that I have reached this great milestone but I am so happy about it. I owe it to my fans in Sri Lanka and all over the world and to the people who helped me when I started music way back in 1966.
Q: Out of all your songs your first hit ‘Mango Nenda’ is still the most popular. Why do you think that is so?
A: Yes, ‘Mango Nenda’ is the most popular song of mine. I think the success lies in its catchy melody. It has a real story behind it too. Whenever I get on stage people always request for this song.
Q: You have worked with the legendary Clarence Wijewardena. What is the most important lesson you learned from him?
A: Clarence was a great personality. He made a big change in the Sinhala music industry and it was a pleasure working with him. I cannot simply name one thing that I learnt from him. I learnt a lot from him and I am ever so grateful to him for that. Our combination gave the music lovers the best of the hits that came out in the 60’s and 70’s.
Q: Looking back would you have done anything differently?
A: No. I just followed Clarence’s footsteps and I never went wrong. I would take the same path if I was given a choice to begin all over again even today.
Q: What would you say is the highlight of your career?
A: Well when we started The Moonstones in 1966 we went right to the top in the music scene and The Super Golden Chimes did even better. I will never forget the great times we had during the 60’s and 70’s.
Q: Besides music what are your other passions?
A: I love sports, especially tennis! I never miss any of the tennis matches shown on TV.
Q: How do you feel about the present state of the music industry?
A: The present music industry is very advanced and highly commercialised. During our days we did music for our enjoyment but now money comes first. But I don’t blame anyone for that. The present day musicians have to move with the times.
Q: What do you think about reality shows which select vocalists and brand them as superstars?
A: No comments.
