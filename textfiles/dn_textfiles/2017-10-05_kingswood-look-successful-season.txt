Kingswood look for a successful season

Kingswood College Kandy housed at Randles Hills, is one of the oldest schools playing cricket. This season too they are blessed with a good coach and a well-balanced side. They not only possess a formidable batting line up but also a penetrative attack and are determined to give the leading schools they are playing a run for their money. In the past they have produced several top class teams and cricketers. At Kingswood cricket takes pride of a place and many cricketers have enjoyed the game.
Some of the best products Kingswood has produced are Maurice Fernando who in 1958 brought honor to the school when he was unanimously chosen as the Schoolboy cricketer of the year by a panel comprising eminent cricketing personalities.
On his way to the award he beat Lareef Idroos, Michael Tissera (S. Thomas’ College), Sarath Silva (Nalanda College), S.W. Seneviratne (St. Anthony’s College) and Russell Duckworth (St. Peter's College).
Some of the cricketers who did well at school level and club level are Maurice Fernando, Herbert Jayasuriya, C. Ratnabushana, Ajith Gannoruwa, Owen Mottau, S.B. Elikawella, D. Perera, A.H.M.

Cricket at one time took pride of place at Kingswood College and many cricketers enjoyed run-feasts on the pint-sized ground at Randles Hills in the early days.
Once again the lads from Randles Hills are fortunate to have the service of old Antonian Indika Fernando as coach.
Last year he guided them to win one outright and five on first innings. They should enjoy another good season. Fernando played for St. Anthony's College from 1994 to 1996, and was a right-hand bat and a right-arm leg- spinner.
Later he played Sara Trophy cricket for Kandy Cricket Club and Kandy Youth Sports Club. He has completed his Level one and two coaching courses organized by Sri Lanka Cricket and conducted by Australians Terry Oliver and Darren Holcer. His assistant coach is an old Rajan Harsha Udara a level III SLC qualified coach who played for his school for four years. Jagath Pushpakumara is the physical trainer and the experienced Sarath Ekanayake is the MIC.
This season Kingswood played their first match with Vidyartha College at Police grounds matting wicket which ended in a draw. On the same wicket they played St Thomas’ College Matale but their tournament game against Royal College was postponed due to wet weather.
On October 3-4 they will play St. Anthony’s College at Katugastota, 9th-10th vs Sri Sumangala College in Panadura, 19-20 St. Sylvester’s College in Kandy, November 1-2 Wesley College in Colombo, 9-10 Dharmaloka College Kelaniya at Kirindiwella, 2018 January, 11-12 with St .John’s College Jaffna in Kandy. 18-19 Piliyandala Central in Kandy, 25-26 Kegalu Vidyalaya in Kandy, February 1-2 Sri Piyaratne College Padukka in Kandy, 22-23 St. Thomas’ College Matara in Kandy, 27-28 St. Mary’s Kegalle in Kurunegala, March 16-17 (Big Match) vs Dharmaraja College at Pallekelle, and the one day on 25th at Pallekelle.
This year they are led by fourth year coloursman Ganidu Kamburugam, who bats left hand in the middle order. He is also a fine off spinner and a good close in fielder. Last season, he scored over 350 runs and took 42 wickets. This year much is expected from him with bat and ball and also as captain. He has two deputies, Dulin Wijenarayane in his third year, a good left hand batsman and the stumper of the side, and Saumya Piyasena, also a third year player who bats left hand and bowls off spin.
The rest of the players in the squad are Dhananjaya Maduranga a left hand batsman, who is also a good wicket keeper, Deegayu Bandara a third year bats right hand and a right arm fast bowler, Uthpala Jayalath second year a right arm fast bowler and middle order hard-hitting bat, Kashan Vithanarahchi second year and right handed bat, Madhwa Dhanajaya second year off spinner, Hashika Gamage fresher a steady right hand bat and leg spinner, Dumindu Dharmasala fresher a left hand opening batsman, Lakmal de Silva fresher a steady left arm spinner, Harshana Wickramasinghe right arm medium paceman and Dilsha Senaratne a right arm fast bowler.
