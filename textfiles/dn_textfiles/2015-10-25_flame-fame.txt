Flame of fame

Since its inception in 1908, The Dutch Burgher Union has been helping the “less advantaged”by supporting their children to obtain a better education. The DBU, through the various sponsorship schemes and overseas donors, currently support the education of more than 350 children, as well as provide financial assistance to around 350 impoverished elderly citizens.
In order to raise money for The DBU Welfare Fund, the band “FLAME” has generously volunteered their time and talents and will perform on Wednesday, October 28, 2015 at 7.00 p.m.at the Dutch Burgher Union, No.114, Reid Avenue, Colombo 4.
The DBU would also be most appreciative for your generous cash donations. We also welcome Company display material or Banners at Rs.10,000 each for display at this event.
