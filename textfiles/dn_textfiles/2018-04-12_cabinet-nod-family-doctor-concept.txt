Cabinet nod for Family Doctor concept

The Health Ministry had received Cabinet approval to strengthen the primary healthcare system in the country by promoting the Family Doctor concept.
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing, said, "As we face an ageing as well as increasing population, it is necessary to bring the health service closer to the people."
Improving primary care curative facilities closer to home, would also reduce the current burden on tertiary care facilities, the minister added.
“At present, a network of 970 primary level curative hospitals that operate under provincial health services, are largely bypassed by patients, resulting in overcrowding of healthcare facilities at a tertiary care level. A large number of people also visit private hospitals and specialists,” Dr. Senaratne said.
The government had suggested that general practitioners (GP) be used in the primary care system and have one or two doctors cater to 5,000 patients.
Patients would then need a recommendation from their GP, to consult a specialist, rather than going straight to one. A series of consultations had also allowed the ministry to come up with a detailed programme of implementation to improve primary care facilities.
