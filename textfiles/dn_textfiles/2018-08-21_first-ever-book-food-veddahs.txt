First-ever book on food of the Veddahs

The first-ever book on the food of the Sri Lankan Aadiwaseen (Veddah community) was launched recently. The book is in the Sinhala language.
The first copy of the book titled Vedi Janayage Sampradayika Ahara Thakshnaya (‘Traditional Food Technology of the Sri Lankan Veddahs’) was handed over to Veddah Chief Vishwa Keerthi Vanaspathy Uruwarige Vannila Aththo, at a simple ceremony at the Adiwasi Cultural Heritage Centre in the Adiwasi village of Dambana, on Saturday by its author Poojani Gunasekara.
Gunasekara, who is a graduand of the Ruhuna University, researched and wrote the book with the aim of benefitting those suffering from noncommunicable diseases due to consumption of junk food.
Vedda Chief Vannila Aththo said that although a number of books have been published on the customs, traditions, language, rituals, history, songs, and other aspects of the Veddah people in the country, so far a book on their food has not been published. “There is a secret in the food tradition of the Veddah people that enables them to live long,” Vannila Aththo said. “We express our gratitude to Poojani kekuli (Poojani girl).”
Veteran writer Mahinda Kumara Dalupotha also participated in the ceremony.
