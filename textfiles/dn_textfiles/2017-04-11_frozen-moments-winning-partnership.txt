Frozen moments of a winning partnership

The Australian High Commission launched a photography exhibition at the Lionel Wendt Gallery on April 5 to celebrate the 70 years of development cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka.
The exhibition, which was comprised of over 50 photographs, highlights the projects that have benefited Sri Lankans in the areas of health, education, employment, and sport, among others. Most of the pictures were taken after the end of the civil conflict, but there was also a selection of vintage black and white photos featuring a variety of scenes of Sri Lankan-Australian friendship.
The lion’s share of the photos, however, captured the recipients of Australian aid, such as fishermen with boats and citizens in rebuilt homes. Pictures of children, women, and the elderly feature prominently. Most of the documented projects were carried out in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Particular highlights includes portraits of those who received loans to start a cinnamon oil mill and those of a female de-mining team trained by Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH) and funded by Australia. These snapshots capture women with heavy demining equipment. The accompanying captions describe the tedious, stifling, and heroic work of clearing mines throughout the country.
Though most of the photographs’ subjects are aid recipients, there are a few of Australian diplomats interacting with locals. One excellent photo is of Kathy Klugman, former Australian High Commissioner, at the opening of rebuilt homes for resettled families.
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australia’s Minister for International Development and the Pacific, launched the opening, and noted that Australia has supported Sri Lanka’s development over the course of the countries’ bilateral relationship. She added, however, that Australia is ready, willing, and able to help Sri Lanka continue its development.
“Many of our new programs focus on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more quality jobs and opportunities for all Sri Lankans, especially women,” she said. She added that Australia would continue to support young Sri Lankans to study at its universities.
“We are proud to support the next generations of Sri Lanka’s leaders with a world-class education in Australia” said Minister Fierravanti-Wells.
The opening itself was a stylish affair, as representatives from NGOs, foreign embassies and high commissions, and members of the local community viewed the photographs over canapés and fine wines.
The exhibition is now closed, but it will be open to the public from April 21 to 23 at the Lionel Wendt Gallery, Colombo 7.
