Sri Lanka Police celebrates 151st Anniversary on September 7

Sri Lanka Police will mark its 151st Anniversary with a ceremony under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Police Field Force Headquarters, Bambalapitiya, on Thursday (September 7).
The ceremonial parade consists of police parachute displays, police band performance, tattoo drill and drill squad. A magnificent display will be given by the Kennels Division and the Mounted Division that will add colour to the event. Measures have been taken to facilitate the public to participate in the ceremony and to watch the drills.
The Police was formally established in Sri Lankaon September 3, 1866. When considering world history, the Sri Lanka Police could be considered as one of the foremost. Sir Robert Peel, known as the Father of Modern Policing, established the Metropolitan Police in England in 1829, which is deemed the first formally established Police in the world. Thirty seven years later, the Sri Lanka Police was established in 1866, governed by Ordinance No. 16 of 1865, and today, marks its 151st Anniversary.
The Sri Lankan Police, which serves day and night on 365 days of the year, comprises about 87,000 officers and 484 police stations. Expeditious steps are being taken to increase the organizational structure to 600 functional police stations.
