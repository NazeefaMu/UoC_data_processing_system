A1 is the same old brand new

The title of one of the band’s hit songs says it all: Same Old Brand New. That’s what fans of A1 (A One, not to be confused with AI which stands for American Idol) will see when the band stages its 20th Anniversary Reunion Tour twice at the Kia Theater at the SMX Convention Center in Davao City on October 23 and at the Waterfront Hotel & Casino in Cebu on October 25, all produced by Concert Republic.
The concert is called a “reunion” because more than 15 years after he quit the band, Paul Marazzi has rejoined Ben Adams, Mark Read and Christian Ingebrigtsen. Marazzi’s leave-taking turned the quartet into a trio.
Formed in 1998, the British-Norwegian pop group achieved instant success with its debut single Be The First To Believe, followed by Like A Rose, Take On Me, Caught In The Middle and its rendition of A-Ha’s Take On Me. These and other songs are expected to be included in the band’s “reunion” repertoire.
Q: Fifteen years is a long time since you first performed in the Philippines. What, if any, do you remember from that visit?
Paul: I can remember a lot of very kind people enjoying our music. Oh and the delicious food!
Christian: Wow, it’s hard to believe it has been 15 years already! I remember a lot of things. How amazing our fans are in the Philippines. How we had to have at least five bodyguards each when walking anywhere. How everyone seems to speak perfect English.
How we performed at the Miss Binibining Pilipinas final at the Araneta Coliseum, and no one had told us that the finalists would parade in their bikinis in front of us during our performance. I’ve never played so many mistakes! I remember thinking that the Philippines was one of my absolute favourite places to go to.
Ben: We’ve been to the Philippines so many times that it’s hard to remember the first time but what I can say is that there is a reason we keep coming back! We love it. The people, the food, our fans....so many things!
Mark: It is a long time ago. I remember never having experienced fans like it anywhere else in the world, so passionate and loud, our first introduction to our amazing and loyal fans over there and they’ve been a big part of our journey ever since.
Q: How would you make up for that 15-year gap?
Paul: I don’t feel there is anything to make up for. Although I know that the band members all feel that 15 years is too long.
Christian: Luckily, Mark, Ben and I have had the opportunity to be back to the Philippines a couple of times since then. But this will be the first time we’ll be back as the original line-up, with Paul. I think the main thing we’ll be focusing on this time, is really being present, taking in all the impressions more. It’s so easy, when you’re in the middle of a “whirlwind” of success like the one we experienced 15 years ago, to take things for granted and not truly appreciate everything and all the love we get from our fans. This time we will experience everything with a great deal of gratitude, and try to give as much back to our fans as we possibly can.
Ben: Don’t understand the question, sorry.
Mark: Well, we have been back many times since, most recently as a three-piece, but this will be an especially momentous occasion and return as it will be all four of us.
Q: Do all of you have families (like most of your fans)? Tell us more about your families.
Paul: I have a growing family. I have one daughter...and one on the way!
Christian: I have a wonderful family with a brother, sister, mom and dad. I’m a third-generation musician, as my grandfather was a violinist in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and my father is a singer, like me. We sometimes do concerts together. He celebrates his 50th anniversary as an artist this year, which we will mark with a great concert in Trondheim in February. My brother sings and plays the piano, but hasn’t chosen a career as a musician. My mother is the technical person in the family, and met my dad when she worked as a technician in a recording studio in the ’70s. My sister has four wonderful children, and made me an uncle when I was only 10 years old.
Ben: No family for me. I’m Peter Pan.
Mark: (No comment)
Q: What did you learn from your breakup and eventual reunion?
Paul: That we all had very different versions of events.
Christian: I learned so much about how to stand on my own feet, being a solo artist, having to make all the decisions on my own. But I also learned to appreciate the value of being part of a band, having someone to share all the experiences with, not to mention play ball with, bringing out the best in each other, and how sometimes together we can truly be greater than the sum of each part.
Ben: That there are always two sides to every story and things are always as they seem.
Mark: We have learned to appreciate and respect each other and all that we achieved together and we take more time to enjoy it this time around.
Q: How has your music changed (if it did) during all these years, especially with the emergence of several bands?
Paul: My musical preferences have evolved a bit. But I have always tried to be open to everything.
Christian: Well, as people, we always change with the times, growing and evolving. So as a band, we’ve changed just as our fans have, as we’ve grown older. But essentially, the chore of what’s A1, is that we have four very different people writing the songs, pulling and dragging in each direction, eventually ending up with something that we all can agree is great. As we all grow and change as people and writers, this means what we write will always be colored by the time we’re in. However, our love for the strong melody will always be at the centre.
Ben: As a band, we’ve tried out several things but we always feel more comfortable down the “caught in the middle” type of sound. Just good classic pop/rock.
Mark: Like with all bands, our music changes with the times and styles. But a strong melody and relatable lyrics always remain at the heart of any good song.
