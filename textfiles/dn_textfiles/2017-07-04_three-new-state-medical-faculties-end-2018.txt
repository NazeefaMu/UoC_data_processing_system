Three new State Medical Faculties before end of 2018

The Higher Education Ministry has planned to set up three new State sector Medical Faculties before the end of next year.
The three new faculties will be established at Kurunegala, Ratnapura and Moratuwa.
The first in these series will be set up at Kurunegala by the end of this year, said Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Work on the Ratnapura State Medical Faculty will be launched at the beginning of next year and the Moratuwa new faculty will be launched during the latter half of next year, Kiriella said.
It is the UNP which launched the free education system in Sri Lanka. It has no need to destroy free education but to further nurture it, he said.
Kiriella said the government spent Rs. 400,000 annually on each University student.
Despite this commitment towards free education, certain students were pointing the accusing finger at it alleging that it was trying to ban the free education system.
