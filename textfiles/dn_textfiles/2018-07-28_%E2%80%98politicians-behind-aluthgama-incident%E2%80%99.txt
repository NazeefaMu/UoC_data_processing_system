‘Politicians behind Aluthgama incident’

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the 2014 Aluthgama incident was incited by politicians to achieve their narrow and petty political objectives.
“The seeds of communalism was sown by the politicians with an objective of securing more votes for them without giving an iota of thought about the country’s future,” he said
The Minister stressed that time has come to end political campaigns based on the lines of nationality, religion or caste.
He was speaking at a ceremony to grant compensation to those whose houses and business places were damaged due to incidents that took place in Dharga town and Aluthgama in 2014.
Rs.188 million was distributed among 122 victims at a ceremony held at Atluthgama under Minister Senaratne’s patronage. Minister Senaratne said that Rs.250 million was paid to victims of the Aluthgama incident as compensation earlier.
