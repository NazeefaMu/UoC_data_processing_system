Stop character assassinating Soysa, urge family members

The family of Guinness record holder and night club owner Wasantha Soysa called upon social websites to stop character assassinating Soysa by trying to depict the main suspect in the killing as a hero.
Addressing a press conference held at Soysa's Panorama Club in Anuradhapura, they said certain websites were trying to portray a wrong picture about Soysa depicting him as a person who engaged in illegal and unauthorised activities. Soysa's son Gisara said he would challenge anyone to prove that his father had assualted him or her during his career.
He alleged that certain media institutions criticised and ttacked his father even before his body was brought home. Gisara said he was thankful to the Police for taking steps to apprehend the culprits behind the murder within a week. Soysa's daughter Sharmini said family members were in deep mental distress over the wrong picture created about their father by certain sections of the media.
Soysa's sister Nirupama Rajapaksa said her brother engaged in business activities since 1997.
"He engaged in business according to the country's laws and regulations paying all taxes and other dues promptly. Despite this, some sections of the media were trying to portray him as an illegal businessman," she said.
Soysa's brother, Anura Soysa attached to an Australian University said he regretted to see certain sections of the media trying to portray his brother as a criminal and the main suspect in the killing as a hero.
"Certain sections of the media are trying to engage in sensationalism without trying to recheck information to seek the truth," he said.
