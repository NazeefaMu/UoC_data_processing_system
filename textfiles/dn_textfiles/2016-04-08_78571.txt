Avurudu Goodies

 
The Galadari Hotel is readying for the Avurudu celebrations in grand style. The hotel’s Café 64 will be offering a wide selection of traditional sweetmeats and cakes from April 11 to the 15 between 9am to 7pm.
Make this festivity special with the sweetmeat and cake sensations available at the café. Choose from a tempting range of cakes which includes banana, fruitcake, coconut cake to date cake and much more. A special Avurudu Kevili platter also awaits all.
In addition to this, coconut and milk toffees are one’s for the taking. Another fabulous offer is the very special Avurudu Cake made available at the Café 64 which is definitely the best Avurudu gift to take home to friends and family this holiday season. This one-of-a-kind ribbon cake shaped like a betel leaf is decorated in traditional Avurudu charm, yet another successful creation by Pastry Chef Pradeep Fonseka.
