World’s oldest Bornean orangutan goes ape on her 62nd birthday

The world’s oldest Bornean orangutan, Gypsy Chan, goes ape on her 62nd birthday by shoving her two-year-old grandson, Api’s face into her towering fruit cake.
The sweet photo at Tokyo’s Tama Zoo, Japan, by British snapper David Williams, 41, will cause tiers of joy. Gypsy wowed the science world when she was spotted acting as a peacemaker by breaking up fights between apes
Scientists, writing in the journal Primates, say this is the first time an orangutan had behaved in this way.
Dr Tomoyuki Tajima of Kyoto University in Japan, who recorded the behaviour along with colleague Mr Hidetoshi Kurotori, a keeper at the Tama Zoological Park in Tokyo, said: “Orangutans spend most of their time alone in the wild. However, they sometimes come and travel together, so researchers regard them as semi-solitary.”
Molly, the world’s oldest captive orangutan, sadly died at the zoo in 2011. She was aged 59. Molly arrived at Ueno Zoological Gardens, another zoo in Tokyo, in 1955 from Indonesia and was the first orangutan in post-war Japan. She found fame when she became an artist by drawing with crayons in 2002.
Gypsy is now the world’s oldest and clearly still going strong as these pictures show.
