Munchee Super Cream Crackers  ranked among top

Statistical data from market research shows that Munchee Super Cream Cracker has become the country’s most popular biscuit surpassing other biscuit varieties. About 23% of the local biscuit market is taken up by the cracker category, out of which Munchee Super Cream Cracker claims to a significant 70% share of the cracker market. Studies have further revealed that at any given minute, around 4000 Munchee Super Cream Crackers are consumed across the country.
As a market leader in Sri Lanka, Munchee played a major role in popularizing and repositioning the image of cream crackers in the market. This was achieved through the company’s pioneering campaign ‘Podi Badaginnata Super’, which redefined the cracker’s image from being a nutritional supplement for the sick to an all time snack enjoyed by all age groups. Moreover, Munchee incorporated cutting edge technology and machinery to introduce a cracker with seven layers, preserving air pockets on both sides. The extra layers and air pockets give the Super Cream Cracker its extra crunchiness, making every bite a truly delightful experience.
The ‘Super’ in the Munchee’s Super Cream Cracker portrays the cracker’s healthy aspects as it does not contain sugar, colours or preservatives. The cracker is also enriched with essential vitamins and minerals, including Vitamins A, B1, B4, B5, B6, B12, D, E, and K1 in addition to folic acid.
Munchee uses best industry practices and strict quality guidelines when it comes to manufacturing & sourcing the best ingredients. This has made Munchee Super Cream Cracker to earn the ‘Super Fine’ quality, elevating the brand to the top international standards and extend its global footprint across 55 countries. Munchee Super Cream Cracker is also served as a special in-flight snack in some of the prestigious global airlines including the American Airlines.
Being the first cracker brand in the country to win SLS certification (SLS 251 standard), Munchee Super Cream Cracker has been awarded several certifications such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 22000 in addition to FDA international certification. Munchee is also the only South Asian biscuit manufacturer to win the globally acclaimed BRC certification twice, including the recently won BRC’s AA certification which was awarded by Mr. Joachim Schulz, Global Product Manager of International Featured Standards (IFS). The British Retail Consortium (BRC), a globally acclaimed leading brand and consumer protection organization, offers certifications to 130 countries assuring that a product is safe, legal and of high quality, and only Munchee biscuits have been awarded this prestigious recognition.
A recent survey conducted by the Survey Research Lanka revealed that consumers are drawn to Munchee Super Cream Cracker because of its freshness, crispiness, good taste and nutritional values.
