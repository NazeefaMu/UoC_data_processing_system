SAITM students write to the UGC

The Student Action Committee of SAITM sent a letter to the University Grants Commission yesterday evening requesting an appointment for a meeting with the Higher Education Minister Wijedasa Rajapaksa, the Convener of the committee Shanaka De Seram said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR) in Colombo yesterday, he said that since no authority gave an appointment for a discussion the committee is compelled to demand an appointment in writing for a discussion. The SAITM students had never been invited for any previous discussions held in connection with solving the SAITM issue.
According to Seram, all the solutions given by the Government for the SAITM issue so far, were limited to various cabinet papers and had not been implemented in practice. At least the cabinet paper presented recently, should be implemented in practice in a fair and expedited manner. If not, the SAITM students will be compelled to come into streets and block roads, which is the popular way of opening eyes of the Government.
Meanwhile, some others are purposely delaying the task of finding a final and acceptable solution for the SAITM issue because they want to take political advantage using the issue. The 980 SAITM students are local investors and it is the sole responsibility of the Government to protect them. But what the Government does is giving high hopes to the SAITM students and later breaking them down into pieces, De Seram added.
