Caution on mobile phone use in bedroom

Using mobile phones in the bedroom and keeping it switched on there for long hours in the night has adverse effects on health, Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) Director Dr. Paba Palihawadana said.
According to Dr. Palihawadama, consultants had explained the connection between mobile phones and neurological issues. Electronic equipment such as mobile phones can cause neurological problems and can also damage the brain.
People should keep mobile phones out of the bedroom or keep them switched off, he said.
The consultants had stated these facts during a recent health seminar held at the HPB to mark the World Mental Health Day.
