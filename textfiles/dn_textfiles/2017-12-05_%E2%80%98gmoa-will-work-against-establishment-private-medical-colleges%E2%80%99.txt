‘GMOA will work against establishment of private medical colleges’

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) will join hands with all the other forces to defeat the efforts made through the Presidential Committee to prioritize the establishment of private medical colleges, GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said it is very unlikely the participation of the GMOA in any committee (even just as observers) if the Presidential Committee decides to establish private medical colleges affiliating to the SLIIT or any other institution. According to Dr.Aluthge, the GMOA has already informed Dr. Harsha De Silva (the Chairman of the Presidential Committee) in writing about the GMOA's stand on the facts observed.
"The GMOA will also communicate all new negative developments to the Chairman of the committee and to the other officials," he said.
"Setting up a non profit medical college is not a solution for the SAITM issue and it will create more complications than now.
No non profit university in the world have a success story. In the US, there are about 1000 such institutes and 2.7 million students enter into them but only 55 percent of them become graduates.
No non profit medical faculty in Sri Lanka will be able to meet the minimum standards of medical education," Dr.Aluthge added.
