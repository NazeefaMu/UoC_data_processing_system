One of a  kind

They were married just five weeks after their first encounter. Such was the impact that they had on each other. Now 35 years later they still live in blissful harmony. Blessed with three children who are young adults now, Athula and Rosy Senanayake are not ready to relax and retire from their busy lifestyle yet. Here Athula Senanayake, the beloved husband of Rosy Senanayake, unwinds his thoughts about his life with the woman whom he dubs as a ‘unique personality in Sri Lanka because of her wide ranging experiences in diverse areas’.
 The wife and mother
We met in London in 1980 and we were married five weeks after our first meeting. It was a learning experience getting to know each other. I think she is an exceptional mother with all the protective qualities and other features that a mother possesses. However I think she has a double dose of all that!
Rosy as 
Mrs World 1985
Ours is not a ‘normal’ lifestyle. I am a restaurateur and my hours are regular. I have been having my own business since 1991. In most instances we cannot get together except for special occasions. Despite that I believe that we have a bond and relationship that has been built up as husband and wife. The children too have adapted to this because from day one it has been like this.
We were quite lucky because we had the children when we were quite young. Kanishka is 33 years and Thisakya is 30 years.
Our youngest, Radhya, is 26 years now. The days in which we were running around from one tuition class to another are over. All three studied in Sri Lanka and though they went abroad for their university studies, they returned back to the country. We are both happy about that because returning was their own choice. They are very happy here surrounded by their friends and family so we hope that they will settle down here as well.
Looking back we wonder how we managed. I think that it is a difficult period for any parent because there are various factors like effort and cost involved. It was not easy but we managed. The children are very close to their mother. She has always been there for them. We are a close knit family.
 Greatest weakness
She is incapable of putting aside certain common sense suggestions and focus on what she or the party is saying. Certain politicians have this practice thought they know what other people are saying is also correct. However as a politician they have to pretend that theirs is the only solution that is available for a certain issue.
Rosy finds this task difficult because she is a very balanced person. Therefore she finds it difficult to ignore that there is some sense about what the other person is saying. She is not a hard politician but very sensitive to such issues.
She is a diehard UNP party person. I am a liberal thinker and I speak for both sides. Therefore we do not discuss politics often.
 Habits and beliefs
Rosy is very house proud. She believes in keeping the communication channels open always so that one can come to a better and broader understanding of things. She is a very likeable person so everybody was ready to help her wherever she goes.
 Travels
Rosy has been to Israel twice but for holidays she likes to go to a place which offers privacy. People are not kind always. They are concerned about facts like what was she like, what was she wearing, she did not event glance their way etc. It is mostly a love-hate situation.
The public figure
When Rosy became a public figure she had to attend many social events. So we were out a lot. If we have an event I would take my suit to the office and change there before meeting up with her at the event. Life is like that. It has never been a conventional arrangement from day one. Rosy had less of a work load then before she became a part of the political set up.
Rosy has always been her own person. I have always been amazed how she has been able to adapt into the political and public figure that she is today. Many people find it difficult to handle this change. She has some advantages: the door has always been open for her and she is a likeable person. People relate to her a lot because they expect her to be unapproachable, arrogant and proud. However when they meet her they realize that she is the opposite of what they have expected. She is a very generous person. There is no limit to her generosity. She makes other peoples’ problems her own which is both a plus point as well as a weakness.
 Free time
Though Rosy is a public figure she has never really used her titles to get what she wants. Everyone expects her to be perfect all the time. It is very demanding to be ‘exceptional’. She spends a lot of time getting herself ready for such events. When an event is over she just wants to collapse and relax.
She likes to keep up with the political issues. We watch political debates. People complement her in her Sinhala vocabulary in particular. She built up this aspect through listening to such programs. I too can speak Sinhala without using a single English word to express my point and I use the accurate word during the appropriate situation. Rosy used to do talk shows in the evenings and she was very talented at getting out information quickly.
Any free time she has, she spends it with the children. The children, too, have their own schedules now. Even my daughter and her husband live here with us.
Passions
She is passionate about women’s issues in politics. One of her main concerns is to try and increase the percentage of women’s representation in parliament. Even countries like Iran and Bangladesh have a higher representation of women in parliament. It is quite embarrassing for us because Sri Lanka has already had a female president and a female prime minister. Since the period of violence is far behind us I think women do not have an excuse for why they should not join politics now. Rosy is passionate about her religion – Christianity. I am a Buddhist in a fundamental sense meaning I believe in the essence of Buddhism. I feel that there are too many rituals that are coming into play now with poojas taking over elements like bavanas and teachings of the Buddha.
 A different profession
It is difficult to imagine Rosy engaged in something else but I think she would always have been a campaigner. It was only when she became involved in such activities that we realized that this was what she was meant to be. She has worked with the Tea Board in London but I think she was meant for bigger things.
 Favourite cuisine
Rosy is a rice and curry person. I am more into western food. Going out we visit all types of restaurants so she is not particular about what type of food she wants to go for.
She makes the traditional Christmas cake at home every year. There is like 40 kilos of it and the whole house is aromatic on the day she engages in her ‘baking spree’. She is very religious about the affair meaning that they all have to be cut in a particular size. It is the only time she does the cooking and she wishes to do it all by herself.
I suggested that she makes the wedding cake for our daughter’s wedding that was in December 2016. We were keen to make this affair as personal as possible. She made about a thousand odd pieces of wedding cake in our house.
 
 Life with Rosy in a few words
 
‘Eventful’ because there is never a dull moment with her. We are meeting a lot of exciting people at events. She met Meryl Streep recently at a women’s conference in London. She has met everybody: from Mohammed Ali to all the top actors and actresses involved in charity work.
‘Long distance’ because though we are in the same house she has gone by the time I wake up on some days. There is always communication as we talk to each other all the time. We have a family group on WhatsApp and we send messages to that and everyone responds. Though we are far away it is like we are all together in the same room.
‘Spontaneous’ because five weeks is a very short period to get to know someone before deciding to tie the knot. I am more planned but she has to be at two places at the same time so she is rushing off from one to another. It is more difficult for a woman than a man because a man can just put on a shirt and sarong and look smart. Men do not have to worry too much about appearances as long as they shave in the morning.
 Togetherness time
Our time together now is generally during the small dinners and lunches we get invited to. Those are nice because they are intimate occasions. We interact at home too. I believe that for any couple, after a certain number of years, there is communication without communication. It develops with a lot of time together.
 
 Animal lovers
I am a physical animal lover. We have always had dogs in the house. Our present pet, Jagger, is also in our daughter’s wedding album. Jagger was rosy’s birthday present and she is very fond of him. Some stray cats visit our house but I think we are not ‘cat people’.
 Irritations
I think it is mostly me that irritates her! She gets irritated with herself because there is so much workload. She is concerned about cleanliness and wants things kept in a certain way. We as a couple have a lot of heated discussions on politics, the children or any other topics. I don’t back down during such discussions and she knows that. Most of the time she knows that I am correct. Due to the old fashioned values that we have been brought up with we are concerned about doing the ‘right thing’.
 Rosy in 10 years from today
I will be 70 years then she will be 68 years. Grandchildren will be our priority. We had the children when we were very young and we get nervous when we see older couples with very young children. We have no real plans per se because it has all really been about the children.
I believe that Sri Lankan parents rarely make long term plans. Obliviously, I would like to retire someday to a place like Nuwara Eliya and run a bed and breakfast place. We are still too involved with our children’s lives which we should not be at these ages.
