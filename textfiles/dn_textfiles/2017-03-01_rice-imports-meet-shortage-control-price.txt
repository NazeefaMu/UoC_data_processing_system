Rice imports to meet shortage, control price

 
The Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) will import 20, 000MT of rice monthly to meet shortage and to control prices.
A buffer stock of 100, 000 MT will also be imported to meet exigency.
Price controls have been imposed on rice in light of dwindling supplies as a result of the drought – the worst in forty years.
The Cabinet of Ministers previously approved the importation of rice through private importers – 113,000 MT were imported but is not sufficient to meet demand.
