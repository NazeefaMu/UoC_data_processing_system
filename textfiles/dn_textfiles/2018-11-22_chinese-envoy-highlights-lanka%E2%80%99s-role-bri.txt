Chinese envoy highlights Lanka’s role in BRI

Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan said close cooperation between Sri Lanka and China has made a greater contribution towards the development of Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lanka is one of the first countries to openly support and join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In the last five years, in-depth exchanges and cooperation in various fields has blossomed under the BRI framework,” he said.
The Chinese envoy in Colombo was speaking at the inauguration of the international seminar on the Belt and Road Initiative at Five Years – Regional and Global Dimensions at the BMICH to mark the 5th anniversary of BRI.
“The pragmatic cooperation between our two countries has made a great contribution to Sri Lanka’s development, and also brought tangible benefits to our two countries and two peoples,” the envoy said.
He said that the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is a good example of the BRI practice.
The Ambassador added that the completion of the Norochcholai Power Station provided about 40 percent of the nation’s electricity supply, the Colombo Airport Expressway has brought great convenience to domestic and international travellers. The CICT has became the fastest growing container terminal in Asia.
He said the Moragahakanda Project, which is the biggest water reservoir in Sri Lanka, has brought great benefits to local agriculture and people.
“Besides, the Colombo Port City, as well as the Hambantota Port and Industrial Park, are expected to become the new engines for Sri Lankan economic take-off,” he said.
“We are confident that as long as all countries could make joint efforts and constantly push forward BRI cooperation, it will bring more and better prospects to the world. As we all know, the BRI consists of Five Connectivities, among which Policy Connectivity is the start and People’s Hearts Connectivity is the end,” he said.
