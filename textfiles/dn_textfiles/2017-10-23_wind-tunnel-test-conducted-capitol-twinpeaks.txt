Wind tunnel test conducted at Capitol TwinPeaks

The 470-apartment Capitol TwinPeaks twin tower project located in Colombo 02 incorporates the latest trends in condominium construction.
Sanken Construction has successfully delivered some truly iconic projects in the past for many developers and Capitol TwinPeaks too is expected to be a triumph of both design and construction.
The project has incorporated the latest technology available in the industry for its design development and construction activities from its rudimentary stage to ensure its structural performance and long-term stability.
In addition, Sanken Construction recently conducted a wind tunnel test for Capitol TwinPeaks despite its high cost to ensure that it delivers the best possible product to its clients.
Determining what the wind loads will be for specific mean recurrence intervals and understanding what the uncertainties are in these loads is critical, which is why Sanken undertook the wind tunnel test for Capitol TwinPeaks, which rises up to 182m and therefore requires an accurate assessment of wind loads on cladding elements to ensure adequate strength.
The main structure of a tall building and its façade must be designed to safely withstand the extreme winds to which the building will be subjected during its expected life.
Since there are no laboratory facilities available in Sri Lanka to perform this test, the wind tunnel test was performed by a renowned wind tunnel testing consultant, CPP Wind Engineering & Air Quality Experts from Australia.
Capitol TwinPeaks stands tall at height of 182 m from ground level making it susceptible to nature’s extreme conditions. Some of the most fascinating features of Capitol TwinPeaks such as the Sky lounge sunset bar, sky bridge and so on are located at the roof top level.
Through this wind tunnel test, the developer was able to verify how the wind flow patterns surrounding the building effects the building and its contents and necessary rectifications needed to provide safe and pleasant living conditions for residents.
Results obtained from this test were then forwarded to principal structural designer and façade designer to optimize the design.
The presence of Sanken guarantees immense value addition to the ambitious Capitol TwinPeaks project.
Apart from its impeccable track record of delivering projects on time, Sanken Construction infuses the best aesthetic features in the project along with international living standards to set a benchmark in trendy lifestyles.
Moreover, it takes care of all regulatory approvals so that there is no stress on the owner eventually. Its projects always incorporate latest systems, processes and materials. Attention to detail and constant feedback to the developer and in turn to the customers is an added plus.
Capitol Developers Ltd is a member of the reputed construction giant, Sanken Group. In fact, all properties developed by Capitol Developers have been contracted to Sanken Construction, which guarantees timely delivery of the apartments to buyers along with the hallmark construction quality of the Sanken brand.
Capitol TwinPeaks is scheduled to be ready for occupation by end 2020.
