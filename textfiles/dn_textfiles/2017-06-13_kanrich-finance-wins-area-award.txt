Kanrich Finance wins AREA award

Kanrich Finance Limited (KFL), won an AREA award at Asia’s leading large-scale and regional CSR programme, organized by Enterprise Asia, for its CSR initiative, 'Kanrich Thaksalawa'.
A licenced finance company with a history of over 44 years, this initiative was developed with a goal of providing free English education for rural students.
The project was piloted in 2016 to provide an opportunity to less fortunate children of the company’s under privileged customers in Sri Lanka.
The programme currently serves over 400 children.
The project was initiated with a strong vision of being able to advance the country’s future generation, providing opportunities to these children to access global environments, developing them into the future leaders of tomorrow.
Experienced and qualified teachers were hired by the company who were involved in teaching students from various levels with a goal of bringing them up to high standards.
Each student’s standard or level is closely evaluated via the extension of tests and examinations, which is used as a tool to identify whom to pay more attention to.
The students are also being put through a practical session to develop their communication and presentation skills,” said Assistant General Manger Shyaminie Fernando.
“This free service is currently provided to students starting from the Grade 6 and will be continued until the student passes on to Grade 10, thereby collating enough time to build a strong relationship and genuinely assisting the student in reaching at the ultimate desired level.”
“This project intends attaining the corporate mission in being a responsible corporate entity in the industry, thereby being a unique initiation for the company where extended support and a sense of encouragement is provided to Kanrich’s customer base.”
As an expansion plan, Kanrich also has made provisions for a second phase of the project in providing learning opportunities for a further 1,800 children via the implementation of 50 study centres across the country within the year 2017.
“Further, in incorporating a sense of innovation, Kanrich also has ideas in the provision of a mobile library for the students in view of further improving their reading and understanding skills effectively. The ultimate goal of this project is to create one million future leaders from the rural community by 2025.”
