Rains destroying crops

Due to the heavy rains experienced these days in the Matale district, farmers face huge losses in the current Yala season.
At present, the paddy fields near some tanks in the Galewela and Dambulla areas, have completely inundated. Over 200 acres which were under paddy cultivation have been destroyed.
Farmers say that if the rain continues, their entire paddy cultivation will be devastated.
