Sword attack on Jaffna police officers  Four in custody, more to be arrested: SSP, Jaffna

There are more suspects to be arrested in the Monday’s sword attack on two Police officers in Jaffna, SSP Jaffna Glaston Stanislaus told the Daily News yesterday.
“Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the attack. The rest would be arrested and legal action taken against them as well,” he said.
Asked if the suspects concerned belonged to a Jaffna-based criminal gang Aawa and if they are becoming a threat to maintain law and order in the Jaffna Police Division, SSP Stanislaus responded: “It is the media that seemed to be giving undue recognition to these small time felons.”
“Incidents such as this, could happen anywhere, in any Police division, he said."They need to be stopped and will be stopped.”
“Why anyone would want to superimpose them as a group called Aawa. Who gave them that name?” he questioned.
On being pointed out that the group however appear to be responsible for causing similar sorts of incidents in Jaffna, SSP Stanislaus said, “actually, there is no such big band of operatives so as to characterize them with a name in Jaffna, except a few men that needed arresting.”
“Meanwhile, law and order in Jaffna is being maintained as usual,” he added.
