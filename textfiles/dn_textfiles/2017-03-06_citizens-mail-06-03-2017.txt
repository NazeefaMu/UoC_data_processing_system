Why we need to rein in the underworld
Regular newspaper readers recently have had an overdose of information related to the underworld. The foremost among them was a narration of seven persons - five prisoners and two jailers - were massacred in broad daylight. It was really a dramatic scenario with the perpetrators attired in police uniforms.
This fiasco came to pass not so long ago on February 27 at 8.30 am in Kalutara. Surprisingly it is the area where the Police Higher Training Institute is located. Needless to say, the news bulletin surprised and took centre stage.
However we cannot, and shall not, pass the blame to anyone. The religious leaders, teachers, politicians, statesmen and other opinion leaders have an instrumental role in shaping the society we live in. But they too have a limit in shaping the social attitudes. The government is trying their level best to keep things under control. What they really need is correct guidance and proper consultation to steer the society well ahead of hazards such as underworld.
The press also reported that a commission had been appointed to look into underworld activities. It is easy to entertain a pessimistic opinion that such commissions – or even a committee among other things – would yield zero results. However difficult it may be, we should keep our fingers crossed about these commissions and committees appointed, because that indicates the attempt of the government to pull down the underworld activities. It may not yield results soon. But it may deliver something in future. Doing something is of course better than nothing at all.
