Brand new form of imagery

Venue: J D A Perera Gallery, University of Visual & Performing Arts,
Date: From July 18 to 22.
Artist Prasad Abu Bakr who is participating in the event for the second consecutive year shares a few of his thoughts with the Daily News.
Nawa Kalakaruwo is the only annual art event that offers an opportunity for emerging artists to showcase their work, happening since 1988. It is due to open again for the 22nd time in Colombo early next week with the participation of a large number of artists – Some of them for the first time and others who have been participating at numerous exhibitions around the country has been selected by the foundation to showcase their work as in other years.
The George Keyt Foundation has been constant in opening up avenues for new artists to emerge through their two highly patronized promotional programmes such as ‘Kala Pola’ and ‘Nawa Kalakaruwo’. “However the unique aspect for me as an artist is that it gives artists a platform to show their various creative exercises – which takes a different perspective from the routine ‘painting & drawing’ aspect because, as in my case, for example, I combine my photography with my childhood ability to paint – creating a brand new form of imagery” says the artist who emerged with his all-new creative exercise in recent years and states that it is heading in the right direction where art appreciation is concerned.
Speaking about the confusion some people create by calling his work ‘collage or photomontage’ – which is a term he too used initially when he held his first collection sponsored by The Alliance Francaise de (Kotte) Colombo in 2016, as he steered along showing his work at numerous exhibitions he came to realize that it was more tilted towards ‘mixed media’ as there are a lot of creative elements involved in the process of his exercise – his photographic images play a vital role while he enhances and gives his pictures more three dimensional depth by using various other techniques such as painting, drawing, collage etc.
“To me, Nawa Kalakaruwo is an ideal platform to present my creative images to be viewed by a larger audience,” says Prasad, promoting the event as an all-round artistic exercise that can be utilized by emerging artists to promote themselves.
As the organizers of the event – from the George Keyt Foundation says “Nawa Kalakaruwo presents new and interesting paths and different handling of the chosen medium”. This exactly is what is interesting about this annual event, that it also opens a fine testing ground for artists like me, who totally into creating an images combining two contrasting art forms, painting and photography and have built an ardent fan base – especially amongst many foreign buyers who find this novel creative exercise much to their entertainment stated the artist.
“Nawa Kalakaruwo by itself creates a larger platform for both art enthusiasts and collectors alike to visit, explore and experience the emerging talent of local artists while seeing for themselves new trends and styles totally individualistic. The exhibition also stands out as the ‘one & only’ annual art show to happen in Colombo or any other part of the country for that matter” stresses Prasad adding that the George Keyt Foundation together with Carson Cumberbatch PLC and its subsidiary Carsons Management Services (Pvt) Ltd should be applauded for coming forward in support of the event this year – giving art lovers yet another opportunity to visit the only art event of this caliber which happens once a year only.
