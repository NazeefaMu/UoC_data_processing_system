AIADMK call for India to oppose UNHRC extension on Sri Lanka

 
India must oppose a resolution in the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) moved by the US, the UK and some other countries on giving two more years until 2019 for Sri Lanka to submit its report on the killing of Tamils, the AIADMK said in Indian Parliament yesterday.
AIADMK leader V Maitreyan raised the matter in Rajya Sabha during Zero Hour and urged the Centre to take the initiative to see that an independent international investigation is ordered. 
Requesting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring justice to Eelam Tamils, Maitryean said: “I urge the Government of India to oppose this Resolution in the UNHRC in the voting to be held on 22nd March.”
He said that eight years have elapsed since the systematic genocide of Eelam Tamils in Lanka in 2009, in which over 150,000 Tamils were killed. “So far, no reliable investigation has been undertaken and not a single guilty has been punished,” he said.
He said a resolution was adopted in the UNHRC sponsored by the US and Sri Lanka in 2015 that called for independent investigation of the war crimes in Sri Lanka with the participation of international judges and lawyers and jurists.
