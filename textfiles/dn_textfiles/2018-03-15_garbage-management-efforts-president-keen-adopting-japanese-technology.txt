Garbage management efforts: President keen on adopting Japanese technology

President Maithripala Sirisena said he looks forward to implementing the novel technology and technological advances used for garbage management by Japan, in Sri Lanka, for a permanent solution for issues relating to the garbage management sector.
The President made these remarks after visiting the Shinagawa Incineration Plant, a modern high-tech and state-of-the-art waste management plant in Tokyo, yesterday.
The Shinagawa Incineration Plant is one of the 23 plants which manages and recycles 11,000 Mt of garbage generated by 9.3 million people living in Tokyo daily.
Out of the 11,000 Mt of daily collected garbage, the Shinagawa Incineration Plant recycles 600 Mt daily in a high tech and people-friendly manner. The Shinagawa Incineration Plant has been designed and constructed in accordance with three principles of garbage management such as implementing an eco-friendly design, maintaining harmony with urban planning and promoting the national commitment to recycling.
According to the Chief Officer of the incineration plant, the plant is run by electricity generated through garbage recycling and the management process of the Shinagawa Incineration Plant. Excess electricity generated is sold to the national grid and it receives a significant income.
Moreover, it is significant that the Shinagawa Incineration Plant is situated in a highly urbanized area in Tokyo. Yet, no stench emanates from the plant due to the advanced technology used, the Officer said.
Having observed the plant, President Sirisena instructed Sri Lankan officials to look into the possibilities of establishing such a plant in Sri Lanka aiming to provide a permanent solution for garbage management. The President further instructed officials to gather information promptly in this regard.
Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and Parliamentarian Ashu Marasinghe also participated in the observation tour.
