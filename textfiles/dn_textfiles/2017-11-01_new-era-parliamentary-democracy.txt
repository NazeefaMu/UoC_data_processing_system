A new era of Parliamentary democracy

The 21st death anniversary of Sri Lanka's first Executive President JR Jayewardene falls today. Reproduced below is a speech made by him to mark the formal opening of the new parliament in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte on April 29, 1982
Our country has a very ancient history of government with which the people were associated. Anuradhapura had a Mayor (Nagaraguthika) 2000 years ago; Polonnaruwa in the 11th Century A.D. had a Cabinet of Ministers and the buildings in which they deliberated are still to be seen. Village assemblies (Gan Sabhas) have existed from the earliest days.
When the Maritime Provinces came under British rule, Chief Justice Sir Alexander Johnston recommended in 1810 that Sri Lanka should be given a free Constitution. This did not happen because of a change of Government in the United Kingdom. A Legislative Council with official and unofficial members was however established in 1833.
Elections to the Legislative Council were first held in 1911 when a member called the Ceylonese Member was elected by the whole island on a very restricted franchise. Ponnambalam Ramanathan, later Sir, was the first to be so elected. In 1920 and 1924 the membership was enlarged and more members were elected. This Legislative Council existed till the grant of Universal Franchise and the creation of the State Council in 1931. The Elected Municipalities of Colombo Kandy and Galle were established in 1865.
The Legislative Council sat in the building erected opposite Gordon Gardens which later was the home of the Senate and now of the Presidential Secretariat and Conference Hall.
From 1930 sittings were held in the State Council building which Hon. Members vacated a few weeks ago. The Legislative Council, The State Council, The House of Representatives. The National State Assembly and Parliament sat here from 1930-1931; 1931-1947; 1947-1972; 1972-1978 and 1978-1982 respectively.
Free elections and Democratic freedoms
Many famous sons of Sri Lanka elected by the people, no longer with us, have taken part in debates in these two buildings; Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Sri James Peiris, Sir D B Jayatilake, E W Perera, D S Senanayake, W A de Silva, S W R D Bandaranaike, Sir John Kotelawala, Dudley Senanayake, Sir Francis Molamure, T B Jayah, George E de Silva, A E Goonesinha, Philip Gunawardena, N M Perera, G G Ponnambalam, S J V Chelvanayakam, S A Wickramasinghe and several others whose names are part of the political history of our country. They belonged to two generations that preceded the generation that sits in the Chamber today. I have been associated with all of them except Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir James Peiris during the 44 years of my public career. My father and his brothers were Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan's sponsors in the 1911 election and they worked with Sir James Peiris and some of the others mentioned above to establish the Ceylon National Congress in 1918.
There is only one Member of the 1931 State Council elected by Universal Franchise still alive, Vaithialingam. I hope he is here today. There are two who were Members of the Second State Council elected in 1936 alive and still in active politics - myself elected in 1943 and Dr Dahanayake, MP elected in 1944. Both of us have seen these Assemblies in peaceful periods and also in turbulent moods. We have both been State Councillors.
Members of Parliament, Back-Benchers, Ministers, Opposition Leaders and Prime Ministers and I am sure it is as much a pride to him as it is to me to be able to be with you today.
In 1947 was elected the first Parliament which had the opportunity of governing a Lanka free once again after 133 years. From 1947 we have had 8 general elections, several by-elections, six changes of government. Free elections and Democratic freedoms have survived throughout this period.
The new building we occupy today is situated in a city, Sri Jayawardhanapura, Kotte, which was the capital of Sri Lanka from 1411-1568. Western imperialists first came to our land during this period.
Though Bhuvenekabahu V ruled at Gampola during the latter years of his reign, he also called himself King of Jayawardenepura, Kotte, where Nissanka Alagakkonara had built the fort of Jayawardenepura, Kotte. It was however, in 1411 when Parakramabahu VI began what was to be a very long reign that he established himself here and it was he who really founded the Jayawardenepura Kotte Kingdom. He gave it supremacy over other subject kingdoms in the country; contributed to its golden era of poetry and during his 55 years of rule made this period rich in literature, incidents and achievements.
He was the first Sinhalese Monarch since the days of Parakramabahu I and Nissankamalla to bring the whole island under one rule, and the last ever to do so. Even today the Sandesa poems which reached their maturity in his period and Kavyasekera and Guttila Kavya are a source of enduring joy. Owing to the constant harassment by the Portuguese the kingdom moved from Jayawardenepura (Kotte) to the Udarata (Kandy) and in 1597 the city was finally abandoned and its temples, buildings and monuments were razed to the ground by the Portuguese.
Hopes and aspirations for future
We see around us in these new buildings, features that represent the culture and heritage of the past and embody our hopes and aspirations for the future. We commence here a new era of Parliamentary Democracy in a Chamber worthy of an Elected and Sovereign Assembly. Let us look after this building and its environs carefully.
What should be the standard of conduct we should maintain? Let us ask ourselves some of the questions the Buddha asked, when King Ajasatta of Magadha sought his advice as to whether they should go to war with the Republic of the Vaggis:
Do the Vaggis have frequent gatherings? Are they well attended?
Do they assemble and disperse peacefully?
Do they attend to their affairs in concord?
Do they proceed in accordance with their ancient laws?
Do they show respect and honour; esteem and veneration towards their elders and deem it worthwhile to listen to them?
Do they show respect and honour; esteem and veneration towards their shrines?
“These conditions lead to a nation's welfare. If they follow them their growth is to be expected, not their decline”, he said.
In this Temple of Democracy let us so conduct ourselves for the welfare of the many, that generations yet unborn may say, that within this Chamber our words and conduct represented our finest hours.
