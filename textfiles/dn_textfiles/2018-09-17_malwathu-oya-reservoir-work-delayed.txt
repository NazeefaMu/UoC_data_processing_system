Malwathu Oya reservoir work delayed

The lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir construction work has been idling for years. A 3.6-km long dam over the Bogoda village near Thantrimale has to be built to complete the project. Rs. 13,500 million has been spent on the project to date. The reservoir will contain 169,440 acre-feet of water submerging 3,500 hectares.
Reportedly, lack of funds is the main reason for the delay. Sources said Rs. 55 million was allocated to survey lands but it is incomplete yet. Nearly 500 families has to evacuate for the project.
Tisawewa, Nuwarawewa, Mahakanadarawa, Pawatkulama and Akithamurupu tanks are at the upper and lower river basins.
Project Director Engineer T.P. Alwis said a meeting was held to discuss the delayed work of the project led by the Prime Minister and all stakeholders participated in it. The Chinese CAMSE Engineering Company completed the Yanoya Reservoir headwork construction and now they carry out the work of the 20-km long left bank canal construction and they will likely to get the lower Malwathu oya reservoir construction work as well.
The project will supply water for cultivating around 36,000 acres in Anuradhapura and Mannar. Five million cubic meters of drinking water will be supplied annually through the project. It will supply 4.68 megawatts to the national and resolve flood issue in the districts.
