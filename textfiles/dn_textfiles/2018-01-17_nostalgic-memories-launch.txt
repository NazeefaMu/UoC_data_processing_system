Nostalgic  memories launch

Narada Wijeyasuriya’s latest publication is an autobiography titled as Mathaka Potha written in a simple, yet, lucid style. The biography accommodates minute details about the unknown life of known figures. The central focus of the book is woven around nostalgia, now a trendy fashion among the literati. A reader scanning across Wijeyasuriya’s book will have an idea about the nostalgic flavor.
A student of Nalanda College, Colombo, Wijeyasuriya flew to Switzerland on a scholarship.
His next milestone is entering the University of Colombo.
Over the past years, he has breathed into several roles such as teacher, journalist, television presenter, poet and lyricist. The book will be launched at the Ananda Samarakone Studio of Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation on January 20 at 2.30 pm.
