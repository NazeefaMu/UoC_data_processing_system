Four GMOA top officials to contest SLMC election

Four top officials of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) including Dr. Aunuruddha Padeniya will contest Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) election, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya, GMOA Assistant Secretaries Dr. Navin De Zoysa and Dr. Nalinda Herath, and Consultant Pediatrician Dr. Harris Pthiyage would hand over nominations for the election.
The GMOA is now seeking legal advice for its future actions against holding the election as its violates rules and regulations.
They should be gazetted before calling for nominations and holding the election, he said.
The GMOA has already informed its objection to President Maithripala Sirisena and all relevant authorities.
The SLMC would not change its stand on the SAITM and protect the standards of medical education, he said.
