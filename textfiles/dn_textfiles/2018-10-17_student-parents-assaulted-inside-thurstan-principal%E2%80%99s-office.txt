Student, parents assaulted inside Thurstan Principal’s office

A father, mother and their son have been severely beaten inside the principal’s office at Thurstan College by a group of students including prefects last Monday morning.
Police media spokesperson’s office said the student’s parents had arrived at the school to meet the principal to complain about the continuous harassment their son had to face for the last few months from several students including school prefects.
The principal had been out of the office at that moment and they had waited in his office when some students including prefects had attacked the student with clubs.
The father and mother who had intervened to protect their son from the assault were also beaten with clubs by the group. The father and his son are now receiving treatment at the accident ward. ASP Lucky Randeniya and the Cinnamon Gardens Police OIC are conducting the probe.
