Quarters will be provide for all health staff by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had stated.
According to Minister Dr. Senaratne, during the first phase of the programme quarters for Consultant doctors and doctors will be provided. Tenders have already been called for this housing project.
During the second phase of the programme, quarters will be provided for nurses, RMPs and AMPs. Rest of the health workers will be given quarters after this phase of the programme. At present, health workers face various problems due to lack of quarters when they receive transfers.
Last year, Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne presented a Cabinet Paper to commence a housing programme for health sector workers this year. This programme is scheduled to be completed within three years (2020).
