Dr. Arosha, Sadesh Kumar appointed to Board of MPI film circuit

In an unprecedented move, former Working Director of ITN, former Senior Consultant of Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRC-SL) and a well known film producer, Dr. Arosha Fernando who has been recognised for producing the highest number of films in the recent time, 16 films within a short span of 4 years including the Movie EKA DAWASAKA API which is currently being screened in the CEL film circuit along with the high budget film producer who has produced the popular films Super Six, Pravegaya and Maya, R. Sadesh Kumar has acquired shares of one of the five film circuits in Sri Lanka, Movie Producers & Importers Company Pvt Limited also known as MPI film circuit at an undisclosed price, and subsequently appointed to the board of directors.
It's a historical move as this is the first time in the history that the ownership of a film circuit has been purchased by a new party since the establishment of the five film circuits in Sri Lanka in year 2002.
MPI film circuit has a total of 34 film theaters including both Sinhala centres and Tamil centres spread across the country including North & East. It's one of the largest film circuits in Sri Lanka after the state owned Rithma film circuit which comes under the National Film Corporation having 57 theatres.
MPI is licensed to produce, distribute and screen Sinhala films as well as import, distribute and screen Tamil, Hindi and English films.
Responding to the questions raised regarding the new acquisition, Dr. Arosha said, "We know that once developed, any film circuit can be a lucrative business and we are endeavour to work closely with the other board directors to make a solid plan to develop MPI to different height by end of the year".
