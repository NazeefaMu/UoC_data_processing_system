‘GMOA prepared to launch strike on August 3’

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) had decided to launch an island-wide strike on August 3 at 8.00 am, if it does not receive a positive response from President Maithripala Sirisena, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo, yesterday, he said that the GMOA expected the President to hold immediate discussions with them, adding that if he were to not respond positively, the proposed strike would be launched. Dr. Aluthge said the strike would affect both state and private sector medical services.
"The government has imposed four taxes on patients. The government should not—and cannot—consider people falling ill as a reason to impose taxes," he added.
According to Dr. Aluthge, there was no positive response, or any response whatsoever, from President Sirisena or the relevant Health officials for the 10 demands recently presented by the GMOA in writing.
"Turning a deaf ear to demands will lead to an island-wide strike. One of the main demands presented by the GMOA was restricting the tax limit to 12 percent for professionals. Currently, ministers import vehicles valued at Rs. 460 million using tax money paid by professionals," he said, adding that tax on doctors' vehicles had been increased, while their transport allowances remained unchanged.
Making arrangements to sign more Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with several countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and India without having a proper national policy on signing such agreements, was another main reason to launch the strike, Dr. Aluthge said; the FTA signed with Singapore was unacceptable as it posed possible adverse effects on the Sri Lankan economy.
