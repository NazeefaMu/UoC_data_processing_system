A truly Indian experience

India celebrates 71 year of independence this year while Sri Lanka celebrates 70 years of independence this year. This friendship between Sri Lanka and India is highly valued by the governments of both countries, which is why the High Commission of India in Colombo tries to do something of importance every year to strengthen relations between both countries.
And last week they organized a musical evening named “Bollywood and Beyond” celebrating independence.
Music has always been considered a unifying force in this world throughout history. Indeed it is a universal language that speaks to the hearts and minds of both men and women.
This time the High Commission of India used the power of music to demonstrate India’s commitment and intent towards eternal friendship and love between our two countries.
For this purpose three stars aligned last week – Violin Maestro Padma Bhushan Dr. L. Subramaniam, Renowned Vocalist Padma Shri Kavita Krishnamurti and Daughter Bindu Subramaniam. All these three individuals are musical personalities who have etched their name in Bollywood and ‘Beyond’. Dr. L. Subramaniam is a musical genius, Krishnamurti a Bollywood sensation and Bindu Subramaniam is her father’s daughter and a class of her own. She owned the night with her powerful voice. Bindu Subramaniam is renowned internationally and as well as in India.
Before her performance, the music of Dr. L. Subramaniam and Kavita Krishnamurti held the audience spellbound.
The Sri Lanka audience was treated to a truly unique Indian experience. Seeing these three phenomenally talented artistes on one stage on one night was an unforgettable experience.
Words can’t really express what that musical evening was like except that it was a privilege to be there. Getting an opportunity to be in the presence of these internationally renowned musicians and listening to their rapturous music, was like attending a Beyonce Concert or a Rihanna concert!
At the evening were some political heavy weights - President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, a number of Ministers, Members of Parliament, senior officials and diplomats were among the dignitaries who participated in the special cultural event.
The musical evening showcased the beautiful blending of Indian and Western classical music with popular Bollywood songs.
The trio were accompanied by eminent musicians Tanmoy Bose on Tabla, Frijo Francis and Sanjay Marathe on Keyboard, Alwyn Dominic Fernandes on Guitar, Keith Peters on Bass guitar, Prasad Kulkarni on Octopad and percussion and Satya Sai on Mridangam.
High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu evinced his pleasure by warmly welcoming everyone to the momentous occasion. The High Commissioner delivered a powerful speech.
“Today is a fitting occasion to mark this milestone of 70 years of independence in Sri Lanka. This is a milestone for democracy as well. It has been a delightful and a satisfying journey. Both of our countries have walked the path of democracy with confidence and courage. We have faced challenges boldly and we have given the best to our countries. This is testimony to our invincible will and fearless spirit. It is a moment of pride for both of our countries. We are keen to reach our destination while being conscious of the path chosen. The journey is as important as the destination.
Our forefathers have courageously made sacrifices. There are so many unsung heroes – the men and women who have made sacrifices for our two countries in their own unique ways. We are walking towards a bright future with common interests with the wishes and aspirations of our peoples merging. This merely strengthens the bonds between our two peoples – India and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka occupies a special place amongst our neighbors. We are delighted by the fact that our interaction and projects benefits both our peoples,” said Sandhu.
Sandhu said that India is always ready to assist Sri Lanka and India will stand by Sri Lanka.
“Finally I wish to thank the Subramaniam trio and the players for being here today giving this musical evening meaning and for providing entertainment and being a part of our celebrations today. The cultural ties between Sri Lanka and India ties their soul and spirit together. The overwhelming turnout here today proves this. Our ties run deep,” said Sandhu.
