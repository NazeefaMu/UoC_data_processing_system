Health Ministry Media Unit broken, equipment missing

The doors of the Health Ministry Media Unit had been broken and all computers, other equipment, files, and CDs among others in the Unit were removed on the night of the appointment of the new Prime Minister Mahnda Rajapaksa, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, after observing the damages the following morning they asked the Health Ministry Security to lodge a formal complaint to the police.
The tradition so far from the time of the former Health Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva was to hand over the rooms, computers and other electronic equipment to the new media unit officials who arrive with the new Health Minister.
The Media Unit officials who leave the office take only their documents sans anything else, the sources said.
An official asserted that some files may have been removed from the premises by the time the tip-off was given.
Every indication is that the documents related to certain government health sector appointments and tenders to procure pharmaceuticals were taken.
An investigation has been launched into the incident. Most of the health sector bigwigs are now overseas attending a Global Conference on Primary Healthcare in Astana, Kazakhstan, the media reported.
