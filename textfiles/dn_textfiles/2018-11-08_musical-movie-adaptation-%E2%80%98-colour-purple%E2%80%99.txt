Musical movie adaptation of  ‘The Colour Purple’

Steven Spielberg is back with yet another interesting project. This time he would don the producer’s hat for the Tony Award-winning movie ‘The Colour Purple’, which would be a musical.The Alice Walker novel, ‘The Colour Purple’, was initially turned into a Steven Spielberg drama and later on made into a Broadway musical. Warner Bros. has now decided to develop it into a musical movie. The Tony Award winner will soon hit the big screen.
The Broadway version of the movie was produced by Oprah Winfrey, Quincy Jones and Scott Sanders, who would now also produce the big-screen musical. The 1982 Alice Walker novel was adapted in both the movie and stage productions.
Walker was the first black woman to have won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Whoopi Goldberg starred as Celie in Spielberg’s movie, which earned 11 Oscar nominations; although it didn’t win any. Winfrey, making her feature acting debut, also earned a nomination.“We’re really excited to create a film that translates the heart and emotion we found in telling this generational story on stage,” Sanders told THR. “This is an incredibly powerful drama that needs to be shared,” added Sanders.
