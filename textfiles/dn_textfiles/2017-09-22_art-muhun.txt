The Art of Muhun

Juliet Coombe gets curd creative after learning the secret to making Tissa Buffalo curd
Tissa has been famous for producing thick creamy curd for thousands of years. The name curd is traditionally used in the in the Indian Sub continent to refer to yogurt. Some Kataragama pilgrims stop in Tissa to buy curd pots as an offering and others to refresh themselves before going to the holy of holies. However I have gone to Tissa to learn first hand how to make my own pot of this Greek style thick lush yogurt that is the perfect way to start ones day or end it with a treat by adding a splash of treacle.
The paddy culture
As the fruit bats fly overhead across the lake, to hang out in Para Mara trees, we set off in a safari jeep to learn about Tissa’s historic curd-making process, first hand in an exciting half day experience. Driving past Tissa Temple, reflected in the paddy fields filled with water, watching one small boy fly a kite as buffaloes trundled across the road in front of us, was almost biblical if it weren’t for the fact that this is a deeply Buddhist town.
We turn off onto a small track and head to a scenic rural area called Polgahawelana, Debarawewa, Tissa. Here adorable baby buffaloes were playing in their cattle skips waiting to be taken to their mothers for milk, which is partly a trick to get the herd of buffalos lactating so the curd producer can collect the creamy milk in a silver churn that is carried on the back of their singer bikes with only coir ropes to secure them.
After having a go at milking and making everyone laugh at how little milk I managed to produce, we return to the curd producer, Ajit’s family home for tea where we learn, over a cup of Ceylon Pekoe, how 

on average each buffalo female produces two to three liters of milk each morning. Farmer, Ajit Siriwardhana collects 24 liters on average each day and returns home on his bike to his wife Chandralatha, who has prepared a wooden fire and huge pot with a ladle ready for the fresh milk. The milk is boiled and ladled for forty five minutes as she keeps pouring it back into the pot, while kindling the fire, until the buffalo milk starts to curdle, forming a skin on the top to show it is ready. Then she pours it into empty terracotta clay pots. While this is happening the amazing EKHO Safari Hotel naturalist guide Samarth Udugampala, who worked with Galle Wildlife Conservation society as a wildlife research officer, takes us on a fascinating village walk to learn about the paddy culture, village life, the trees that are important for medicinal purposes, and how Kaduru has a double purpose if mixed with other things. Its seeds can help cancer patients, but can also be used to commit suicide, often in the village where a love affair has gone tragically wrong.
Great cooking secrets
As you walk along the edge of the paddy fields learning about rice production you will also see many types of wildlife from lizards, like the monitor, to rat snakes. You will enjoy some of the 245 species of butterflies like the Lemon Migrant butterfly and Plain Tiger, as in the dry zone. Udugampala explains how useful the coconut trees are and how everything can be used from the husk for rope, to the stem for roofing material, the milk to make the curries, and the flower for making the local whisky toddy. I learn how the villagers also burn the husk in the morning and evening as a natural mosquito repellent, and in the kitchen use coconut husks as firewood. The husks can even be used as bowls if they are a nice shape and are polished for sambals to be served in. Along with naming the plants there are fun activities, such as touching the sleeping grass that curls in your hands and is used as traditional medicine to help the nervous system. The villagers live with nature and you will see many interesting insects, frogs and the Purple Swamp Hen. Bird watchers will love this trail as you might also see Green Bee Eaters, Little Egrets, Intermediate Egrets, White Breasted Kingfishers, Common Kingfishers, Green Imperial pigeons, and/or Spotted Dows. If you enjoy this traditional nature walk then consider the early evening bird watchers’ boat trip at 3.30pm, on the Tissa Tank, leaving from the hotel private platoon.
After the walk through the village you will sample, on the veranda, the butter top curd, set over eight hours and usually sold for 160 rupees a pot to buyers who come to their home in the evenings. On average Siriwardhana makes 18 pots daily from 12 milk collecting buffalo. Interestingly, hybrid cows produce milk twice a day in the morning and evening. As part of the experience you will try the curd with locally produced treacle. Interestingly in the old days to pasteurize the curd they would wash the curd pot with the pee of the buffalo but today they use a little bit of the old curd for the new pot of fresh curdled milk, which is called Muhun in Sinhalese.
Passing through picturesque paddy fields, we return to the hotel where we learn how to make cheesecake and delicious desserts with the master chef, so you can see for yourself how this ancient tradition is now being used in diverse exciting new ways. This cooking class takes place in the air-conditioned dining hall overlooking the five hundred year old banyan tree. Here the chef will share some of his great cooking secrets and let you have a go at being curd creative. But take care, as whatever you produce will be served with your lunch. One tip if the rice and curry are ever too hot, have a spoonful of curd, as like sugar it will neutralize the chili and quickly cool you down.
