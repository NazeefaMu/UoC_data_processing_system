PARLIAMENT

Both Commission reports to be taken for debate after PRECIFAC report is translated
The Secretary to the President has informed Parliament that approximately a month's time would be taken to translate and submit the PRECIFAC report, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
MP Wimal Weerawansa, raising a point of order, questioned as to when the debate on the reports of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue and the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) would be taking place.
The first debate on the two reports was held on February 6, 2018. At the second day of the debate which was scheduled for February 20, 2018, it was postponed as TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran pointed out that they were not able to participate in the debate as the PRECIFAC report was in Sinhala. The reports were then forwarded to the Official Languages Department for translation.
In reply, Speaker Jayasuriya said the second day of the debate was still fixed for Friday (23), however, translations on both the reports were yet to be completed by the Official Languages Department. He pointed out that if both reports were in English, they could have held the debate. In response, MP Weerawansa asked if it was possible to hold the debate on the Treasury bond issue as the Commission’s report was available in English. “Since we already have the Treasury Bond Commission report, could we not take it for debate until a translated copy of the PRECIFAC report was submitted?” he questioned. In reply, Speaker Jayasuriya informed that a decision had been taken at the Party Leaders’ meeting to take both commission reports together for debate.
Speaking on the same matter, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake requested the Speaker to expedite the translation process, as both reports were mandatory for the debate.
“It is not fair to request for the the report to be taken which addresses their fraud and corruption later and to take the report which investigates into others’ corruption first. We need both these reports for the debate as soon as possible,” MP Ratnayake pointed out. He requested the Speaker not to solely rely on the Official Languages Department on the translations of these two reports and requested the possibility of deploying Parliamentary staff to expedite the translation process.
Meanwhile MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara speaking on the same topic, said it would take a longer time if the Parliament was to wait until the Official Languages Department completed the translations of these two reports. “As I have once been the subject Minister for this department and the ministry, I am very much aware of the capacity of this institute. Thus, you might want to rely on another source as well, if you really wanted to receive the translated copies soon.”
MP Nanayakkara made requested to avoid the use of the issue on translations as a scapegoat to delay the debate on the two reports.
New Standing Orders to come into effect from April 15:Speaker
The attendance of the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister to reply to questions raised during the oral question round in Parliament would be mandatory from April 15, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker made this observation when UNP's backbench MP Ashoka Priyantha, complained that the relevant ministers were often absent when they raise questions and which deprives them of the chance to get proper answers to the supplementary questions they raise.
The Speaker said according to the new Standing Orders adopted by the House early this month, the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister should be present to answer questions. The Speaker said that he had directed the attention of both the President and Prime Minister in this regard.
The new Standing Orders would come into effect from April 15.
Govt. members demand separate high court to expedite large corruption, fraud
The Government members in one voice insisted in Parliament yesterday, to set up a separate high court to expedite high profile cases on allegations of financial crimes and large scale corruption and fraud.
When the House took up several regulations and rules moved by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, Government MPs who took the floor stood firm that the offenders who swindled public money must be tried before Courts of Law without further delay.
They reminded that the punishing of rogues and taking a hard-line on corruption and fraud, was a key election pledge of the ‘Yahapalana’ Government. They emphasized that the Government should not back peddle on this pledge at any cost.
Deputy Ministers Karunarathna Paranavithana and Ranjan Ramanayake and UNP backbench MPs Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Ashoka Priyantha and Ajith Mannapperuma, called on the Government to expedite the high profile cases on corruption and fraud by going ahead with the proposal to set up a separate high court.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath and UPFA MP Douglas Devananda, too, threw in their weight behind the plea. None of the members from the SLFP took part in the debate yesterday.
“Punishing those involved in financial crimes and large scale corruption and fraud was an urgent matter of national importance in the country today. The seriousness of some of those cases had rocked the entire country. We are unable to move an inch forward without prosecuting those involved in such cases. Large scale corruption and fraud are a cancer that should be dealt with,” Paranavithana said.
Reminding that justice delayed is justice denied, the Deputy Minister pointed out that the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary have a special role to play in meting out justice with regard to high profile cases which had come to light recently.
He pointed out that those who spoke against the move of setting up a separate court, exposed their allegiances with the wrong doers. “We need a revival of the judiciary, while a separate court is the first step in that direction. We also need a new political culture that respects the tenets of good governance,” he added.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath pointed out that the Government had failed to prosecute the rogues for three long years, due to its deals with the accused party. He said nobody should be afraid of setting up a separate court if they are not guilty of wrong doing. “Go before that court and clear your name if you are not guilty,” he told those, objecting to the Judicature Amendment Bill.
He also accused that President Maithripala Sirisena’s entourage during his recent visit to Japan included an individual accused of murder and another accused of financial fraud.
“The allegiance of these persons, speaks as to why they had gone scot free despite the serious allegations against them. On the other hand, the Prime Minister was also accused of making deals with the offenders,” he added.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa queries as to how SAITM appears to be on sale
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa, referring to a newspaper advertisement, questioned yesterday, as to how the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital which was officially handed over to the Government, appears to be on sale. Jayatissa further questioned if the government had actually acquired the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and how SAITM advertises the selling of the hospital.
JVP MP Jayatissa also pointed out that the government was paying Rs. 300 million per month at present, for the same hospital which was taken over in August.
Jayatissa did not receive an answer from State Minister of Higher Education Mohan Lal Grero who was to respond to the question. Minister Grero stated that the initial question raised by Jayatissa was not related to the SAITM issue, but on the Advanced Level examination results and the minimum cut off marks for Government Medical Institutions.
Jayatissa who forwarded a series of questions to Grero, asked if it was fair to make the minimum cut off grades for Government Medical Institutions be at a high standard, whereas private medical institutions were allowed to enroll students at a lower grade level. “A student in Hambantota, also need two A grades and a B to enter the Government Medical Faculty. So isn’t it unfair for them, when SAITM takes in students for two C grades and a pass?” Jayatissa initially questioned.
Minister Grero, refusing Jayatissa’s argument, stated that the present structured education system in the country does not correctly measure the intelligence of students.
He pointed out that A/L results have become an accepted criterion, only because there was no other option. “The results recorded by a student in grade five scholarship examination, O/L or A/L examination, does not evaluate which profession that particular student should master in,” he added. Accordingly, Grero said that a student with three A passes would not be as qualified as a student who had scored lesser grades, but has better interpersonal intelligence.
Countering Grero, Jayatissa said that even Parliament has the level of education as a criterion when recruiting persons providing gardening services at the Parliament. “In any profession, there is a required education level. There could be such concepts about methods to measure a person’s intelligence, but a criterion on education level is still important.” Jayatissa pointed out.
‘CB bond issue too could be heard at proposed special courts’
The case pertaining to the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance could also be heard at the proposed special courts, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala said in Parliament yesterday.
She made these observations in reply to JVP MP Vijitha Herath who proposed to take up the case on the Central Bank bonds issue as the first in one of the three proposed high courts to expedite cases on large scale corruption and fraud. She said the sole objective of the proposal to set up separate courts, was to punish the wrong doers, adding that it was not an attempt of a political witch-hunt. She said her Ministry is awaiting the Supreme Court's opinion, adding that future steps on the separate court would be based on the Supreme Court ruling.
Private Institution owes SLRD Rs. 9.78 million:Dy Minister
Sri Lanka Railways Department is yet to receive Rs. 9.78 million from a private institution for granting railway carriages for renovation and attachment to trains to offer luxury services to tourists, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Deputy Minister was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Lucky Jayawardena.
Jayawardana queried as to whether all dues have been obtained from private institutions to which these carriages were granted by the Railway Department.
Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said an sum of Rs. 9.78 million had to be obtained from a private institution called ‘JF Tours and Travels.’
“JF Tours’ agreement with the SLRD expires in 2021. Therefore, the SLRD has decided to obtain the due amount in four instalments per year.
An instalment would be Rs. 500,000 minimum. We have to get the approval from the Secretary to the Treasury for this proposal and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) should be signed with the company. We will obtain the due amount in full before the agreement expires,” Abeysinghe said.
The Deputy Minister however, noted that this was not a loss to the SLRD, but an additional income.
“These were used carriages and the department receives an additional income by granting them to private institutions,” he said.
