Cabinet reshuffle: changing pillow for headache

The Cabinet reshuffle is similar to changing pillow for headache. It shattered people's hopes for better appointments, Abhayarama Viharaya Chief Incumbent Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said.
Addressing the media at Abhayaramaya in Colombo yesterday, Ven. Ananda Thera said the Independence Square was not given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to commemorate soldiers who laid their lives for the motherland.
The law of the land should be implemented without being biased. All ethnic groups and religions should be treated equally, the Thera said.
