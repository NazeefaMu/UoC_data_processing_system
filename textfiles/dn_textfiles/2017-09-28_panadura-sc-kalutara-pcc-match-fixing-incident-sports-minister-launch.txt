Panadura SC-Kalutara PCC match fixing incident: Sports Minister to launch independent inquiry

Minister of Sports, Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said an independent inquiry will be launched into the Premier ‘Tier B’ match between Panadura Sports Club and Kalutara Physical and Culture Club played at Surrey grounds, Maggona from January 23-25.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) which had held initial investigations into the game had stated that “both clubs were guilty of misconduct and had not played to the spirit of the game”.
On the final day, the two teams produced 607 runs for 23 wickets lost in just 60.4 overs which led to suspicion of the manner in which the match was played.
The SLC imposed punishment on all the players and coaches of from both teams and they received a one year suspension from all cricket related activities in addition to a fine of Rs. 500,000 being imposed on each club.
Critics however have pointed out that it was unfair to only punish the players when the club officials themselves have not faced any censure.
“I agree that the ruling is unfair and that match fixing cannot take place with the involvement of just the players,” said Minister Jayasekara addressing the weekly cabinet briefing yesterday.
He explained that Chamara Silva, the captain of the Panadura SC who reported sick on the day, had submitted an affidavit to the Ministry and that all other players too were willing to do the same.
“The problem was that when the investigations were launched, lawyers represented the teams as a whole. If individual cricketers were allowed to give their own statements, we could have got a better result,” he said.
Jayasekara pushed aside allegations that action was not being taken against the club owners because they were members of SLC.
“The law will apply to all equally. I am not worried about which position someone holds. I will send home all those who bring disrepute to the game and the country,” stressed the Sports Minister.
