Villagers urge to repair road

The road leading to Addalaichenai Government Teachers’ College (GTC) North in the Addalaichenai Divisional Secretariat Division in Ampara is in a state of disrepair.
The road which has not been repaired for a long time has large pot holes and vehicles run on the dilapidated road with great difficulty.
Affected villagers urge authorities to take steps to construct the dilapidated road.
