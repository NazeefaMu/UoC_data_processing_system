Eminent Marine Engineer joins CSC for supervising new ships-in-building

Chief Engineer (Marine) M. D. Christy Emalson Jayamanne has joined Ceylon Shipping Corporation on second-mend basis as the Chief Engineer of the on-going shipbuilding of the two Break Bulk Vessels that are under construction in a Chinese shipyard in Weihai.
These two new vessels which are expected to arrive in Sri Lanka in January and April 2016 respectively, will be commissioned for the carriage of coal to the Lakvijaya Power Plant in Norochcholai, Puttlam. Each of these vessels has a cargo carrying capacity of 63,000 DWT, and will be able to sail in any part of the world's oceans with the capability of carrying dry bulk cargo. Commencement of their operations will open new avenues for CSC to venture into bulk cargo markets that are becoming quite lucrative in modern day shipping business.
