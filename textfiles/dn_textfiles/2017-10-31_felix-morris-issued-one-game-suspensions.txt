Felix, Morris issued one-game suspensions

New York: Washington Wizards guard Carrick Felix and forward Markieff Morris were each issued one-game suspensions by the NBA on Sunday for leaving the bench during an in-game altercation against Golden State. In addition, three other players were fined as a result of the incident, which took place with 19.5 seconds remaining in the second quarter of the reigning NBA champion Warriors’ 120-117 home win Friday over Washington. Wizards guard Bradley Beal initiated the altercation by grabbing Warriors forward Draymond Green around the neck.
Beal was ejected for starting the incident and was fined $50,000 on Sunday. Green, who escalated the incident by confronting Beal and continuing the conflict, was ejected for fighting and was fined $25,000. AFP
