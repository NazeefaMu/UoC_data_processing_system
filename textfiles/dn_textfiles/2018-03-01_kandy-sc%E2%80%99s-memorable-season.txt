Kandy SC’s  memorable season

Today rugby is very popular in the central hills with the success Kandy Sports Club had this season sweeping everything before them to win the league and knockout titles without losing a single match.
It was a joyful occasion for Kandy who carried away another trophy displaying and outplaying their opponents showcasing their lofty standards. They made history by becoming the first team to win the Clifford Cup on 22 occasions since 1992.
They continued to walk the local rugby world like a colossus this season both in the league and the knockouts.
Kandy SC has won the Clifford Cup for a consecutive period of ten years between 1995 and 2005 (the competition was not held in 1998) and six consecutive years between 2007 and 2012. In 2006 Kandy withdrew from the tournament (due to dispute over the ground allocation).
The years they have won are 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, In the years 1954,1955, 1969 and 1978 they were placed second.
In Sunday’s Cup final they beat a fighting Sri Lanka Navy XV at Longden Place. Among those who graced this memorable event and enjoyed the top class rugby dished out by Kandy were Dialog’s Group Chief Marketing officer Amali Nanayakkara, Sri Lanka Rugby president Asanga Seneviratne and Vice President Lasitha Gunaratne.
The rugby on show was befitting a cup final; where both teams were locked in a tense battle in the first half using all their rugby skills.
The game began with Navy forwards dominating the proceedings. But whenever Kandy won possession they looked very dangerous with their three-quarters running the ball in splendid fashion. Still the sailors prevented Kandy’s penetrative moves with some terrific tackles by their forwards.
Both teams displayed a willingness to throw the ball around but neither got too close to their opponent’s line in the first quarter.
The winners displayed some excellent running rugby to show they’ll again be hard to stop in the race for the grand win. Everyone was impressed by the work rate of the winning team, the power of the players looked good and their work rate. It was a team effort that resulted in victory.
Many seem to have forgotten those glorious moments of Kandy, but there are still a few who remember the part played by promoters, one such person is former Royalist Malik “Mr. Rugby” Samarawickrema. Malik’s name is a household in the game of rugby.
He played for Royal College as a scrum half from 1966 to 1968 and CR & FC, Low Country and was also a member of the Sri Lanka President’s XV.
He hung up his boots in 1977 and became a great promoter of the sport, and today in the field of rugby he is the undisputed king maker. It was Samarawickrema who brought Kandy to its present standard through his knowledge and experience.
A big hand should go to the rugby committee headed by former captain Lasantha Wijesuriya. The champion Kandy SC squad comprised Gayan Weeraratne (captain), Damith Dissanayake, Richard Dharmapala, Shehan Pathirana, Oshan Perera, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Dimitri Wijetunga, Thilina Wijesinghe, Jason Dissanayake, Nigel Ratwatte, Lavanga Perera, Fazil Marija, Lasitha Aththanagoda, Danush Dayan, Dhanushka Ranjan, Asitha Ratnayake, Roshan Weeraratne, Yakoob Ali, Arshad Jamaldeen, Piyumal Manchanayake, Anurudda Wilwara, Ganuka Dissanayake, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Shashika Jayawardana, Heshan Kalhara, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Suhiru Anthony, Ashan Darling, Tharindu Chathuranga, Sanushka Abeywickrama, Heshan Jansen, Diluksha Dange, Kasun Srinath, Chathura Seneviratne, Lakshitha Ranaweera. Coaching staff - Sean Wijesinghe, Saliya Kumara, team manager - Kapila Silva, Sanjeewa Perera and masseur and Siva Kumar.
This was the last game of Fazil Marija, who once again was the cynosure of all eyes and he signed off with another magnificent display.
A player of international class Marija who mesmerized opponents and spectators with his magnificent and inspirational play is not likely to be seen again.
