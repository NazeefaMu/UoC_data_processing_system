Moratuwa, Peradeniya university professionals certify safety of Rajagiriya Flyover

The Rajagiriya Flyover is recommended for safe operation and for the use of the public, said Peradeniya University Engineering Faculty Senior Lecturer Dr. Krishan Wijesundara.
He made this statement at a press conference held at the head office of the Road Development Authority.
Dr. Wijesundara further said that the Rajagiriya Flyover is designed in accordance to the Euro code and an ‘As Built’ analysis was carried out to check the structural stability. The ‘As Built’ analysis for the Rajagiriya Flyover was carried out by the Moratuwa University’s Engineering Faculty, together with professionals from the Peradeniya University’s Engineering Faulty.
According to the Finite Element Analysis carried out by the Moratuwa University’s Engineering Faculty, structural stability of the Rajagiriya Flyover is assured and thus, it is safe for operation and fit for the intended purpose. Therefore, the Rajagiriya Flyover was opened for traffic.
Deflection and vibrations in structures are inherent due to live loads, according to design standards. Steel structures amplified the vibrations compared to concrete structures, but at any moment will not jeopardise the integrity of the structure. Steel is the best material to construct this type of long-span complex bridge.
In addition, Peradeniya University’s professionals monitored the flyover to check actual stresses and performance of the bridge. This analysis is very important as a base date for future reference.
The second purpose of this analysis was to verity the result obtained from computer analysis with the actual data obtained from this monitoring mechanism.
This is a very valuable assessment as these data could be used for academic purposes of the university.
This flyover was monitored and data was collected under fully loaded conditions with vehicles. The highest weighted vehicles available in Sri Lanka were loaded onto the flyover to get relevant data for the analysis.
As per the design criteria, the allowable vertical displacement of this flyover is 40 mm, while the actual observed maximum vertical displacement is only 8 mm with heavily loaded vehicles.
Therefore, the flyover is in the safety region. For this structure, natural vibration should be higher than 2 Hz to ensure safety aspects, while the actual natural vibration is higher than 2.5 Hz. Therefore, the vibration level of this flyover is also in the safety region.
Therefore, the Rajagiriya Flyover is recommended for safe operation, as it is theoretically proved using real readings that were verified by the analysis.
Addressing the news conference, RDA Project Engineer Himantha Jayalath said that this four-lane flyover was constructed with a four-lane service road under the flyover to take all turning movements. Totally there are eight lanes for this flyover system. And the number of existing lanes on the Sri Jayewardenepura road is six.
Therefore, this eight-lane flyover merges with six lanes of the existing road. This merging occurs at a distance of 150 mm beyond the flyover, for smooth merging. Therefore, this not a bottleneck, as pointed out by some media, and this is the general phenomena of a flyover.
Jayalath further said that the Rajagiriya and Battaramulla area was congested even during off-peak times before the construction of the flyover.
“But this congestion was reduced after opening the Rajagiriya Flyover and much better benefits were obtained during evening peak time. This evening peak congestion was further reduced by utilising an additional lane in the peak direction. This concept is successfully used in other developed countries, and hence we started this with professional consultation from the Moratuwa University,” he said.
The investigation report prepared by the academics of the Peradeniya and Moratuwa Universities has confirmed that the Rajagiriya Flyover meets the required standards, said Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Suriyaarachchi.
Suriyaarachchi explained that the objective of the press conference was to reveal the actual situation pertaining to the ongoing research activities on the Rajagiriya Flyover. A measurement device was installed last Sunday to conduct checks, owing to which the use of the flyover was temporarily halted for about half an hour. These checks and monitoring are an integral part of the flyover plan, in the best interests of the public, he said.
However, there were various misleading reports in the media in this regard, Suriyaarachchi said. While thanking the media for the interest they are evincing with regard to the road development activities, the Chairman requested the media to clarify their doubts if they have any, and verify the truth of the information from him or his officials who are willing to cooperate, before they are published.
Road Development Authority Director General Rohitha Suwarna said generally with steel bridges and with concrete bridges, the vibrations are kept at a minimum. Hence the vibration when vehicles travel over them is at a minimum.
Explaining the high standards of the Rajagiriya Flyover, Suwarna reiterated it has been constructed meeting the necessary international standards and norms. He further said that there is plenty of knowledge and resources within Sri Lanka pertaining to the highly advanced technology of flyovers.
