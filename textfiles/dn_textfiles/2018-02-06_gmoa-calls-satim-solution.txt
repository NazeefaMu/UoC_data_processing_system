GMOA calls for SATIM solution

The two batches of SAITM medical students should be awarded with a local state medical degree or a foreign state or private medical degree and not SAITM MBBS, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMAO) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo last evening, he said that until the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), political authority and the judiciary accept the foundation of the solution, they will not be able to solve the SAITM issue.
According to Dr.Aluthge, any solution should be according the Medical Ordinance and the University Act and should not violate any of them.
The MBBS to be offered to the SAITM students should enable them to register with the SLMC.
'The Government should immediately issue the Gazette Notification on abolishing SAITM and the solution given to the SAITM issue should be presented to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General," he added.
