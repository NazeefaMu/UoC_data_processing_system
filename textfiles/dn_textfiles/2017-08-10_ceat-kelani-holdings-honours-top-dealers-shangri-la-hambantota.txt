CEAT Kelani Holdings honours top dealers at Shangri La Hambantota

The beauty and harmony evoked by the name ‘Shangri La’ was much in evidence when one of Sri Lanka’s leading tyre brand CEAT recently felicitated top dealers at an entertainment-filled weekend at the Hambantota resort and spa of the same name.
The top 125 dealers, their spouses and children were hosted by CEAT Kelani Holdings in acknowledgement of their contribution to the CEAT brand’s continuing market leadership in2016-17across multiple tyre categories in the domestic market.
This was the company’s first dealer awards event at a Sri Lankan venue in four years.
The last three such events were held in Rome, Singapore and Malaysia.
Speaking at the gala awards ceremony at the Shangri La ballroom, CEAT Kelani Managing Director Vijay Gambhire said the company takes great pride in its achievements in the last financial year, especially because it was a period of challenge due to an economic slowdown, natural disasters, escalation of raw material costs and depreciation of the Rupee.
Despite these challenges, CEAT Kelani had posted a resilient performance with six per cent sales growth and seven per cent value growth in 2016-17, achieved an overall market share of 46 per cent and maintained its brand equity at the highest in the country in the tyre sector, Gambhire said. In the radial category CEAT now has 39 tyre sizes and a market share of 32 per cent; in the motorcycle category a market share of 22 per cent with 32 sizes and in the Truck and Light Truck category a market share of more than 50 per cent, he disclosed.
“All of this is possible because of the hard work, dedication and loyalty of our dealer partners, who are being honoured at this awards night,” Gambhire said.
Top dealers received cash awards, trophies and certificates in recognition of their performances in each of the product categories that CEAT manufactures, as well for overall excellence.
They also had an opportunity to win gold through raffle draws conducted during the proceedings. Some of CEAT’s top dealers for 2016-17 were Sumidag Tyre Co., Sumith Marketing Co., U&H Wheel Service, Smart Wheels,Paramount Tyre Traders, M. J. R. Peiris & Sons, New Rizna Tyre House, Supiri Tyre Worksand Abdeen Tyre Service.
CEAT Kelani Holdings supplies nearly half of Sri Lanka’s overall requirement of pneumatic tyres and exports about a third of its production to countries in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Far East. The company’s manufacturing operations encompass the radial, commercial, motorcycle, three-wheeler and agricultural machinery segments.
