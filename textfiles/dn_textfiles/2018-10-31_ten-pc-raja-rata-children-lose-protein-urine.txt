Ten pc of Raja Rata  children lose protein  with urine

Almost 10 percent of children in Raja Rata lose protein along with urine, a recent study revealed, said Dr. Channa Jayasumana of the Raja Rata University.
This is an initial sign of impending kidney aliments, he said, and added that water filters should be installed in all schools to provide drinking water to schoolchildren, Dr. Jayasumana said.
The farmer population in Raja Rata is prone to kidney problems. Each farmer family had at least one kidney patient among them, he said.
He said while people were subjected to cancer and kidney problems, others engaged in a power struggle are giving scant regard to this problem.
He said the Anuradhapura district had recorded 44,000 kidney patients.
“There are nearly 80,000 kidney patients throughout the country.
“Altogether, 25,000 kidney patients had succumbed to the disease in recent times," he said.
