“The proposed land area spanning over 542.7, will have four warehouses with conventional cargo at Bandaranayake Quay for its intended development into a fully-fledged passenger ship terminal and also relocate three existing Custom Scanning facilities located outside the port premises into a facility centre within the premises, adjacent to the port access road,” it added.
The total area would be divided into zones according the intended development and it would be implemented in eight phases.

The Western Region Maritime City Development Project had studied the area and produced a conceptual plan for development, giving due consideration for current and future logistic demands.
The plan, according to the Cabinet paper, had recommended that the garbage dump be developed as an urban recreation park for public recreational purposes and open public space/recreation facilities in the Bloemendhal general area.
The plan would also look into enhancing logistics-handling capacity, port operations, multi-model transport facility, a passenger ship terminal, mitigating city traffic and educating and creating port-related employment opportunities for youth. The total project is expected to cost USD 200 million.
