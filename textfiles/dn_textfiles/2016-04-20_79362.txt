In the lawsuit, Upul had named Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake as the defendant. Upul claimed that Ramanayake on January 20, 2016 made defamatory remarks alleging that he fraudulently obtained a loan of Rs. 76 million from Lankaputhra Development Bank.
He stated that the defendant had made this statement with wrongful intention to defame or injure (Animus-Injuriandi) to him.
Upul alleged that the statement caused damage to his reputation and claimed Rs. 500 million as damages.
