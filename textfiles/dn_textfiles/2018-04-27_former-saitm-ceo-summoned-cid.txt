Former SAITM CEO summoned to CID

Former Chief Executive Officer of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Dr. Sameera Senaratne was summoned by the Crimes Investigation Division (CID) yesterday to record a statement, the CID said.
Previously on April 18, the former Kaduwela Pradeshiya Sabha member Wilathgamuwage Don Aruna Lakmal Kushantha was arrested by the CID for the attempted shooting of the SAITM Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Sameera Senaratne on February 6, 2017.
Police were earlier on the lookout for the former Pradeshiya Sabha member and a driver attached to a Local Government institution for the shooting.
Accordingly on March 24, the driver attached to the Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha, Susil Udayakumara, was arrested by the CID.
Police had earlier suspected that the shooting incident from where SAITM CEO Dr. Sameera Senaratne escaped unhurt was staged.
Police said the shooting was staged to show that CEO’s life was in danger. The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) Police arrested a suspect in Embilipitiya over the event and questioned a former Special Task Force officer in remand custody over another case.
Interrogations revealed that the shooting was staged, police said.
