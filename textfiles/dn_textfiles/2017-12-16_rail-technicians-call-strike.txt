Rail technicians call off strike

The Railway Technician Assistants have called off their strike action over the recruitment process after discussions with Railways General Manager, S.M. Abeywickrama.
The Railway Technician Assistants have called off the strike since the railway authorities had promised to address their grievances, Sri Lanka Railway’s spokesman said.
However, there was no disruption to train operations yesterday and the day before as a result of this strike.
