Dangayange Avurudu 2016

Whyteleaf Performing Arts Academy held its annual New Year celebrations ‘Dangayange Avurudu’ at Ratmalana recently. This event was organised for children and consisted of many traditional Avurudu games, singing and dancing performances. It was held with the attendance of several distinguished artistes like Jagath Wickramasinghe, Ashika Mathasinghe, Dinakshi Priyasad and Lakshan Wattuhewa.
The events included the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Kumariya, Fancy Dress Parade, Pillow Fight (Kotta Pora), Blind Pot Breaking (Kana Mutti Bideema), Marking the Elephant’s Eye (Aliyata Aha Thabeema) and many others. The students of the Academy skillfully drew upon their talents and eagerly participated in the events.
Keeping in line with the values of the Whyteleafe Academy, the judging of games such as the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Kumariya involved a wide range of criteria like personality, knowledge and capabilities instead of just the outward appearance.
Imaya Bogoda was crowned the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumariya (age group 11-16) and Dilya Janadheera was the Whyteleafe Singithi Avurudu Kumariya (age group 4 -10). Chamod Dabare was selected as the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Chaviru Perera was the Whyteleafe Singithi Avurudu Kumara.
Given the acting talents of the students at the Academy, the Fancy Dress competition became a very lively event of the day. Sajani Ranathunga and Kalindi Wanigasooriya were the winners of the senior and junior batches.
Students from both the Colombo and Kalutara branches of the Whyteleafe Academy participated in the celebrations along with their parents. The Prize Giving for the winners was held with the participation of veteran singer Jagath Wickramasinghe and his wife Gayani Wickramasinghe and the principal of St. Paul’s Girls school, Sumeda Jayaweera.
