About 80,000 in Kurunegala sans IDs

Out of the total population of 1.6 million in the Kurunegala district, 80,000 people are without National Identity Cards while 20,000 families do not have title deeds or permits to their lands. Also, 18,000 drivers do not posses valid driving licenses.
Due to these shortcomings, the ‘Nila-Mehawara Janapathi Janatha Sevaya’ mobile service programme is intended to remedy such shortcomings, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said. He was addressing the gathering at a 'Nila-Mehewara Janapathi Janatha Sevaya' mobile service programme held at the Ibbagamuwa Madya Vidyalaya to resolve problems of the people in the Ibbagamuwa DS division, recently.
The minister said the Home Affairs Ministry was first set up in 1931 during the British period and as such, it was a ministry with a long history.
Today, the ministry had 25 Kachcheris and 352 DS divisions under its purview and it had a close link with the people. His ministry had organised such mobile service programs to resolve people's problems such as obtaining NICs, birth certificates and driving licenses at their doorsteps enabling them to save money and time involved in such exercises. All projects launched by the previous regime in the area would continue to a successful completion as his ministry had allocated the funds for them.
