Man receives 10-year RI for child rape

Tangalle High Court Judge Sujatha Alahapperuma imposed a 10-year rigorous imprisonment (RI) on a father of six, who pleaded guilty to charges of raping an eight-year-old girl.
He was also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 500,000 to the girl and her family. The judge also ruled that if the suspect failed to pay the said fine, he would be imprisoned for an additional two and a half years.
State Counsel Oswald Perera appeared on behalf of the complainant.
