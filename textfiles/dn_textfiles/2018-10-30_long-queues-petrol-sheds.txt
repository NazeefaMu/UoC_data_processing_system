Long queues at petrol sheds

Long queues of vehicles were seen at petrol sheds yesterday with rumours of an indefinite strike to be launched by several Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) trade unions, following Sunday’s incident at Dematagoda Office.
The Hemmathagama Cooperative Petrol Shed saw nearly a 100-metre queue and a driver said he had to stay for over 45 minutes in the queue to get petrol. Due to the congestion, Police were deployed to control the situation. However, diesel in the shed was over in the morning.
