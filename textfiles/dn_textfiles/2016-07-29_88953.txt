Batting legend  Aravinda de Silva:  Kusal bats a  lot like Mahela

 
Batting legend Aravinda de Silva who was the only Sri Lankan to reach a maiden Test century with a six said that Kusal Mendis who emulated his feat at the Pallekele Stadium yesterday had the makings of a cricketer who could reach great heights in the game.
“His calm aggression shows the character of the person he is. He’s got all the material to make it big,” said De Silva after Mendis had swept spinner Nathan Lyon for six to reach his first three-figure innings in Test cricket playing in his seventh Test.
“Kusal tends to bat a lot like Mahela Jayawardene. If he can maintain the same standards as Mahela I am sure he will be able to reach the same lofty heights as Mahela did,” said De Silva. “I have seen Kusal when he played in the under 19 side and he showed he had a lot of potential. He was fast-tracked into the national team and it is now paying great dividends.”
De Silva scored his maiden Test century playing in his fifth Test against Pakistan when he hooked fast bowler Imran Khan for six in the first Test played at Faisalabad in 1985.
De Silva went onto score 19 more hundreds in a 93-Test career. – ST
