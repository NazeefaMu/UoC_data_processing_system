Overhaul of outdated Acts to facilitate budget relief measures

The government has decided to revise 13 outdated Acts to facilitate the relief measures proposed in the Budget.
Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga said the purpose of this move is to remove the technical errors and administrative difficulties arising due to restrictions in these Acts and thereby to immediately provide the relief measures proposed in the Budget.
The government reduced the prices of 11 essential items from the Budget to reduce the cost of living of the people. The prices of gas and kerosene were also reduced. The Budget also included many proposals to encourage local and foreign investments with the aim to generate one million job opportunities, he said.
The Secretary pointed out new regulations are needed to successfully implement these proposals.
Dr. Samaratunga said the relevant institutions are already instructed to formulate the legal framework to implement all the proposals in the Budget.
Accordingly, the Inland Revenue Act, No 10 of 2006, Value Added Tax Act, No 14 of 2002, Nation Building Tax Act, No 9 of 2009 and Economic Service Charge Act, No 13 of 2006 will be revised.
Moreover, the Financial Acts including the Betting and Gaming Levy Act, No 40 of 1988, Default Tax Recovery (Special Provisions) Act, No. 16 of 2010, Telecommunication Levy Act, No 21 of 2011, Ports and Airports Development Levy Act, No 18 of 2011 and Tax Appeals Commission Act, No 23 of 2011 will also be revised.
In addition, Import and Export (Control) Act, No 01 of 1969, Land (Restrictions on Alienation) Act, No 38 of 2014 and Strategic Development Projects Act, No 14 of 2008 will also be revised.
Samaratunga said the relevant bodies have also been instructed to draft new Bills if new laws are necessary to implement the budgetary proposals.
