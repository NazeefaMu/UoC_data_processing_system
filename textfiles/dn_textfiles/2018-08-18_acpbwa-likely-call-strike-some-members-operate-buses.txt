ACPBWA likely to call off strike, as some members operate buses

The All Ceylon Private Bus Workers Association (ACPBWA) is likely to call off their strike as some members of the Union had operated buses yesterday against the Association’s decision.
Trade Union action had not the desired impact on the transport service as the routine bus service was operated by private buses were available.
Meanwhile, ACPBWA Convener Kumararatna Renuka, had sought the intervention of President Maithripal Sirisena to solve the issue. Kumararatna while condemning the statement made by Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, said that they had no faith in the subject Minister.
“If a solution is not given, we will continue our Trade Union action,” he said.
