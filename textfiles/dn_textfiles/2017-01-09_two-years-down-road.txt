Two years down the road

Two years ago, on this day, the country was lashed with a political tsunami when the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena overcame severe odds to emerge victorious at the Presidential Election. The result no doubt would have overwhelmed this modest man from the out backs of Polonnaruwa, the son of a farmer, as much as it did the larger electorate. Sirisena when he left the SLFP as its General Secretary no less, and took the plunge to present himself as the candidate representing a rainbow coalition, of not only political parties, but also a wide spectrum of civil society organisations, artistes and social activists etc, he, no doubt, was treading on political quicksand.
On the one hand he had the challenging task of winning over the acceptance of the UNP, a large segment of whom would have not taken too kindly towards voting for a man of the enemy camp. On the other hand he had the might of the Rajapaksa ruling clan to contend with their control of state machinery, the unleashing of state terrorism and a highly obnoxious vilification campaign. That he braved the odds and emerged victorious is not only testament to the man’s courage and resourcefulness, but also a reflection of the public hope for a better country, ruled, not with an iron fist, but respecting and honouring the people’s rights and their genuine aspirations.
True, most of the pledges made, yet remain to be fulfilled and reforms promised have been moving at a slow pace. Bringing to book those responsible for mega corruption which formed the main plank of the election platform has also been slow, creating frustration among many, chiefly the civil society organsations which put their shoulder into the campaign of the Common Candidate.
But, there have been visible changes during the last two years, chief of which is the absence of the climate of fear. Even his worse critic would concede that today there is an air of freedom, freedom to critcise the government, media freedom, freedom of the judiciary etc. Ethnic relations have never been so good as at present with the President working earnestly towards reconciliation. He has to a great extent removed the stigma attached to the SLFP as a racist party by emphasizing national unity.
Under President Sirisena, there is a Unity Government today which has placed a moratorium on contentious and rancorous politics which retarded development and progress in the past. One time arch foes are today sitting together to map out development plans and work together to take the country in one direction, under the President’s stewardship.
The newly dawned year no doubt is going to witness many changes and radical shifts in many spheres. The President in his New Year message clearly indicated this. He placed accent on development and the employment generation. He said one’s objective should be for those in power not to look at consolidating that power or those not in power to aspire for power, but to work together for the good of the country.
The President is aware that goodwill and popularity is a transient phenomenon and that people are bound to change or shift allegiance soon if they are not satisfied with their rulers. Hence, he, together with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, will be looking towards alleviating the hardship, a large segment of the populace is forced to undergo, due to the high living costs, in the new year. Already he has the rice crisis to contend with and is bound to be confronted with other problems which the Opposition will wish on him to topple him from his perch. For now though, President Sirisena is firmly in the saddle and still enjoys the goodwill of a sizable section of the public. His journey no doubt will be strewn with obstacles and pitfalls, but he is certain to demonstrate the strong resolve and resourcefulness he displayed in overcoming a formidable political foe two years ago to emerge triumphant in the face of these challenges.
