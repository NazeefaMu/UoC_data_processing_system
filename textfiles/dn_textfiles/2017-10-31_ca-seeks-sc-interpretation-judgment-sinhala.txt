CA seeks SC interpretation on judgment in Sinhala

The Court of Appeal has sought the Supreme Court’s interpretation to ascertain whether Court of Appeal can issue a judgment in Sinhala as per a party’s request in a particular case. The Court of Appeal Justice (President) L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne has sought Supreme Court’s interpretation to ascertain whether there is legal provisions in the constitution to issue a judgment in Sinhala.
The judgments in the apex courts of Sri Lanka are delivered in English pursuant to the provisions of Article 24.4 of the constitution.
Public interest litigation activist, Attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri had made a request from Court of Appeal that he be provided a Sinhala translation of a judgment that was delivered by Court of Appeal on March 9, 2017 regarding a revision application.
In his revision application, Attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri has challenged lower courts decision to release several illegally captured elephants to the claimants to take part in the Perahera last year.
Mr. Laksiri maintained that citizens of Sri Lanka have constitutional right to obtain Sinhala translation of a judgment. He argued that powers vested on the Justice Minister through a gazette pursuant to the provisions of Article 24.4 of the constitution cannot be exceeded the provisions of Article 24.1, 24.2 and 24.3 of the constitution which need to be widely interpreted.
However, Counsel Asthika Devendra appearing for a respondent party informed that the Court should not entertain this request since Court proceedings could be disturbed and delayed if parties allowed to obtain Sinhala transaction of a judgment.
Deputy Solicitor General Warunika Hettige submitted to Court that this application should be referred to the Supreme Court since it a matter of constitutional interpretation.
Accordingly, the Court of Appeal has sought Supreme Court’s interpretation in this regarding in terms of Article 125 of the constitution.
