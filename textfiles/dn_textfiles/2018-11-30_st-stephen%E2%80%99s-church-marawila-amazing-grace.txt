St. Stephen’s Church, Marawila: amazing grace

Consecrated in 1870 and handed over to the Diocese of Colombo by the then Bishop Claughton, this quaint little church with its imposing dome atop is one of the oldest churches in the country.
Nestled among the lush greenery, ascending towards the eastern sky when dawn appears, is the magnificent but small abode of God.
The Stephen's church stand upright though with a small Anglican community in the Roman Catholic dominated Diocese of Chilaw.
The church is shepherded by its youthful priest, Rev. Fr. Anil Wickramasinghe.
Down the years, the church has nurtured among its simple community, an Archdeacon from the clergy; among intellectuals and professionals; the first Sri Lankan envoy to the United Nations, a foreign minister, doctors, lawyers, from the corporate sector; a postgraduate from the Oxford University, writers etc. and dedicated laymen from the church.
Together, all have lived and worshipped like one family which is the strength of the church upon the resonate voice of God on all of us.
JESUS CHRIST, THE SHEPHERD
As one enters the church, it is the figure of Jesus that comes in contact at eye-level on stained glass done in myriad colour, meticulously put together as homage to the Gentle Shepherd who carries the staff in his left hand.
A great bit of art work considering the time it was created over a century and still sits well. Here, Jesus gives the impression of the Risen Lord. Either way, Jesus protects all of us, his chosen flock.
THE FONT
Primary and original, the fountain-head for baptismal, the font is as old as the church. Erected in fine timber with the baptismal well, deeply inlaid with transparent crystal of a green hue with no cracks or damage in any way to hold the holy water for Christian babies as their lives are dedicated to God by their parents.
It is a spiritual journey as the years keep moving on and as they grow up in the spirit of God.
THE CEMETERY
The cemetery or the graveyard where the spirits of the deceased rest in peace under the watchful eyes of marble angels who guard the graves, some of which holds generations in their family vaults. Few of the marble statues are classic with clear-cut features and worth a colossal sum as they are priceless today.
No one dare steal them because they are protected by the unseen hand as God abide over them.
