The Clifford Cup knockouts will scrum down in February with one quarter and semi-final being played in Kandy at the Bogamabara Stadium. The fixtures are Quarterfinals: 16th - Friday, 17th – Saturday (2 match’s one in Kandy and the other in Colombo), 18th - Sunday. Semi-finals 20th in Colombo and 21st in Kandy and final 24 – Saturday (Kandy or Colombo). All Colombo matches will be at Race Course Stadium. The Clifford Cup is the most prestigious club rugby knockout tournament in Sri Lanka and probably the oldest rugby tournament in Asia. The Clifford Cup came into being in 1911 when Lady Elizabeth Clifford (wife of the acting Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hugh Clifford) was interested in the annual rugby football fixture between Low Country and Up Country and expressed a wish that a match take place in Colombo on her birthday 26 August, between teams representing the United Services and All Ceylon. Arrangements were made to play the match on August 26, but it was not to be as the venue the Race Course was not available on that particular day. The following year 1912 on September 2 the match finally took place and Kandy United Services defeated All Ceylon by 25-0. The All Ceylon team comprised entirely of European expatriates. Rugby was suspended due to the outbreak of World War I. It was once again revived by Sir Hugh Clifford who returned to Ceylon as the Governor and Lady Clifford.
The Clifford Cup was awarded to the winner of a quadrangular tournament comprising Low Country, Up Country, Ceylonese and the United Services. The first tournament in 1926 featured Ceylonese a team composed of entirely locally born players. Ceylonese lost the match against the Kandy United Services. The competition continued until 1938, when it was disrupted by the advent of the Second World War. In 1950 the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union decided to grant official status and a new system was planned and the cup was introduced to the club tournament, where clubs like Kandy Sports Club, Dimbulla A & CC, Dickoya MCC, Uva Gymkhana Club, (KV) Kelani Valley Club, Havelock Sports Club, CR & FC, and CH & FC took part. Havelock SC became the first champions. Then in 1961 five ‘affiliated’ rugby clubs, Police, Army, University, Air Force and Navy from Division ‘B’ were invited to join the tournament and play against the ‘constituent clubs’, forming a 13 team competition. The format of the competition was also changed, whereby all 13 clubs had to play each other once on a home and away basis in alternate years and at the end of the league season the best eight teams competed in a knock-out tournament for the Clifford Cup. In 1975, the format was further adjusted to give prominence to the teams who are able to score the highest number of goals. In 1985, the rugby league competition was renamed the John Player “Gold Leaf” Rugby Championships and the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union decided to award the Clifford Cup to the winners of a separate knock-out tournament, conducted among the ‘A’ Division clubs held at the end of the regular season.
Kandy Sports Club has won the Clifford Cup a record 21 times since 1992. The CR&FC have won it 14 times, including a tie with Dimbulla ACC, Havelocks SC have won it 13 times including a tie with Police SC, Police SC 8 times with ties against Havelock SC and Army SC, CH & FC 7 times, Dimbulla A & CC twice including a tie with CR&FC, Army SC twice with one tie with Police SC, whilst Air Force SC and Navy SC have only won the cup once.
