Tsunami houses to be handed over after 14 years

About 500 houses, built with the assistance of the Saudi Arabian government for tsunami affected people at Noracholai in the Akkaraipattu DS Division in 2009, under the tsunami re-building development project, will be handed over to beneficiaries soon.
Ampara District Secretary Thisitha P. Wanigasinghe is working in this regard to hand over these houses. Interviews are held for the selection of beneficiaries by the Akkaraipattu and Addalaichenai Divisional Secretaries at the two Divisional Secretariats, Addalaichenai Divisional Secretary T. J. Athisayaraj said. The kachcheri received about 125 applications from Addalaichenai, Oluvil, Palamunai and Deegawapiya areas in the Addalaichenai DS division.
In addition to 500 houses, the area comprises a school, play ground, market, community centre and library.
The houses were built about 10 years ago. However, they were not handed over to the people despite repeated requests made by the people. Therefore, at present, the houses are partially damaged, over grown with weeds and shrubs.
The High Court has ordered that the houses be distributed among all three ethnicities, in keeping with the ratio of the three communities.
