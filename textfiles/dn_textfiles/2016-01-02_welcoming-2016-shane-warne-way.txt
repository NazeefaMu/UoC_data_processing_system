Welcoming 2016 the Shane Warne way

 
Shane Warne was in the party mood on Thursday as the cricket legend enjoyed a New Year’s Eve fantasy-themed fancy-dress party.
The former Australia bowler appeared in high spirits as he partied with friends to welcome in 2016.
Warne was pictured alongside a bevy of beautiful ‘angels’ including glamour model Tilley Holzberger and photographer Rosanna Faraci as he showed off his Baywatch costume via his Instagram account.
The 46-year-old also posed alongside a smurf, a gladiator and a stormtrooper as his friends got into the fancy-dress spirit.

Warne posted a New Year message to his Instagram followers and friends and family, saying: ‘Happy new year to you all, I hope 2016 brings everything you desire.
‘Remember nothing comes easy though & if you want it, you have to work for it, be prepared to make sacrifices, it will be all worth it in the end & very satisfying.
‘To my wonderful family & awesome friends you are all so loyal no matter what, no judgements, means a lot, you know who you are, have a great night & here’s to 2016!!!!!!’
Widely regarded as one of the game’s best bowlers, Warne is now a commentator and pundit in his homeland.
The World Cup winner made his Test debut in 1992 before facing England in his last Test 15 years later.
Warne represented Hampshire for seven years having spent the majority of his career appearing for Victoria before playing for Rajasthan Royals and the Melbourne Stars.
