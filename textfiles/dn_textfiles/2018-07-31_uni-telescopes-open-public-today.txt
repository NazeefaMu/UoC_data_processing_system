Mars’ close approach to Earth
Uni telescopes open for public today

Telescopes at the Colombo University will be open to the public today, to observe Mars and Saturn till 10.00 p.m. The public could visit the Colombo University playground from 7.00 to 10.00 pm.
The Colombo University Astronomical Society will conduct another two astronomical night sky observations camps jointly with the committee for the popularisation of science of the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Science, on August 1 at the Vijitha Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Pollonnaruwa and on August 2 at the Sinhala Madya Maha Vidyalaya in Trincomalee, which will be open form 7.00 to 9.00 pm.
Mars, the only planet whose surface we can see using ground-based telescopes (except for Mercury), will near the Earth on July 31 after 15 years.
This was last seen closer in 2003, with the next closest to be in 2020, and even closer in 2035.
At the close approach, the red planet will be brighter than all other stars in the night sky.
“Look to the eastern skies late these evenings and if the sky is clear, you could see Mars above the horizon between the star constellation Capricornus,” Colombo University Physics Department Astronomy and Space Science Unit Director Professor Chandana Jayaratne said.
This is the nearest that Mars has come (57.6 million kilometers to earth) since its record-breaking close approach on August 28, 2003. At that time, it passed by at a distance of only 55.8 million kilometers, the closest it had come in 59,619 years.
There are observational camps conducted by astronomers all over the world to observe this rare event.
The planet will remain bright for several weeks, and you could also view Saturn, Jupiter and Venus in a “long arc across the sky from east to west,” shortly after sunset.
