Presidential Commission on SriLankan, Mihin
‘Two companies favoured for tender’

SriLankan Airlines Administrative Manger R. Ferdinands yesterday said the tender to supply duty free goods was offered to two companies for seven years without following proper procurement or tender procedures during former Chairman Nishantha Wickremasinghe’s tenure.
He told the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged frauds taken place at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka that the tender to supply duty free items is renewed once in every six month, but these companies were offered the contract for seven years continuously under Wickremasinghe's administration.
He said that addresses and Board of Directors of the two companies were the same.
Ferdinands said that then administration had failed to include how these goods should be supplied to the SriLankan Airlines in the bilateral agreement.
The Commission chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Anil Gooneratne met at the BMICH yesterday.
He said the supply of duty free goods had not been carried out properly after 2010, and the two companies that received tender to supply goods for 2011 had interacted with tender board members before the tender was granted.
Ferdinands showed the emails exchanged between the companies and the Tender Board members to the Commission.
The Commission will meet again on June 28.
