Mokgweetsi Masisi sworn in as Botswana’s fifth President

Botswana has once again, witnessed the compliance of the constitutional requirement of a state President relinquishing power at the end of two consecutive five year terms in office.
This was when President Dr. Lieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama stepped down as the 4th President of Botswana on April 1, 2018, after completing ten years as President. He is a son of Sir Seretse Khama, the first President of Botswana. Vice President Mokgweetsi Masisi took his oath before Chief Justice Maruping Dibotelo as 5th President of Botswana.
President Khama’s term ended at midnight on March 31, 2018 and Vice President Mokgweetsi Masisi was sworn in as the 5th President of Botswana on April 1, 2018, in the early morning hours amidst rain.
The Attorney General of Botswana Abraham Keetsabe in an exclusive interview to the press, explained that the office of the Presidency, is conferred by operation of Law, is instant and simultaneous and the taking of the oath is a necessary process to allow the new President to start work guided by the oath. The oath being taken later than midnight on March 31, 2018, was not a problem.
The Constitution of Botswana permits a President to hold office only for an aggregate period of ten years, beginning from the date of his or her first assumption of office and the oath taking ceremony signifies the smooth transfer of power from former President Ian Khama to the 5th President Mokgweetsi Masisi. This has been meticulously followed by all previous Presidents who succeeded the first President Sir Seretse Khama, namely President Ketumile Masire (now deceased) and President Festus Gontebanye Mogae.
The down pour was quite heavy and it left all the dignitaries and special guests who were smartly dressed drenched in rain. So were the members of the Botswana Defence Force who were providing a guard of honour to the President who had to be taken under cover of an umbrella to receive it. Rain is always welcome in Botswana. The Setswana word for rain is “Pula” and the national currency of Botswana is “Pula.” Such is the importance of rain. It is the general belief in African countries that when a heavy down pour precedes or occurs immediately after an event, like the Presidential swearing in, it is a good omen and that the Gods have smiled upon the man of the moment.
Due to the heavy downpour as a Plan B, the rest of the proceedings took place in the National Assembly (Parliament building) under the stewardship of Speaker Mrs Gladys Kokorwe. The new President made his inauguration address in the National Assembly which is an unicameral legislature. In his speech, he said “It is with a deep sense of humility that I accept the immense responsibility that has been bestowed on me and the trust and confidence thereby reposed, as the 5th President of our Republic and Nation of Botswana. In carrying out my duties, my touchstone shall remain the oath I just made to uphold the Constitution, the Rule of Law and maintenance of national unity, peace and prosperity. We remain committed to fighting corruption, in order to safeguard the hopes and dreams of all Batswana for current and future generations. Therefore it is incumbent upon us to continue to strengthen our institutions and exact the full might of the law to ensure the fight against corruption in all its forms and manifestations,” he went on to say as follows, “Just like my predecessors, I stand to acknowledge that we are not yet where we wish to be as a nation. We still seek to build a Botswana in which sustained development is underpinned by economic diversification. We shall not be satisfied until we have eradicated poverty and social exclusion in order to build a society that provides an opportunity and dignity for all.’’The new President has excellent credentials. He comes from a strong political dynasty much like that of his predecessor. His father Setlhomo Edison Masisi, was a Member of Parliament and a Cabinet Minister in Sir Seretse Khama’s Government; while his late brother, Tshelang Masisi, was the long time MP for Francistown West. His other brother, Brigadier Thulaganyo Masisi is a retired Army General. President Masisi had his early education in the elitist schools in Gaborone, namely Thornhill Primary School and Maru A Pula International School and after graduation, he obtained a Masters degree in Education from Florida State University, U.S.A.
He became a Member of Parliament in October 2009 and was appointed Assistant Minister of Presidential Affairs and Public Administration and in 2011, a full Minister. He has twice won the chairmanship of the Botswana Democratic Party and took over as Vice President from the great Ponatshego Kedikilwe in 2014, when the latter retired as Vice President.
In his new Cabinet, he has appointed Nonofo Molefe his rival in the BDP Chairmanship as the Minister of Presidential Affairs and retained most of the Senior Ministries of his Predecessor’s Cabinet, while making it a point to remove two ministers against whom there were complaints of alleged corruption, signalling a new era. He has also appointed as his Vice President Slumber Tsogwane, MP for Boteti, the longest serving MP being in Parliament since 1999.
His spouse Mma Neo Jane Atsile is now the First Lady. She is Botswana’s 4th First Lady because his predecessor never married. She fills in the 10 year void left by Mma Nametso, wife of the country’s third President Festus Gontebanye Mogae. The First Lady plays a critical role in strengthening the image as well as adding a lot of colour and glamour to the Presidency in the eyes of the people. The First Lady is a feminist and has expounded the Setswana saying, “Mosadi thari ya sechaba,” – meaning “ woman is the Pillar of the Nation” and a lot is expected of her.
Botswana has come a long way since the country became independent in 1966. It has an impeccable record of good governance and has a strong economy after the discovery of diamonds. Transparency International has rated Botswana as the least corrupt country in Africa. Although the B.D.P has managed to win all elections up to date, it has faltered in the 2014 General Elections by losing some seats. With the opposition parties seeking to unite under one banner, despite factional conflicts, President Masisi faces the kind of challenges never ever faced by any of his predecessors and he has to read the script and find a winning formula come October 2019.
Judge Mookodi, a lifelong friend of President Masisi and a classmate at both Thornhill and Maru A Pula schools, in a statement to the Mmegi Newspaper has stated that President Masisi is synonymous with certain values which became apparent as he grew up. “Honesty is consistant with what he does, quite frank and has a bias for action.’’ There cannot be a better testimonial than this for someone placed in the unenviable position that President Masisi is placed in.
Notwithstanding various negative comments made by his critics, President Masisi has brought hope and joy to many people against all odds and has created great expectations.
Coincidentally, by winning many gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, Botswana athletes led by Amantle Montsho and Isaac Makwala have heralded the arrival of President Mokgweetsi Masisi by decorating him in gold.
