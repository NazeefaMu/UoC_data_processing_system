Seylan Bank wins high at LankaPay Technnovation awards

The bank with a heart, Seylan Bank, took centre-stage at the recently-concluded LankaPay Technnovation Awards 2017.
Seylan Bank won four key awards as Runner up of the ‘Overall excellence in Interbank Payments’ category; Top award Winner of ‘Best Bank for Seamless Back-end Operations’; Winner of the ‘Bank of the Year for Financial Inclusivity’ in Category B and Winner of ‘Bank of the Year for Excellence in Customer Convenience’ in Category B.
The LankaPay Technnovation Awards is Sri Lanka’s first and the only payment technology innovation awards event to recognize banks and non-banking financial institutions who promote electronic transactions facilitated via the LankaPay national payment network.
LankaClear is the operator of LankaPay, the national payment network, and has been providing a vital national service via the country’s banking and financial sector. These awards bestowed on Seylan Bank reflect the financial and operational excellence followed by the Bank.
Seylan Bank has adopted advanced technology and devised innovative products and services in electronic banking in alignment with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s mission to lower the cost of banking transactions and revolutionize traditional payment modes. As one of the pioneers in electronic banking, Seylan Bank is geared to drive customer convenience and enable innovative digital payment channels.
Seylan Bank is closely allied with LankaPay and operates on various LankaPay product platforms. The first of these is the Sri Lanka Interbank Payment System (SLIPS), an online interbank electronic fund transfer system, which enables movement of funds from one account to another without the corresponding piece of paper to authorize or prove that the transfer had occurred.
Thus, crediting and debiting of accounts are handled more promptly and accurately without the need to write cheques, pay orders or vouchers.
As a result of Seylan Bank’s presence on LankaPay’s Common ATM Switch (CAS), customers are able to enjoy island wide, secure ATM access at all ATMs of the participating banks at the most affordable rates.
The Bank has taken steps to implement proper systems and processes in place to ensure streamlined operations.
Rohini Weerakkody, Assistant General Manager Operations, at Seylan Bank comments, “We are delighted to win four key awards at the LankaPay Technnovation Awards 2017, which reflect on our leadership in the digital front.”
