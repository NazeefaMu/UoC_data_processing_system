Travel marvel by the sea

Jetwing Hotels has cemented itself as one of the premier hotel chains in Sri Lanka. Over the years it has expanded into one of the most successful hotel chains in the island offering services and facilities that are lavish and spectacular. Their latest property is ‘Jie Jie Beach’, a property located in Panadura that is yet another marvel and masterpiece in Jetwings’ 44 year old history.
Owned by Jie Zhong Jie Lanka Development Construction & Engineering (Pvt) Ltd, Jie Jie Beach is managed by Jetwing Hotels.
Daily News attended the opening of Jie Jie Beach and experienced Jetwing’s warm hospitality and vibrant spirit which captures the very essence of the brand. Jetwing made a strong statement backed by their distinctive design built on a foundation of passion and love for the hospitality industry.
“We are greatly pleased to be introducing another hotel – Jie Jie Beach by Jetwing. This is probably the largest hotel that Jetwing will manage in Sri Lanka. It is all due to Li Jian Guo and his partners from China who came to Sri Lanka and found our island so lucrative. It was he who built this hotel,” said Chairman of Jetwing, Hiran Cooray.
When Guo came to meet Jetwing, and spoke of his idea to build a hotel in Panadura he was not taken seriously.
“But then we saw the construction and we were amazed at how the project was going on. We were shocked that within 18 months of starting construction they completed this hotel. Now we are privileged to be appointed Managing Agents of this beautiful hotel,” stated Cooray.
Jetwing is riding the wave of stability.

“We can see that there is a lot of destruction and disturbance in the Western World. More and more tourists are looking at coming into the Southern Hemisphere. We must utilize the opportunity presented by the political stability in the country and for this we are greatly privileged,” explained Cooray. Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Affairs John Amaratunga was highly excited at the launch of Jie Jie Beach.
“I can vouch for the fact that anyone coming here would love to come back because of the facilities. The construction is marvelous and flawless. It is really encouraging to have the Chinese Workers here. I invite Lee to come and build some more hotels in Sri Lanka.
We have plenty of beaches, heritage sites, Wildlife and all the necessary attractions. We are a wonderful place for tourists. But I think we definitely need to advertise more. We need to take Sri Lanka’s message of tourism to the rest of the world. Let’s hope at least this year we can advertise the beauty of this country so that tourists will be excited about coming to Sri Lanka. We need to step up to the plate and meet this challenge and requirement,” said Amaratunga
The Minister also commented that we have so much more to offer that some of the countries in the rest of the world.
“There are no seasons in Sri Lanka. All 365 days are good. Any tourists would love to come her and experience our hospitality and services. I think this hotel will definitely flourish,” stated Amaratunga.
Li Jian Guo Chairman of Jie Zhong Jie Lanka Development and Construction Engineering is the true hero here.
“I am an investor from China and I am involved in the construction industry. I came to Sri Lanka in 2013 and fell in love with the island. I stayed here for a few days and thought it was a lovely land to invest in. I have been in the construction field for 30 years and made a quick decision to build a hotel here,” said Guo.

Construction work was started in 2015.
“This is a large and magnificent hotel. It is one of the largest hotel projects in Sri Lanka. Even though I am an expert in the construction industry, I don’t know how to manage and operate a hotel. This is why I have partnered with Jetwing. They are professionals in the industry. I am definitely expecting to invest in more hotels in Sri Lanka,” stated Guo.
