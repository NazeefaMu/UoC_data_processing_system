Ministry launches district level project to reach the affected

‘Yeoman service provided by media’:
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha stated that the media has provided a yeoman service in helping thousands of displaced people who were affected by the adverse weather conditions. Their responsibility towards the society was highlighted.
He was addressing the ‘Manusathkame Sathkaaraya’ programme carried out by the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry to distribute relief items in flood affected areas, initiated at the ministry premises.
Minister Musthapha said: “none of the media organizations in the world did such great work in assisting the victims of a disaster. What they did was to gathering information and distribute. But the journalists in our country are far beyond them in humanity in such incidents. The government is doing their best to support victims without any difference. We should work together to help our own people when they are in need.”
As per the instructions given by Minister Musthapha, Secretary to the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Kamal Pathmasiri implemented the project.
The project included the provision of water bowsers to each district to distribute drinking water to affected households, until the water supplies are restored, repairing of damaged roads and providing machineries with the help of Local Authorities which have not been affected by the disasters and affected Local Authorities will be provided with provisions of Rs. one million to meet urgent requirements. Those provisions will be used for reconstruction activities. A flood relief centre will be established in the ministry premises. The ministry has already initiated distributing goods, having received assistance from private sector institutions.
The ministry has also planned to implement a special programme to manage the huge amount of garbage collected in flood affected areas.
