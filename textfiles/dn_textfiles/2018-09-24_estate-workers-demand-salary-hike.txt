Estate workers demand salary hike

A large group of estate workers with the support of several politicians and trade unions staged a protest yesterday at Thalawakele town requesting a salary hike commensurate to the current cost of living.
All the shops in the town were closed in support of the protest and the access roads to and from Thalawakele town were obstructed.
Salaries of the upcountry estate workers have not been increased so far in accordance with the memorandums of understanding signed and the workers demanded that estate companies increase their salaries immediately as they are facing numerous difficulties due to the rising cost of living.
Minister Palani Thigambaran, State Minister V. Radhakrishnan, and several other Tamil politicians also took part in the protest from the Thalawakele Bus Terminal to the public grounds.
