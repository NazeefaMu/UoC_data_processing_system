RECOVERING THE HUMAN

The government has made education compulsory for thirteen years and plans to make Sri Lanka a hub of education. If properly done, it has the potential of making many individuals conscious of humanness in themselves and in all others. This enables them to coordinate their complex relationships in an acceptable way and bring about a well-ordered civilized and cultured society which will contribute to further the progress of the people of Sri Lanka and Asia. Needless to say, it is also the way to progress on the road to reconciliation and avoid the path to mad and mindless violence and disintegration in Sri Lanka that has caused widespread dissatisfaction and sadness.
The violence that has caused disintegration is directly due to a lack of a moral sense, civic responsibility on the part of many citizens as also politicians, agents of law and order and high administrators who have been indecisive, spineless and vacillating. This has been due to an insufficiently developed humanness and consciousness.
INTEGRATION IN HUMANNESS
Every person has the capacity to grow, to mature, to be independent and free, to perceive and know, to feel, to express, to relate to others, to judge, think, reflect, understand, will and act. Each of these capacities are multidimensional and complex. Yet they could be developed and activated simultaneously. They could be separately or jointly, fairly, fully or barely developed or left undeveloped and neglected according to the manner of home upbringing and school education.
It needs to be observed that the human being, unlike an animal, is not born with instincts; the human being has only reflexes, which too needs to be developed, as in learning to drive a motor car. The human being has to learn everything from learning to stand straight, to walk with head held high, to speak clearly and to relate to family and strangers.
One could be physically grown but not be consistent and mature. One could be very active externally but intellectually inactive or active only minimally. While one has developed prejudices and strong feelings, he may have unexamined and superficial intellectual development, understanding and interior convictions. Though one may be curious about day-to-day news, one may be carried away by spurious propaganda, a mere hearsay or rumour and not investigate or have a desire for truth.
It is not all who learn even the basics through their family upbringing and through their school education. When the upbringing whether in a royal family or a rural peasant’s or any family has been shoddy and defective, even education in a ‘prestigious school’ by itself may not humanize the individual sufficiently. Patience and kindness, clarity of thought expression and relations of others may stimulate some to the recovery and integration in humanness.
Religious, ethnic, cultural, linguistic and other groups may have an understanding of one’s identity. However it is wholesome only when with one’s own human dignity one takes into account, as a result of one’s consciousness, the important values that accept and respects the humanity and the identity of others.
WHAT MAKES US CIVILIZED?
Anyone, well-bred at home, educated in school and well-formed in character and intelligence could become a civilized person able to choose between good and evil. Doing what is good and right is creative. A human being is meant to be creative. Doing evil is being destructive. In our context, those who have done irreparable harm to life and property have done evil; those who have killed journalists and made people to disappear have done evil; those who have been plundering, misusing peoples’ money and banking it abroad in secret accounts and laundering money are evil; those who have borrowed billions of dollars in the name of the people and are not able to account for it are evil; the cunning rogues who have stolen money and hidden them in hitherto undetectable places are evil.
Politicians making solemn promises to clean-up such corruption and getting elected and turning back on their promises are accomplices of evil; those who have been secretly involved in the bond scam have done evil; those who have done harm to the Muslims in Ampara, Teldeniya, Digana and Kandy are evil. Those who accommodate themselves to evil are also evil.
Though these people may not get punished in proportion to the vast destruction they have caused to the country, the evil in their hearts will not be erased. While their tarnished character will remain marred with evil and continue to perpetuate great evil unless they are prevented in carrying out evil deeds by law if law is strong and effective. Organised and well planned evil could only be controlled by those with authority empowered to do so. Those empowered to do so, do not need further authorization by politicians who remain rotten.
If citizens who in positions of influence and power have abused their position and caused much evil wish to turn over a new leaf, they should be able to rid themself of self-absorbed selfishness, rule the wayward desires of their mind and heart, and not get entrapped in their lower tendencies. Nevertheless, the persecutors of Muslims should be tried in Courts and if found guilty, confined to prison and reformed there through a programme of rehabilitation to help them arrive at a new consciousness of good citizenship.
While some think deeply, many think little or not at all. Those who think very superficially and only skim the surface of problems and blame everybody except themselves include the politicians of the political parties who are now arguing among themselves. They too need rehabilitation. A good many of them are psychologically sick and need psychiatric treatment to help them accept the depth of their involvement in evil. A wholesome rehabilitation should include a formation of conscience, will and character which need to be unified and integrated.
COMPARTMENTALIZED LIVING
The human, physical, intellectual, psychological, social and spiritual aspects in the life of many prominent people have been compartmentalized. They should be helped to unify and integrate them through a recovery of humanness.
Compartmentalizing aspects of life subconsciously isolates values. For example, a person compartmentalizes religion and worship in one compartment, do political party activities in another compartment, responsibilities of public office, life with neighbours, life with wife, children and relatives in separate compartments. These compartments remain air-tight, discordant and unrelated to one another. For example, the person who worships in the morning, plans during the day to escape paying taxes, to take a bribe in the evening, to commit a grave injustice, to syphon off ‘commissions’ and make illegal gains, to cast aspersions on someone and destroy him, to take ‘French leave’, to neglect and abandon one’s duty, or to get paid for work not done. Corrupt practices are as many and varied as the many corrupt individuals who indulge in such evil that are so destructive of society. In such persons life is dichotomized, human values have not been instilled and integrated through proper family breeding, nurturing and a wholesome education. Such people are malformed and unaware that their evil behaviour negatively affects the lives of others; they need to be rehabilitated and brought to social consciousness.
Yet, every person remains a complex human being varying in depth and potential and has the capacity to be raised to an acceptable human level for civilized social intercourse. If sufficient resources are expended and all are rightly motivated and led, with none left behind, all could be developed so that there arises in our society citizens of integrity with a rich variety of human resourcefulness and creativity. Right understanding of the human and helpful and proper monitoring could minimize under-development in individuals and help them towards alternative possibilities of growth and human enhancement.
JUSTICE DELAYED
Some people, who for some reason or other are malformed and underdeveloped psychologically due to defective education could incite hatred among other people in a civic community. It spreads to others equally weak who without reflective thinking react with unrestrained emotion and heap wrong upon wrong thus leading even to violence, destruction, arson and anarchy even with loss of life.
The development of the sense of right and wrong, good and evil, even being shy, having the sense of guilt over wrong done and having a sense of self-restraint is part of being human. Admission of guilt, making reparation for the wrong and damage done, true repentance, resolve and promise of not repeating them and consequent forgiveness are also values that undergird equity and justice that sustain and maintain civilization and advance human progress. When justice is circumvented, manipulated and delayed by those who should be concerned - as they have been defectively educated! - the very foundations of society is undermined in the short term as well as in the long term. This is an area that is not thought of sufficiently by those in the summits of power. They are unaware that through their culpable inefficiency, evasion, inattention, indecisiveness and procrastination they not only cause evil to society, they also undermine their own credibility, integrity and security.
ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING
In the human being instincts are not developed. What we human beings have are motor reflexes, an involuntary response to certain stimuli. Doctors’ tests could review whether reflexes work properly. Lacking instincts, human beings have to learn almost everything from standing on two legs to walking, running, talking, speaking, eating, behaving and acting with responsibility for oneself and for others. Learning to base and activate oneself depends on and develops in intelligence, knowledge, discerning, understanding, judging and acting.
With the development of inborn talent and sufficient concentration and perseverance human beings also develop the sense of beauty, aesthetics and various crafts, arts, music and becomes creative and cultured in many surprising ways. It is this aspect of human development that enhances, completes and makes the human being the ‘crown’ of all nature. All acknowledge the preciousness of human life and for most people it is a gift and a blessing to be born a human being. If such is learnt, no violence will occur.
Human ingenuity for creativity could promote many human values and enhance the lives of fellow human beings or also pave the way for the annihilation of the whole human race. This is the reason why with the advancement of science and technology, proper thinking, learning and proper education and guidance of the young from an early age to proper consciousness is so very important in order to ensure civilized and cultured living for everyone. Could emphasis on a wholesome education hub not fill the void?
