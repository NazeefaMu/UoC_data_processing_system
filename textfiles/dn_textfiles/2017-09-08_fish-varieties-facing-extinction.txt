Fish varieties facing extinction

A variety of fresh water fish in the Sabaragamuwa Province face extinction, says nature-lovers.
Among them is the small and beautiful Bulath Hapaya who had already disappeared from a majority of rivers, ponds, streams and village brooks.
Handaya, Mal Dandiya, Thittaya, Thal Koraliya, Weli Gowwa, Hunga and a variety of small shrimp are facing extinction.
According to nature-lovers, the main reason for this tragic situation is gem mining in waterways, excessive use of pesticides and insecticides in paddy fields, and careless washing of chemical containers in streams and rivers.
