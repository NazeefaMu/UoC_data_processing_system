Best and most efficient will be selected this year: Mahinda Amaraweera

New Year 2017 will be special for the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry as it will hold a competition this year to select the best and most efficient officer. The winner may be an officer or an ordinary employee. He or she will be feted and rewarded, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting at the Ministry on January 2 to commence work for the new year. The New Year programme began with every one taking the oath of dedication to their duties.
The ministry belongs to the fishery community rather than to ministry officials. The existence of the ministry depends on the fishery community who visit it seeking its services, the minister said.
The minister said he witnessed four categories of office workers. One group attend office early and left office late after performing extra duties. Another group come late and spend time criticising and obstructing others’ work. Another group arrived and left office in time rendering an honest work. A fourth group not only neglect their duties but also try to sabotage others' duties. It was therefore up to the ministry staff themselves to decide the category they are in. The minister said he knew certain staff members who sleep resting their heads on tables. Others waste time on Face Book page. Book reading could be permitted during spare time provided the books read were good. He said he made these comments not to run them down but to steer them on the right path.
The minister said public servants who abide by rules and regulations and render a proper service could work for the entire duration of their service period and retire happily. But the date the politicians should retire was decided by the people. Politicians had to retire on the day they were rejected by the people.
