Drinking raw milk could be DEADLY!

A new craze for ‘raw’ milk and cheese that hasn’t been pasteurised has put thousands at risk of severe food poisoning, experts warn.
Most milk in the supermarket is pasteurised, meaning that it has been heated to high temperatures in order to kill harmful bacteria.
But ‘raw’ milk, which has not gone through this process, is rising in popularity in the US and the UK with sellers claiming it has a better taste and is more nutritious.
A US study has now found that 750 people are taken ill after consuming raw dairy products every year and people who drink raw milk are 840 times more likely to get sick.
Experts from the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have now spoken out against this new ‘healthy eating’ fad.
There are several different types of food poisoning in the UK, all with slightly different symptoms - and levels of severity.
‘The growing popularity of unpasteurised milk in the United States raises public health concerns,’ experts from the CDC said in a research paper.
‘Outbreaks associated with dairy consumption cause, on average, 760 illnesses/year and 22 hospitalisations/year, mostly from Salmonella and Campylobacter.
‘Unpasteurised milk, consumed by only 3.2 per cent of the population, and cheese, consumed by only 1.6 per cent of the population, caused 96% of illnesses caused by contaminated dairy products.’
In the US, 3.2 per cent of supermarket milk is unpasteurised and in the UK, around 200 farms have taken to selling raw dairy, according to the Guardian.
Enthusiasts claim raw milk has a more authentic taste and may even be more nutritious and higher in vitamins.
But a new study has found that those who drink raw milk are 45 times more likely to end up in hospital.
Raw milk can cause food poisoning because it is more likely to be contaminated with harmful bacteria that is normally removed during the pasteurisation process.
Researchers found that people who were hospitalised after drinking raw milk were most likely to be infected by Salmonella or a bacteria called Campylobacter.
‘As consumption of unpasteurized dairy products grows, illnesses will increase steadily,’ the researchers concluded.

‘A doubling in the consumption of unpasteurized milk or cheese could increase outbreak-related illnesses by 96 per cent.’
British experts have also spoken out against drinking raw milk milk.
‘Unpasteurised or ‘raw’ milk and ‘raw’ cream may contain harmful bacteria that cause food poisoning,’ the UK’s Food Standards Agency said on its website.
‘If you have a weakened immune system, you are particularly vulnerable to food poisoning and should not consume unpasteurised milk and cream.
‘Vulnerable groups include pregnant women, infants and children.’
The research is to be published in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease. -Daily Mail.uk
