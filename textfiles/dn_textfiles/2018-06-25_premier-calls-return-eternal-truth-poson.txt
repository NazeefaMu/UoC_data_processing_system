Premier calls to return to eternal truth this Poson

 
Prime Minister Ranil Wckremesinghe called all followers of Buddha to return to the eternal truth and to shed light on their way of thinking to achieve deeper understanding this Poson.
He said this in a message released today in commemoration of Poson.
Furthermore, the Premier said, ’Buddhism is the greatest philosophy to enrich one's spirituality. The four sublime states of the mind; Metta, Karuna, Muditha, and Upekkha, which stand for loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity, teach us peace, reconciliation and spiritual calmness through the teachings of the Buddha’.
‘During the 3rd Century BC, Arahant Mahinda introduced the doctrine of Buddhism on a Poson Full Moon day. From this moment we inherited new knowledge which enabled our society to flourish’.
The full context of the message is produced below:
