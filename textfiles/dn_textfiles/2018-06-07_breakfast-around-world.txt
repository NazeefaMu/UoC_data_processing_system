Breakfast around the  world

UNITED STATES:
Breakfast food items vary widely from place to place, but eggs, potatoes, and bacon or sausage is common.
AUSTRALIA:
Australians love Vegemite enough to eat it every day. They also eat a lot of fruit and sometimes indulge in a full English breakfast.
ENGLAND:
The fortifying English breakfast includes eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, mushrooms, and cooked tomato.
FRANCE:
A traditional breakfast is coffee and either baguette or croissant. Like Cubans, the French often dip their buttered bread into coffee.
RUSSIA:
Griddle cakes are huge in Russia. There’s cheese-stuffed syrniki, crepe-like blini made with kefir, and fluffy oladi, which are about the size of a biscuit.

Russian
KOREA:
A Korean breakfast looks strikingly similar to a Korean dinner. There’s rice, soup, the ever-present kimchi, some type of fish or beef, and may be other leftovers from the previous night’s dinner.

INDIA:
Breakfasts in India vary by region, but often you’ll find a tray crowded with chutneys, dips, and breads like dosa, roti, or idli.

Dhal 
Dahl made with orange lentils, spices and coconut milk is the staple of every Sri Lankan breakfast and sometimes also lunch and dinner.
 
Curries 
Apart from dahl, a Sri Lankan breakfast will certainly include another type of curry, either potato, chicken or sometimes even fish curry.
 
Sambol 
Sambols is eaten along with any meal. The most common sambol is pol sambol, prepared with grated coconut and plenty of chili. Another kind of sambol commonly eaten with hoppers or egg hoppers is seeni sambol, a caramelized onion concoction with lots of chili. One cannot forget katta sambol and luni miris too.
No matter what is on the menu, research shows that breakfast is a very important meal especially for children. So fill your child’s tummy with a yummy breakfast before sending to school.
