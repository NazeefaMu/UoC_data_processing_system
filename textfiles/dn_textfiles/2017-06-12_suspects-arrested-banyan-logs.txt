Suspects arrested with Banyan logs

Two suspects who had trespassed into the Meegastenna reserve and cut down several Banyan trees using a chain saw were arrested by the Ginigathena police as they were trying to transport the logs in a lorry on June 10.
“This follows a complaint made by the Meeastenna Grama Niladhari that the illicit felling of trees was rampant in the forest reserve which overlooks the banks of the Kelani Ganga,” police said.
Investigations revealed that the suspects are residents of Pitawala and Kithulgala. They have requested officials attached to the Hatton Forest Conservation Office to assess the value of the banyan logs and submit a report.
The suspects were due to be produced before the Hatton magistrate.
