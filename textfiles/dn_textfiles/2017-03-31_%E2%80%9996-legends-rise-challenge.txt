The ’96 Legends to rise up to the challenge

Our cricketing legends of the 96 World cup winning team has come together once again. All 14 legendary cricketers from the 1996 victorious team are the brand ambassadors for a unique first of its kind landmark building, an amazing feat of architecture which will be among the tallest buildings in Sri Lanka.
This unique mega structure which represents four cricket bats and a ball will be easily in league with iconic buildings of the world such as Burj Khalifa in Dubai, Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur or shard in London which will re-define the city’s skyline and attract thousands of tourists, cricket lovers to our country.
The development will function as a mini city that houses state-of- the- art residential tower soaring 69 floors perched on a podium of commercial facilities carefully segregated by designers to maintain the privacy of the residents to be located in Buthgamuwa cross road, Rajagiriya.
For the first time in the history of any sport, the entire world cup winning team joins hands to promote a monumental structure to celebrate the winning of a world cup so that the historic legend will live on.
