A march forward to reforge the nation

Large crowds were present at a number of May Day rallies organised by leading political parties and trade unions countrywide. Working-class masses displayed their enthusiasm with their participation in these rallies. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) held their rally at Batticaloa under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, while the Ceylon Workers' Congress held theirs at Nuwara Eliya town and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) also held a May Day rally at Borella. The following are some of the highlights of the May Day events that took place.
