Former MP Polgampola remanded till May 18

Former MP and former State Timber Corporation Chairman Anuruddha Polgampola, who was arrested by the CID on Tuesday, was remanded until May 18.
He was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court yesterday. He was arrested on Tuesday based on a warrant issued against him for his failure to present himself before the Vavuniya Magistrate’s Court for the hearing.
The former Kegalle District MP was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over an alleged fraud of Rs 8 million connected to the construction of the Northern Railway line.
Polgampola was recently appointed as State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman by President Maithripala Sirisena, but the decision was suspended shortly after and former UPFA MP Shantha Bandara was later appointed to the position.
