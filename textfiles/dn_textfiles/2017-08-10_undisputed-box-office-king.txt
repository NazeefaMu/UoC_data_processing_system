Undisputed box office king

Despite stiff competition from big banner films like Salman Khan’s ‘Tubelight’, Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Jab Harry Met Sejal’ and Anil Kapoor’s multi-starrer ‘Mubarakan’, SS Rajamouli’s ‘Baahubali: The Conclusion’ remains the undisputed king of box office.
Most of the films, which run for a good two to three weeks at the box office, recover their money in the first week itself. The trend of movies successfully running at the box office for 100s of days has become a thing of the past and ‘Baahubali 2’ seems to be the film that has could bring that trend back.
Porducer Karan Johar took to Twitter to announce that the epic drama has completed 100 days at the box office.
The epic drama has minted more than 1000 crore at the box office, India and overseas combined, and was touted to be the highest-grossing Indian film ever till Aamir Khan’s ‘Dangal’ released in China and earned a whopping 800-odd crore there, becoming the 5th highest grossing non-English film ever.
‘Baahubali 2’ earned close to 625 crore in India.
The film, which was originally made in Telugu and Tamil and dubbed into Hindi, Malayalam, German, French, Japanese and English, went on to amass huge fortune in Hindi, earning more than most of the Bollywood films.
‘Baahubali 2’ stars Prabhas, Rana Daggubati, Anushka Shetty, Sathyaraj, Ramya Krishnan, Nasser and Tamannaah Bhatia.
