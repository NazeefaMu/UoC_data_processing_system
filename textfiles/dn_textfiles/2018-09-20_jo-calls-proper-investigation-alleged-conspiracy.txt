JO calls for proper investigation into alleged conspiracy

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said that National Police Commission (NPC) members should resign if they could not properly investigate the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma questioned as to why DIG Nalaka de Silva had not been arrested. He was addressing a press conference in Colombo yeserdeay
He said the recent transfer of DIG Silva to the IT Division from the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) was also questionable.
Alahapperuma added though the Law and Order Ministry had guaranteed to provide security for President Sirisena after the alleged conspiracy came to light, no such security had been provided for Rajapaksa despite him already having a smaller security detail.
