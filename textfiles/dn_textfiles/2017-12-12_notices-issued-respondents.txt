Writ petition against monopolization of the shipping industry
Notices issued on respondents

The Court of Appeal has issued notices on Minister of Ports and shipping and three others returnable for January 30, pursuant to a writ petition filed by Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara for Minister’s alleged failure to prevent the monopolization of the shipping industry.
The court of Appeal (President) L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne made this order when the writ petition filed by MP Nanayakkara was taken up for support.
In his petition, Nanayakkara is seeking a writ of mandamus order directing Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe to act in terms of section 28(1) (a) of the Merchant Shipping Act No.52 of 1971 and declare it as an offence for any person to monopolize or to combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade in relation to the carriage of goods by sea to and Sri Lanka and prescribe penalties and other punishments for such offence within a period of three months.
The petitioner had cited directing Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping L.P. Jayampathy, Director General of Merchant Shipping Ajith Wickrama Seneviratne and Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake as respondents.
The petitioner stated that by a recent disclosure of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) dated August 28, a leading Sri Lankan Conglomerate has announced that one of its subsidiaries has recently acquired 94.81% equity stake of Sri Lanka Shipping Company Ltd, for a purchase consideration of approximately Rs.4.9 billion. In terms of that disclosure, this acquisition is in line with the group’s stratergy on expanding its maritime operation and paving the way for establishment of the largest marine and shipping company in Sri Lanka.
The petitioner further stated that an article published in a leading newspaper soon after the corporate disclosure revealed that as of now, this conglomerate together with another leading player in the shipping industry is said to control over 70 percent of Sri Lanka’s shipping and maritime services market and is seeking to acquire more acquisition in the shipping sector with a view of increasing its market share in the future.
The petitioner further stated that in the above circumstances restrictive practices are openly and deliberately being carried out in relation to the carriage of goods by sea in Sri Lanka and the largest shipping entities are monopolizing and combining and conspiring with others to monopolize carriage of goods by sea to and from Sri Lanka.
The petitioner further stated that in general restrictive practices and monopolization lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, competition being eliminated through the dominant entities setting prices below costs and absorbing those losses until their competitors can no longer survive and prevention of new entrants into the industry.
Vasudeva Nanayakkara further stated that when the restrictive practices and monopolization are permitted, the dominant entities could engage in price-fixing irrespective of demand and result in the consumers having no alternatives, inflation would occur as the dominant entities could raise their costs by fixing any price they desire and the dominant entities would also provide inferior services due to lack of alternatives.
President’s Counsel Faisz Mustapha with Faisza Mustapha Markar, Akiel Dean and Rajika Aluwihare under the instruction of counsel Sarath Upul Fernando appeared for the petitioner.
