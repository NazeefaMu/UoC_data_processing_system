Incredible india

India, the destination for the adventurous, the destination for those who seek and yearn for Spirituality. India is the destination for those who want to soak in the rich diverse culture of this land. India is one of the most alluring destinations in Asia. The Daily News recently attended a familiarization tour of India sponsored by the Indian Government in what proved to be an exciting and unforgettable experience.
Truth be told it was destiny that the tour to India took place close to the Hindu Festival Diwali. The Elephanta Caves on Elephanta Island were our first exposure to mythology in India. The cave temples on the island are dedicated to the Hindu God Shiva.According to historical sources, the Trimurti is the triple deity of supreme divinity in Hinduism where the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities, typically Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer. Diwali is the day the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king Narakasura. Krishna is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu.
Elephanta Caves
Visiting the Elephanta Caves is a fascinating experience. To reach the caves you need to travel by boat to Elephanta Island and this experience is particularly meaningful and special to those who love history and culture and who delight in spirituality. According to Hinduism, Shiva is the Supreme Deity seen as both creator and destroyer of the Universe. His incarnation as the destroyer is seen in his appearances in incredible forms. At Elephanta Caves all three aspects of Shiva – Creation, Preservation and Destruction are combined.
When walking through the Elephanta Caves, one marvels at the life size statues which show the prodigious skill and ability of the architect. So excellent that the Elephanta Caves were included in the ‘World Heritage’ list in the year 1987 by UNESCO, because such beauty belongs to all of mankind. It is an example of how a person can be inspired to create works of stupendous beauty.
If you take the Island, different dynasties controlled Elephanta Island throughout the centuries– the Mauryas of Konkan, the Trikutakas of Badami, Silaharas, Rashtrakutas, Kalyani Chalukyas, Yadavas of Devagiri and later by the Muslim rulers of Ahmedabad, the Maratha. In 1534 A.D. the island passed into the possession of the Portuguese who named the location as ‘Elephanta Caves’. This was because there was a huge colossal stone structure of an elephant.
Ancient wonder
However accessing this ancient wonder is not easy. After arriving on the Island you need to climb 120 steps to reach the cave temples. However the climb is worth it! The stone sculptures of the deities are so amazing that you can easily forget the passing of time in these caves, a creation of an unknown genius and one that has survived the passing of time and will continue to do so far into the future.
Looking at the stone columns what comes to mind is J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth, specifically the ‘Mines of Moria’/ ‘Khazad-dum’, the home of the Dwarves!! It is so well planned and conceived, that it really is overwhelming walking into these caves. When one looks at these astonishing stone statues, one believes in the potential locked inside us all. The statues bring out the pride and greatness of the pantheon of Hindu Gods.
Their imperiousness evident on the expressions on their faces. In that respect it has a certain similarity to the Olympian Gods of Greek Mythology. As you walk through the corridors you feel a sense of awe as history looks down on you. Who was this mysterious creator as intriguing as his creations? Will we ever know? What effort must have gone into this remarkable creation - hewn from stone!
However our tour was not only about the past! The Mumbai Airport is one of the most beautiful airports in the world and is worth mentioning. And it was our first introduction to India. And what an introduction it was!
The unique architecture of Terminal 2 celebrates both the rich heritage of design and craft of India and India’s emerging stature as a global leader. Terminal T2, which is a colossal 4.7 million square feet (5 times BIA terminal) is built on 4 levels “vertical terminal” handling both International and domestic passengers under one roof. Mumbai Airport handles more than 50 million passengers per annum and Terminal 2 is designed to handle 45 million passengers. The mega international terminal 2 is ultra- modern yet it is also unmistakably Indian.
T2 design is inspired from peacock, the national bird of India, and can been seen in every element of the terminal in a beautiful contemporary way, be it the interior of the huge roof or the magnificent 30 mega columns that hold the mega roof.
Small disks of colorful glass recessed within the canopy’s coffers speckling the hall below with light along with the reflective water pools around columns. The constellation of colors also makes reference to the peacock.
There are about one thousand custom made chandeliers exclusively crafted for the terminal inspired by India’s national flower – the lotus. ‘Diya Curtain’ (a curtain of lighting lamps)is a symbolic Indian Gesture with 10,000 lamps’ at the Immigration Hall.
The terminal is also the home to GVK ‘Jaya He New Museum’, an amazing collection of art and craft and some 7000 artifacts from all corners of India.
Where art is usually an afterthought or a decoration in many civic buildings around the globe, GVK’s Mumbai International Airport must be applauded for incorporating the art and craft as an integral part of the design from the very beginning, creating a one of a kind airport where passengers can’t complain even if they miss their flight.
GVK Botanical Gardens - The Mumbai airport is also a place for biophilic designed spaces with large vertical gardens, water features, koi fish ponds spread inside and around the airport. The kitchen waste of the airport is decomposed and used as fertilizer to maintain these gardens. The botanical garden team continues to engage passengers and stakeholders to promote the green initiatives and spread awareness through events and workshops round the year. Every plant and tree is natural and alive and there is nothing artificial at Mumbai Airport.
 
Memorable stay
GVK is an Indian conglomerate spanning diverse sectors including energy, resources, airports, transportation, hospitality and life sciences.
Our stay in Mumbai and New Delhi was one of luxury and comfort. We received accommodation at seven star hotels – The Taj Palace New Delhi and the Taj Mahal Tower Mumbai. Here, the service was of a very high standard which was super luxurious. The attention paid to the smallest detail made it very memorable.
Last but not least, one is compelled to comment on the hospitality and warmth of the Indian people. Right throughout the trip we, the journalists were treated like VIPs. Everywhere we went we experienced the vibrant culture of India. The Indian Bazaars that we visited in order to purchase mementos were so vibrant and colorful, it was really amazing. The sellers, busy as bees, were truly aggressive negotiators! It was so quaint and beautiful that it was part of the unforgettable memories of India that are forever etched in our minds. These Indian Bazaars are huge, bustling and noisy and one is tempted to buy those little trinkets and goods of greater value. As mentioned above our visit to India was close to the time of the Hindu Festival of Diwali and there was no shortage of items at these Bazaars that had relevance to the festival.
