Rohingya responsibility
This refers to your editorial titled as “Find solution to Rohingaya refugees’ problem” published on September 28.
I agree with your conclusions that the government should take swift measures. In fact, Myanmar, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka are the countries seriously involved in the restoration and resettlement of Rohingya refugees. It is the issue which not only had a human rights angle, but seriously of security concern to India as well. In my opinion all the stakeholder nations should jointly discuss the issue and work out the solution which can provide succour and relief to genuine refugees and help in identifying the persons who are posing security threats in connivance with terror groups.
The major responsibility lies on Myanmar government to recall and ensure rehabilitation of Rohingya refugees. The UNHCR and other Human Right conventions should be followed in resolving this grave crisis.
