Global Design Tex launches first training development centre in Mullaitivu

Co-founders of Global Design Tex (GDT), Maheshika Kularathne and Sampath Madarasinghe, known experts in the field of the apparel industry established their training development centre (TDC), 300 km away from the capital city of Colombo, in a remote village named Keppapillaw in Mullaitivu in the Northern Province.
This is set up as a stepping stone to establish a fully-fledged garment factory employing around 300 youth in Chemmalai, Mullaitivu within the next two years.
GDT, with their Australian partnership, caters to a niche market with a premium range of brands, exclusively for the Australian market and also serves Europe and the USA
GDT is now is in the process of expanding their global network with Europe and India attracting many similar new brands. The duo felt that it is the need of the hour and took this risk in good faith for the sake of humanity and genuine endeavor to support the Government effort in reconciliation and nation building.
The idea was mooted by Commander Security Force – MLT, Major. General Dampath Fernando who understood the desperate need of addressing the prevailing unemployment issue in the district as majority of the men and women are employed on the basis of daily wages with very limited earning capacity causing numerous grievances on sustaining their families.
In fact according to Government statistics the Mullaitivu district is considered as the poorest district in the country with mediocre development in all areas as compared to other districts since the three- decade war ended in 2009.
The Army has come forward as usual to play their role, teaming up with the GDT group, to establish their TDC with 35 employees from the area.
Maheshika Kularathne who is the livewire behind this whole exercise has been working very closely with the Army from start to end, to set up this centre. Mullaitivu District Secretary Rupawathi Kethishwaram who supported this project from the very inception said the TDC with 35 employees would help to sustain 35 families and in the future through the upcoming factory, 300 more employees would sustain a further 300 families.
With many giants in the apparel field, GDT, an up and coming business entity effort to extend its commitment to establish its business in Mullaitivu should be highly commended.
It would no doubt be an eye opener for other investors to look towards the district.
