Sri Lanka recovering to reach envisaged economic objectives: Ravi

"Sri Lanka’s economy has shown tremendous resilience in the past countering many adverse situations," Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said the governments strategies to improve growth and dilute the debt servicing could ensure a noteworthy contribution towards the expected evolution of the Asian and Pacific region.
He was addressing the 50th Annual Meeting opening session of the ADB’s Board of Governors in Yokohama, Japan on Saturday.
The Minister said the Sri Lankan economic growth was somewhat retarded in 2016 due to bad weather conditions, but the country was positively recovering to reach envisaged economic objectives enumerated in the government’s 2017 budgetary proposals themed, “Accelerating Growth with Social Inclusion". Karunanayake paid accolades for ADB’s contribution to bolster the Sri Lanka economy. ADB’s cumulative lending, grant, and technical assistance approvals for Sri Lanka stands as US$ 8.43 billion and ADB’s cumulative non-sovereign financing by product for Sri Lanka has reached US$ 560 million. For 2016, the approved loans, grants, and technical assistance amounted to US$ 714, million. In the last five years ADB’s co-financing to Sri Lanka toped US$ 2.3 billion.
