Animal husbandry in Matara enhanced

Animal husbandry in the Matara District is to be improved.
Farmers have been encouraged in cattle farming and poultry keeping and many other projects in the fields have been in progress now, SPC Agriculture and Livestock Development Ministry officials said.
Equipment and materials to construct cages and sheds needed for poultry farming have been provided to the farmer families in the district.
A special incubator with modern technology has been set up at the Kekanadura Livestock Farm to facilitate farmers engaged in the fields.
A factory has been established as well to produce animal food. Hybrid milch cows were distributed among dairy farmers to boost milk production.
The Livestock Development Department provided cattle farmers with financial assistance to build cattle sheds, ministry officials said.
