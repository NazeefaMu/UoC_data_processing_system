Gaja wreaks havoc in Jaffna

The cyclonic storm 'Gaja' triggered over the Bay of Bengal has displaced over 400 members of 205 families in the Jaffna district, the Jaffna Disaster Management Centre said yesterday.
The Disaster Management Centre officials said the storm damaged over 100 houses and 75 of them were completely damaged. Many of the houses were damaged by falling trees in the heavy wind.
The Centre said the other districts in the North Vavunia, Mullativue, Mannar and Kilinochchi were intact.
The Kytes Island is the most affected where over 270 members in 105 families were displaced.
The Delft Sea has grown rough in winds and as the storm is turning from bad to worse, the number of the displaced could increase. Therefore, the Centre has warned the people to remain vigilant. The Jaffna fisher folk cannot engage in their livelihood due to heavy rains.
