Health Ministry needs better leadership to tackle dengue: GMOA

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said that the Health Ministry needs a better political leadership that gives priority to solving health issues and not prioritizing political agendas.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Office, he said that the Health Ministry should end its ineffectiveness and give required technical leadership to control dengue in the country.
“The GMOA will submit a set of proposals with five main proposals to President Maithripala Sirisena next week. The proposals will be formulated on scientific facts. The current dengue control activities should be based on more scientific background,” he said.
He said a more scientific approach was needed to tackle dengue as the number of deaths from dengue is on the increase and gas reached 200 within the first six months of this year.
