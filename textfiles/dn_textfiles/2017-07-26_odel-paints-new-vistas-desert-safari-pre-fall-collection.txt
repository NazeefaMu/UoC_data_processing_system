ODEL paints new vistas with Desert Safari pre-fall collection

Nature’s vistas and forms have once again inspired a seasonal fashion collection at ODEL, this time the dramatic shapes and colours symbolic of the desert.
The fashion-focused retail giant’s latest offering is a ‘Desert Safari’ themed collection of clothing and accessories to celebrate the pre-fall fashion season.
With its aesthetically designed bold patterns featuring plant life, cactus,animal prints and desert sunsets, the new collection explores hues of the wild on a spectrum ranging from khaki green, orange, mustard, maroon, brown, plum purple, grey, dark blue, white and beige.
Inspired by international designer brands such as Huishan Zhang, Valentino, Chloe, Blumarine, Roberto Cavalli, Ellery, Neil Barrett and Versace, the collection includes statement pieces worthy of snazzy catwalks in the world of vogue. It is designed to appeal to the daring and more adventure-inclined patrons of ODEL, with an affinity for the great outdoors.
With its bold prints, bolder cuts and spotlight on nature’s arrays, ODEL’s ‘Desert Safari’ range is an exclusive capsule collection that will bridge the gap in the retail market between the summer and fall collections.
“The world of fashion is always in motion, and as the most passionate emissary of that world in Sri Lanka, ODEL ensures that its customers are keeping pace, with carefully selected pieces appropriate for the local milieu,” said Ms Desiree Karunaratne, Group Marketing Director of Softlogic Holdings, which owns the ODEL chain. “As a result, there is always something refreshingly new to look forward to on our shelves and our Desert Safari collection pulls out all the stops to create just that look for the season.”
The ‘Desert Safari’ collection is available at 22 trend-defining ODEL stores, and caters to all age groups, genders and sizes, and includes matching shoes, bags and other fashion accessories.
Seasonal collections such as ‘Desert Safari’ and its predecessor ‘Hola Summer’ exemplify ODEL’s status as the country’s most dynamic fashion and lifestyle store for the entire family, offering everything from formal and evening wear to office wear and cool casuals across a range of local and international brands, making it unnecessary for shoppers to travel overseas in search of current fashion. ODEL also offers the latest in sportswear, lingerie, cosmetics, jewellery, wristwatches and eyewear, as well as confectionary, books and household needs.
