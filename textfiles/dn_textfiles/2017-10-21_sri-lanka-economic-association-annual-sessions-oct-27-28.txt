Sri Lanka Economic Association Annual Sessions on Oct. 27, 28

The 2017 Annual Sessions of the Sri Lanka Economic Association (SLEA) will take place on October 27 and 28 under the theme, ‘Modernization of Agriculture and Industry: Challenges for Sri Lanka.’ This marks the 31st successive year of the event, which gathers policymakers, public officials, academics, and economic researchers in Colombo.
The highlights of this year’s sessions include an inauguration ceremony conducted under the auspices of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the launch of a new book on economics titled, ‘The Sri Lankan Economy: Charting a New Course’, published by the Asian Development Bank.
Five technical sessions will be held focusing on a range of pertinent issues, from the commercialization of agri-business and challenges facing the agricultural sector, to the industry’s evolution and current composition.
According to SLEA President Dr. Upananda Vidanapathirana, this year’s agricultural theme was chosen because stakeholders felt that it was time to address issues in the ‘real sector,’ those that feel real and urgent to a larger swath of the population who might not otherwise concern themselves with economics. The previous themes for the annual sessions have included macroeconomics, public debt, and fiscal deficit.
The inauguration ceremony of the Annual Sessions will take place on October 27 at 4 pm, followed by a reception. The technical sessions will take place on October 28 from 8 am to 5.45 pm. All programmes on both days will be held at the auditorium of the Centre for Banking Studies at the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in Rajagiriya.
