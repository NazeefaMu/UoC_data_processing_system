President took decisions in interest of country - Gammanpila

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila said President Maithripala Sirisena would work in cooperation with the Parliamentary group represented by him in future.
He said he was thankful to President Sirisena for certain decisions taken in the interests of the country. The UNP was currently facing several problems and it was getting ready it form a national government.
Gammanpila was speaking at a press conference at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head office at Pitakotte yesterday.
He said the SLFP had not expelled Mahinda Rajapaksa from the party membership or the post of party patron and as such Rajapaksa could claim the position of Opposition Leader as a member of the SLFP.
Although Parliamentarians Dr. Harsha de Silva, Eran Wickramaratne and others desired an excellent government administration, they could not achieve some of the desired objectives.
Gammanpila said the duty of an Opposition was to highlight government actions detrimental to the country and added that he would never reveal the internal matters and issues of the UPFA to outsiders because he has always stood by the policy and programme of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He said Mahinda Rajapaksa volunteered to accept the Premiership in order to perform his duties by the nation and due to this step some of the dangers posed to the country and nation had receded.
