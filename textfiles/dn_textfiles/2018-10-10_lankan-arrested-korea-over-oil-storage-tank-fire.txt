Lankan arrested in Korea over oil storage tank fire

The Korean police have arrested a Sri Lankan national in its probe of a recent explosion at an oil storage facility, Korean police officials said Monday.
The arrest came one day after an explosion at the oil storage facility in Goyang, north of Seoul, which consumed a large storage tank with 2.66 million liters of gasoline, enough to fill 250 tank trucks.
The police said the 27-year-old Sri Lankan is believed to have accidentally caused the fire by releasing a sky lantern in the vicinity of the oil storage facility.
The police believe the sky lantern may have started the fire when it fell on the lawn of the oil storage facility, causing flames that later spread into the ventilation system of the oil tank, leading to the explosion.
The 27-year-old is said to be a construction worker at a site near the facility.
