Gunaratne to bat in the middle order in Mathews’ absence

Asela Gunaratne who excelled in the T20 series against Australia will bat in the middle order in the absence of regular skipper Angelo Mathews and the captaincy will be bestowed on Rangana Herath in the forthcoming two-Test series against Bangladesh according to the chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya.
Jayasuriya also said that a few players who have excelled in the Sri Lanka ‘A’-England Lions series in Dambulla will be included in the Sri Lanka side for the Test series against Bangladesh.
The chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Medical Board Professor Arjuna de Silva said that Mathews is gradually recovering from his hamstring injury and is already doing some exercises. He is doing workouts in the gymnasium and from next week he will be batting at the nets. If everything goes right he will be able to play in the One-Day Internationals against the visitors by end of March.
Veteran Rangana Herath who led Sri Lanka to a 2-0 win in the Test Series against Zimbabwe is tipped to take over the captaincy from Mathews for the Bangladesh series.
The first Test starts at the Galle International Stadium on March 7 and the second at the P Sara Oval will be Bangladesh’s 100th Test.
