Police have begun an inquiry into the discovery of several partially burned bodies at the Anuradhapura ‘Nisala Nimnaya’ cemetery.
The bodies were discovered after dogs and other animals had dragged the bodies to a nearby jungle belt for consummation.
Anuradhapura Special Municipal Commissioner Ajantha Gunawardene told reporters an institutional inquiry was underway into the incident.
It is suspect that bodies brought for cremation are removed while they are still partially burned and dumped at a nearby pit to save fuel used for fire at the cemetery.
