Union Bank received Compliance award at 53rd Annual Report Awards

Union Bank of Colombo received the award for ‘Compliance’ in the banking sector at the 53rd Annual Report Awards concluded recently.
The competition which was held around the theme ‘Quintessence of Eminence’ aimed to recognize the most cohesive, clear and customized annual reports that best reflect an entity’s operation, whilst going beyond its financial performance. Organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka), the annual report awards competition aims to promote transparency and accountability among organizations that produce annual reports in the country. Over 140 organisations including blue chip companies, conglomerates, SMEs to small time community groups contended for the coveted honours this year. 
The winners are selected on their ability to communicate the objectives, highlights, performance, personnel and management clearly to an intended audience. The size, resources, complexity and sophistication of operation of each entrant had been considered in the judging process. Hence, the awards tend to provide a holistic interpretation of an organization’s performance along with a view of ethics, values, achievements, and most importantly the future orientation of the organisation.
Commenting on the award, Chief Financial Officer of Union Bank Mr. Malinda Samaratunga said “We are pleased to accept this prestigious honour once again at an extremely competitive awards ceremony that assesses organisations’ ability to promote transparency, accountability and social responsibility by maintaining effective communications with its stakeholders. The award affirms the continuous improvement of our financial contribution, ethics, transparency and corporate responsibility that form the basis of our strategic direction to become one of the leading commercial banks in Sri Lanka.”
