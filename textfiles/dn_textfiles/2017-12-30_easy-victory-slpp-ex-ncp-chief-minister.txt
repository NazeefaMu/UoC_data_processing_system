Easy victory for SLPP: ex-NCP Chief Minister

Since the parties in the Yahapalana government are contesting the forthcoming local election as seven separate groups, the SLPP which is contesting in coalition with 18 other parties, will clinch an easy victory, former Chief Minister of the North Central Province S. M. Ranjith Samarakoon said.
Addressing a press conference held yesterday, Samarakoon said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated because the UNP, SLFP, JVP, SLMC, TNA, JHU, plantation sector parties and Rishad Bathiudeen's party contested the last election in coalition. This victory could not be repeated because they were now contesting separately, he said.
