Under Education National Plan
Increased access to higher education

e-Education centres for undergrads
With the aim of facilitating undergraduates to access the latest in advanced and novel knowledge available in the world, e-education centres would be established in every university by next year, University Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said.
“In line with establishing e-education centres, each reading room in universities would be provided with Wi-Fi facilities next year. The Higher Education Ministry would allocate the necessary funds for the project in due course,” he added.
Besides moving to the latest of advancements in the education sector, it has been planned to establish a central national digital library through which lecturers, undergraduates, or other parties could access the library, the Minister said.
On a government’s policy decision, the room for accessing higher education would be significantly increased during the next five year period under the national plan for higher education, State Minister for University Education Mohan Lal Grero said.
He said so after he met the university academics at the University Grants Commissions yesterday.
He noted that more students should be recruited to universities, allowing more students to access the higher education sector. Similarly, undergraduate courses should be transformed with a view of producing employable graduates.
“Without considering the trends and demands in the job market, our universities produce graduates. Once these graduates enter the job market, they lag behind in finding employment as the qualifications they possess, are not what the job market expects. In other words we are attempting to produce squire pegs to fit into round holes,” he said.
Moreover, the Minister said it has been planned to establish a unit in every university, called the industry advisory council for each trade. The unit will design degree programmes, which are would be favourable to job market as well as industries and we could be able to get advice from industries to design degree programmes through this advisory committee.
As a move to produce employable graduates who would be a resource to the job market, a “Technology Stream” as the fifth stream for the Advanced Level was introduced in 2013.
“Now the idea is to reduce the number of students who are opting to read art streams in advanced level curricular. But I would have to mention that out of 334 DS divisions in our country, there are no 1AB school in 72 DS divisions which offered maths and science streams until 2013, revealing that there was a huge issue in the distribution of resources for the general education system of this country,” Minister Grero added.
The government would also facilitate the increase or the intake. It had been aimed at increasing the intake by 10 percent annually, so as to reach the target within a 5 year period by 2020.
“When you consider the quality of undergraduate courses, we need to establish a quality assurance unit in each university to have internal quality audits. My proposal is to establish a quality assurance and an accreditation council, an independent council which is answerable to the Minister and the UGC, so that they could do an external audit on the quality of universities in future,” he said.
