Chamari, first Sri Lankan to play in Women’s BBL franchise

Batsman Chamari Atapattu's record-breaking year assumed greater significance as she became the first Sri Lanka player to be roped in by a Women's Big Bash League franchise.
She has been signed by Melbourne Renegades for the third edition of the WBBL, starting December 9, and will join the New Zealand pair of allrounder Amy Satterthwaite and medium-pacer Lea Tahuhu as the side's overseas recruits.
"I am excited to come to Melbourne this season and play with the Renegades. The WBBL is a big competition and the club has lots of fan, so it will be great to have that support," Atapattu told Melbourne Renegades.
Atapattu, who put in an emphatic display of her big-hitting prowess at this year's World Cup with an unbeaten 178 against Australia in Bristol, became the first Sri Lankan woman to sign a contract with a franchise-based T20 league in July. She represented Yorkshire Diamonds in the second edition of the Kia Super League in England.
On November 1, she was named women's cricketer of the year by Sri Lanka Cricket, and also took home the award for best batsman in both ODIs and T20Is.
