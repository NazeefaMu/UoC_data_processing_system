IAPC&M  recognizes Deepal  Sooriyaarachchi   as accredited master coach

 Well-known business professional, Deepal Sooriyaarachchi has recently been conferred the title of ‘Accredited Master Coach & Mentor’ (AMC/M) by the International Authority for Professional Coaching & Mentoring (IAPC&M).
Based in the United Kingdom, IAPC&M provides accreditation for professional coaches, mentors, training providers and corporate in-house programmes across the globe that pass their vigorous criteria and commit to honour their exacting industry standards for the protection of the end user.
Sooriyaarachchi was awarded his accreditation after the IAPC&M validated his wealth of training, authenticated his certification and practically assessed his professional experience in the areas of coaching and mentoring as practised throughout his career that expands nearly three decades.
Consequently, he is the natural choice when contemporaries seek coaching, and or mentoring, personally and or professionally. Now that the highest industry authority in the world has endorsed his capabilities, Sooriyaarachchi will obviously continue to provide these services while enriching the management development work he currently engages in.
The IAPC&M uses a rigorous assessment process to maintain such high standards when accrediting anyone, be they a practitioner, senior, master or fellow coach/mentor. Sooriyaarachchi supplied over 40 testimonials, reflective case studies and conducted several live coaching sessions and was interviewed before achieving his AMC/M status. Ongoing CPD is also a fundamental part of accreditation.
Sooriyaarachchi currently focuses on mentoring very senior managers, mostly in the C suite, and business leaders. Deepal is a marketer by profession with a passion for developing people.
Sooriyaarachchi said, "I am humbled by this recent recognition of my competencies by the International Authority for Coaching and Mentoring and gives me greater encouragement in doing what I love, developing people. I have been helping many young professionals who are at thresholds of assuming greater responsibilities in their careers. Compared to their predecessors today’s executives have to shoulder greater responsibilities much earlier in their life and they are constantly challenged to perform in an environment that is constantly changing. This poses extreme pressures on them and they need extra help to face them. The assistance of a professional coach or a mentor can mean a lot. Sometimes it is that extra perspective, reassurance is all what is needed for a person to move to the next stage. In a world where there is very little time to observe, reflect and learn from the phenomena it is nothing but common sense to have a professional help from an experienced coach or a mentor.”
