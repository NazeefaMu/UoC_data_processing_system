Trinco port, FTA among topics for discussion during Modi visit

The contract for the construction of the Trincomalee Port and the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement are among some of the bilateral agreement that will visited during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka, the New India Express reported.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected in Sri Lanka for the inauguration of the UN Vesak Day celebrations from May 12 – 14.
It will be Prime Minister Modi’s second visit to Sri Lanka since 2014.
Earlier in 2015, he had inaugurated the reconstructed Northern Province Railway line that linked Jaffna with Colombo. The rail line is one of the few developmental projects undertaken by the Indian government in post-conflict Sri Lanka, where China has made deeper inroads.
The Indian Government has been undertaking large number of development projects in Sri Lanka for rehabilitation and resettlement of conflict-affected and internally displaced people in Tamil-majority Northern and Eastern provinces.
India’s total development aid is more than USD 2.6 billion. As per the Government of Sri Lanka’s statistics, more than 880,000 Internally Displaced People have been resettled in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, as of end-August 2016, with around 43,600 people left to be resettled.
The flagship project is the US$ 270 million Indian Housing Project for constructing 46,000 houses in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, which are nearing completion, and 4000 houses in the Central and Uva Provinces.
