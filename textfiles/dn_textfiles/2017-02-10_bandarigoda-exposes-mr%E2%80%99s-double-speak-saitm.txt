Bandarigoda exposes MR’s double speak on SAITM

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had favoured the establishment of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) is now against granting provisional registration to the SAITM medical graduates, Galle District United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Bandula Lal Bandarigoda said. Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikota UNP Headquarters yesterday, Bandarigoda said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had provided SAITM with a 5 acre land and granted a loan amounting Rs. 600 million during his regime.
Therefore, it confirms that the former President is solely focused on re gaining political power by making falsehoods in order to act in his personal interests rather than driving Sri Lanka towards sustainable development, he added. Colombo District UNP Parliamentarian Mujibur Rahman said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to establish national unity, harmony and reconciliation even after the 30 year war had come to an end.
The consensus Government will not break the promise made to re-establish good governance, democracy, reconciliation, media freedom and to produce a better Sri Lanka for future generations, Rahman added.
He also said that a constitution acceptable to all would be created in order to achieve sustainable development and pave the way for every citizen could stand as one irrespective of differences.
