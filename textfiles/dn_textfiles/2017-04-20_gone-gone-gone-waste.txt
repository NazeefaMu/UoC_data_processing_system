Gone, Gone, Gone to waste

The Sinhala and Tamil New Year traditionally brings with it new hopes and aspirations. Had the government hoped for a politically more tranquil New Year, it must have been most disappointed.
Literally hours after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year dawned last Friday, a mountain of garbage at Meetotamulla collapsed, taking with it dozens of houses and at least thirty-one lives. Many more are still reported as missing and the death toll from the disaster is expected to climb.
This is not a natural disaster. It is a tragedy due to a combination of factors: political expediency, inefficient government and even more inept local government. Right now though, it has evolved into a political dog fight with the government and the opposition- mostly the Joint Opposition (JO) - trading charges as to who is responsible for the disaster.
Initially, the extent of the disaster was understated. This was partly because the country was still in holiday mode and media coverage centred mostly on New Year celebrations. First reports only suggested that one child had died in the tragedy. As hours passed however, the full scale of the disaster unfolded.
To be fair, the government did respond with alacrity. President Maithripala Sirisena ordered officials of the Disaster Management Centre to conduct an immediate assessment. He also ordered the Police and the armed forces personnel to assist in relief operations. Those affected were to be housed in temporary accommodation, for which three warehouses were released. Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka visited the site of the tragedy.
Compensation to the victims
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was on the last leg of an official visit to Japan and Vietnam, cut short his visit and returned to the country. Wickremesinghe had also arranged for disaster management experts from Japan to visit Sri Lanka to assist in the relief operation. They are said to be very experienced in managing such disasters as Japan is a nation frequently affected by earthquakes.
The government also ordered the immediate release of compensation to the families of the victims. In addition, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa announced payments of 2.5 million rupees for those whose properties were damaged and Rs.100, 000 on behalf of the deceased as insurance payments. Despite these measures, there was some consternation, even within government ranks. United National Party (UNP) parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar went public saying that the government should shoulder some of the responsibility for the disaster because he had been urging that the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla be stopped but his pleas had fallen on deaf ears.
Indeed, as recently as in late March this year, a fire had erupted at the dump in Meetotamulla. It was thought that the dry weather and flammable material in the garbage dump had combined to produce the fire. On that occasion, Marikkar made a public appeal to stop the dumping of garbage which had accrued to about three million tonnes, rising 180 feet high.
“I told the leaders of this country that no more garbage can be dumped in this place. Nobody understands the gravity of the situation” Marikkar said then and stated that he is ready to sacrifice his parliamentary seat on behalf of the people of Kolonnawa. Marrikar’s words turned out to be unfortunately prophetic.
While Marikkar was lamenting his plight, he and his fellow UNP parliamentarian from Kolonnawa, Hirunika Premachandra, came under fire from the JO. The JO alleged that the duo had canvassed preference votes at the last general election in August 2015, promising the people of Kolonnawa that they would halt the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla.
Premachandra in particular came under fire from a television stationed owned by the family of her political bete-noire, Duminda Silva.
This is when the disaster assumed a different dimension. Government politicians were quick to respond to these allegations, noting that the dumping of garbage at Meetotamulla was the brainchild of former Defence Secretary and head of the Urban Development Authority (UDA), Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Colombo’s garbage
Rajapaksa had won many plaudits for his pet project of beautifying Colombo city, in the years after the end of the war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). As part of this project, he ordered the relocation of the massive garbage dump at Bloemendhal road in Kotahena and decreed that no more garbage be dumped there.
A top Malaysian renewable energy company was contracted to remove the garbage at Bloemendhal road and set up a renewable energy plant on a 20-acre land at Kahatamedawelayaya, Muthurajawela, in the Gampaha District, using tonnes and tonnes of the Bloemendhal garbage.
This was after the Supreme Court had ordered that no more garbage be dumped at Bloemendhal road. While the dump at Bloemendhal road was cleared, the alternative site chosen was Meetotamulla.
With the government pointing the finger of blame at Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the JO countered these claims, stating that Rajapaksa had a plan to transport Colombo’s garbage to Puttlam by train. This plan, the JO argued, never became a reality because the Rajapaksa government was swept out of power in January 2010. Since then, the JO argued, the government had done little to redress the grievances of the residents of Meetotamulla.
Soon, the war of words escalated. Even former president Mahinda Rajapaksa entered the fray, declaring that the government ought to take responsibility for the disaster. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader Udaya Gammanpila, never one to lose an opportunity to take a swipe at the government and at his former colleague, Minister Champika Ranawaka, said that the government should immediately implement Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s plan, instead of worrying about who gets credit for that.
Meanwhile, the government had to call in the Police and the armed forces to maintain peace at Meetotamulla. The public in the area were becoming restive as more and more bodies were unearthed as the clearing of debris progressed at a slow pace. Given the nature of the clearing work, it was not a task which could have been carried out at a frantic pace, experts say.
Sentiments ran high in Meetotamulla and the surrounding areas as mass funerals were held for some of the victims. The public, perhaps more measured in their assessment of who was to blame for the disaster, were accusing all politicians of all colours of playing with their lives and were giving vent to their feelings. In that emotionally charged atmosphere, there was plenty of room for mischief makers to thrive and the government was keen to avoid such a situation which would only compound the crisis even further.
Recyclable waste generating energy
Key questions, however, still remain. The main consideration is where Colombo’s garbage would be dumped in the future or whether it should be dumped anywhere at all. The concept of recyclable waste generating energy is not new and has been adopted by many countries on a large scale.
This appears to be the solution to Colombo’s garbage crisis but the issue is how soon such a project could get off the ground- and what could be done in the interim.
As a make-shift arrangement, the government sought and obtained a court order to dump Colombo’s garbage at an alternative site, Karadiyana in Piliyandala but this is essentially a stop-gap measure.
In the meantime, however, the political blame game will continue to be played out in the media. Meetotamulla will remain in the headlines for weeks to come, but finding a solution to the crisis it generated will take a Herculean effort- an effort that will be as great, if not greater than what is required to clear the massive mountain of garbage that mars the Meetotamulla skyline.
