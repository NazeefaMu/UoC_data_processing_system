Chandimal to lead depleted Sri Lanka squad in India

 
 
Dinesh Chandimal will be leading Sri Lanka against India in the three-match T20I series next month. Many a first choice player has missed out due to injuries, namely Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Nuwan Kulasekara, Rangana Herath and Nuwan Pradeep.
 
The squad also sees the return of pacer Dilhara Fernando to the national team after a gap of four years.
 
Malinga missed Sri Lanka's recent tour of New Zealand tour due to a knee injury and will be needing another two weeks to regain full fitness. Mathews is nursing a groin strain but is likely to be available for the Asia Cup that begins soon after the series against India. Herath is recovering from a pulled side muscle and Pradeep is out of action due to a hamstring injury.
 
Sri Lanka squad: Dinesh Chandimal (c), Tillakaratne Dilshan, Seekuge Prasanna, Milinda Siriwardana, Danushka Gunathilaka, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Asela Gunaratne, Chamara Kapugedera, Dushmantha Chameera, Dilhara Fernando, Kasun Rajitha, Binura Fernando, Sachithra Senanayake, Jeffrey Vandersay.
