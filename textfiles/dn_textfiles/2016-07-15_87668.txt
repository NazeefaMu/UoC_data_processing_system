Sri Lanka rugby captain Fazil Marija hospitalized

Sri Lanka national rugby 15 side skipper and former Sevens captain cum fly half Fazil Marija had suddenly fallen sick and admitted to a private hospital in Colombo yesterday, where he is currently undergoing treatment.
According to Marija, he was admitted to a private hospital as he did not feel very comfortable.
“There are some medical reports to be released and we will know the exact outcome after doctors examine them,” Marija told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday. Marija is expecting a fast recovery and most probably may play in the inter-club rugby Sevens tournament for Kandy Sports Club which is due to begin next month.
He has however ruled himself out from taking part in the upcoming Mercantile rugby Sevens tournament to be worked off during the weekend.
