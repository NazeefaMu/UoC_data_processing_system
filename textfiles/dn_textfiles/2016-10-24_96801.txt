Vinuja Ranpul – first batsman to pass 600 run mark

All rounder Vinuja Ranpul of Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa became the first division one under 13 cricketer to pass the six hundred run mark in the ongoing inter schools cricket tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association.
In the just conducted first round in six matches he has scored 623 runs at a Bradmansque average of 124.6. His run rally consisted of three centuries and two half centuries with a top score of 189 runs against Bandaranayake Maha Vidyalaya, Gampaha. Also he has claimed 21 wickets and his allround performance has helped immensely in Cambrians becoming the leaders of the group and by thus they have booked a berth in the second round.
