Islamic State attacks Kabul intelligence training centre

AGHANISTAN: The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for an attack on an intelligence agency training facility in the Afghan capital on Monday.
“Two IS attackers raid the Afghan intelligence centre in Kabul,” the jihadists’ propaganda arm Amaq reported.
Nasrat Rahim, a deputy interior ministry spokesman, said the sound of large and small arms fire could be heard from the fighting.
Roads to the area were closed and dozens of police and intelligence officers were blocking access to the public.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet.
The Afghan capital has become one of the deadliest places in the war-torn country for civilians in recent months, as the resurgent Taliban and increasingly the Islamic State group both step up their attacks.
Security in Kabul has been ramped up since May 31 when a massive truck bomb ripped through the city’s diplomatic quarter, killing about 150 and wounding around 400 people, mostly civilians.
Monday’s attack represents another blow to beleaguered Afghan forces.
The Taliban have targeted military installations in recent months, including a spate of attacks in October that killed around 150 people.
Afghan forces, already beset by desertions and corruption, have seen casualties soar to what a US watchdog has described as “shockingly high” levels since NATO forces officially ended their combat mission in 2014.
Morale has been further eroded by long-running fears that the militants have insider help -- everything from infiltrators in the ranks to corrupt Afghan forces selling equipment to the Taliban.
