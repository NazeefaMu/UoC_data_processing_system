The 9 As, a real indicator of intelligence?
The recently released G.C.E (O/L) results, countrywide, made everyone happy. Surprisingly, according to a recent news report almost 14,000 students, from the leading schools of all the parts of Sri Lanka, obtained 9 A passes, which made every student and parent euphoric. The question is whether this achievement is the result of real intelligence or mere information gathering. Earlier days, in 80s, getting eight distinctions was a Himalayan task and a rare happening. Only a handful of students got all the subjects distinction island-wide.
Afraid to say, at present, whether the standard of evaluation has come down or the rate of rote learning by heart has escalated or the standard of real learning has gone up. If the first two are the reasons, seriously, our students overestimate themselves and have overconfidence in their ability once they have achieved 9 As. This leads them to choose the A/L stream in which they are not capable enough or not interested in and continue to be low and passive in the A/L education. Consequently, but disappointingly, many of them failed to score such good results in their A/L examination and even fail to get minimum eligibility to enter the university because of their superciliousness and indecisiveness.
Further, our students and parents have the illusion that when you get 9 As only, you can become doctors and engineers. One of my friends, from an average middle-class family, studied in her mother tongue Sinhala got 5 Ds and 3Cs and entered the University of Moratuwa at the first attempt and has class in electrical and electronic engineering. She got a scholarship to a recognized University in London for her PhD in robotics. Now, she is a leading academic and a researcher at the leading University in the UK. However, she is really worried that though her nephew got 9As, he depends on his parents for carrying out the routine activities he is supposed to perform on his own at his age. She opines that our teens always need their parents to fulfil their complementary needs such as preparing a cup of tea or making an omelette. So, no matter what the student’s results in his/ her O/L, he or she should have to have the knowledge and intelligence to compete and fit into the 21st century in a pragmatic sense.
Personally, I feel students run from pillar to post to the tuition without a break. This results in losing or neglecting their health. Sadly, the students have got ‘A’ grade for English without the practical ability for reading a piece of article and composing a creative writing in their own. They are not able to communicate confidently with people successfully. Students should be trained to survive independently in real life, whereas, students of the Western countries do so.
Therefore, it is mandatory to revise the syllabus to include more student-centred learning activities and outcome-based education and evaluate and allocate marks for these activities of practical applications. Finally, my message is not to discourage the students with 9As but to encourage the students with average results who can also do wonders in the A/L and at the universities, no doubt at all.
