Further remanded for allegedly soliciting bribe

National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) Chairman M. K. Muthuvinayagam and Kadiresu Sivanesan, who were arrested for allegedly soliciting a bribe from a businessman, were yesterday further remanded by the Colombo Additional Magistrate.
Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage made this order since Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake was absent yesterday.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the NLDB Chairman had allegedly demanded Rs.1.2 million from a businessman to expedite the lease of a restaurant at the Malsiripura NLDB Farm. However, it was later negotiated for Rs.600,000.
The Chairman had done this deal through another person known as Kadiresu Sivanesan.
Sivanesan was sent to collect the alleged bribe from the businessman and based on a complaint made by the said businessman, the Bribery Commission officers had observed the whole incident. Sivanesan, having obtained the cash had called the NLDB Chairman to confirm that he had received the money. The case will be taken up on November 1.
