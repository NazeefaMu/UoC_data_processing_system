Elephant House and Keells Food help to keep alive big match traditions in 2017

School ‘big match’ cricketing encounters have long been known for sharing the spirit of sportsmanship and camaraderie amongst historic rivals. That is why Elephant House and Keells Foods, as Sri Lanka’s most loved beverage, ice cream and processed meat brands, have signed on as the official sponsors for an unprecedented number of cricketing encounters in 2017.
Helping to promote the long-standing St. Joseph’s - St. Peter’s, Ananda - Nalanda, Trinity - St. Anthony’s, Prince of Wales - St. Sebastian’s and Jaffna Central - St. John’s big matches, the Elephant House and Keells Foods sponsorship of these tournaments encompassing Sri Lanka’s top schools not only focuses on keeping alive general excitement surrounding cricket locally but also honoring important traditions and lessons stemming from the glorious past of these age-old encounters.
These big matches are also a unique opportunity for Elephant House and Keells Foods to showcase their wide and diverse product offering, with spectators keen to re-familiarise themselves with longtime favorites as well as even trying out new products. However, most important of all, as sponsors, Elephant House and Keells Foods are excited to continue delighting big match fans, helping to keep going an enduring and quaint local tradition that is unique to Sri Lanka.
Big matches are unique Sri Lankan traditions that many hold dear from their youth, which ultimately inspire people to reminisce about the ‘good friends, good times’ of school days long past. These important traditions also remind people of vital lessons about courtesy and sportsmanship that they were taught early on, no matter the schools they went to. This is why Elephant House and Keells Foods are pleased to offer their assistance to the exemplary young men, as well as parents and other guests, participating at this year’s school big match cricketing encounters.
