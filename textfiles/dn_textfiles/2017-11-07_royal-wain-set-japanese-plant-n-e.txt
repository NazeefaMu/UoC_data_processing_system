Royal Wain to set up Japanese plant in N-E

Sri Lanka company based in Japan Royal Wain Co. Ltd, has tied up with one of leading Japanese instant food manufacturing companies to set up a plant in the North East to manufacture rice and fisheries based food items and re-export back to Japan. Royal Wain would also bring in two additional investors to Sri Lanka.
Chairman, Royal Wain, Ranjan Costa who is now in Sri Lanka says that he will be launching this operation next year with a Japanese investor. “I am now in Sri Lanka on a fact finding mission to identify a suitable area to launch this operation. We are looking for a sea front land the in North East and once it is identified, the Japanese team would visit Sri Lanka towards the end of the year.”
He said that they want to open a plant in the North East area to manufacture NORI, a ready to eat rice packet which is wrapped in edible sea weed instead of polythene. “This is a very popular instant lunch meal in Japan and we found out that the sea weed that is used to wrap this is also growing in Northern seas of Sri Lanka.
“Since both rice and ocean fish are available in North East we are keen to open a factory in North East and plan to re-export via the Mattala Airport via Dubai.”
He said this would be a BOI approved project where the investment would be over US$ 50 million.
Royal Wain Co. Ltd, Japan will also tie up with Showa Shoyu Co. Ltd. of Japan to manufacture Soya bean souce and other food items mainly from Agriculture products. Showa Shoyu Co opened their first overseas factory in Bangladesh mainly to manufacture sauce using Soya bean and other agro material grown in Bangladesh.
The Japanese company now wants to open their second overseas factory in Sri Lanka to manufacture other Agri products and re-export.
Costa also said that Royal Wain Co. Ltd, his company has partly invested in a four star hotel project in Anuradhapura and with a third Japanese company will open this hotel early next year. “We want to run this hotel as a training school for foreign students and also provide accommodation.”
“We hope to build 80 rooms and have two separate hostels to house foreign students mainly from the region who would work and learn at this hotel.”
