NCPA gets tough on child abusers

Tough action will be taken against all acts of mental, physical, cruel and degrading against children, Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Attorney Marini De Livera yesterday said in a statement.
In his statement, Chairperson de Livera requested all teachers and principals to be sensitive to the needs of children as a high prevalence of violence against children in educational and other institutes were reported.
The NCPA also observes, “Research has shown that children exposed to violence show excessive irritability, emotional distress and develop criminal violent tendencies.”
The NCPA notes that the circular issued by the Education Ministry in 2016 (Circular No 12 issued on 29/04/2016) has outlawed physical punishment and has outlined methods of positive discipline, such as advising children, talking to parents and guardians, and limiting privileges enjoyed by the child.
The Authority hopes to create awareness about the contents of the circular through its street drama group and workshops for teachers and principals with techniques such as role play, Chairperson De Livera stated.
The NCPA urges the public to inform of violence against children through its 24-hour toll-free helpline - 1929.
