‘Solution to NHSL clinical waste issue soon’

The infected waste (clinical waste) issue of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) will be solved shortly, NHSL Director Dr.K.Wickramasinghe told the ‘Daily News’ yesterday.
According to Dr. Wickramasinghe, the institution which handles the task of removing infected waste from all state hospitals faced an internal administrative issue recently and as a result, it was forced to limit the daily infected waste removal from all state hospitals and not only from NHSL.
“But, the institution removed infected waste daily from all state hospitals including the NHSL and it is not true to say that the waste had not been removed for a month. There was a limit to the amount of daily removal that was able to be removed and as a result, a part of the waste collected inside the hospital,” he said. “Chemicals were added to the waste remaining inside the hospital in order to maintain hygiene, and the institution has promised promised to clear the remaining clinical waste within a few weeks,” Dr.Wickramasinghe said.
“Meanwhile, more similar institutions/systems are to be selected to handle the job and a solution will be given for the issue tomorrow or the dayafter,” he added.
