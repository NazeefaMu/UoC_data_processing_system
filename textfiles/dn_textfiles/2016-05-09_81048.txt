Practical politics!

Title: Law of Elections
Author: Dr. Jayatissa De Costa, President’s Counsel, Former Principal, Sri Lanka Law College
Most readers of Dickens are familiar with his description of a Parliamentary election at which both candidates appeared at the hustings and faced a mob of their supporters and opponents, while rival newspapers poured the heartiest abuse on each other.
Britain has moved a long way from those days. British general elections are of the most decorous kind. Sometimes around 1950 Winston Churchill, whose long political experience entitled him to speak with authority spoke of the general election held that year as the most genteel and orderly election in the country’s history. That was sixty six (66) years ago.
Although in Sri Lanka candidates seeking election to Parliament, Presidency, Provincial Councils Municipal Councils, Urbans Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas do not have to answer as many questions or strive with hecklers as in Britain the emphasis here still remains on the personal touch; candidates themselves call on housewives, pat babies on the head, tickle children under the chin and generally try to spread an atmosphere of goodwill. Individual voters still relish these pressing attentions at election times.
Viewed, however, from the standpoint of undue influence, corruption, general intimidation and other vitiating factors recent experience has shown that Dickens’ description of an election in Britain is still relevant to Sri Lanka.
In Dr. Jayatissa De Costa’s own words ‘If one compares the position in Sri Lanka with that of England, one will observe that elections were very corrupt in England in the 19 th century and the early part of the 20 th century. Accordingly there were a large number of election petitions in that era.’ However, today in England elections are conducted without corrupt or illegal practices and for the past 90 (ninety) years there were only a handful of disputed elections in England.
Dr. De Costa has therefore, rendered a useful service by publishing a work on the Law of Elections. Little ink has been spilt, even badly on the law of elections in our country. Two earlier works which dealt with this subject were the Law of Parliamentary Elections in Ceylon by S.E.J. Fernando (1947) and the Law of Parliamentary Elections by R. Weerakoon (1970). These were mere handbooks for the guidance of busy candidates and cannot in any way be treated as dealing with the subject with any degree of thoroughness. Besides they were published before 1970. In the period after 1970 however, momentous and far reaching constitutional changes have taken place in the country leaving a vital lacuna in the earlier publications. Dr. De Costa has done more than necessary to fill this vital gap.
The author deals with the main features of our election law beginning with its early evolution packing it with all the material which is necessary to give the reader an accurate and complete impression of the rather complicated election law in Sri Lanka.
This comprehensive work is remarkable for its conciseness. The major events, periods, election offences and the case law are handled with clarity. The mass of material has been so admirably simplified that the reader can get a clear grasp of the law relating to Elections in all its aspects.
The historical development of the elective principle in Sri Lanka, the proportional representation, nominations, conduct of the poll, a general introduction to the election offences, personation, treating, undue influence, bribery, false statements, illegal practices, Presidential Elections, Provincial Council elections, local authority elections, referendum, election petitions and agency are discussed and one can form a picture of how Sri Lanka has drawn on all the experiences of other parliamentary democracies and shaped her own legal concepts, structure and scheme.
The procedure in election petition cases which obviously deserves careful study is discussed in chapter 16. As has been judicially observed “once an election petition is presented the matter ceases to be one exclusively between the petitioner and the respondent. In fact it becomes a matter in which the whole electorate, not to say the whole country has an interest and any order disposing of the application should therefore be made from the largest point of view” (Nagalingam J. in Don Alexander vs. Leo Fernando 49 N.L.R 202).
Agency an important aspect of election law is discussed in chapter 17 where principles such as vicarious liability are dealt with to shed light on the operation of the concept of agency.
In this book Dr. De Costa has amassed a wealth of material both from Sri Lanka and abroad, particularly from England and India. Therefore practising lawyers will find in the book a ready reference to leading cases on Election Law.
Since the author has introduced a comprehensive element into the treatment of the subject and has explained the practical operation of the several relevant principles of law, students of law will immensely benefit from it.
Although this book is essentially meant as a legal research the author has not confined his studies to an analysis of the technical rules either substantive or procedural. The author tries to look at the election law in actual operation and to assess the electoral system in Sri Lanka in terms of practical politics. In the result, the approach that has been adopted by Dr. Costa is one that of a constitutional lawyer as well as that of a political scientist.
Election law is very complicated and undergoes many changes periodically. The author has dealt with the statutory provisions and the decided cases up to March 2016. This is a book which the author must have taken several years to write and it can be called a standard work on this difficult branch of our law which is a very valuable work that will greatly help judges, lawyers and students of law in this difficult field of law.
