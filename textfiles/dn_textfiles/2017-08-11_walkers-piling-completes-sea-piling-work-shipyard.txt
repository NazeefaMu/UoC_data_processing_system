The sea piling work was carried out to enable the installation of a state of the art Ship Lift and Transfer System at the Mutwal Harbour which can lift ships up to 1200 ton displacement and 65 meter long ,and included the installation and testing of 124 bored cast in-situ piles of which 68 piles are allocated offshore with varying diameters from 750mm to 1200mm. Walkers Colombo Shipyard designed and built a 1000 ton barge which was used to mount the piling equipment during the offshore piling.
