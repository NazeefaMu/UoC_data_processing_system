Rajapaksa should not be opportunistic: Harison

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should not be opportunistic for political gains even from the existing drought that affect the masses, said Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harison.
“While the drought is affecting the entire region, the former President said it was a problem with the President and the Prime Minister. The responsibility of a former President should be to find solutions for the issue at hand without making groundless statements,” he added.
He made these observations at a press conference in Anuradhapura yesterday.
Minister Harison said the government has allowed the private sector to import rice to reduce the price of rice in the market. He added that the price of rice was reduced by Rs 10. This measure will urge the errant traders who have massive stocks of paddy in their stores, to release these stocks. “The rice mill owners are attempting to make hay while the sun shines,” said Harison.
“That is the reason the government decided to import rice. We are confident that the rice prices will further drop in the near future.”
Harison said the country was self-sufficient in rice during the Rajapaksa regime. “But it was not because of Rajapaksa. Could he order God Sakra to give rain? The country was self-sufficient in rice because there was rain that season. We know that he lived as if he was above God Sakra. But today he knows where he is,” Harison said.
He said there is a stock of more than 200,000 mt of paddy at the Paddy Marketing Board. He added that along with the stocks of the private sector there is ample for consumption until May.
He added that if the private sector owners attempted to hide their stocks, the government would act in accordance with the law. He said the government could check the stores of the private sector at any moment according to the Act.
