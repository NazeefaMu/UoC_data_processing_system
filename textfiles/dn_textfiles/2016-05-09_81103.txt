Japan crushes Hong Kong 38-3

Under normal circumstances, the second game of this year’s Asia Rugby Championship - Top 3 just concluded between Japan and Hong Kong would have been a chance for Leigh Jones the present head coach of Hong Kong to show his class against his former team Japan but the Brave Blossoms produced one of the greatest show by winning 38 points (6 tries, 1 conversions) to 3 (1 penalty) in the end at Hong Kong Football Club in Hong Kong.
The Welshman left Hong Kong in 2014 to be part of Eddie Jones’ coaching team helping the Japanese side to produce one of the greatest shocks in the history of rugby when they beat South Africa at last year’s Rugby World Cup.
After the tournament Jones returned to Hong Kong to oversee the change to professionalism for his first real test as head coach in yesterday’s game against Japan who are fresh off an 85-0 drubbing of South Korea in the tournament opener last week.
But it was a much changed Japan squad that played against them yesterday and not one member of the Rugby World cup Squad has been included in this Asian Rugby Championship- Top 3 tournament. After losing their head coach Eddie Jones to England national team two months back the Japanese interim coach Ryuji Nakatake picked 17 uncapped players last week to take part in this tournament.
It paid rich dividends in the end where they surprised everyone last week by scoring 13 tries in their 85-0 thumping win over the South Koreans who ranked Asia’s number two behind Japan.
Jones, meanwhile, has probably the most settled squad in the tournament with Nick Hewson leads a side that includes the likes of Jamie Hood, Ben Rimene, Lee Jones, Kam Shing Yiu, Alex McQueen and New Zealand-born Ryan Meacheam who was given a debut on the wing yesterday, but he could not received much balls for him to darted across the field to do his usual magic. So in the end he was kept in a cold storage for the most part of the match.
Jones, Hong Kong side could not get their set pieces to function nor they could not cope up to the fitter Japanese side that played a spectacular fast-paced game completely shattering the opponents pattern of play, especially at the breakdowns the physical contest was very impressive and in the end ran down as many as six tries.
For Japan, tries were scored by prop forward Hiroki Yamamoto (Two) and one apiece by scrum half Keisuke Uchida, Winger Kentaro Kodama, centre Ryoto Nakamura, flanker Shokei Kin. Fly half Ryohei Yamanaka fired across the four conversions.
While Ben Rimene put over the solitary penalty for Hong Kong.
