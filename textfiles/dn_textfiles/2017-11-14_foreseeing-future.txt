FORESEEING THE FUTURE

Three decades ago digitalism was not even a meme-fied concept it became in this avant-garde decade. The traditional medium was curbed within the walls of electronic means. Establishing Teleview at a time when VHF was the catchphrase, Sunil Ratnayaka raised a stone in Sri Lankan visual technology three decades ago.
And now three decades later, Ratnayaka owns a granary of expertise and memories. That this decade in our life has witnessed a technological upsurge is something that needs not told repetitively. Yet, in Sri Lanka, not everyone used to be conversant in the language of technology.
“I had been there throughout all these developments. I studied changes as well as improvements. I went in search of institutes where I can learn new modes of technology. It was a journey from Singapore to National Association of Broadcasters in the US,” Ratnayaka recalls.
Conceptual stages
Keeping his ear to the technology ground, Ratnayaka knew everything happening in the global sphere. He was familiar with the 3D concept years before it actually came to surface. He studied the subject from the conceptual stages to the final product.
“When we know technological advancements beforehand, it is easy to become accustomed to it. Creativity changes from time to time. So does technology with the growth of the global village. We might not be able to be on equal terms with the global context, but at least we can get closer.”
Can being technology savvy go hand in hand with artistic creativity? Ratnayaka calls himself skilled in technology as well as artistic creativity plus entrepreneurial competence. Here is someone who has won numerous awards for his entrepreneurial capacity as well as artistic creativity.
And there is another plus. Ratnayaka has produced about 2000 commercials, most of which have been honoured by various awards.
“A commercial comes in various types. It could be teledrama, musical and many other varieties. Whatever it is, it has to be delicate, brief and must be transmitted to a person within a short time. And they demand the best technology.”
Sunil Ratnayaka became a brand name owing to his feat with producing Dandubasnamanaya, a teledrama based on Sinhalese heritage.
The role of the Sri Lankan producer needs to change.
Producer’s role
“If someone can dole out money, they easily go for producing a teledrama. That brings them many benefits. Tax exemption and the opportunity to be with actresses are a few among them. That said, there are a few good producers in Sri Lanka.”
But the story is different in Hollywood, Ratnayaka muses. A Hollywood producer requires creativity. They know the core, depth and the gravity of the creation. They choose the director, not the other way around like it is in Sri Lanka.
Ratnayake’s attempt is to introduce a new mould to the Sri Lankan producer’s role. With expertise in directing and producing various teleworks, he deems himself fit enough to be a professional producer.
“It is said that 50 percent of the global companies close down following a lapse of about five years. I have survived for 30 years. So I think I am professional enough to change the producer’s role in this country.”
Ratnayake has produced the highest number of teledramas with his company being the oldest surviving production house. Dandubasnamanaya has won the largest number of awards in the country. Teleview is in possession of a script bank. They are currently in the process of evaluating them before finalising them for production.
Common question
“The problem in Sri Lanka is that you cannot reach the mass market with a high-quality production. We need to give up or adapt to the environment. Otherwise, we cannot move forward. That is the rule of evolution.”
But then the common question emerges. What if the cultural core values face danger in approaching the mass market?
“Culture is a changing aspect. Having said that I think the Sri Lankan culture has some stupid elements. For instance, we do not like girls to go in mini skirts. School principals are repulsed by it. Well, if they can expose themselves at a sports meet or a swimming contest, what’s this great fuss? As long as you have the private parts covered, that is what matters. A few years ago when a couple engages in some intimacy it drew enough response in Japan. But now they don’t care a heck about it.”
But the issue with the current mass market is that the audience is happy with a simple storyline involving a love affair. Ratnayake’s team roams in a higher plane.
For instance, Bhawathra was the first local science fiction narrative, based on an alien, telecasted.
“I am fond of the skies. I am surprised by what is happening in the skies. I am a lyricist. I used to see many things in the skies which others do not see. I used to see compassion, love and many other things. On a different note, I am crazy about Steven Spielberg. His creations influenced me to come up with the Bhawathra concept. I made use of the local belief and folklore to add colour to the alien’s character. For instance, the villagers are used to the sight of seeing lights travelling from one mount to another. They used to call it devatha eli. I made the alien travel from one mountain to another. Then there was another belief that deities used to extract milk from the cows. When they are done, the humans have no milk left in the morning. Mudiyanse devathava’s work, they used to call it.”
Scientific knowledge
Countries like Japan, China and Korea shot to development because they transmitted the scientific knowledge to people. They made the people involved in their scientific programmes. Without scientific knowledge, it is hard to work with people. Influenced by that phenomenon, Ratnayake used Bhawathra to transmit scientific knowledge to Sri Lankans.
“Culture needs a wider scope. Things like incest sex are there. We cannot avoid them. We shall not do them. But that does not mean that we shall not let them engage in it. It is a biological requirement. If things like prostitution are not there, the humans would react wildly. People will kill each other. That is why prostitution should be there. We should let them function without harming society in general. And that does not mean we should reach extremes. It should not be pornography.”
During the early days of our journey, Sunil Ratnayake was a pillar of strength. As two young Sri Lankans embarked on a revolutionary journey, we would not have produced the first-ever music video ‘Ae Pawasu Loke’ if not for the support of Ratnayaka and Teleview. He is a truly inspiration personality in the Sri Lankan television and cinematography industries and stands as a true inspiration to young entrepreneurs coming into this industry, much more than this he is a true Sri Lankan, who supports the younger generation and guides them to achieve their fullest potential.
Bathiya and Santhush
An industry veteran with over thirty years of experience, Sunil began his career as a civil engineer who then became a news correspondent for the Rupavahini Corporation. He is now one of the Sri Lanaka’s renowned television producers as well as an award winning director and songwriter. Starting his entrepreneurial career in 1983, he has received numerous accolades such as Best Teledrama Producer (Dandubasnamanaya) and Most Popular Teledrama Producer (Randoratuwa) for his outstanding work.
After following management courses in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore, Sunil was inspired to model Teleview around world class business strategies practised by global brands such as Sony and Toyota. He has won numerous creative, business and social awards for his excellence over the years.
