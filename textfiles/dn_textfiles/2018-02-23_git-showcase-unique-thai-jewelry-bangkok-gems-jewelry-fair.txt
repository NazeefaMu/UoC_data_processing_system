GIT to showcase unique Thai jewelry at Bangkok Gems & Jewelry Fair

The Gem and Jewelry Institute of Thailand (GIT) has announced the launch of ‘Inheritance and Identities’, a project aimed at highlighting the country’s community gem and jewelry industry.
Duangkamol Jiambutr, Director of GIT, said, “This is one of our key projects in 2018. Our main objectives are to enhance the capability of the workforce in the gem and jewelry industry, and help them develop the products to meet market needs.”
“We also expect to create awareness of gem and jewelry products from local communities among tourists and jewelry lovers from every corner of the world.” From the beginning of the project, GIT’s team has targeted local communities in several provinces throughout Thailand.
“Dan Kwian, a sub-district in Nakhon Ratchasima province, was our first target,” Jiambutr said. “GIT’s experts have worked with the villagers to modernize the design of their ceramic jewelry, while preserving its uniqueness. We hope the new design will help them increase their consumer base.” In addition to design development, the GIT will focus on marketing the jewelry products through cooperating with partners to expand distribution channels.
“We have displayed and sold gems and jewelry products at GIT shops. Moreover, the GIT, in collaboration with the Department of International Trade Promotion (DITP) and the Department of Business Development (DBD) has found new online and offline distribution channels,” the GIT director adds. “We expect to see local artisans sell more jewelry and increase their income. This project not only helps create jobs and generate income in local communities, but also helps preserve the heritage of valuable Thai craftsmanship,” Jiambutr said.
