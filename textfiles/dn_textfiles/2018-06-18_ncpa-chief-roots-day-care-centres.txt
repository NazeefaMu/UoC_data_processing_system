NCPA chief roots for day care centres

National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Chairman M.M. Abeyratne said that the NCPA is to forward a proposal to the government to set up day care centres in all private and government organisations countrywide to protect children from possible child abuse and sexual harassment.
“Many employees face the problem of looking after their children safely while they are at work. This new proposal would enable employees to be productive and efficient at work, while ensuring the safety of their children. To implement this programme, I shall start a day care centre at the NCPA,” said Abeyratne, in Kurunegala .
