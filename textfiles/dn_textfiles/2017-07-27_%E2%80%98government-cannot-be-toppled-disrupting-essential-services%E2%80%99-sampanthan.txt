‘Government cannot be toppled by disrupting essential services’: Sampanthan

 
 
The government cannot be toppled by disrupting the essential services, Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R. Sampanthan said in Parliament today.
He also said that disrupting the essential services is an act against democracy.
He added that the Joint Opposition is attempting to topple the government by interrupting the essential services.
“But everybody should realize the government has received the people’s mandate,” Opposition leader said. “
The provision of fuel to the people is essential. But the Joint Opposition is attempting to disrupt it. That is the reason why the President declared the distribution of fuel is an essential service.”
He also added that the trade unions are essential for a democratic country but they should not cripple the essential services of a country.
“During such situations, the government should take strong decisions to solve the problems of the people,” he said
