Isis challenge Prince Harry to a fight and threaten to send him 'to hellfire'

 
Isis has challenged Prince Harry to a fight and threatened to send him "to hellfire."
A Singaporean member of the terror group appeared in a three-and-a-half minute in which he encourages would-be jihadis to fight for Isis in Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
The jihadi, who is identified as Abu 'Uqayl, goes on to threaten Prince Harry, who spoke about the London Bridge terror attack when he visited Singapore in  June.
He said: “To Harry, you come to Singapore and tell such stories to gain sympathy for the London terror attacks?
“Why don’t you come here and fight us if you’re man enough, so that we can send you and your Apaches to hellfire?"
The Prince formerly served in the British Army, where he flew Apache attack helicopters in Afghanistan. 
His visit to Singapore was overshadowed by the London Bridge terror attack, in which three knife-wielding assailants used a van to ram pedestrians on London bridge before stabbing people in restaurants and pubs around Borough Market.
Eight people were killed and 48 injured in the attack, which was claimed by Isis. 
Singaporean authorities have identified the man in the video as Megat Shahdan bin Abdul Samad, 39, who left the city-state to work in the Middle East in 2014.
In a statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs said: "Our security agencies have been aware for some time now of the presence in Syria of a Singaporean, Megat Shahdan bin Abdul Samad, 39, and have been monitoring his activities.
"It is believed that the person in the video calling himself 'Abu Uqayl' is Shahdan."
