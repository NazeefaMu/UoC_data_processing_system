EDB to prepare National Export Strategy

 
The Export Development Board (EDB) has initiated to prepare a National Export Strategy (NES) for five years.
The strategy was prompted to be prepared by the Sri Lanka Export development Act.
The initial consultative meeting was held recently at the EDB, chaired by International Trade Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The NES provides a detailed, prioritized five year action plan to develop trade and competition for the benefit of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) in Sri Lanka.
The strategy will provide a clear direction for sustainable export-led growth to make Sri Lanka a key trade hub in the Indian Ocean.
The objective of the meeting was to discuss the NES objectives and agree on the next milestones.
A detailed strategy with realistic and measurable action plans for the development of the product and service areas and key trade support areas such as trade promotion, trade intelligence, trade financing, quality and enterprise competency development was determined to be prepared at the meeting.
EDB Chairman and Chief Executive Indira Malwatte, Secretary Chandani Wijayawardena, officers from the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and Managing Director Saman Kalegama, Agency for International Trade were among the thirteen members of the consultative team and the NES coordinated by the Policy and Strategic Planning Division of the EDB.
Technical assistance for the NES will be provided by the International Trade Centre (ITC) based in Geneva and European Union (EU) will support financially.
