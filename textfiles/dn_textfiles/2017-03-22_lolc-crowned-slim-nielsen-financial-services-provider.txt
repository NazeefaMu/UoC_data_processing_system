LOLC crowned  SLIM-Nielsen  Financial Services Provider

LOLC was crowned the “Financial Services Provider of the Year 2017” at the SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards 2017 at the awards ceremony held at the Water's Edge, Battaramulla, recently.
The SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards is a joint initiative of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the national body for marketing, and Nielsen Sri Lanka, the local arm of the largest information and research company in the world. Known as one of the much awaited events in the corporate calendar, SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards rewards and recognises brands that have made a powerful impression in the minds of the people. Winners are based on consumer responses or people's choice rather than on a decision of a panel of judges.
LOLC Group Managing Director and CEO, Kapila Jayawardena said, “This award is a true reflection on how well the LOLC brand is embedded in the minds of the public and how well the brand has given back to society in terms of benefits, value and more importantly uplifting the socio economic status of the community. Unlike any other awards presentation, at the SLIM-Nielsen People's Awards, it is the people who decide, who walks home a winner. The people have judged us and they have shown how close we are to their hearts and minds. Being adjudged the Financial Services Provider of the Year,reflects our connection, our strong bond with the people of Sri Lanka, and we consider this as the ultimate recognition.”
