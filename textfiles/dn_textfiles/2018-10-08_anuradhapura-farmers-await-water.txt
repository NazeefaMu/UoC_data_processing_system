Anuradhapura farmers await water

Seventy three major tanks in Anuradhapura are drying up and major reservoirs in the area received only a little rainwater in the past few months, Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Director Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said.
He told that farmers were cautioned to use rainwater as much as possible to prepare land for cultivation and use tank water sparingly.
The farmers said it is a risk to cultivate now because they lost a few ‘kannas’ in the drought. They are given packs of dry food worth Rs. 5,000 each, Somawansa said.
Water levels of 3,000 small tanks are very low and the issue will worsen in the 2018/2019 Maha season, he said.
‘’We expected to cultivate 132,000 hectares in the 2018/19 Maha season. But we are compelled to cultivate only 1,21,170 hectares or even less if we do not receive rainfalls,” he said.
About 36,384 mt of fertiliser subsidy will be distributed among 150,000 paddy farmers at a cost of Rs. 2,537 mm for the Maha season. A farmer then will have to spend only Rs. 500 on a 50 kg bag of fertliser, Anuradhapura District Agrarian Development Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said.
