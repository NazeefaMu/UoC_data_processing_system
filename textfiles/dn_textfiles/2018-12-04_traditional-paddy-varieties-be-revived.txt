Traditional paddy varieties to be revived

The cultivation of traditional varieties of paddy is to be revived in the country at present.
Under a special programme, the farmer community would be encouraged to grow more traditional, high-quality paddy varieties, agriculture officials said.
The traditional paddy strains include marvie, samba, suwadel, rathdel, danahala, H4, gambada marvie and several others, officials said.
According to the Agriculture Ministry sources, over 3,000 acres of uncultivated land in the country have been brought under the plough for the purpose.
The only exception is that neither chemical fertiliser nor pesticides are used in the cultivation. They are also capable of resisting pests, insects and floods.
Paddy farmers are also being made aware of the significance of using organic manure and compost rather than chemical fertiliser in cultivations.
Cultivation instructions, agricultural know-how and other facilities would also be provided to farmers by the Agriculture Ministry.
It is targeted to bring about 100,000 acres under cultivation of traditional varieties of paddy soon, agriculture authorities said.
Steps would also be taken to encourage cultivators in this regard.
Enhancing the high quality rice production is the aim of these endeavours, agriculture project officials added.
