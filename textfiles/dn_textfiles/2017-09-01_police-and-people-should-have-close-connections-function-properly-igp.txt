Police and people should have close connections to function properly: IGP

The Police and the people are connected to each other such as a tree and its bark. The Police could fulfil its duties only if it functions in closely association with the public, said IGP Pujith Jayasundera, addressing a meeting held at Meegoda to mark the opening of the new Meegoda Police Station on August 29.
The Meegoda Police Post upgraded and set up as the Meegoda Police Station was the 486th Police Station in the country.
The IGP said a proper policeman should display humanism in the discharge of his duties. He should also understand the problems encountered by the public at large. They should always ensure quick action regarding complaints made by the public.
People should also act in an intelligent manner and notify the Police about any illegal activities in their area. So that the Police could take prompt action. He said as IGP, he was approachable to the people round the clock and he or his security could be contacted on mobile 071-7582222 or 071-8592020.
He said he planned to increase the number of Police stations in the country to 600.
Provincial Minister Gamini Thilakasiri and Parliamentarian Sumith Vijayamuni Zoysa were also present on the occasion.
