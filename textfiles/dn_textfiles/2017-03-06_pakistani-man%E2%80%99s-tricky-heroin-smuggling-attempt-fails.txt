Pakistani man’s tricky heroin smuggling attempt fails

The Police Narcotics Bureau on Saturday arrested a Pakistani national who attempted to smuggle-in heroin worth Rs.30 million using a novel method.
According to the Police, the heroin had been mixed with rubber carpets. The carpets had been created mixing two layers of rubber and one layer of drugs. The Police said it was difficult to detect the drug with a preliminary inspection. The drug, according to the Police, can only be consumed after setting the carpet alight. The heroin is sold to customers as pieces of the carpet.
The 25-year-old Pakistani national had arrived from a middle eastern country. He was arrested on a tip-off.
The Police said three carpets he had contained heroin weighing 5.5 kilograms. He was produced before the Negombo Magistrate’s Court and was remanded until March 11.
