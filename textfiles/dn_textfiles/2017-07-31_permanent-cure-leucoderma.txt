Permanent Cure for Leucoderma

Beauty produced by the pleasing appearance does matter. It is just not the way you think, your intellect or what you say is going to make an impact on your personal and professional life. Your physical appearance is important enough to make significant changes in your life.
Leucoderma, also known as vitiligo, is a distressing skin condition that has affected many lives not only in Sri Lanka but also all around the world. Often affected individuals are discriminated against especially in marriages and their families face social stigmatization leading to low self-esteem, anxiety, embarrassment, anger and even serious depression. In some parts of the world it is also considered as a curse of god. Hence it is life-changing even though it is neither contagious nor life-threatening. How consoling would it be to hear that this condition can be completely cured? The Daily News came across an Ayurvedic Doctor who claims to have brought a few lives around the country back to normalcy. H. M. Jayatilake, Former District Community Medical Officer and a lecturer at Siddayurveda Nikethana Vidyalaya treats the patients who sought his aid at Madugahawatta weda Nivasa, Bemmulla. Jayatilake who has been keen in Ayurvedic medicine since his childhood, graduated from Yakkala Wickramarachchi Ayurveda Vidayalaya and has since been in government service until his recent retirement.
“The word leucoderma literally means white skin. A gradual loss of the pigment melanin from the skin layers results in these white patches. These patches look ugly, especially on persons with a dark complexion. The condition does not cause any organic harm. It is caused neither by any germs, nor is it due to bad blood. It is considered to be neither infectious nor contagious,” he said.
Dr. Jayatilake said it was a popular belief that rat bites were the primary cause of this disorder while a despairing few even believe it to be a curse of god. “Some believe that this condition occurs when you insult your parents and teachers and that it cannot be cured. Although this disorder does not produce any physical impairment, it significantly influences the psychological well-being of the patients. They are subjected to isolation, whispered comments, antagonism and insult. This sometimes makes the patient and their family to go behind rituals rather than seeking a medical help. Thus the delay in treatment further complicates the condition. Patients get depressed and it further triggers their condition,” he added.
According to western medical science, the actual cause of leucoderma is the gradual erosion of melanin in cells – the pigment that gives the skin its natural color. “The problem usually starts with a small white spot which later develops into patches. These patches are pale in the beginning, but become whiter and whiter as time passes by, due to loss of pigment. As the spots enlarge, they merge into each other and form a very broad patch. In some cases, most of the skin of the body may be covered with white patches,” Dr. Jayatilake pointed out.
Reasons
“At present I find that there are many reasons for this condition. Mostly the condition is triggered by food that we take which include artificial flavours especially monosodiumglutamate (MSG) commonly known as ajinomoto. It is widespread and is a silent killer. It is a flavour enhancer that is added to thousands of the foods you and your family regularly eat, especially if the majority of your food is processed,” he said.
Dr. Jayatilake said MSG is one of the worst food additives in the market and is used in canned soups, crackers, meats, salad dressings, frozen dinners and much more. “It's found in the food you eat at the restaurants and cafeteriasas it enhances the flavour of foods, making processed meats and frozen dinners taste fresher and smell better,” he said.
Ayurvedic doctor says at present leucoderma patients have increased because they use more artificial food. “They don’t add green leaves to their diet which boost the production of melanin. In the past the villagers used to make salads with several green leaves found in their gardens called `Kalawam Pala’. This includes sweet potato leaves, cassava leaves, Gotukola, Mukunuwenna and several other dark leafy greens. In Sri Lanka we have medicine for all illnesses, but people are unaware of it. Manioc or Cassava can cure cancer. Thebu leaves are good for pressure and lotus yams are very beneficial and can increase the production of melanin. Illnesses such as high blood pressure, diabetes and even leucoderma were there in our bodies, but they were controlled by the food the people consumed,” he said.
Humans who are at the top of the food chain are generally not exposed to a single toxin at a time, but to a complex mixture of toxins. This includes pesticides and other chemicals that enter our body from multiple sources such as animal products and fruits and vegetables that are exposed to the harmful toxins.
“When preparing a soup most commonly people use carrots, beans and cabbage. Those vegetables are abundant in toxins that come from pesticides use on them. If you can make a pumpkin soup with dhal and potatoes, that gives more nutrition than other vegetables. Pumpkin is the best food for fatigue that is why after several days of breaking rest at a funeral you are given a meal inclusive of pumpkin. Nowadays people replace it with other vegetables, which is not correct,” he said.
“Some of Sri Lankan women employees who go for foreign employment consume excessive amounts of tomatoes which can result in developing leucoderma many years later. Especially women from areas like Anuradhapura get used to fast food and forget cucumbers, water melons that grow in the area that help balance the immunity in the body,” he added.
“When you consume fruits and vegetables eaten by rats, monkeys and squirrels you may develop this condition. Apart from that when the snake bites are not completely treated and those who work in factories might develop this condition after a long period of being exposed to chemicals used. Excessive use of antibiotics also results in leucoderma,” he said.
Treatment
“Reasons for this condition vary, so it has to be treated according to the history of the condition of each patient,” Dr. Jayatilake said.
“The prognosis of the condition is very slow and depends on each patient's skin condition and the triggering factors like the food they consume and the materials they work with. Some patients, as they are not aware the facts that cause the condition prematurely discontinue the treatment or switch on to another doctor which again leads to noncompliance. Patient compliance is an important aspect in achieving the desired outcomes,” he said. “The more the body area is covered with white patches, longer the treatment will take for a complete cure. Hence it is advisable to consult a competent ayurvedic physician on the first appearance of such white spots,” he added.
Dr. Jayatilake said his treatments for the condition consist of application of ointments and medicinal oil on the skin and administering of herbal tablets and powders into the body.
“My medicine is aimed at regarding the lost balance of the immunity system so that the body can function normally and restore its productions of melanin. As usual with ayurvedic medicine, there are no side effects or after effects and the cure stays permanent.
The medicine can be complimented with the food one takes. Green leaves like “kathurumurunga” (Coronilla grandiflora) and “mukunuwenna” (Illecebrum sessile) benefits and expedite the healing process.
The same way, big fish, meat and fowl as well as pickles and sour fruits are to be strictly avoided especially mangoes, tomatoes and pineapple. Excessive drinking of lime juice will also have adverse effects on the healing process,” he said. Patients from all over the country including Trincomalee, Galle and Matara reach out for this ayurvedic doctor who is concerned in providing a service which brings him merits rather than financial benefits or recognition.
