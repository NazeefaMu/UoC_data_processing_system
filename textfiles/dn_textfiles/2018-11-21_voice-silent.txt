Voice of the Silent

With an intent of conquering one of the biggest battles that the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Hospital, Angoda-Mulleriyawa of Sri Lanka faces, that of stigma associated with mental health disorders experienced by patients, a former resident of the Institute, brave survivor,33-year-old Shmana Whittall Ferdinandus, on recovering from her infirmity formed a committee of friends and family to raise funds for the betterment of the National Institute of Mental Health Hospital by organizing concurrent awareness programmes in Colombo and Melbourne.
Aptly named the “Fearless Fundraiser Events “Shmana spearheads a forceful team whose Mission is to make a difference in the lives of people affected with mental health problems and to make society aware of the implications not only to those afflicted but also to the society.
In a heartwarming and unscripted delivery of her personal experience of her affliction, the time of treatment, under the purview of Consultant Psychiatrist of the NIMH Dr Mahesan Ganesan, her will to emerge from the darkness of depression, bipolar and her strength, Shmana made an impact on the audience by transmitting a live address from Australia,

Proceeds collected at the event held in Colombo on November 4 were presented to Dr Venura Palihawardena by Shmana’s Mother, Sherine de Run.
The committee members are now hoping to bring Fearless Charities to life in 2019 with many more quarterly events organized globally to support patient wards and the afflicted at NIMH.

Within a period of one month they were all able to bring these great events to life which has raised funds of over Rs200,000/- for NIMH which will be utilized as below;
* Providing 20 Patient cupboards for Ward 16
* The contribution of furniture for the Children’s learning & disability unit.
* Christmas party for the NIMH hospital
A small gathering of friends and family supporting the cause met over afternoon tea in Melbourne on the 10th of November - where Shmana related her story, described her Mission, showed a video presentation of the most harrowing period of her life, and celebrated her survival.
Shmana has also published a book which will be launched in February 2019 and here are a few excerpts from her close family and friends.
Shmana is a living, breathing, joyous testament to never giving up and having the courage to ask for help. Her new outlook to life (after overcoming many obstacles) is an unselfish attitude to ensure she helps as many people as possible – ‘’Nadini Soyza - Best friend’’
I watched my oldest friend fall into the darkest hole imaginable and witnessed every stage of it. I am so happy to see that with the help of her family she got through something most of us thought she would never recover from, I am so proud and my heart is finally at ease, ‘’Yasara Abeynayake Marija - Childhood best friend’’
I felt sad that such a vibrant person had to deal with mental illness. I also had no doubt that you would pull through because I knew you would put your experience to work for the good of other less privileged people. There is a reason I liken you to Mother Teresa because of your heart for the poor. "Nataliya Gunasekera - Cousin"
The mission is to help make a difference in the lives of people coping with mental illness and to make the community better aware of the implications of all mental illnesses. We will be engaging in relationship development with hospital staff, the wellbeing of the community through awareness, education, support programs and engaging in extracurricular activities for the patients and attending to their basic needs.
Our vision is to see a community and support group well aware of handling mental illnesses without judgment or social stigma and being supportive of the full recovery and wellbeing of the patients and their loved ones.
