Rasanjana excels in drawn game

Nalanda’s stylish left-hander Lakshitha Rasanjana scored a magnificent century and Kasun Sandaruwan a half century at the 88th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter against Ananda College that ended in a draw at the SSC grounds yesterday.
Nalanda who were dismissed for a paltry 144 put up a better display of batting in their second innings to finish on 280 for four wickets with Rasanjana’s innings being the highlight and his unbroken century partnership with Sandaruwan that put paid to any chance Ananda had of pressing for a win.
Ananda resuming at their overnight score of 160-5 took a first innings lead of 46 when they declared at 190-8 losing three wickets within the first hour to paceman Kalana Perera who scalped the prize wicket of Sri Lanka under 19 cricketer Sammu Ashan for 67.
Perera and Asel Kulatunga claimed three wickets each for 35 and 47 runs respectively.
Nalanda lost the wickets of Avishka Perera (7) and Malinga Amarasinghe (21) before the first innings deficit was wiped out.
However a brilliant 90 runs partnership for the fourth wicket between Rasanjana and Suhanga Wijewardene followed by the former’s association with Sandaruwan put Nalanda out of danger. Wijewardene scored 44 including 3 fours and a six. Sandaruwan built a strong 111 partnership with Rasanjana to take Nalanda to their final total before the match ended.
Rasanjana’s brilliant knock of 113 not out included 11 fours and a six while Sandaruwan’s splendid 50 comprised 5 fours. Rasanjana was fortunate to be let off at 90 by Ananda’s vice captain Dileepa Jayalath.
The Man of the Match and the Best Batsman award was won by Rasanjana and the Best Fielder award went to Asela Kulatunge also of Nalanda. Ananda skipper Avishka Anjula bagged the Best Bowler’s award.
