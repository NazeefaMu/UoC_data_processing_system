TMP to perform at Kala Pola

The children of The Music Project (TMP) will perform at Kala Pola for the second successive year. Kala Pola is a unique arts event featuring perhaps the largest collective of artists to display at a single eventin Sri Lanka. The event which is a collaboration of the George Keyts Foundation and John Keells Group isnow a celebrated arts event.
As an event promoting the arts it is fitting that The Music Project orchestra will perform. An orchestra of
musicians from two farming schools and one town school of Kurunegala who have rehearsed as an orchestra for over five years will perform light classics.
The children hail from challenged backgroundsand music is a unifying mission as they perform as one voice as a united orchestra; the mission of the project is that of social cohesion providing the children with alternative prospects of performance andopportunity. The children have specialist instrumental training from local teachers who work fulltime with the project and also visiting specialist instructors and volunteers who support the children on theirmusical journey.
The children play instruments ranging from violin, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, oboe, trumpet, trombone, bassoon and percussion. The orchestra performs a wide genre of music ranging from popular light classics to local fusion.
The children also benefit hugely from events such as these which feature the children and so provide motivation and encouragement as participants of a celebrated orchestra.
The children will perform at 11 am on February 25, 2018 at Kala Pola.
