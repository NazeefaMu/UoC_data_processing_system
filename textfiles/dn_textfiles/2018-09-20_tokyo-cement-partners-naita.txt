Tokyo Cement Group on the other hand, has been providing a yeoman service to the construction Industry by conducting training programmes for masons across the county, since the year 1997.
Furthermore, an ultra-modern Training Institute was established in Dambulla in 2012, in memory of the Founder Chairman of Tokyo Cement Company, late Deshamanya A.Y.S. Gnanam, which facilitates formal masonry training for school leavers.

Annually over 200 masons obtain their professional qualification at the institute and become active participants of nation building, while some of them bring in valuable foreign exchange through skilled employment in other countries.
The two organizations have been close collaborators for many years in facilitating professional training in the field of construction, and with this new understanding will improve the impact of the programme by reaching out to all parts of the country via the NAITA District Office network.
