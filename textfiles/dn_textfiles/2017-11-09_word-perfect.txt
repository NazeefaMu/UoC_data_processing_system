Word perfect!

Her talent rocked the Lionel Wendt theatre as the Workshop Players brought Lerner and Loewe’s Broadway classic ‘My Fair Lady’ onto the stage. Hailing from a musical family 20 year old Amarsha Tissera never dreamt that she would give life to the iconic role which had been played by Audrey Hepburn in the timeless classic.
However this in not her first brush with a stage play. She has previously acted in ‘Peter Pan’ in 2008, playing Wendy’s character when she was in her early teens. The play was directed and produced by Sharika Jayawardene for the Flying Solo School of Speech and Drama.
Since the play ran for 10 days, Amarsha shared Eliza Doolittle’s role with Daniella Perera. It was directed by Surein de S. Wijeratne and produced by Jerome L. de Silva. ‘My Fair Lady’ is based on George Bernard Shaw’s ‘Pygmalion’, and is considered one of the finest musicals ever created.
“I heard about the play last year. Initially I wasn’t going to audition for the main lead. I was going to try my luck for the ensemble. However my Mum encouraged me to go for the lead. There were about 23 girls auditioning for Eliza’s role. I was the ‘newbie’ in the crowd. I just walked in with a smile without any knowledge on how to take care of my voice even. I just could not believe it when I got the call informing me that I have got the role,” Amarsha enthused.
She noted that she has grown up watching ‘My Fair Lady’ with her sister since she was 7. She has been listening to Beethoven and Mozart from childhood because both her mother and grandmother were music teachers.
“Both sides of my family either play a musical instrument or sing. No one has done drama per say,” Amarsha expressed.
“It was a lot easier being a Covent Garden girl because there is no need to act like a lady then. Being ladylike was the most difficult part of the project for me! You need to be so prim and proper and word perfect. The transition in which she was taught to utter certain words differently was the most fun part for me because it showed the audience that even a common flower girl could amount to something as beautiful as a duchess,” Amarsha recalled some of her favourite scenes from ‘My Fair Lady’.
She said that the most challenging process during the week and a half in which the play ran involved taking care of her voice.
“I used to simply drink hot water and taking part in a singing event. With ‘My Fair Lady’ I learnt that you need to look after your voice 24 hours a day. This involved consuming bee’s honey and steaming to help clear the throat. You also need to drink coriander water and Paspanguwa daily. We had to drink two glasses of water as soon as we got up. Then a specific breakfast followed to give us energy. We were also advised to get adequate sleep. Since I was not use to such a schedule I found it very difficult to follow,” the bubbly youth giggled adding that it was this change of lifestyle rather than the acting which was a trail to her.
She notes that the most important advice that Surein has given her was not to react to missing a lyric. Just keep going because the show must go on.
“Working with Jerome was memorable because he was back on stage after five or six years. The entire experience was simply magical for me,” she beamed.

A past pupil of St Bridget’s Convent and Lyceum College, Waththala, Amarsha has been involved with drama from grade six. Firstly she starred as Portia’s clerk in ‘Merchant of Venice’. Driven by a passion for acting in stage plays she began taking part in the school productions annually.
“We did ‘My Fair Lady’ during the last year I was at school. I played Eliza’s character there too. Therefore the lines were very familiar during the Workshop Payers’ rehearsals,” she said.
Music runs in the family. Amarsha’s mother, Anusha Tissera, plays and teaches the piano. Her father, Trajan Tissera, is attached to Lanka Aluminum Industries PLC. Her sister, Tehani, plays the violin. Amarsha plays the cello and the piano. She had learnt to play the cello since she was seven and completed grades 1 to 8 with the ABRSM and Trinity College of London. She has trained under her mother and Tamara Holsinger. Amarsha has completed grades 1 to 8 in piano with the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music (ABRSM) and holds a A.T.C.L from the Trinity College of London. She has learnt to play the piano from her mother and Ramya De Livera Perera. She has completed Grade 8 ABRSM in singing, under Naomi Gooneratne’s guidance. She has completed grades 1 to 8 and holds an A.T.C.L. from the Trinity College of London for speech and drama and was trained by Sharika Jayawardene and Tamara Holsinger. She also sings with the past Bridgteens Choir ‘Contempo’.
Amarsha is currently in the third year of her LLB degree. She aspired to study law from childhood but after her stint in the spotlight on stage she is considering studying theater as well.
She says that sacrifices are evident if you want to excel in the scene.
“It is difficult if you cannot be flexible. If you are in a play you have to give your 100 percent. You need to be there mentally and emotionally to take on the role. Many of the Workshop Players had professional commitments too while they took part in the production. Luckily I had the opportunity to stay away from lectures because I was not missing out much,” she said.
She says that she owes all that she is today to God, her family and her teachers because it is their confidence, their support and their love that has brought her to this point in her life thus far. Amarsha is also grateful to the Workshop Players for giving her an opportunity of a lifetime and welcoming her into the workshop family.
Her message to the youth is, “I think fear; is one prevalent factor, fear of rejection, the fear of not being good enough, that holds back individuals from achieving their potential or to even take that leap of faith, to believe that they can do anything they set their minds to. I, too, was very nervous to audition for the role of Eliza Doolittle. But one bit of advice my mother instilled in my sister and I - if you don’t try, you will never know. Life is all about taking risks and trying. Don’t ever leave room for regret and end up living a life of ‘what-ifs’. The world is full of endless possibilities and they are within your reach. Don’t hide in your box and throw your God-given talents away all because you’re afraid to take that leap of faith. Nothing is impossible until you make it be. All you need is 20 seconds of insane courage.”
