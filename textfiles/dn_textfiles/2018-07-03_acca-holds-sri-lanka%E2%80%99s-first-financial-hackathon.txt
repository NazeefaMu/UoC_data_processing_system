ACCA HOLDS SRI LANKA’S FIRST FINANCIAL HACKATHON

The country’s very first Finance Hackathon hosted by ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) was held at the JAIC Hilton in Colombo.
Ten teams were from the key universities and from some of the leading corporate entities and worked around the clock to come up with solutions to case studies presented to them on current challenges that are prevalent in the finance industry.
The Hackathon participants were set through the paces by Peter D’Almeida, the Managing Director and Chief Executive of N-able, a part of the Hemas Group of companies, who provided valuable advice, input and guidance to the participants. With less than four hours of brainstorming, the teams pitched their ideas to a team of industry experts ranging those from top finance entities, blue chip companies and banks.
The judges evaluated the ideas presented, by perusing their user potential, level of innovation and commercial potential.
The Hackathon showcased some of the brightest minds coming together to work on case studies involving customer and business solutions, creating an intense burst of idea storming. Students and young executives of each team worked diligently on seeking intelligent solutions to overcoming and managing challenges in the finance arena.
These included working on case studies based on financial management and analysis, involving risk, financial reporting and maximizing company value and mind mapping on solutions pertaining to fair value.
After impressive pitching from all teams, Team Image Makers from University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Team Sparklers from University of Colombo and won the event.
The runners up were Team Maximus from Moody’s Analytics and Team Phoenix from University of Kelaniya. Winner received trophies and cash prices.
Nilusha Ranasinghe Head of ACCA Sri Lanka added “what we saw during the Hackathon was innovation at it’s best! Our main aim through this event was to foster and harness out of the box thinking and collaboration amongst our youth and to help them contribute their talents to think of ideas that will revolutionize the way forward for the financial industry that is evolving at a very rapid pace.”
“It also gave a great opportunity for the participants to be coached by some of the top industry experts, meet new people and learn new skills.”
“Inspiration, innovation and learning was the backbone of this Hackathon and we hope it gave our participants a deeper understanding of the challenges they will face to stay at the forefront of the finance industry in the future.”
