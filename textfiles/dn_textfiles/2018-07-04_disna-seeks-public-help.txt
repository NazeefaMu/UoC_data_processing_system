Disna seeks public help

Disna Pinsirini Wickramasinghe (33), a mother of one of No. 2/4C, Kalana Zone, Thudawe, Matara is suffering from a cell tumour on her left knee joint.
Consultant Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. A.B.S.A. Perera, who is treating her, has recommended a total knee replacement surgery to correct her deformity.
The process including the total knee replacement system is estimated to cost Rs. 2,900,000.
Pinsirini says she is unable to foot this bill amidst her family’s financial difficulties. She requests philanthropists and the public to assist her by sending whatever financial contributions possible to expedite the surgery.
Contributions should be remitted to account number 032200140052670 at the People’s Bank Uyanwatta branch, Matara.
Her contact number is 0776396243.
