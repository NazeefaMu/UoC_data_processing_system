Prof. Sampath Amaratunge, VC University of Sri Jayewardenepura

Prof.Sampath Amaratunge at first glance looked more like a corporate CEO than a university don and he was kind enough to give me an hour of his precious time for this interview at his office at the premises of University of Sri Jayewardenepura. He was not only a past cricketer but a cricket enthusiast as well.
Prof. Amaratunge an old Anandian started playing cricket at under 12 level, coached by the late Lionel Mendis, that team was captained by Nimal Wettimuny (one of Wettimuny brothers). At under 14 level Prof. Amaratunge played under Arjuna Ranatunga. According to Prof. Amaratunge before embarking on a match, Lionel Mendis used to draw a chalk circle on the floor with the wickets in their appropriate places and then give SR tooth paste tube caps to be set as fielders for each batsman of the opposing team. Arjuna even at that age was smart enough to set various fielders even before Lionel Mendis instructed him to do so.
Prof. Amaratunge was indebted to Lionel Mendis for teaching him good management tactics even at a tender age.
Came the ‘O’ Levels almost all them in his team failed to get through, Prof. Amaratunge was one of the few fortunate ones. Then came the ‘A’ levels and he did well and Arjuna’s mother was his class teacher and she put a stop to his cricket saying that his talent was in his studies and encouraged him to pursue that path since she knew that the bright young lad was destined to go far in the academic sphere. His last match was against St Benedict’s where he took 10 wickets, it should also be noted that Prof. Amaratunge was a tall and strong fast bowler who stood at 6’ 3”.
In 1982 he got through his ‘A’ levels and was selected to follow a degree at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The first thing that young Sampath did was to make a bee line to see the cricket ground. This he said was because cricket was in his blood. By the time he was in his third year he managed to form the inaugural cricket team at the University, those days they were not famous for sport. That team consisted of Huston Jilla (Royal College), Marzook (Zahira College), Dayaratne (Dharmasoka Ambalangoda) Shantha Rubasinghe (St Aloysius Galle), Ravi Wijegunawardena (from Horana) and Ravi Jurangapathy (from Wesley College) they all played first eleven cricket for their respective schools. At the same time he played for the under 25 team of Rio Sports Club Ambalangoda and he was the only undergraduate in that team and again bowled fast.
In the year 1986 the University of Sri Jayewardenepura became the inter-unit tournament champions beating Colombo and Moratuwa. The final was against Moratuwa and in that match Prof. Amaratunge took 5 wickets accounting for all those Sara players and they won the match. At the time the Vice Chancellor was Dr Karunasena Kodituwakku and he asked Sampath what they wanted and he said that the facilities for practicing at the university grounds was not adequate and wanted better facilities. Dr Kodituwakku was so helpful that the following day they were practicing at the NCC nets and at the adjacent net the Sri Lanka national team players were practicing. “Arjuna was very young at the time, Duleep Mendis was playing and we did get the opportunity to bowl at them.” His connections with Arjuna is strong as ever even to this day.
A unique feature of that fast bowling duo, was both were extremely tall Rubasinghe being 6’ 4” and Sampath 6’3” and the umpires were concerned because there outstretched arms went over the sight screen and most of the batsmen were baffled. He stressed the fact that his love for cricket still takes pride of place.
During his University career he was made the captain of the cricket team. The cricket team of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura became the best cricket team (1986/87) among all Universities of Sri Lanka under the leadership of Prof. Amaratunge. He was also nominated as the best player that year. Prof. Amaratunge was also a University Coloursman for three years.
He was later appointed as the president Sri Lanka University Sports Association (SLUSA) in 2008 and he continued in this post till 2009. During his time as the president of SLUSA , the Mini Olympics was organized in the premises of University of Sri Jayewardenepura inviting the Prime Minister, Minister of Sports, Minister of Higher Education and other distinguished invitees.
The Professor related to me that he was different from the other academics in that his heart was with the students and due to his genuine concern for them, together with his out of the box thinking he had no problems in executing them.
The perks given to the students who were involved in sports were as follows, tailor made meals, track kits, appropriate footwear, free vitamins, and transport during the sport seasons. All these were funded by the money allocated for such purposes by the University Grants Commission.
As a result of these Developments University of Sri Jayewardenepura was renowned for its outstanding achievements in sports. The University won the overall championship at the Inter-University Games for three consecutive years.
Furthermore Prof. Amaratunge introduced medical camps for over 350 students. By hiring outstanding coaching staff, advisors and trainers enabling talented students reach their respective peaks.
Prof. Amaratunge stated that he believed in properly harnessing the funds given for the development of the universities. He noted that it is their duty that the students of the University who are the most important stakeholders of the institution get the best that can be offered for their development; as it is them who will in turn develop the nation.
Having been unanimously selected as the Vice Chancellor for the second term, he continues to develop the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with the hope of contributing to the development of higher education in the country.
I felt nothing but admiration for Professor Sampath Amaratunge who was never afraid to spend lavishly on his deserving students whom he treated as human beings and not as morons. He touched their hearts and they reciprocated well. I went down the campus premises and could not find any posters out of place where as earlier Ja’pura was known to be splattered with posters everywhere. He has that corporate quality together with the intellect ability which stands him apart from the rest us who are also academics.
In our hour of need be it governance or Sri Lanka Cricket we badly need vibrant , honest people with integrity like Professor Sampath Amaratunge.
