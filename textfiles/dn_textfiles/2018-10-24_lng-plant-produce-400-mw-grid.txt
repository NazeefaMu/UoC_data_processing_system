LNG plant to produce 400 mw to grid

Ceylon Electricity Board Chairman W. E. B. Ganegala said the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) power plant funded by the Chinese government would contribute 400 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.
He was speaking at the Hambantota district coordinating committee meeting held at the Hambantota administration complex, presided by Ministers Sajith Premadasa and Mahinda Amaraweera, recently.
The ministers gave the approval for the project on the condition that it fulfills all environmental obligations.
Minister Premadasa said all precautions should be taken in releasing effluents to the environment and owners of houses and properties affected by the project should be compensated prior to the commencement of the project.
