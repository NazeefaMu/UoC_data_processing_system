Appointment of new SLFP office bearers by June 27

Central Province Chief Minister and Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Central Committee member Sarath Ekanayake said that new Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) office bearers would be appointed by June 27.
He also said that until then a group of new office bearers would be appointed temporarily on June 03.
He made these observations yesterday during a press conference held at the Provincial Council Complex at the Pallekelle in Kandy.
He said that a decision had been taken not to divulge the decisions reached at the Central Committee but some members who were present there only for a short period had revealed many such decisions which is wrong. He added that due to this reason a negative image has been painted on the party and government since the discussions on positive side of the government such as receiving the GSP concession, lifting the ban on fish export, getting rid of war tribunal etc did not reach the public.
