CNCI ACHIEVER Awards today at Galadari

“The CNCI Achiever Awards” event which is annually organized by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI), the premier Industrial Chamber in the country recognizes and rewards the Sri Lankan industrialists for their achievements and excellence displayed both in the manufacturing and service sectors.
In 2017, the “CNCI Achiever Awards” competition is being held for the 16th consecutive year today at Hotel Galadari. The event in total is a comprehensive process. The ‘Achiever Awards 2017’ event was launched in the month of February and the applications were closed in 31st May 2017 and then the evaluation process was soon started. The evaluation of applications basically has three stages. First is the Auditing Process. Each and every application received were scrutinized by a reputed audit firm to ensure that the financial figures presented and the general data submitted were in order. Any observations made by the Auditors had to be clarified by the applicants. Thereafter, the “internal judging” process, where the applications were evaluated by an internal panel of judges consisting of Chartered Accountants, Engineers, Management Specialists. Interviewing the contestants and company visits of short listed companies were also taken place at that state. Finally the evaluation of applications by the External Panel of Judges, which was Headed by Professor Sampath Amarathunge, Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenapura.
The evaluation was made on number of criteria encompassing Turnover, Value Addition, Productivity and Responsibilities towards employees, Growth and Future, Corporate Plans, R & D, Quality Assurance, Environmental Responsibilities, Health and Safety and Social Responsibility etc.
CNCI in its quest to make the industries globally competitive considers this contest as a tool to encourage our industrialists. Thus every year new factors are brought into the evaluation enhancing the benchmark levels. “CNCI Achiever” is a highly popular event among the industrialists mainly due to its stringent evaluation process and independent selection process of unbiased nature. For all quantifiable figures, the marks are assigned by a special computer package designed for the purpose.
One significant feature observed in this year was the largest number of applications received in the “Extra Large” category for both Government and Private sector industries. This we consider as a novel trend where some public sector industries have been confident enough to complete with the private sector industries in terms of operational excellence.
Bank of Ceylon has been the principal sponsor in this year for the event who has been sponsoring the event for the last 11 years.
Ceylinco General Insurance Ltd (sponsoring for the last nine years) and Litro Gas Lanka Ltd have been co-sponsors while ITN and Lake House have been Media Sponsors. Sampath Bank, Peoples Leasing & Finance and National Savings Bank have been event sponsors.
