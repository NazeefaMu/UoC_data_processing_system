Sudath Sampath to coach U-20, Women’s Sevens teams

Former Isipathana and Sri Lanka Sevens rugby skipper and Police SC, CR & FC and CH & FC rugby coach Sudath Sampath has been entrusted with the task of coaching the Sri Lanka Women’s national rugby Sevens as well as the Sri Lanka national Men’s Under 20 rugby Sevens teams with immediate effect.
Sampath is known to be one of the best ever Seven’s players produced by the country and came into the national rugby team in 1990 where he turned out for the Sicily Sevens in Italy at the age of 20.
Sampath who is more famously known as the ‘Little Serevi of Sri Lankan rugby’ was a complete treat to watch in full flow and can make any opposition look like mere spectators with his nippy footwork and quick breaks.
He is currently with the CH and FC team as the assistant coach and had a good season this year from the second round onwards in the Dialog inter-club league rugby tournament ending up with some spirited performances.
Sampath is a level 2 qualified rugby coach, hence is an interesting addition to the national ranks.
Meanwhile Army officer (female) W.D.P.I. Thilakawardena and ex-Thomian rugby player Jayan Goonetilake has been appointed as managers of the National women’s and Under 20 rugby teams respectively.
Nazim Mohamad, secretary of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) officially confirmed all the appointments.
