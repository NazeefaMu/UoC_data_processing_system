EU allocates €300,000 for flood victims

The European Commission yesterday announced the allocation of €300,000 for emergency assistance to communities affected by floods and landslides in Sri Lanka, a statement issued by the Delegation of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives said.
Full statement: The European Commission is allocating €300,000 (LKR 51 million approx.) in humanitarian funding to Sri Lanka to bring emergency assistance to communities affected by the recent floods.
“This contribution from the EU will allow our partners on the ground to provide relief to the most-impacted families. This is an expression of solidarity from the European people to the people of Sri Lanka,” said European Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Commissioner Christos Stylianides.
The EU-funded assistance will focus on the most pressing needs of the affected families in the immediate aftermath of the floods, including access to clean water and sanitation facilities, the provision of essential household items, as well as emergency shelter. The EU funding is being made available via the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) through its Small Scale Response mechanism. Additionally, the Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre has activated its Copernicus mapping service upon request from the World Food Programme. The Copernicus maps will focus on the Southern and Western areas of Sri Lanka that have been affected by the rains.
