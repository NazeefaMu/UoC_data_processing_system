Yala earns record income

The Wildlife Conservation Department has recorded Rs. 10 million income for the past several weeks from Yala Block 5 even though the National Park was closed from September 1 since it was undergoing development and renovation activities.
Wildlife Assistant Director for Uva Region M.H. Chitrasena said local and foreign tourists in large numbers visit Veheragala in Block 5 to view leopards.
