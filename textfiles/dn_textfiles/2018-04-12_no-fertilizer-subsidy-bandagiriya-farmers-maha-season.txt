No fertilizer subsidy for Bandagiriya farmers in Maha season

A group of 64 farmers attached to the Bandagiriya Farmers’ Association No. 3 who lost their Yala cultivation in 2017 due to restoration work on the Bandagiriya Wewa have been further inconvenienced by the alleged failure on the part of Bandagiriya Agrarian Service officials to provide their fertilizer subsidy on time for the 2017-2018 Maha season.
Farmers said although they had cultivated their lands this season and are about to harvest the crop, officials had still not provided the fertilizer subsidy due for the season.
Farmer W.A. Willington said they submitted their applications for the subsidy to the agricultural research and production officer in the area on December 12, 2017, but they had still not received the due subsidy although they are close to harvesting their crop.
They made representations to the government agent too and he promised to look into it soon, but as yet there has been no remedy. Hambantota District Agriculture Director D.C.A. Gunawardene said they discussed this problem at a meeting of the district agriculture committee and decided to forward it to the Fertilizer Secretariat. She said nearly 163 farmers were affected by this problem. She said it was up to the Agrarian Service Department to resolve the issue which is outside her ambit.
