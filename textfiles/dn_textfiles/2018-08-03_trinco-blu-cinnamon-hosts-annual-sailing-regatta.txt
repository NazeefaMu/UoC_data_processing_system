Trinco Blu by Cinnamon hosts annual sailing regatta

Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts recently joined hands with the Royal Colombo Yacht Club (RCYC) to host the 9th consecutive RCYC Sailing Regatta - the nation’s largest annual sailing event. Held recently at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon, this year’s competition featured a record number of 49 boats in action, with the island’s most seasoned crews as well as up and coming sailing enthusiasts vying for a winning spot.
Conducted off one of Sri Lanka’s most scenic beaches, between Nilaveli and Trincomalee, this year’s regatta comprised three classes of boat races - the single-handed under-15 Optimist Class, the single-handed Laser Class and the two-man Enterprise Class. Out of a total of 21 Optimists selected from the sailing squads of Royal College and St. Thomas’ College, Dhanika Nanayakkara of St Thomas’ College emerged as the winner of the junior sailing class, while Royalists Kanila Gunasekara and Anuka Samaraweera came in second and third respectively. With 21 sailors going head-to-head in the Laser Class, P.D.D.S. Rajapaksha of the Sri Lankan Navy secured first place in the category, while Navy Officers W.A. Roshil Nishantha and J.M.P.L. Jayasooriya finished in second and third place respectively. Two-man crews battled it out in the Enterprise Class, with N.G.M.U. Gunawardana and U.D. Rajapaksha winning the race, and W.M.C. Marambe and A.S.K. Soyza becoming the runners up. Recognized as the most talented sailor and winner of the entire regatta, P.D.D.S. Rajapaksha was awarded the Overall Champion Trophy by Priyantha Jayasooriya - Resident Manager of Trinco Blu by Cinnamon.
