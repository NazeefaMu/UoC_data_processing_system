Kandy SC gets a good rugby leader

Most sports, like rugby, involve more than a single player. Several players combine to form a single group and are considered a team. When you hear the word team, there has to be someone who will lead it.
Kandy Sports Club side will be led by one who learnt his rugby at Kingswood College where he excelled in the 7s and 15-a-side and started his club rugby with Kandy SC and went on to play for Sri Lanka sevens and fifteens - Gayan Weeraratne in the next season.
The newly married Gayan is a team man like his brother Roshan who led the side to win the league and knockouts last season.
He played for Kingswood College from 2005 to 2007. He had the privilege of leading the Sri Lanka Under-19 at the junior Rugby Asiad.
A lot should be heard of Gayan as he tries to emulate the feats of his brother this coming season.
