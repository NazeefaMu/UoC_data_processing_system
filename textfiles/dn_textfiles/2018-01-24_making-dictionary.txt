On making a  Dictionary

Have our readers ever heard of Simon Cassie Chetty (1807-1860)? Possibly not because he belonged to the 19th century, He was a Lankan belonging to what we call the Colombo Chetties originally from the Puttalam District. Their ancestors, like many of our ancestors, hailed from Southern India. But he was a pioneer in many fields contributing to varied aspects of literature.
We learn from Prof S Thillainaathan that this scholar was a linguist having known Sanskrit, Sinhala, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, and Dutch besides English and Tamil.
Gnanam Balachandran, a young independent researcher has codified different strings relating to the attempts made of making Dictionaries undertaken by Simon Cassie Chetty. Balachandran gave a speech on the subject at the Kolumbu Tamil Sangam two years ago and that is now available in a book of 52 pages priced at Rs 200. His father T Gnanasekeran edits a literary magazine called Gnanam. He in his foreword says:
“Cassie Chetti was engaged in compiling dictionaries relating to medicine, books in Tamil, bilingual writing and on, borrowed words and classical words”
The book is in Tamil and titled “Saimon Cassie Chttyin Akaraathi Muyarchikal” - Attempts at compiling Dictionary Simon Cassie Chetty.
Here are some main points from the book to persuade you to do your own research on Simon Cassie Chetty as a pioneer Lankan, who brought fame to this country,
u He was born on March 21, 1807, in Kalpiddy in Puttalam district.His father’s name was Gabriel Cheddi. He joined the Public Service as a translator and later admitted to the Administration Service. He was the first Lankan to be admitted as such an officer and the first Lankan District Judge to be appointed.
u He was also the first Lankan to have written a book in English. He was the author of the “Ceylon Gazetteer” in 1834. He was also the author of Tamil Plutarch
uAn excerpt from the foreword written by him for Ceylon Gazetter is as follows:
“Before I conclude my prefatory remarks, I feel it necessary to entreat the indulgent public generously to make every allowance for any faults in composition which may appear in the following work: for I am sensible that I cannot stand the test of criticism, particularly as it regards, a knowledge of which language I possess very imperfectly; but as I have never received any systematic education, I trust it will improve. An apology for all errors”
u Simon Cassie Chetty compiled a Medical Dictionary called Malaiyaha Aharaathi.
u His essay written in 1849 was titled “An Outline of Natural History”. This was published in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol ii, No 5.
uHe died on May 11, 1807,
Gnanam Balachandran should be encouraged for his attempt to place the pioneers who have contributed to the evolution of Lankan Tamil Literature in a larger context of Tamil Studies. He can be contacted on 2586013.
