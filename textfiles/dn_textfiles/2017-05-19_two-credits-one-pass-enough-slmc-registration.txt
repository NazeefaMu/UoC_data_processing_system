Two Credits, one Pass enough for SLMC registration

The minimum basic educational qualification required to register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) as a MBBS doctor in Sri Lanka is to have passed the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination with two Credit (C) passes and one Simple (S) pass in the Science Stream or have equal qualifications.
SLMC Vice President Prof. Nilanthi De Silva said that even though a medical degree holder possesses all the required standards of education, clinical training etc he/she must have basic minimum educational qualifications mentioned above to receive SLMC registration.
Addressing a press conference held at the SLMC Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka said that in the United States, the third commonest reason for death is medical error and in 2013, a total of 240,000 US citizens died due to medical errors. Even in 1875, Sri Lankan doctors were allowed to practice anywhere in the United Kingdom and this high standard has been followed by Sri Lankan doctors since then.
“The SLMC was established by Medical Council Ordinance Number 24 of 1924 (an Act passed in the Sri Lanka Parliament) and the main task of the Council is protecting patients’ rights, especially their right to life. Therefore, standards in medical education is a must to protect patients’lives,” SLMC sources said.
