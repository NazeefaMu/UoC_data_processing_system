France claim first win in nine months by beating Argentina

LILLE, France, Saturday: France claimed their first victory in nine months by beating Argentina 28-13 as Teddy Thomas scored twice on Saturday, less than a year from the teams’ meeting at next year’s World Cup.
Guilhem Guirado also crossed for the home side in Lille as Jacques Brunel’s men sealed a much-needed confidence boost as well as a psychological edge ahead of the pool-stage fixture in the sport’s showpiece event in Japan in September.
Despite a positive start for the Pumas with Ramiro Moyano touching down after less than two minutes, the hosts fought back for a first win since March’s Six Nations victory over England.
Moyano’s try came after a superb Jeronimo de la Fuente off-load and the winger ran in untouched from more than 50 metres.
Baptiste Serin claimed the home side’s first points with a penalty goal after seven minutes. Nicolas Sanchez then added one of his own.
Thomas’ first try came as Yoann Huget, playing his first Test in a year, broke the Argentinian line following tidy set-piece play and the Racing 92 winger dotted the ball down in the corner unopposed.
France’s scrum was solid throughout and the they took the lead for the first time after 33 minutes as the Pumas’ 22-year old tight-head prop Santiago Medrano was penalised and Serin added the three points for a 11-10 advantage which held until the half-time whistle.
The Pumas started the second half the better and Sanchez added a second penalty goal to regain the lead for his side.
The rest of the half belonged to the home team, mainly through fine playmaking by Gael Fickou who transferred his good club form onto the international stage. – AFP
