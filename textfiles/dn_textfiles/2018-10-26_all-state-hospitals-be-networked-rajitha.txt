All state hospitals to be networked - Rajitha

All state hospitals will be computerized and networked by next year (2019) and the eHealth card will be introduced for all Sri Lanka citizens, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, once the computerization process is complete, the free health service can be offered to all citizens without any difference.
He was addressing the fourth Industrial Revolution and Healthcare Conference at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said that by next year a gene technology laboratory will be set up in Sri Lanka. About 40 percent of the total population of Sri Lanka has gene differences. According to gene technology based medical science, different methods of treatment are used for the same disease based on the specific patient’s genes.
“When I took over the Health Ministry, there was a shortage of 44 to 75 drugs and 10 percent wastage. A new computer software was introduced to prevent this situation. Now, there is no drug shortage or wastage. The Health Ministry now saves money and uses the savings to provide free eye lenses, heart stents etc. This is how modern technology has been used for the well being of the people,” Minister Senaratne added.
