Sweet addiction

It comes in a white, crystalline form and gives us a pleasurable high – but refined sugar is as habit-forming as cocaine or nicotine. According to a review in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, animal studies show that lab rats will switch from cocaine to sucrose in the twitch of a tail.
Sugar makes us obese, can promote the development of type 2 diabetes, raises our blood pressure and gives us fatty livers. But it also alters our mood, making us feel rewarded and euphoric.
The lead author of the review, James DiNicolantonio at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute, says that, unlike salt, sugar has no “aversion signal”. “Salt taste receptors will ‘flip’ when you’ve had too much, but this doesn’t happen with sugar – so we have a built-in safety mechanism that protects us from over consuming salt but not sugar,” he says. “People can eat an entire bag of cookies or endless bars of chocolate and still want more.”
DiNicolantonio argues that refined sugars can produce bingeing and cravings – indicative of an addictive substance. And then there’s withdrawal. He says: “Withdrawal symptoms from sugar come from dopamine deficiency in the brain. This may lead to symptoms such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and it may even create a similar state in the brain as found in patients with depression.”
There is some evidence of genetic differences in our response to sugar because we all perceive sweetness differently. But, overall, the review says, refined sugar gives us one of the most intense sensory pleasures of modern life.
