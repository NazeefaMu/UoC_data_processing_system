The keynote address will be given by Chief Guest, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera whilst the Guest of Honour would be Minister of Plantation Industries Naveen Dissanayake, in the presence of Ministers, Parliamentarians, and heads of stakeholders associations of the tea industry.
SLTFOA established in 1990 has a membership exceeding 300 members spread out in Galle, Matara, Ratnapura, Balangoda and Kandy and Gampola Districts.

The SLTFOA business matters are administered by a General Committee which meets monthly. The members of this Committee are elected annually, District wise at the Annual General Meeting.
The Primary Objective of SLTFOA, which is a nonpolitical independent body, is to promote, foster and protect the tea industry.
The industry is catered mainly by the tea smallholder farmers who are responsible in producing approximately 72% of the national tea production, the largest volume of tea which is consumed by millions world over as 'Ceylon Tea'.
The members of the Association cater almost exclusively to the tea smallholder population in manufacturing their green leaf and providing services such as advisory and extension, supply of input materials as fertilizer, their welfare etc., including loans and cash advances on the supply of green leaf.
The Association is proud to be serving today’s estimated extent of smallholdings, which is around 122,000 hectares, contributed by about 400,000 people directly or indirectly employed and has further plans to rake in all private factories countrywide under its umbrella to improve and serve smallholders more efficiently.
The Chairman of the Association or his nominee is the member in the Boards of Sri Lanka Tea Board, National Institute of Plantation Management, Tea Small Holdings Authority, Tea Research Board, and Employers Federation of Ceylon.
The Association holds the status of an affiliated position in The Colombo Tea Traders Association.
This year’s Annual General Meeting would go down the history and would be one of the most memorable events as Sri Lanka celebrates its 150 years in Tea Production.
