Pochettino foresees golden future in Spurs’ new home

London, SUNDAY: Mauricio Pochettino described Tottenham Hotspur’s final day at White Hart Lane as “perfect”, but said moving into their new stadium would take the club to the next level.
Local hero Harry Kane scored the decisive goal as Tottenham beat Manchester United 2-1 on Sunday in their last game at the Lane, which is due to be demolished and rebuilt in time for the 2018-19 season.
The game was followed by a pitch invasion and then a ceremony involving Spurs greats from yesteryear, a rainbow breaking through the clouds with perfect timing as a shower of white tickertape brought the festivities to a close. “I think for me the most special day will always be the last day at White Hart Lane,” Spurs manager Pochettino said. “For me it was a very exciting day because I think it was perfect. The preparation of the game, the game, we played well and we got the three points.
“And at the end the ceremony was fantastic to share with all the legends, the people, the staff, the fans, the family.”
Pochettino’s side will play at Wembley next season before returning to their new 61,559-seater stadium, which is already taking shape beside the Lane. Spurs have twice come close to the Premier League title in the last two seasons, losing out to Leicester City last season and Chelsea this. But despite admitting to feeling “sad and disappointed” about Spurs’ latest brush with glory, Pochettino believes even brighter days lie ahead. “We were talking a lot. We believe that when the new stadium opens the door, it will help the club to reach the last level,” said the Argentine.
“That is our expectation. That is our idea. The facilities, the training ground, the new facilities with the new stadium will put the team and the club in the last level in Europe.” It was Spurs’ 14th successive home league win -- equalling the club record, set over two seasons in 1987 -- and confirmed they will end the season in second place, their highest placing since a runners-up finish in 1963. United, meanwhile, are now assured of finishing outside the top four, meaning they must beat Ajax in the Europa League final in Stockholm on May 24 to secure a place in the Champions League. AFP
