Reduced rates for Lankans at Chennai fertility centre

A branch of ARC International Fertility and Research Centre, which offers concessionary rates and facilities to Sri Lankans, will be opened in Chennai, India on November 1.
Tamil Nadu Governor Dr. K. Rassaiah will be the Chief Guest while Deputy High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to Chennai V. Krishnamoorthy will be the Guest of Honour. The medical facility which offers Advanced Fertility and Surrogacy treatments is managed by Dr. Saravanan Lakshmanan.
The hospital chain is planning to establish centres in Sri Lanka which can carry out preliminary investigations on a client and direct them to seek specialized treatment at hospitals in India.
According to Dr. Lakshmanan, the hospital will provide internationally acclaimed services to Sri Lankan's at highly competitive rates which can be even lower than rates at Sri Lankan hospitals. Also the hospital is planning to provide free accommodation to a patient's family while seeking treatment in India. The medical facility has a variety of fertility treatments which include IUI, IVF, Green IVF, ICSI, Assisted Hatching, Pre-Genetic Diagnosis, TESE, Donor and Surrogacy programmes.
