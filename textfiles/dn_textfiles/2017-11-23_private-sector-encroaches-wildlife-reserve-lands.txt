Private sector encroaches wildlife reserve lands

A large extent of land in the Hambantota district allocated for wild elephant management reserves, have been encroached by the State and the private sector for various cultivations and setting up of houses.
The Malaara and Thammanawa Wewa reserves have also been encroached by these sectors. According to the wildlife officials, the residents of the vicinity said that illicit felling and poaching of wild animals, clearing of forest lands also go unabated. The residents of other parts of the Hambantota district said this situation has paved the way for wild elephants to arrive at villages close by and destroy houses and cultivations.
When queried, Southern Region Wildlife Director Prasantha Wimaladasa said that as a result of the clearing of forest reserves by the private sector at alarming proportions, lives of villagers are in danger and steps would be taken to nab the culprits who perform these unruly acts.
