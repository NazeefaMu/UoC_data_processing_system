Trinity College OBA Dinner Dance

An evening renowned for glamour and prestige, the 107th Annual Dinner Dance of the Trinity College Old Boys' Association (Colombo branch) will be held at Hilton Colombo on Saturday, October 3.
A celebration of brotherhood which binds all Trinitians together as one family, is aptly named the 'Lion's Roar' reflecting the rich heritage Trinity is synonymous with.
An opportune to reminisce the fond memories of the days spent at 'the best school of all', this will undoubtedly build a platform for all old Trinitians to forge and renew acquaintances in the spirit of fellowship.
Promising a night of festivity, the popular tunes of Misty and Doctor will keep all participants on their toes till the break of dawn.
In line with tradition, this year's edition of Lions' Roar too is expected to be an astounding success, which will aid in raising funds for the Trinity College Old Boys' Association (Colombo branch).
