Balangoda accident
Bus driver further remanded

The driver of an office staff transport bus who ran over two students on their way to sit for the G.C.E. O/L exams was further remanded by the Balangoda Magistrate yesterday.
The bus was plying from Balangoda to Ratnapura when it knocked down the two students on the white crossing in the Ellepola area on the Badulla-Colombo main road on Monday.
One critically injured student is at the ICU of the Balangoda Base Hospital and the other was transferred to the Colombo National Hospital from the Ratnapura Teaching hospital, Balangoda police said.
They were identified as students of the Gavaranhena Vidayalaya in Balangoda.
The two female students on their way to the examination centre had spotted their teacher and stopped to receive her blessings prior to the examination. Thereafter, they had walked on to the pedestrian crossing to get to the examination centre when the accident took place, police said.
The General Manager of the Sabaragamuwa Province Road Passenger Transport Authority said the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council had stipulated that office staff transporting services, three-wheelers and schoolchildren transporting services be strictly regulated.
School transport vehicles and three wheelers were already registered and regulated and office staff transport services too would be registered and regulated from next year, he said.
