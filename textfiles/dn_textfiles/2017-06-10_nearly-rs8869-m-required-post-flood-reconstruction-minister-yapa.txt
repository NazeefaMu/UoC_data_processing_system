Nearly Rs.8,869 m required for post-flood reconstruction: Minister Yapa

Nearly Rs.8,869 million is required to rectify the damages caused by the recent catastrophic floods and landslides, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said yesterday.
He said this amount can be recovered from the insurance trust fund due the Insurance Policy that the government has taken covering all the people and the houses in the country.
The Minister made these observations yesterday in response to a query raised by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) MP Sunil Handunnetti. The Minister was responding to the Adjournment motion.
“You have said that Rs.8 billion is needed to rectify the damages caused by the floods. But, we need to know if the Insurance Trust Fund is paying this amount.
There is a notion that the it would not be possible to obtain this amount from the insurance fund as the government has failed to pay the premium” MP Handunnetti said.
Minister Yapa said that the full amount or more would be obtained from the insurance trust fund. “We have already received an advance of Rs.150 million,”the Minister said. “On the other hand last year we got Rs 3.135 billion to provide relief and construct the houses for the people who were affected by flood and landslides last year.”
