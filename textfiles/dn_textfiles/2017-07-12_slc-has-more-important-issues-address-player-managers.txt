SLC has more important issues to address than player managers

Sri Lanka’s first ever loss of an One-Day International series to lowly ranked Zimbabwe was another nail in the coffin for the current Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) administration headed by Thilanga Sumathipala. Since they were elected to office on January 3 2016, the country’s cricket has been on the down grade and unless some drastic changes are made we will end up like the West Indies or Zimbabwe.
The only silver lining of the current administration is the 3-0 whitewash that Sri Lanka handed out to the Aussies in August last year, but the dismal performances that has followed the national team since then puts into perspective whether that win was a fluke.
The defeat at the hands of a team like Zimbabwe who are ranked even below Afghanistan brings into question the policies adopted by Sri Lanka Cricket whether they are going the right way forward.
A lot has been spoken of the development plans and strategies they have put in place but nothing seems to have worked as the national team which is the pride of the nation continues to slip, stumble and fall at every stride. The team’s current ranking tells a story in itself – 7th in Tests, 8th in ODIs and 8th in T20Is. It is the worst record for a national team under any cricket administration in this country.
The defeat against Zimbabwe comes closely on the heels of the last home series against Bangladesh where Sri Lanka lost their first ever Test match to them and managed only a draw in the Test, ODI and T20I series.
To add to the woes of the team they have lost a top coach in Graham Ford prior the Zimbabwe series and are saddled with Nic Pothas who was initially brought in as fielding coach but after Ford’s departure elevated to the position of interim head coach for the Zimbabwe and upcoming Indian series.
As Ford once said there are no quick fixes to a team in transition and one cannot see Pothas waving a magic wand to make things happen suddenly in Sri Lanka’s favour during the Indian series.
The series especially the five ODIs is important from Sri Lanka’s perspective because they are precariously placed in eighth position and cannot afford to go below that slot or they will have to qualify for the next cricket World Cup in 2019.
On current form following the loss to Zimbabwe beating third ranked India who were the finalists at the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy seems an uphill task for Sri Lanka. India are coming to Sri Lanka fresh after a 3-1 win over West Indies in the Caribbean and will be looking to avenge their stunning seven-wicket loss in the Champions Trophy group game.
Sri Lanka Cricket is answerable for the plight of the country’s cricket at present and instead of indulging in some less important issues like player managers they should first try to address the current situation at hand and put the national cricket team on a winning track.
As reported in a Sunday newspaper the player manager issue was first sparked off on social media and it has been blown totally out of proportion. Although SLC cannot turn a blind eye on such accusations like player managers trying to manipulate team selections and so forth and it needs to be investigated whether such accusations are true, the need of the hour is not that, but to get the national team up and running before such issues are addressed.
As we pointed out last week social media has the good, bad and the ugly side of it. It’s good - when it informs of what is happening around you, bad - when people try to use it for individual gains and, ugly - when the personal lives of individuals are intruded.
A report on social media states that the Sports Minister has called for a report on private managers hired by national players. Why the Sports Minister should get involved in such issues is quite baffling. When there is a national body for the sport like Sri Lanka Cricket he should leave it for them to initiate an inquiry into it rather than get himself involved in such issues unnecessarily.
The main problem with Sri Lankan sports today is that everyone tries to jump onto the bandwagon and have his or her say and, rather than provide a solution to the problem at hand only aggravate it. That is one reason why we are down in the dumps in sports. When will we ever learn or learn at all?
