PM TELLS PARLIAMENTARY GROUP
UNP revamp after NCM

The United National Party (UNP) will undergo a major revamp after the no-confidence motion, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister stated that party responsibilities would be handed over to a new team and he would take necessary steps to bring about the changes needed, to put forward a strong team for the next Provincial Council and other upcoming elections.
Addressing the UNP Parliamentary group yesterday, he said working committee members and all UNP parliamentarians are invited to meet on April 6 and 7 to discuss on the complete transformation of the party which had not happened in recent times. He said the term of office of all UNP office bearers will expire on April 30.
State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva told the media at Sirikotha yesterday that the UNP was confident of defeating the no-confidence motion moved by the Joint Opposition (JO) against the Prime Minister.
“UNP is not a party owned by a family. So a revamp of the party will be done in a democratic and a transparent manner,” the State Minister said.Dr. de Silva said many recommendations have come through the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee. The committee has recommended many changes in the party constitution and hope to discuss these recommendations during a special meeting of the UNP Working Committee and the UNP Parliamentary Group scheduled to be held on April 6 and 7.
A statement released by the UNP said that they would finalise decisions on the party reform process during the above meeting and a committee would be appointed to monitor the progress of their implementation.
The Prime Minister will hold discussions with the Party Chairman, General Secretary and Treasurer with regard to the process of appointing the committee and thereafter communicate their decision to the UNP Parliamentary Group.
“If those constitutional changes are required we are looking to make changes to the UNP constitution,”he added.
UNP Puttalam district MP Hector Appuhamy said MPs who criticise the government holding ministerial posts should resign.
