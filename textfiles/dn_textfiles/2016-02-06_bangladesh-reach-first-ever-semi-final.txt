Bangladesh reach first-ever semi-final

Host Bangladesh defeated a valiant Nepal by six wickets after a tense run-chase to storm into the semi-finals of the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2016 on Friday, giving the nation its maiden appearance in the last four of a world event. Skipper Mehidy Hasan and Zakir Hasan hit unbeaten half-centuries as Bangladesh recovered from early setbacks to surpass Nepal's 211 for nine with 10 balls to spare in Mirpur. Bangladesh, mentored by former Australia international Stuart Law, was made to fight hard for runs as Nepal's bowlers conceded just 21 runs in the first 10 overs. Bangladesh faces the winner of Monday's quarter-final between Pakistan and the West Indies in the second semi-final at Mirpur on 11 February. The first semi-final on 9 February in Mirpur will feature the winners of quarter-final matches between India-Namibia and England-Sri Lanka. In the Plate Championship quarter-finals, Afghanistan trumped Fiji by 226 runs after opener Karim Janat smashed 156 off 132 balls with 12 boundaries and six sixes. Afghanistan piled up 340 for nine after being sent into bat and Fiji was shot out for 114 in reply.A fine all-round performance by Jeremy Ives helped Zimbabwe defeat Canada by six wickets in another Plate quarter-final in Cox's Bazar.
