Implementation of Land Development Ordinance of 1935 in major irrigation settlement schemes: Land laws & woes

The State aided peasant settlement has a considerable history in Sri Lanka, the earliest experiments in the later period being in the latter parts of the 19th century. However, it became fully accepted policy only in the 1930s, after the granting of universal suffrage and the limited government under the Donoughmore Commission of 1931. This became a popular rural development strategy during the pre and post Independence eras, in terms of State interventions on land and irrigation infrastructure development.
The land alienation which ultimately led to creation of human settlements was done under different types of schemes such as major settlement schemes, village expansion schemes, highland settlement schemes, middle class schemes, youth settlement schemes and regularization of encroachments. Among the various types of settlements ‘major settlement schemes’ known as ‘irrigated settlements’ or ‘major colonization’ were subjected to more debate than other schemes, due to their contribution to society and economy of the country.
The initial objectives expected to be achieved from major settlement schemes through the Land Development Ordinance of 1935 were (a) protecting peasant farmers as a group (b) alleviating land hunger among the poorest of the poor (c) relieving population pressure of the villagers in the wet zone of the country, (d) increasing food production particularly paddy (e) developing the scarcely populated dry zone. Some of the more recent objectives were (a) generating hydro power (b) promoting industries and (c) promoting exports.
This article draws partly on the evaluation of the findings of various socio-economic and agrarian studies conducted by researchers and recognized research institutions such as Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute on such topics as Land policy, fragmentation, encroachment on State land, informal land transactions and profitability of irrigated paddy sector, in the context of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO) of 1935 within the sphere of major irrigation settlement schemes.
A brief overview
The tenure under the Land Development Ordinance at the beginning provided for the lease of State land to an allottee in perpetuity on a restricted tenure.
The allottee could not fragment the land, mortgage the land or dispose of it without Government Agent’s permission. The tenure was liable to cancellation for any default. The allottee’s land was therefore a protected holding which could not be mortgaged, leased or sold or cannot be seized by a Court of Law.
The first major amendment to the LDO was made in 1969 by the Land Development (Amendment) Act of 1969. The main purpose of the Amending legislation in 1969 was to confer the ownership of the allotment alienated under LDO to the allottee. Under the LDO of 1935 the allottee held his allotment under an entailed lease perpetuity.
Under the provisions of the LDO as amended, alienation under the Ordinance has been effected in three stages instead of in two stages as at earlier. On selection at a Land Kachcheri every allottee is in the first instance be entitled to receive a permit authorizing him to occupy the land. With this permit he is required to pay an annual rent which is a nominal sum.
He is required to develop his allotment during this period under close government supervision. These conditions require an allottee to pay to the Government a prescribed amount in annual installment – instead of rent for a specified period. In fixing this scale of payment the government takes account of the improvements effected to the land with the assistance of the State.
When the permit holder has duly paid all these instalment he is entitled to receive a grant of his allotment.
The grantee is able to freely dispose of his allotment without the consent of the Government. However, The LDO requires peasant holder to obtain the prior consent of the Government Agent before disposal. The restriction has been designed to prevent the passing of land intended for the peasantry to the richer classes or high income groups. The owner of a holding may also not lease his holding except in such circumstances as may be prescribed.
The holder of a grant may not mortgage his holding to any person other than the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Corporation of Ceylon or People’s Bank or the Ceylon State Mortgage Bank or a Registered Co-operative society or other prescribed institutions. Amendments have been made to the Agricultural and Industrial Credit Co-operation Ordinance and the People’s Bank Act No.29 of 1961 to enable those institution to lend money to owners of holdings alienated under the Land Development Ordinance.
The provisions in the Amended procedure ensure that in future no person may be nominated as the successor by the owner of a holding or a permit holder unless that person is the spouse of such owner or permit holder or belongs to one of the groups of relatives enumerated in the Ordinance. This restriction has been imposed with a view to creating something in the nature of an entailed and preserving the allotment as far as possible in the family.
A permit holder is now given the right of nominating more than one successor provided that such nomination does not contravene the conditions of his permit with regard to fragmentation. A nomination made by the permit holder who on the date of making such nomination was unmarried, will upon marriage of such permit holder, be null and void.
This provision has been introduced to meet the cases of hardship caused to permit holders and owners who have forgotton to change their nominations on marriage.
Hitherto the right of a nominated successor to succeed to land held on a permit or grant was given precedence over all others including the spouse of the deceased permit holder or owner.
Under the Amended legislation, the surviving spouse is given the right of immediate succession in every case. The nominated successor is only entitled to succeed on the failure of such spouse to succeed or on the re-marriage or death of such a spouse. Where a spouse succeeds by operation of law, such spouse will have no power to dispose of the land or to nominate a successor thereto. A spouse who succeeds as nominated successor however, will succeed to all the rights of the deceased permit holder or owner like any other nominated successor. A spouse who succeeded otherwise than as a nominated successor will lose his or her right on the land on re-marriage.
Discrimination against female spouses who succeed to land under the LDO is found both in the legislative scheme for succession and according to the findings of empirical research in the practice of the LDO. The situation of surviving spouses being deprived of their full legal rights to succeed to State land also appears to be the result of an unfortunate combination of unnecessarily complex legislation, incomplete erroneous transferring of such legislation into guidance for officials and selective implementation even of such guidance as revealed in the empirical studies. Where there has been a breach of the conditions of a permit, State authorities are empowered to impose a fine in the first instance. The cancellation of the permit will only be resorted to where the permit holder fails to pay the fine or where there is further contravention of the conditions of the permit.
The time given to a permit holder to show cause has also been extended. The State authorities can institute proceedings against any person who encroaches on land which has been alienated and for the punishment and summary removal of such encroachers. There was no legal bar earlier to the alienation of land under the Ordinance to a non- citizen although in practice alienation has been confined in the vast majority of cases to Sri Lankans.
The LDO as amended ensures that no State land shall be alienated to any person other than citizens of Sri Lanka and declaring that any alienation made in contravention of this provision shall be invalid. The Ordinance amended also provides that selection may be made only from such class of persons as may be prescribed.
Land policy
The Land Commission of 1927 appointed by the then Governor, Sir Hugh Clifford, which highlighted the harsh consequences caused by the Crown Land Encroachment Ordinance of 1840 and Wasteland Ordinance of 1897 recommended, (a) the planning of peasant settlement scheme (b) formulation of policies for mapping- out land, land tenure, land alienation, disposition and succession and related aspects.
The Land Commission of 1927 also declared that State land must be held by the government in trust, for the whole people inhabiting the country and the State land should be allocated according to the interests of the community. This declaration in the Land Commission of 1927 created the precedence for the subsequent attempts at establishing major settlement schemes, then known as ‘colonization schemes’ in the Dry zone under the concept ‘peasant propertorship’. In order to give effect to the above purposes, the Land Development Ordinance No.19 of 1935 (LDO) was enacted.
One important provision of the LDO is related to tenure. The Ordinance provides a method of alienating State land on a restricted tenure.
The intent of these conditions was to protect the newly settled farmers from a loss of their land to more resourceful interests which might purchase such lands or obtain it through many lending activities which really have occurred. The LDO backed by the Land Commission of 1927 placed the preservation of peasantry the first and the foremost obligation. The type of tenure, which defines the user rights determines the household behaviour indicating the level of investing, productivity improvement and resources conservation, technical use, returns and income from the land.
The nature of economic activities conducted on holdings, returns increased and the level of household consumption costs and cash savings may be more important considerations for the settler as an investor, in determining economic improvements than security. Yet from the view point of utilization of a public resources, the relationship of settler economic activities with the legal tenure of settlement warrants a deeper investigation particular when viewed against the longstanding policy expectation of a prosperous settler multitude a higher contribution to the domestic food supply through settler endeavours and conservation of land resources for future users of the nation.
As correctly stated by the Land Commission of 1987, the key terms of State land and alienation summarized to a large extent the entire field of land policy in Sri Lanka not only during the colonial period but also during the independent era.
As it also correctly appeared to the Land Commission of 1987, the emphasis had somewhat shifted away from ‘State ownership to State trust.’ Therefore the Land Commission of 1987made it clear that any government would therefore be falling short of its duty if it neglects such a trust.
As the Land Commission of 1987 noted, the policy of state aided colonization and alienation of land under village expansion, highland settlements, middle – class schemes made significant progress since national independence.
In spite of certain positive aspects like such as peasant settlement and village expansion in unoccupied lands under State ownership, there were also more negative aspects such as the widespread problems of landlessness, large scale encroachment of State land and the restrictive nature of land market.
Although the settler should have holdings of similar size, with equal subsidies and institutional facilities, economic and social differentiation began to take place once production had begun.
The idea of creating a homogenous class of contended peasantry remain therefore unfulfilled. Thus, although disposal and fragmentation of land were prohibited by law, de facto transfer and parcelization of allotments cannot be prevented. As a result of this polurlazation process, the unequal agrarian structure began to appear in the major settlement schemes after the establishment.
As the economic development of the country on modern lines proceeds, the conditions to which peasant had been accustomed for generations are radically altered often in the pace of few years.
Naturally conservative and often inprovident, the peasant is slow to adopt himself to the new economic environment which has come into existence around while he has proved himself in many cases only too ready to part with his land. In these circumstances, unless special steps are taken for his protection, there is serious danger of this class going to a worse position. As a change under which the mass of peasant becomes landless labour class is prejudicial to the interest of the whole community, it is necessary to consider whether means cannot be devised to check this process and preserve peasant as a small land owner till such time he become stronger to meet the challenges of polarlization process. Accordingly following conclusions can be made.
