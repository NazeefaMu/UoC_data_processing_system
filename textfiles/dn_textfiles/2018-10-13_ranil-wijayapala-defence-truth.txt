Ranil Wijayapala: In Defence of the Truth

A tribute to senior Sunday Observer journalist Ranil Wijayapala who passed away one year ago.
Every time I go to the Sunday Observer, I cannot help looking at the corner where Ranil Wijayapala used to pound away at his keyboard, editing a copy or writing one of his trademark defence stories. I can almost hear him say “Good Morning, Aiya” with a radiant smile on his face. Yes, it is hard to imagine that he left us exactly one year ago.
I had the rare fortune of working with Ranil in both the Sunday Observer and the Daily News, where both of us began our respective journalistic careers. Now that I am back again in the Daily News, I can still remember the day in February 1997 when he first walked into the editorial room. The one thing I won’t forget is the smile on his face as someone made the introductions.
Ranil was a fast learner. He had a yearning for learning new things in a profession where one never ceases to learn. If he made a mistake in reporting or in a copy, he made sure never to repeat it. From novice reporter to Defence Correspondent to News Editor, he literally made his mark in journalism during a life cruelly cut short. Above all, he feared no challenge in journalism – and in life itself. It was this fearlessness that enabled him to battle the greatest challenge in life. He may have lost this battle, but by living on in others’ hearts, he has surpassed the impermanence of life. He had a good heart and a zest for life, which is why everyone here in Lake House just cannot believe he is gone forever from our midst. He will be remembered as a fine human being first and as a brilliant journalist second.
During a journalistic career spanning over two decades, he covered many beats including Parliament, politics, crime, education and health. But his specialty was defence.
Thrust into journalism at the height of the conflict, he earned a name as a brilliant defence correspondent for both the Daily News and the Sunday Observer. His weekly defence column with up-to-the-minute analysis in the Daily News was eagerly awaited not only by the general readership but also by the defence establishment and foreign observers.
He was no armchair analyst – he walked the talk, reporting from all the major battles of the Eelam War until the final battle at Nandikadal. Indeed, Ranil could have obtained defence news over the telephone as most others did, but that cozy life was not for him. He wanted to be in the thick of the action, reporting from the battlefield as bullets and mortars whizzed past. He was also a versatile feature writer on many topics of current interest.
He joined the Sunday Observer in 2009. While working as a senior reporter of the Sunday Observer, he was appointed News Editor and held that position until his untimely demise. He had a remarkable nose for news and guided colleagues and reporters to produce exclusive stories.
Ranil was a man of peace, so when he expressed a desire to cover the war for the Daily News, I was a bit surprised. But I realised that underneath that serene outlook was a man who had nerves of steel. For the next 12 years or so, Ranil would cover the conflict extensively. Having seen the horrors of war first hand, Ranil did not rejoice in it or glorify it.
He has told me on more than one occasion that he wanted the war to end soon and peace to return. Luckily, this was achieved in his lifetime and despite his perceived penchant for war reporting, he was happy that it was over.
Ranil lived his life to the fullest with his wife Sriyani and two sons Uvindu and Dinidu by his side. Ranil personified courage, commitment, bravery and a search for truth as a journalist and as a human being. His was a short but eventful, even adventurous life that had no place for regrets and no place for sadness.
A Bana Sermon will be held at his Kaduwela residence today in his memory, followed by a Sanghika Dana tomorrow.
