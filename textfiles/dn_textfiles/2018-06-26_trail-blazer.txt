Trail Blazer

Sri Lankan born Councillor Kairul Kareema Marikar was recently elected as the Mayor of Harrow Council from the West Harrowward, Labour Party. She is the first Sri Lankan to hold such a post. Having worked her way up, Marikar in a telephone interview with Daily News said no challenge was too difficult for a determined woman and that the basic rule of politics everywhere is to understand the ‘plight of the common man’.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Could you please give us a few highlights of your journey from working as a Food and Beverage Manger at Queen’s Hotel in Kandy to Harrow Council in London in 2010?
A. I studied at Girls’ High School Kandy and went into catering as I lost a few marks to enter university. So I did hotel management and worked at Renuka Hotel as the House Keeping Manager and then at Queen’s Hotel as the Food and Beverage Manager. At the time I got a scholarship to Switzerland but I could not go because my mother did not approve. I was a woman and alone, she said. Unfortunately it shouldn’t have happened, but I was the youngest and it happened.
Kareema as Mayor.
I got married through a proposal and moved to London in 1990. My marriage was not successful and I suffered through domestic violence. Because my mother selected him, she felt guilty. But I never wanted to show my sadness to the family and my mother’s guidance was there for my three children. I do not regret my divorce.
I wanted a divorce when I just had only my daughter, but then the family did not approve of divorce and things and I had to go back to him. Finally, it came to a stage where I could no longer live with him, he thought with three children I would be scared to leave him, but I was actually happy to leave him. Then I did.
After my divorce I did many jobs, even worked at customer sales at Sainsbury (supermarket) and started studying nursing and mental health. At one point I even worked at the House of Commons Kitchens. It was then that in 2003, I bumped into my local MP, Harrow West MP Garret Thomas, I told him I had personal issues to discuss.
He asked me about many things about Sri Lanka, because I knew a lot about it and then he said why don’t you join the labour party? I took little steps, at the grassroots, planning of elections, etc… from that day in 2003, after my divorce, I worked with the party, then they put me to contest a ward and I won it.
There was another Sri Lankan Muslim man in another ward and he told my aunty that he could not believe that I won. This is the mentality of our people.
Then I contested a second term. I want to do some good here.
Q: Do you still work in mental health?
A. Yes, I still work as a mental health nurse. I balance my roster and when I am free, I work.
By 1995 my son was born, and I wanted to learn about healthcare to nurse my children and then I got interested in it and by 2010, I was fully qualified as a mental health professional.
Q: How was it getting into politics? Did you take to it naturally?
A. I am a peoples’ person. My father and uncle were politically involved, my brother is still a councillor in Kandy. We have that capability. I have won the hearts of my constituents. My ward was a Conservative ward but I made it Labour.
Q: How did you turn it to Labour from Conservative?
A. Thrice a week, I went from house to house getting to know the people in the ward. You have six months to campaign, so I went from door to door and explained who I am and what I am. I personally, have gone through a lot, and I could connect with the common issues of the people. The Conservative candidate there I realized did not connect with the people, he was too ‘high fly’ and did not understand them. I was sympathetic to the people, and I know the hardships of a normal single mum.
Q: How difficult or easy has it been managing such an ethnically diverse ward such as Harrow?
A. We have in total 248,000 people here. Among them 20,000 are Gujaratis and 8,000 are Sri Lankan Tamils. We have 80 places of worship, 158 different languages spoken and are one of the highly religiously diverse boroughs. We are also one of the safest but we have a problem at the moment because of the Police cuts. There are people who are behaving badly. But we have made it clear that the council, police and myself will not tolerate any radicalisation, Islam or otherwise.
Q: Do you think that prejudices against female politicians are the same in both Harrow and in Sri Lanka? If not what are the main differences for women contesting for public office?
Kareema Marikar.
A. I learned about the 25 percent quota for women in Sri Lanka. Main challenge I think is from the leaders of the faith. The holy book has not said that women should not come forward and do this and that. The Muslim preachers have to understand that this is the 21st Century and you have to preach the religion in a peaceful and modern way. I am a Sri Lankan and my attire is the Osari (Kandyan Saree).
I used to wear the hijab but after the twin tower attack 9/11 in America, I was attacked because of it. So I read the Quran and it said that if there is a risk, you can remove it. So I did that. I am hoping to go back to it in future but not now because of my own safety.
As a Muslim, going into politics is not hard, but the Muslim male politicians should not put the women under the thumb.
In UK, politicians are more disciplined, but in Sri Lanka they are not. You need to go by the ethos of the country you live in.
Q: Do you think you would have gotten into politics if you were here? Or would you have achieved the same success?
A. No, because I was working as a Food and Beverage manager in Sri Lanka. My family was very broad minded, we were even called the ‘Sinhala’ Marikkars because my uncle was the Post and Telecommunication Minister. I got a good education in Girls’ High School, but still there is a perception, “Ah she is a woman!”, that perception is still there in Sri Lanka.
I have many female friends there in good positions, but as a Muslim woman they will point fingers at you but you need to overcome that and take the country in the right direction.
It is a wrong perception. This is not the past, this is the future. My attire is the Osariya, and when I don’t cover my head, people think I am a Buddhist. In London, I went to a school event in Osariya, there was a girl who asked me “Oh you became Buddhist?”, that was wrong! A male politician wears the National to stand out but not us?
Q: According to you, what are the most important aspects a local council has to focus on when serving its people?
A. when you are in a local council, funding is a major issue. But any local council should go to every road and check what the real needs are. Go to and see about the road development, street lights, and develop the needs of the area; that should be the priority of the local government councillor. Regeneration and infrastructure development is important.
Then as a local councillor or MP, most important is, that you not misuse your powers. Not do things to benefit your family and yourself and not break the code of conduct.
Q: Since assuming office at the Harrow Council in 2010, you have progressively reached the pinnacle of local government, do you have any plans of entering national politics? Do you eventually plan to enter the UK Parliament?
A. I would like to. I meet up with my local MP, who I started my politics with. I have taught him that Sri Lanka is multi-cultural. The problem was that only the Tamil communities problems were heard loud, drowning out the rest. The voter base was more Tamil community so they had the monopoly within the Party. But after I joined, I am breaking the ice for all communities, and the MP of Harrow knows when I speak, I speak from the heart and I speak the truth.
If I get the opportunity, I will take it.
I would like to come back to Sri Lanka but doing politics in Sri Lanka is different, there has to be changes. There are people who live there who are saying they are fed up of living there.
Q: Any advice you might have for aspiring young Muslim female politicians in Sri Lanka?
A. They should come forward, not just sit there and think of just cooking, eating and having children. They should come out and change the country for the better. Keep your culture and who you are and develop the country.
People cannot say politics is not good and do nothing. You have to go and raise your issues to the local councillor and make your voice heard. That is the way you go to sort out the issues.
So give your knowledge to the country and community and serve them. 
Being felicitated at the local Sri Lankan association.
