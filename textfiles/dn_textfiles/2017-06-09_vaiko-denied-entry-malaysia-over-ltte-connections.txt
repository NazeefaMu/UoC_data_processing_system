Vaiko denied entry into Malaysia over 'LTTE connections'

 
MDMK chief Vaiko was stopped from entering Malaysia on Friday morning as his name is on the list of people who are against Malaysia. 
Vaiko went to Malaysia to attend the marriage of Penang deputy chief minister Prof Ramasamy that is to be held on June 10. 
Vaiko was stopped at Kuala Lumpur airport at 6.30am and the officials there told him that he could not be allowed to enter the country due to his LTTE connections. 
Vaiko will be sent back to India in a flight that reaches Chennai at 10.45pm on Friday.
"Vaiko received the visa to visit Penang along with his PA Arunagiri nearly one week ago. He took a flight from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur at 11.55pm on Thursday. However, he was stopped by officials when he reached the Kuala Lumpur airport," said a statement issued by MDMK party.
Vaiko was questioned by several officials and his passport was also seized. "Vaiko was questioned by officials about his links to the LTTE and about several cases filed by Sri Lanka against him. Vaiko showed his passport and said that he is an Indian citizen. But the officials did not let him go," said the statement.
Vaiko informed Ramaswamy about what has happened at the airport. Ramaswamy tried with Penang chief minister Lim Guan Eng to allow Vaiko.
"The officials at the airport told Ramaswamy that they had received orders from the Malaysian deputy prime minister's office. Arunagiri was allowed to go to the canteen on the first floor to get some food, but Vaiko refused to have anything. Officials also pressurised him to have food, but Vaiko refused," said the statement.
