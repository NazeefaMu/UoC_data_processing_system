19TH MATARA BATTLE OF THE BLUES L/O ENCOUNTER
STC wins by seven runs on D/L method

St Thomas College won the 19th Battle of the Blues one day encounter against St Servatius College by seven runs (D/L method) at the Uyanwatta stadium last evening. St Servatius were 197/6 at the time the match was stopped.
The match was reduced to 45 overs per team as umpires Palith de Alwis and R P Massalage decided that the damp patches on the wicket should dry up sufficiently before the game could start.
Lahiru Dilshan (26 off 30 balls) and Nipun Ruchira (11 off 25 balls) gave the Thomian innings a good start with an opening stand of 39 runs in 8.4 overs after they elected to bat first.
In the 24th over the Servatian bowlers were able to take control and had the Thomians in a spot at 88/5 but a well compiled 36 off 62 balls by Kavindu Ridmal and a captains innings of an unbeaten 77 off 64 balls with 9 boundaries by Tharusha Kavindya helped them reach 226/7 at the end of 45 overs.
Servatian skipper Thilan Prashan and Pasindu Manupriya captured two wickets each.
The Servatians lost their first wicket at 7 and powered by an unbeaten 56 off 84 balls by Risira Lakwin and a cracking 27 off 14 balls which included 2 sixes by skipper Thilan Prashan helped the Servatians at 197/5 when Isuru Udayanga was caught brilliantly on the ropes by Mihisal Amoda. After the umpires ruled it out a controversy
took place if it was a six or a catch causing a delay at which time they had no choice but to call bad light. At the time the Thomians were seven runs ahead on the D/L method
