Football lacks competent officials
Kandy has become a town where the game of football is almost dead and buried. The obvious answer is because they lack competent men to run it. It is said that football was played at Getambe, Nittawela, Podi Bogambara, Police Grounds and the legendary Bogambara Stadium in a big way. In the good old days football was played mainly at Bogambara Stadium when it was under the Municipal Council, and also Police Grounds and University grounds also helped in a big way. Today the biggest problem is that the coaches’ get involved with the Committee and get into FFSL coaching where they are well paid and they have only coaching programs.
