Devapriya stresses need for women’s cricket second string

Sri Lanka women’s cricket coach Hemantha Devapriya stressed the need of forming a second string to feed the national women’s squad and said that the recently concluded ICC Women’s World Cup provided a good opportunity to weigh our team’s ups and downs, so we can lay a strong foundation to produce a much better team in the future. He said so during a press briefing at the R. Premadasa Stadium attended by national women’s team members and SLC officials.
Sri Lanka women captained by Inoka Ranaweera won a solitary match against Pakistan while losing the rest of six matches at the recently concluded ICC Women’s World Cup to be ranked at seventh.
“The team was selected for ICC Women’s World Cup just after six months I assumed duty. The victory of the last match against Pakistan will be a great encouragement for team’s future. We were unfortunate to concede victories to India and West Indies, otherwise would have ended at fifth place,” he pointed out.
Devapriya also said that most of international women’s cricketers maintained a higher strike rate, compared to Lankan women during the ICC Women’s World Cup. Only Chamari Athapattu and Shashikala Siriwardena had a over 50% strike rate. He also revealed that some of the Lankan cricketers showed great promise during the championship to become future greats, mentioning the names of Hasini Perera, Nipuni Hansika and Harshitha Madhavi.
