Citizens' Mail

Remedy to traffic congestion
The news item captioned ‘Moves to resolve traffic congestion’ appeared in the daily press recently prompts me to submit the following proposals for the immediate attention of Transport Minister.
Proposal 1: Immediate solution
To establish Parking Lots at 3 selected Entry Points from the directions of Negombo, Kandy and Galle. Request the ‘driver only’ vehicles to park and travel by bus to their workplace. It goes without saying that a satisfactory bus service should be arranged. Senior officials who need vehicles for their daily duties can burrow a vehicle from the ‘office'. Those who do not like it can buy their comfort paying a daily fee of about Rs.200.
Yes, this system was in operation some time back on Galle Road but the failure is due to sheer lack of genuine interest on the part of relevant authorities.
Proposal 2: Long-term solution
All-time traffic congestion in and around Colombo, which is avoidable, is having disastrous, devastating and destructive repercussions on the national economy by way of overuse and wastage of fuel, which is heavily subsidized out of government coffers, making the Petroleum Corporation a ‘Money Eating Monster’ on top of CEB, by vehicles idling at traffic jams, in addition to overwhelming loss of valuable man-hours. ‘Traffic Jam’ is never as tasty as other Jams!
Did I say ‘avoidable’? Yes, it's a simple idea but an ‘uphill task’ on the other hand and nevertheless with recurring excellent benefits which will last until eternity for the good of generation after generation.
This means breaking up of all institutions - both government and private- employing hundreds and thousands of workers in Colombo area into four parts and relocation of each ‘one-fourth’ part in Warakapola, Negombo and Kalutara on the three main entry routes, developing them as ‘Parallel Cities’ on par with Colombo, except foreign-based high rise buildings.
Suitably softening the Megapolis Concept - the brainchild of our enterprising Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka is imperative and also worthwhile when compared with the ultimate outweighing benefits in the long run.
Once ‘Parallel Cities’ are created, job-opportunities, residency, schooling, government services, financial services including banking, health services, transportation and all workplaces too will spread out evenly instead of nourishing only Colombo as the ‘One and Only Heaven on Earth’ for the whole of Sri Lanka.
These Parallel Cities will eventually acquire land value and prestige on par with ‘Colombo’. Let all the citizens in every part of the country share the ‘prosperity’ and all the good things equally.
Let the young families start building their new house, infant child's schooling, new job etc. rooting themselves in the new city. Relocation problems will naturally ease out with the passage of time. Timely patience and initial painful sacrifice will be a worthwhile investment for future prosperity. ‘Rome was not built in a day’!
Main modes of transport will become economical as buses and trains coming to Colombo can go back with a load of passengers. The number of people and vehicles entering Colombo too will be minimized, making a saving on fuel. This will also result in reducing the volume of garbage to be cleared from eating houses in Colombo, wittingly reminding of the Meetotamulla drama.
Over to you Mayoress of Colombo, Ministers of Transport and Megapolis.
