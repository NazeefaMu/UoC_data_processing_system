Anusha prepares for Asian Games with bronze in Mongolia

Queen of the local boxing ring Anusha Kodituwakku proved she is fit and ready for a tilt at glory at the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang in August when she won a bronze medal in the women’s flyweight category at the Ulaanbataar Cup Mongolia.
At 39, Sri Lanka’s boxing heroine Kodituwakku, is at the tail end of an illustrious career which includes winning a historic bronze medal at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in April this year. The Asian Games will be one of her last major competitions with her swansong likely to be at the World Championships in New Delhi in November.
Kodituwakku, a longtime employee of MAS Unichela, showed her impending retirement will leave a huge void as she took on a strong field at one of the warm-up events to the Asian Games, emerging with a bronze medal in the 51kg flyweight class in Mongolia.
“I’m very pleased with my performance as I will come against these same boxers at the Asian Games too. Winning a medal will boost my confidence,” Anusha said. It will be her first appearance at the Asian Games. Four years ago, an injury forced Anusha out of the Incheon Asian Games.
“It was a noteworthy performance as she faced stronger opponents at the Commonwealth Games. There were boxers from North and South Korea, Russia, Iran and hosts Mongolia, who are all of a high quality. We are very pleased that Anusha was able to reach the semi-finals where she lost narrowly to a North Korean girl,” said coach Manju Wanniarachchi.
Sri Lanka was represented by six boxers in Mongolia, three men and three women.
“Anusha’s next competition as she looks ahead to the Asian Games will be the Police Commissioner’s Cup in Indonesia early in July. Two other girls from MAS who went to Mongolia too – Keshani Hansika and Krishmi Dharmathilake will accompany her,” Wanniarachchi revealed.
The Indonesian event will take place at the same venue where the Asian Games boxing competition will be held leaving Anusha delighted at the opportunity to use this as a dress-rehearsal for her medal bid in August.
