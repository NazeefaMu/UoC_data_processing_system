Political parties have one undisputed leader - WP Chief Minister

 
 The lesson that each political party has one undisputed leader only had to be taught to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya said.
As much as an individual has only a single mother political parties too have a single leader, he said.
Addressing a press conference at the Western Province Chief Ministry Devapriya said that according to party discipline Mahinda Rajapaksa should attend the SLFP-UPFA May Day rally at Galle because he had no right to divide the SLFP or leave party stranded.
Devapriya said he was certain that all true and devout SLFPers would attend the party May Day rally held at Samanala grounds, Galle.
He said certain SLFPers had become puzzled owing to the statements made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. According to information received by him the SLFP-UPFA May Day rally at Galle would be a colossal success as it would rally all electoral organisers, party activists, Parliamentarians and Provincial Council members and ministers together for the first time.
He said today SLFP supporters had received their due place as a result of President Maithripala Sirisena’s astute leadership. He recalled that during the earlier regime SLFP ministers were not afforded plum ministries or the freedom to express their views and inner feelings.
Devapriya said “we have all germinated from the original SLFP seed. True SLFPers are naot those who are vociferous today but those who stood firmly rooted to the party. There is only one SLFP May Day rally and that is the one held in Galle. There cannot be enemies within a political party. Although JVPers subscribed to discerning views they all attend the party May Day rally enmasse, so why can’t true SLFPers attend their party May Day rally at Galle, he asked.
Provincial Agriculture Minister Gamini Thilakasiri, Provincial Health Minister Sumith Lal de Mendis, Education Minister Ranjith Somawansa and Co-operatives Minister Lalith Wanigaratne also attended the press conference.
