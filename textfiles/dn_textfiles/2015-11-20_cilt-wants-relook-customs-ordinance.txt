CILT wants relook at Customs Ordinance

The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Sri Lanka (CILT) Chairman Niral Kadawatharatchie urged the government to revisit the Customs Ordinance in 1869 as a matter of urgency to address multiple issues faced by the local shipping and logistics industry.
"The provisions of the Ordinance are not compatible with the global maritime and logistics activities in today's context,"he said.
He also requested the government to create a platform to facilitate free movement goods across borders to do away with cumbersome and lengthy Customs procedures .
Speaking about the issues prevailing in the railway industry he stressed that government should go ahead with projects such as rehabilitation of railway tracks and rail system electrification .
Kadawatharatchie pointed out that the proposed transport master plan for Colombo city is in hibernation and requested the government to implement the project as soon as possible. However, Deputy State Enterprise Development Minister Eran Wickramaratne responding to Kadawatharatchie's comment on the transport master plan said that he doesn't agree with Kadawatharatchie's comment as the megalopolis plan incorporates the master transport plan for the Colombo city.
Minister said the Customs and ports in Sri Lanka need to fully adopt, as a matter of urgency, electronic document processing to increase the accuracy, speed and integrity of the logistics process. Sri Lanka's soft infrastructure looks archaic in comparison to competing nations, and improving the soft infrastructure is a matter of priority for the present government.
"Moreover, there are a number of government ministries involved in managing logistics in Sri Lanka.
"For example, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Aviation Authority Sri Lanka, and SriLankan Airlines Cargo all come under different ministries."
He queried whether there is sufficient coherence in the way the Ministries of Ports, Transport and Public Enterprises operate with regard to Sri Lanka's logistics.
Corruption can prevent the sort of reform that can truly improve a business. Keeping it electronic helps us to also deal with corruption problems that are endemic in this sector, he said adding that across the world, many people think that corruption- such as a bribe- can grease the wheels of the system. People in logistics might not think there is a problem in making payments to get things done-something as basic as getting a document. However in the long term ,corruption is also sanding the wheel and preventing progress.
He added that for more than 20 years, Sri Lanka has tried to make the transition to electronic processing but people who are beneficiaries of the incumbent system generally block it. As a result, Sri Lanka's logistics won't be as competitive on as it could be on the global scale. Good governance does come into other areas of logistics as well, and we should look into issues like the role of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority as both a regulator and an operator.
