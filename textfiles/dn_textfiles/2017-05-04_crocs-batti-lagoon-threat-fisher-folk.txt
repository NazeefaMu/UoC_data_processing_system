Crocs in Batti lagoon threat to fisher-folk

The crocodile population in the Batticaloa lagoon has risen. This poses a threat to the life of the hundreds of fishing divers dependent on lagoon fishing for their livelihood.
This threat in addition to the heat currently being experienced in the Batticaloa district, has completely destroyed their means of livelihood. The crocodiles come to shore frequently to forage on the offal and other waste matter dumped on the shore and to attack the stray goats and other animals that come to feed along the shore line.
