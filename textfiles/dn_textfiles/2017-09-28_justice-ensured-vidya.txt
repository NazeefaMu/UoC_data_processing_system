Justice ensured for Vidya

President promised victim's family to fast-track Court and swift investigations to bring the criminals to book
It has even been alleged that this entire tragedy was enacted due to one of the suspects being in the business of extreme sado-masochistic pornography

Vidya Sivaloganathan’s family remembers her as sensitive and soft. She had recently cried when her mother said they would have to sell the family’s goat because they couldn’t afford to keep it anymore. “No amma. She’s part of the family now. We’ll reduce our meals and share with her what we eat. Please do not give her away,” she had begged. Every evening, as soon as she returned home from school, she would go straight to her ‘pets.’
“We reared the livestock–the goat, the cow and the chickens for eggs and milk, but Vidya always treated them like personal friends,” said her mother Saraswathi Sivaloganathan, “I often scolded her over it because she was always cuddling them and getting her white uniform dirty. She would cuddle them before going to school and then cuddle them as soon as she returned from school too.”
“The animals knew,” said her brother Nishanthan, 22, “It was finally the dogs who led us to her body. On the days leading up to her funeral and at the funeral itself, the dogs and goat acted half-crazed against certain individuals, wanting to head-butt or bite them. We thought they had become unbalanced with grief just as we had and tied them up. But it turned out the individuals the animals had been reacting against were Vidya’s rapists and murderers. They had had the nerve to show up repeatedly at our house to offer their sympathy until the Police caught them.”
Much has been reported in the local Tamil press and online websites about the case, but the family deny many of the incidents thus reported as unfactual.
“Firstly, I had no idea who could have done this to my daughter. We had no enemies in the area,” says Vidya’s mother.
According to the family, when they went looking for Vidya after 3.00 pm on May 13 when she still hadn’t returned from school, the only one to talk of seeing her at all was one particular schoolboy. He had said that he and a schoolmate had been trailing behind Vidya on their cycles when she turned a corner ahead of them and they heard a crash. When they turned the corner themselves, they had seen her overturned bicycle and one shoe but Vidya herself missing. One of them had also seen a flash of a yellow shirt among the bushes, but nothing more. They had apparently continued on their way to school without thinking to mention this incident to anybody.
“I screamed when I heard this story,” said the mother, “I asked the boy repeatedly why he hadn’t thought to raise the alarm at least to the teachers. At school, the teachers had merely thought Vidya was absent for the day; but she was a girl who didn’t like to miss school even if she was sick. The rapists had planned it well to kidnap my daughter on her way to school. We didn’t think to look for her until several hours later and by then, it was too late.”
After hunting for her in all possible places in and around the stretch from her home to her school, the frantic family finally informed the nearest Police station at Kurkattuwan. “There they said they couldn’t lodge complaints and to take our case to the Kayts police station. By the time we reached the Kayts police station, it was 11.00 pm,” said Vidya’s mother.
She denied reports that the police were rude to her, but said that it was difficult to communicate with them as they spoke only Sinhala.
It was raining heavily and past midnight by the time the anxious family reached home, yet all the talk of elopement had ironically given them a sense of hope. To their knowledge Vidya neither had a boyfriend nor was interested romantically in anyone, but at this stage they were desperately hoping that she was alright somewhere, and thus, were clutching at straws. They were unwilling to let the thought of any harm having befallen her cross their minds.
“I kept nervously wondering how and where we would find her, but I certainly never thought we would find her as we did–gang-raped and brutally murdered.”
She covered her face with her hands at this point to blot out the horror of that memory. The entire family has been psychologically traumatized over the horrific misfortune that befell their beloved youngest member. All of them are apparently, repeatedly falling ill due to this and are constantly in and out of hospital as a result. On the day I visited, Vidya’s father, a stroke recovery patient, was at the hospital for further treatment. He had been recovering well from his stroke of two years before, but this incident had again heavily impacted his health.
It was Vidya’s brother Nishanthan who saw her body first.
It was eventually one of the dogs, Jimmy, who led Nishanthan to his sister’s body. While the youth was scouring about in the bushes, Jimmy appeared with one of Vidya’s shoes in his mouth. He had then led the dazed Nishanthan to the back of an abandoned derelict house, to where his sister’s body lay on a heavily accumulated pile of fallen leaves.
“I was on the other side of the path, looking into a well when I heard Nishanthan yell out ‘Amma,’” said Saraswathi, the mother. I immediately ran over, tearing my feet over the thorny bushes in my haste, and found Nishanthan fainted on the ground. From the periphery of my vision, I saw my daughter’s discarded uniform and looked no further. To this day, I have not looked at what condition she was found in, although I understand it has been made widely public all over the internet. I do not want to know.”
“In fact,” her brother adds, “the Police, when they eventually showed up at 10.00 am, told us that the rain might have done much damage in washing away whatever evidence there were. I think it was the perpetrators themselves who took this photo and then released it. They felt so invincible and proud of their actions that they felt able to do this.”
Nishanthan also believes that the abandoned house behind which his sister’s body was discovered is not the actual scene of her rape and murder. “I went out the previous day along that path to search for her. The dogs accompanied me then too. How come they didn’t sense her there at that time? I think the perpetrators had abducted her to one of their houses and then simply dumped her body there past midnight.”
Some of the arrested suspects’ houses have been damaged–fully or in part, by angry villagers. Or so the story goes. There is an uneasy suspicion on the part of some people including Vidya’s family, that this might be a good way to get rid of evidence as well.
According to several online websites which the local Tamils are following voraciously, the perpetrators were caught with the rape videoed on their mobile phones. It has even been alleged that this entire tragedy was enacted due to one of the suspects, a Swiss PR Resident, being in the business of extreme sado-masochistic pornography; that Vidya was raped and killed for the sake of such a pornographic video and that this high-definition video had been apprehended too.
Police spokesperson ASP Ruwan Gunasekara, however, denies this. “The suspects were caught on the information of local people. We have no video evidence of the crime and while forensic investigations are ongoing to match samples of DNA between suspects and what was found at the crime scene, the results are not out yet; they will take some time.”
“In any case,” ASP Gunasekara further clarified, “this investigation is not in the hands of the Police anymore. A special unit of the CID is investigating the case now. The special investigations unit is also investigating whether there were any lapses in the Jaffna police’s handling of the case, due to widespread people’s protests over the issue.”
President Maithripala Sirisena, when he met the family in Jaffna, had promised them to fast-track Court and swift investigations to bring the criminals to book. That is all they have now to look forward to. Their gentle, animal-loving Vidya who had skipped off to school on May 13 after telling her pet goat that she would get back to pet her some more, will no more turn in through their gate to do just that. All that her grieving family can hope for is that the perpetrators of the horrible crime against their beloved girl be brought to book.
“I want justice for Vidya. President Maithripala told us that it was not within his power to deliver Vidya back to us–but that he would do all he could within his power to deliver justice. We are waiting,” Vidya’s mother said.
