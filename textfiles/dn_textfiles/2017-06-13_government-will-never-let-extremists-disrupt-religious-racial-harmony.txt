'Government will never let extremists disrupt religious, racial harmony'

The government will never let any extremist spoil the religious and racial harmony of the country, UPFA General Secretary, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister said several groups now attempt to create ethnic and religious conflicts by spreading false information via Facebook and other websites to disrupt the progressive journey of the government.
He said the government is ready to take strict legal action against those who create ethnic or religious conflicts in the country. The Minister said the President has directed the criminal investigation divisions to launch investigations on such individuals.
