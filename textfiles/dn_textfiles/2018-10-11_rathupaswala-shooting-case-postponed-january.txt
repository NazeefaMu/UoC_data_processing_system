Rathupaswala shooting case postponed to January

The next hearing in the Rathupaswala shooting case against four Army suspects, including a Brigadier, was postponed for January 4, 2019, when it was taken up before Gampaha Magistrate D.A. Ruwanpathirana yesterday.
The CID officer who led the prosecution submitted that they had not received instructions from the Attorney General although extracts of the case file had been forwarded to him for his instructions.
The Army suspects including Brigadier Aruna Deshapriya Gunawardena who are on bail appeared in court yesterday and they were ordered to be present in court again on January 4.
They are charged with having opened fire and assaulting residents of Rathupaswala who led a peaceful protest demanding safe drinking water on August 1, 2013, causing two deaths.
