Healthy Kids'  Breakfast Recipes

A healthy breakfast contains a mix of complex carbohydrates and protein to fuel your little one until he eats again. Try pairing whole grains such as oatmeal, whole-wheat toast, or whole-grain cereal with a protein source such as milk, yogurt, peanut butter, eggs, or cheese. Add in a side of fruit for a boost of vitamins and minerals, and your child is ready for the day.
Few breakfast recipes to have on the go
Dressed-up Yogurt
This is a quick way to add sweetness and crunch to plain yogurt. You'll get the nutritious benefits of yogurt without the excess sugar so often found in flavored yogurts.
What you need:
a plain yogurt
1 Tbsp of your favorite jam)
1 tsp. honey
2 Tbsp. toasted almonds, roughly chopped
Combine all ingredients in the yogurt container. Grab a spoon and go!
 Crepes On-the-Run
What you need:
2 large eggs
3/4 cup milk
1/2 cup water
1 cup flour
1 Tbsp. brown sugar
3 Tbsp. melted butter
1/4 tsp. salt
additional butter, for coating the pan
Blend all of the ingredients until completely incorporated. Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high. Add butter to coat. Pour a scant 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 45 seconds and flip. Cook for another 20 seconds.When you are ready for breakfast, kids can help fill their crepes with ham and cheese, fresh fruit and cream cheese, Nutella and bananas, peanut butter and jam or any combination that appeals.
Pop-Toast
What you need:
2 pieces of whole wheat bread
1 tsp butter, softened
1-1/2 Tbsp. jam
Lightly butter both pieces of bread. Spread the jam over the butter onto just one piece of bread leaving 1/2 inch border around the edges. Top with the remaining slice of bread. Cut off the crust and seal the two pieces of bread together using the tines of a fork.Slide into the toaster; then *pop*, breakfast is ready.
Add thinly sliced fresh fruit such as bananas or strawberries for a fresh flavour.
