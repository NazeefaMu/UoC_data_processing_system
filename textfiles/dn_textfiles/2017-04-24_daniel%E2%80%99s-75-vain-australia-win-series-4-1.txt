Daniel’s 75 in vain as Australia win series 4-1

Jehan Daniel scored a fighting 75 off 89 balls but it was not sufficient to bring Sri Lanka victory as they fell short by 23 runs to lose the fifth and final Under 19 Youth ODI to Australia at Hobart on Sunday.
The loss meant that Australia took the five-match series 4-1. Sri Lanka were left chasing 245 for a face-saving victory having already conceded the series to Australia.
But following an opening stand of 53 Sri Lanka were truly on course for a win at 192-4 in the 41st over when Daniel’s dismissal triggered a collapse and they lost the remaining six wickets for 29 runs to be all out for 221 in 48.5 overs.
Half-centuries from Max Bryant (67), Jason Sangha (59) and Mathew Spoors (65 n.o.) saw Australia reach 244-4 off their 50 overs after winning the toss and electing to bat first.
Scores: Australia (U19) 244-4 in 50 overs (M Bryant 67, J Sangha 59, M Spoors 65 n.o., W Sutherland 20, P Uppal 22 n.o., P Jayawickrama 2/47)
Sri Lanka (U19) 221 in 48.5 overs (N Sumanasinghe 21, V Chaturanga 31, K Mendis 25, J Daniel 75, K Arachchige 36, W Sutherland 3/24, L Pope 3/40, M Spoors 2/24)
