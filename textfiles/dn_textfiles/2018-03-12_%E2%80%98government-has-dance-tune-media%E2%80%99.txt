‘Government has to dance to the tune of the media’

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amarawera, adressing a meeting at Agunakolapelessa, said to win future elections, the government has to dance to the tune of the media.
The minister said that with the local government elections results, it was the media that enjoyed the victory most. Some voters were under the impression that a Pohottuwa victory would ensure former President Mahinda Rajapaksa becoming the next Prime Minister.
He added that the media focused more on the shortcomings of their regime, rather than highlighting the benefits the government bestowed upon the citizens of the country.
Minister Amarawera said that the country regained its international reputation that was lost during the previous regime due to the efforts of the current government and added that they also re-established GSP Plus and banned fish exports.
