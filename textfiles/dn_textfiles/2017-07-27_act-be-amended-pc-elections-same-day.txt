ACT TO BE AMENDED: PC ELECTIONS ON SAME DAY

The cabinet has approved the proposal to amend relevant provisions in Constitution and Provincial Council Act, to enable elections for all provincial councils to be held on the same day.
The proposal was presented by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe.
The proposal highlights, in the past provincial council elections were held separately for all provincial councils and it impacted on financial resources and democratic aspects. Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya recently said if all the provincial council elections are needed to be held together, it could done by early dissolution of other provincial councils as well. The terms of the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils are due to expire between September 6 and October 1 this year.
