Designs to remember: In memory of Ena de Silva

Ena De Silva whose father was the first Ceylonese Head of the Police Force and whose husbnad was also an IGP passed away recently at the age of 93. I met her first around twenty three years back . She already knew one of my grandfathers. She was offcourse already well known for her batiks.
My associaton began with an offer to make availible her ceations primarily in wood,brass, cushions etc to buyers in Colombo. It was a shortlived enterprise since I had move the outlet out. It also led to supporting the setting up of the second kitchen as it was termed in Aluvihare offering tasty resaonably priced meals by the main road.
The pictures featured today are from those she created in wood,brass,silver,metal and fabric. There are also glimpses of the manner in which the inside of her house was furnished and decorated. The menu in what was known as Alu 1 where the other kitchen was located by the batik works was quite simply extraordinary. One hears of 15 - 16 course Italian meals. Alu 1 had a similar number of items except it was wholly Sri Lankan. One broadly speaking staggered out in a state of shock having consumed an extraordianry fare with what was created in the kitchen. It was an experience. Even in her house there was no such thing as a simple meal.
What she created was pretty much one of a kind. She was the artist and principle designer whose designs were executed by an able band of men,women, boys and girls whose workmanship is seen in the pictures. I hope the pictures featured in appreciation of her extraordinary creativity and talent would give readers a full measure of an unforgettable icon and a tribute to Sri Lankan design.
