Jetwing to open Pottuvil Point and Hotel J Unawatuna

 Jetwing Hotels will open Jetwing Pottuvil Point in Pottuvil and a branch of the budgetary line of properties, Hotel J in Unawatuna to promote the local tourism industry outside the city.
The total investment for these two hotels is Rs 840 million.
Accordingly, Jetwing Pottuvil Point which will have 20 villas with fully fledged accommodation will be opened in July this year, while Hotel J in Unawatuna is scheduled to open in October.
Jetwing Hotels Chairman Hiran Cooray told Daily News Business said at a time when the arrival of foreign travellers to Sri Lanka is increasing, Jetwing has decided to open more hotels and villas in the country, expanding into potential traveller destinations that highlight major tourist hotspots.
“Unlike earlier, majority tourists like to visit areas outside Colombo to stay a longer period and this encourages us to focus more attention towards constructing hotels, villas and resorts in such areas,”
Chairman Cooray said even at present Jetwing runs 19 resorts and 11 villas with 1,258 rooms located in Jaffna, Sigiriya, Dambulla, Passikudah, Nuwara Eliya, Wellawaya, Yala, Matara, Galle, Ahungalla and Negombo.
Jetwing will also open two other hotels, Jetwing Kandy Gallery in Kandy and Jetwing Reef in Uppuveli with all facilities including fully fledged rooms, restaurants, pool and spa.
Highlighting on the development of the hospitality services in the country Chairman Cooray said arrival of tourists to Sri Lanka is increasing due to the availability of sophisticated hotel accommodation and exceptional Lankan style hospitality services.
He also highlighted about the opening of their first five star city hotel with 98 rooms ‘Jetwing Colombo Seven’ located at Ward Place in Colombo 7.
The Jetwing Colombo Seven features 70 Deluxe rooms and 28 serviced apartments and some rooms designed to cater to the needs of differently abled persons.
“Our prime objective is to provide a legendary service to travellers and make Sri Lanka a tourist paradise targetting a record number of tourists to our country”.
