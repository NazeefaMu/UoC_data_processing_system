83 election related complaints recorded between Dec 9 and Jan 5

 
The Sri Lanka Police have recorded 83 complaints of election law violations from December 9 to January 5.
The police report said that of the 103 people arrested, 12 were candidates.
One of the candidates is still in remand custody, the Police said.
Police Media Spokesperson, SP Ruwan Gunasekara addressing a media briefing at the Elections Secretariat today explained that of this number, 54 were complaints made to the police whilst 29 were raids conducted by the police.
Most of the complaints were with regard to property damage and intimidation, he said further.
The police have also decided to take into custody election material in possession of individuals caught violating election laws as court productions. They will then estimate the value of all these goods and sent to the Election Secretariat, he said.
“This will be valuable information when it comes to court cases regarding a candidate’s assets or any election law violation case lodged in court”, said SP Gunasekara.
