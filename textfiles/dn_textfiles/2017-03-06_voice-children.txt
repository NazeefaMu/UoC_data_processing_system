A voice for children

The Legal Aid Commission under the theme ‘Be a voice for children,’ conducted two awareness-raising programmes for school children and parents, separately, at Gunasinghe Vidyalaya, Colombo 12, on February 23.
The LAC Legal Officers of the Head Office, Colombo, Piyumi Kumari, A.A.L., Thamarashi Wickramanayake, A.A.L., Dr. P.A.P Nandathilaka – National STD/AIDS Programme, A.S.G. Mendis, Police Officer, Women and Children Bureau Police Division, Maradana, and Sgt. Chandrakanthi – Dam Street Police Station, participated as resource persons, and conducted the sessions and activities for students and parents.
As the area is more prone to drug issues, illegal and unethical activities, trafficking, using children for illegal business, and family disputes, Gunasinghe Vidyalaya Principal R.M.U. Ratnayake requested LAC to raise awareness on such issues at the programme. Most parents in the area do not send their children to school regularly. About 120 Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim students study in this school.

*Communication skills
*Rights and duties of a child, and how to be a good citizen

*Laws related to child protection
*Current socio-legal issues related to children – child abuse, violence, offences committed on children, and drug issues
*Documentation issues – birth certificates, marriage certificates etc.
*Authorities working for children – child protection authority, regional probation, and childcare officers, police, women and child bureau, hotlines etc.
*Custody and adoption of children
*Maintenance of children and family law issues

The LAC plans to conduct more awareness-raising programmes under ‘Be a voice for children’ project for schools with limited facilities in Colombo.
