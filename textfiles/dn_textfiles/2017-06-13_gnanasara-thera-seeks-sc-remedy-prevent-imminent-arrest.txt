He further sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1), 13(1) and 14(h) of the constitution was violated by the respondents.
The petitioner stated that there is an island wide search for him to apprehend and arrest him and a number of Police teams are deployed for this purpose.
Gnanasara Thera was not present at the Court hearing yesterday on the Court action filed against him over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court.
