Task force appointed to facilitate property rights

 
The Housing and Construction Ministry has appointed a task force to develop a mechanism to transfer state owned condominium and non-condominium properties to those who have utilised them for more than 15 years.
The Housing and Construction Ministry has already invited the relevant families to provide their information.
The decision was made in order to establish clearly defined, fair, stable and enforceable system of property rights.
This initiative was taken to fulfil Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s pledge to empower three million citizens to become land and house owners made while presenting his Economic Policy Statement in 2015.
The government is addressing this commitment on several fronts.
Proposals to modernise surveys and registration systems are under discussion and new initiatives to recognise the rights and legitimacy of the urban poor have already been launched.
Transferring state own houses to their long term occupants is one of the key objectives of the government and around 1000 families, including those who have resettled after the Tsunami will also benefit through this initiative.
