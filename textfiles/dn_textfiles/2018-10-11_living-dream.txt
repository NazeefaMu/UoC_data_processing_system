Living a dream

When it comes to dreams no dream is unattainable for Dream Caravan! Dream Caravan is a band that is itself a dream realized. In the words of Lead Vocalist of Dream Caravan, Ryan Henderlin – ‘We have found a great mix of our individuality to create something unique!’ They have a love for experimenting musically with each member bringing a unique strength to the table. Melodies speaks to Ryan Henderlin on this fantastic musical collaboration.
Ryan Henderlin, is a born and bred Peterite, with an affiliation towards Music, Dance and Theatre, who is involved in those areas on a personal and professional level as well.
“I started my music from school which evolved into performing with groups outside of school. I was involved with a show choir called “ Vocal Enigma Sri Lanka” and in 2015 was crowned winner of MTV’s Yes Superstar Season 03. I’m involved with a Theatre production Company called “Cue Theatre Sri Lanka” and I am currently involved with ‘Dream Caravan’,” said Henderlin.
‘Dream Caravan’ is a band that covers pop, rock, reggae, baila, alternative, blues, jazz and indie. The list goes on because the members of the band are gifted in their own way. They have learnt to merge their talents and give something special to the audience. To them music is a journey and Henderlin points out that a song to a twenty year old means something completely different to a fifty year old. It’s all about the point in life you are in and music speaks to you accordingly.
All six in the band have completely different preferences and styles in music. Henderlin certainly sounds enigmatic when he points out that this could be a danger sign or a blessing! It depends on how you put it together! However along with their differences they also have their similarities. They all love experimenting with music, new ideas and techniques. This mix of personalities creates that magic necessary for the success of a band. The name came about when they were figuring out a name to call themselves. The name of course had to represent their love for experimenting musically! Right throughout they have always tried to be unique. This exploration of theirs sounded a bit like traveling in a Caravan, and so came the name ‘Dream Caravan’!
“As much as I stick to the ideology of “greatness isn’t born, It’s made”, I believe the passion for music is in our blood. We all can learn to appreciate music as human beings, but the choice to pursue it in a professional level requires a dose of insanity or something unquantifiable from within. I like to think it’s the latter,” stated Henderlin.
Personally for Henderlin his inspirations ranges from Bryan Adam to James Brown to Michael Jackson. One of his biggest inspirations would be Bruno Mars. Henderlin points out that the amount of skill and work Bruno Mars puts into his performances are just awe inspiring.
“I love singing and dancing as well and It’s something of Bruno Mars I try to follow and gather from. It’s almost impossible to pick one line in a song that is my favorite and which appeals to me, but I like the line from the song by Lynyrd Skynyrd – ‘And be a simple kind of man, Oh, be something you love and understand”. It is from their song ‘Simple Man’,” added Henderlin.
His message to aspiring young musicians revolves around consistency- Consistency along with the right attitude. It sounds simple but when you put it into action then comes the difficult part. Henderlin points out that it requires a major level of will power because when you start out, you may not have the support or push that you would hope for. You will have to get there by yourself. The right attitude will keep you grounded and keep you moving in the correct direction. The rest will unfold itself!
If you want to thrive in the music industry in any country the formula is roughly the same - Stay Humble, Remember your roots, be genuine and be smart. Henderlin very correctly asserts that like any industry there are pitfalls and there are wrong turns. The music industry in Sri Lanka, just like any other country is a continuously evolving one. With the changing times one needs to constantly keep adapting and keep changing ones game.
“You need to learn what is new and happening in the music industry, new techniques and new technology and be courteous to everyone you meet. At the end of the day strive to be original. Thinking back there are many uncountable and unmentionable outstanding experiences with the band, both on stage and off. It’s hard to mention just one. Best part is everyone around us, family, friends and fans alike are very much involved! But with good times and bad, we stuck together, made the best out of the situation and as Roshan says, whatever happens we Slam through’,” explained Henderlin
The truth is that the best is yet to come for all of us. Henderlin is of the opinion that there have been so many outstanding experiences. Each of the members have had various experiences on their separate platforms, but in terms of the band, usually every performance ends up being a great one because no matter where they perform, they enjoy themselves and in turn the audience responds accordingly. Having different personalities there are differences of opinion. They come from so many different backgrounds but that is their strength! Their diversity which allows them to put together something unseen before.
“We are never on the same page, seeing the picture through different angles. The beauty of it is all of these differences have found a great musical synergy to deliver a truly genuine “Dream Caravan” experience to the listener. As individuals on a personal level we can never be more in sync, in the ways we like to spend our time together, to the crazy scenarios we put ourselves through, we stick through it together, less as just a band and more as a family. Apart from our usual performances and covers that we put out, There are some originals in the pipe line that people will be able to hear in the near future, so do follow us on social media to get first hand updates on what we are up to, on and off stage,” summed up Henderlin.
