Removing persons who stood by party undemocratic - Bandula

 
It was current SLFP Chairman President Maithripala Sirisena who allowed the SLFP to contest the general election under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa and win it by criticising the unsound policies of the UNP. The removal of persons who stood by the party at that time from their electoral organiser posts can be seen as an action which was against the democratic principles existing within the SLFP, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
He was commenting on the shake up of SLFP chief electoral organiser posts carried out by the party.
Gunawardena said it was with the knowledge of President Sirisena that people like Prasanna Ranatunga and Dilum Amunugama played the opposition role in Parliament. He said President Sirisena was also aware of their opposition to the government's budget and their voting against it.
What they did in Parliament as members of the joint opposition was to counter the repeated attacks made by the UNP, he said.
