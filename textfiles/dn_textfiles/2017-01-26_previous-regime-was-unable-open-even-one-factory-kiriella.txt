Previous regime was unable to open even one factory: Kiriella

The previous regime was unable to commence a single new factory. Existing factories began to shutdown including 20 in the Kandy District. A factory in Pallekele under an Indian company with around 3,000 employees was shutdown during the previous regime, Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister was addressing the opening ceremony of a new Maganeguma consultancy office in Ratmalana, Angulana on January 20.
He said the country's present situation had changed where all communities could live as one under Good Governance.
"The Prime Minister is making many efforts to get investors to come to our country. A programme is conducted to handover job opportunities to the youth. The Opposition cannot stand this.
The previous regime lost the election. The people’s mandate is with the President, the Prime Minister, and the United National Front. Unlike the previous regime, we do not trouble others over political reasons. We pledged to strengthen our good governance and take our country forward, Kiriella said.
Protests are held to prevent investments from coming into the country.
The country is governed according to the people’s mandate. Employment cannot be given only through government jobs. New jobs could be created if only factories emerge. For that to happen, investors must come to the country, the minister said.
Private Secretary to the Minister Chamindranee Kiriella, Maganeguma Consultancy Company Chairman Janaka Herath, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyaarachchi, Director General Rohitha Swarna and other invitees were present.
