Obama, Pope unite for action on migrants, climate

US: President Barack Obama and Pope Francis married their political and spiritual power to urge action on immigration and the environment Wednesday, during the popular pontiff's maiden White House visit.
America's first black president offered the first Latin American pope a stately and effusive welcome on the South Lawn, praising his moral leadership on issues that politics have struggled to address.
"I believe the excitement around your visit must be attributed not only to your role as pope, but to your unique qualities as a person," Obama said, praising Francis's humility, "embrace of simplicity" and generosity of spirit.
Though Pope Francis has inveighed against the materialism that the United States seems to embody like no other country, he is also a potential political ally for Obama, sharing many of his progressive goals and bringing along many of America's 70 million Catholics.
Speaking in fluent, if accented, English, the 78-year-old Argentine pontiff returned the warm blessings of his host and addressed Washington's bitter debate about immigration reform.
"As the son of an immigrant family, I am happy to be a guest in this country, which was largely built by such families."
Francis said he would address Congress "to offer words of encouragement to those called to guide the nation's political future in fidelity to its founding principles."
Obama lauded Francis for reminding the world that "the Lord's most powerful message is mercy."
"That means welcoming the stranger with empathy and a truly open heart, from the refugee who flees war-torn lands to the immigrant who leaves home in search of a better life," Obama said. That joint message may also resonate strongly in Europe, which has been convulsed for months by an ongoing refugee crisis. And as many US conservatives question the very existence of man-made climate change, Francis and Obama made a de facto joint appeal for action on the issue.
"Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planet, God's magnificent gift to us," Obama said. Francis took up the call.
"Accepting the urgency, it seems clear to me also that climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation," Francis said.
"When it comes to the care of our 'common home,' we are living at a critical moment of history."
He also invoked Obama's hero Martin Luther King Jr, saying, "We have defaulted on a promissory note, and now is the time to honour it."
The pope was afforded a full ceremonial welcome and a 40 minute one-on-one meeting with Obama in the Oval Office.
Obama himself had made an exceedingly rare ceremonial trip to the airport to meet the Argentine's plane Tuesday, bringing his wife, daughters, Vice President Joe Biden to underscore the special welcome. - AFP
