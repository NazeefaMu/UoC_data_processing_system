Bradby Fiesta postponed

The Bradby Fiesta carnival and after party organized to coincide with the 2nd leg of the Bradby shield encounter, scheduled for 03rd June 2017, has been postponed till further notice. “The Bradby Fiesta Committee arrived at this decision taking into consideration the devastation caused by the worst floods the county has seen in decades,” said Boshan Dayaratne, Chairman, Organizing Committee 2017.
Instead of the festivities, the Bradby Fiesta Committee, comprising of 135 volunteers, have decided to launch a flood relief campaign; to arrange emergency supplies for those displaced and affected, together with necessary items that are required for the commencement of their normal life. For the said purpose special collection points will be setup at the Royal College Union office as well as the Royal College Sports Complex. The Organizers call for support from all Royalists and non-Royalist to lend a helping hand by any means possible to the victims of this disaster.
The Organizers have further announced that all tickets sold would be refunded if produced at the Royal College Union office at Reed Avenue within two weeks from 31st May; and that the balance of the proceeds generated from ticket sale shall be utilized in flood relief efforts.
