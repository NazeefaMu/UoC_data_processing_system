China and Sri Lanka to further elevate relations via establishing of Sister City Relationships

A Memorandum of Understanding on establishing a sister city relationship between Jishan, Shanxi Province of China and Moneragala, Uva Province of Sri Lanka was signed recently in Sri Lanka between the District Secretary of Moneragala and the Magistrate of the People’s Government of Jishan Country with the participation of a Chinese delegation including six members at the District Secretariat of Moneragala.
Cabinet Approval is expected to be granted to the MOU in due course to implement the agreement for the establishment of the sister city in accordance with the principles in the communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
Considering the opportunity for the promotion of friendly relations and deepening of mutual understanding between the two countries through this MoU, Ambassador of Sri Lanka in Beijing Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku, expedited the process of arranging the MOU once the proposal initiated by the Most. Ven. Chang Zang, the Chief Incumbent of Longquan Temple in Beijing, where one of Lord Buddha’s Sacred Tooth Relics is kept for reverence.
The Jishan region is considered an important place for Sri Lankans because it is the birth place of Rev. Faxian who visited Sri Lanka during the 5th Century to learn Buddhism. The 60 acre Jujube garden was also opened last year in Ven. Faxian’s home town named “China-Sri Lanka Friendship Jishan Jujube Orchard” to commemorate the cordial Buddhist relations between the two countries and to commemorate 60 years of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka.
