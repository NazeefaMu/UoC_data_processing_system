Nestlé sweeps board at Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards

Nestlé swept the board at the Best Corporate Citizen Sustainability Awards 2017, winning one of the highest number of awards at the event.
In addition to winning the highly coveted Best Corporate Citizen -Manufacturing sector and Triple Bottom Line - Social Sustainability (People) Awards, the ‘Good Food, Good Life’ company also walked away with the Customer / Consumer Relations Award, Top 10 Best Corporate Citizen’s Award and Best Presented Application Award.
The award for Best Corporate Citizen in the Manufacturing Sector was conferred on Nestlé in recognition of its sustainable business practices and overall contribution to the local community, environment and economy.
The company won the Triple Bottom Line ( People) Award for its performance in the environmental, social, and financial areas, recognising in particular its efforts to enhance the lives of those it touched across its value chain - consumers, customers, suppliers, farmers and employees. The Customer / Consumer Relations Award recognised Nestlé’s solid “inbuilt processes which enables the company to “live and practice” sustainability with the consumer at its core.”
Nestlé Managing Director Shivani Hegde, “At Nestlé, our purpose is to enhance quality of life and contribute to a healthier future. This purpose articulates why we exist, what motivates us and the positive impact we want to have on the world. It gives meaning to what we do. How we live our purpose every day is what has been recognised with these awards - the systems, processes and solid values we have lived by as a company for more than 150 years, and which hold true even today.”
As Sri Lanka’s largest private sector collector of fresh milk and one of the world’s largest exporters of coconut milk powder, Nestlé’s business positively impacts the livelihoods of over 20,000 local farming families.
The company also initiated a significant investment of Rs. 5 billion in its factory early this year to enhance manufacturing capacity for milk powder and coconut milk powder, thereby driving import substitution and increasing exports.
The company is also committed to manufacturing responsibly and sustainably by following the three Rs approach - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Over the last decade or so, Nestlé has reduced its energy consumption by 42%, water consumption by 39% and greenhouse gas emissions by 39%, whilst continuing to scale up production.
In 2016, the company celebrated its 110th anniversary in Sri Lanka and 150th one worldwide.
