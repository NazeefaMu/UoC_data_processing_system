Ryan Jayalath released under strict bail condition

 
Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath arrested on charges of causing damages to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest was today ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
The Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyantuduwa made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court decision not to grant bail.
Accordingly, the suspect was ordered to be released on a personal bail of Rs. 500,000 and his parents were accepted as the signatories to the bond. Ryan Jayalath was released on bail taking into consideration his future educational activities as an exceptional circumstance.
While ordering the suspect to be released on bail, the High Court Judge warned that bail could be canceled and accused would be remanded until the conclusion of the trial, if he violated the bail conditions or repeated the commission of any other offence.
Meanwhile, the High Court Judge issued an order directing the Director of Colombo Crimes Division that the activities of the suspect be monitored in order to ascertain whether he would comply with the court order.
"No one has power to take laws into their hands. All should respect to the country’s law and no one can ignore the law. The bail can be canceled, even with a photograph to prove that he violates court order. This Court will monitor the suspect’s future activities”, the High Court Judge said.
Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the suspect currently has seven pending court cases in the Magistrate’s Court. He said this revision application cannot be maintained due to several shortcomings because it has failed to demonstrate the facts challenging the Magistrate’s order.
Defence Counsel Gamini Alwis appearing on behalf of suspect moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over a period of two months.
“My client had entered to the Ruhuna university in the year of 2010 to follow a MBBS science degree. Now he is expecting to participate in internship training,” Defence Counsel added.  
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Gamini Alwis appeared for the suspect-petitioner.
