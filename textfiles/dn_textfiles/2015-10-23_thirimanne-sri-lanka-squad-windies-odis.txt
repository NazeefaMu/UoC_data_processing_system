Thirimanne in Sri Lanka squad for Windies ODIs

SLC selectors on Friday named three uncapped players in the squad for the upcoming ODI series against West Indies along with batsman Lahiru Thirimanne, despite dropping him from the ongoing Test in Colombo.
Right-handed batsman Shehan Jayasuriya, spin bowler Jeffrey Vandersay and all-rounder Dhanushka Gunathilaka will all hope to make their debuts in the three 50-over matches being held November 1, 4 and 7.
The hosts will also be boosted by the returns of experienced opener Tillakaratne Dilshan and fast-bowler Lasith Malinga who have both retired from Test cricket.
Thirimanne lost his place in the Test team after a run of low scores but has been in better form in recent appearances for the one-day side.
One-day squad:
Angelo Mathews, Lahiru Thirimanne, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Kusal Janith Perera, Dinesh Chandimal, Milinda Siriwardena, Shehan Jayasuriya, Sachithra Senanayake, Jefferey Vandersay, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Kulasekera, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera and Dhanushka Gunathilaka. AFP
