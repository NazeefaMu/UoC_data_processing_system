Garbage recycling project progresses successfully

A garbage recycling project commenced by the Kirinda-Puhulwella Pradeshiya Sabha has at present achieved significant progress, residents said.
This project is currently in operation at Wahtucolakanda in Puhulwella. The garbage, hard waste and other waste matter collected in the Kirinda-Puhulwella towns and other sub towns and villages are brought to this centre and recycled and converted into compost.
According to cultivation committee and farmer organization members, the division of Kirinda-Puhulwella Pradeshiya Sabha is mainly an agricultural zone. Paddy cultivation is the main-stay of the rural economy.
Garbage management and compost production projects have boosted environmental preservation and conservation in the area. In addition, several direct and indirect employment opportunities for the unemployed in the area have also been created through this project.
The environmental conservation and encouragement of farmers to utilize organic manure rather than chemical fertilizer would be twin objectives of this endeavour, project officials said.
