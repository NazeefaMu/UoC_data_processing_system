Minister aiming to scuttle SLMC - GMOA

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) said the Health Minister was all out to scuttle activities of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said they would take crucial decisions against this move on October 18 at its General Committee meeting.
“Trying to bring in a new Medical Ordinance to replace the current one which has a 90 year history, challenging technical decisions made by the SLMC, presenting a pro-SAITM stand to the judiciary going against the SLMC, letting down the SLMC by obtaining private legal services, influencing in every possible way to make the SLMC weak and idle are some of the ‘actions’ taken by the Health Minister to destroy the SLMC,” he added.
He said the SLMC had a 90-year history and was established by the Medical Council Ordinance No 24 of 1924. This is only a part of the anti-establishment campaign in implementation which is aimed at destroying all official and state procedures and establishments.Destroying the free health service,establishments and procedures is part of it, he said.
