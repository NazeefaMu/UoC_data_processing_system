Fort railway station bomb blast: Twenty years RI for LTTE suspect

An LTTE suspect who was found guilty to the charge of having aided, abetted and conspired to explode a suicide bomb at the Fort Railway Station in 2008, killing 16 people including eight students of D.S.Senanayake College, was yesterday sentenced to 20-years-Rigorous Imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
Handing down a sentence against accused Kanagasabei Dewadasan alias Nadan, High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe observed that the prosecution has proven the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the accused alleging that the attack was carried out on or around February 3, 2008 by a female suicide bomber belonging to LTTE and exploded during rush hour on Platform number three.
The suicide bombing killed 16 people including eight school children of D. S. Senanayake College’s baseball team and their coach. The accused had been charged under section 3(b) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
