Stokes dominates as England beat India in 3rd ODI

Kolkata: England all-rounder Ben Stokes put in a dominant performance with the bat and ball to help England pull off a five-run consolation win against India in the third one-day international in Kolkata on Sunday.
Seam bowler Stokes claimed three wickets to help restrict India, who were chasing 322 for victory, to 316-9 as Kedar Jadhav's 90 went in vain.
Chris Woakes, who bowled the final over with India needing 16 to win, held his nerve to give England their first victory on the tour.
Earlier Stokes hit an unbeaten 39-ball 57 to help England post 321-8 after being put into bat at Kolkata's Eden Gardens.
India lost their openers early in the chase but Kohli (55) and Yuvraj Singh (45) put on 65 runs for the third wicket to rebuild the innings.
Kohli, who was dropped on 35, failed to capitalise on the reprieve after losing his wicket to Stokes. He was caught behind chasing a wide delivery outside the off stump.
With Yuvraj (45), fresh from his match-winning 150 in Cuttack, and former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (25) also back in the pavilion, India slipped to 173-5.
First match hero Jadhav, who hit a brilliant 120 in India's opening win in Pune, and Hardik Pandya (56) then put on 104 runs to revive the chase. The batting duo took the opposition attack by surprise with their powerful hitting as they struck 16 fours and three sixes between them. AFP
