We need to improve our present schools rugby system' says sports minister

We need to improve our present schools rugby system so we will get more schools players in to the national team to represent the country said sports minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam at the official launch of the Singer Schools league rugby tournament for the year 2017 held at waters edge Battaramulla on Wednesday the 29th March.
Speaking further he said the schools sports development division are on the look out to improve this present system and rearrange it with capable new people so more talented rugby players from the school section will represent the Sri Lanka national team in the near future. Also addressing the gathering at a media press conference, CEO of the Singer Group Asoka Pieris commended the effort taken by their ex chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya in joining ties with the schools rugby league way back in 2003 and continuing their support for the schools rugby.
SINGER has extended their sponsorship agreement with the Sri Lanka schools rugby football association (SLSRFA) this year as well, having continuously sponsored the league for 15 consecutive years.
