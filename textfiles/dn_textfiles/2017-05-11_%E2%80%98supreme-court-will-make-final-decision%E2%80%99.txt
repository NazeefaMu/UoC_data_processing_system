‘Supreme Court will make the final decision’

Geetha Kumarasinghe’s parliamentary seat:
Former External Affairs Minister Prof. G. L. Peiris yesterday said the Supreme Court has the legal right to take final decision with regard to the parliamentary seat of Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
The Supreme Court has the legal right to take the final decision with regard to the parliamentary seat of Geetha Kumarasinghe, he said.
He said a parliamentarian can make an appeal before the Supreme Court if his or her parliamentary seat is abolished by the Court of Appeal within 41 days.
Prof. Peiris said Geetha Kumarasinghe had informed the Speaker and the Parliament Secretary General in writing that she would make an appeal before the Supreme Court against the verdict of the Court of Appeal. He said attempts are being made to deprive Kumarasinghe of her parliamentary seat even after she had informed the Speaker and the Secretary General of Parliament of her decision to make an appeal against the Court of Appeal verdict.
