DFCC extends Vardhana Virtual Wallet to all smartphone users

Encouraged by the fast-paced adoption of the Vardhana Virtual Wallet by customers, DFCC Bank now invites both DFCC and non-DFCC customers who own a smartphone to use the Wallet, enabling them to enjoy the full benefits of cashless transactions.
By extending the use of the Wallet to non-DFCC Bank customers on a mobile service network of their choice, DFCC Bank delivers its commitment to enhance lives by widening choices for smart phone users. Anyone with a registered local mobile number and a smart phone, who is a resident of Sri Lanka and above the age of 18, can now avail of this service by completing a one-time registration at any one of the 138 DFCC branches and service points islandwide.
DFCC Bank has taken this step to empower everyone to take advantage of the Vardhana Virtual Wallet, which offers unlimited conveniences. Users can transfer only the amount required for transactions via the wallet whilst the balance in their saving account earns the highest interest, purchase goods and services from over 500 merchant outlets including supermarkets, online stores, restaurants, pharmacies, salons and many more, pay utility bills whilst on the move as well as send and receive money anytime, anywhere.
The user is kept informed of all transactions performed via instant SMS alerts and in-app notifications thereby keeping the users up to date.
Users can receive money from overseas through DFCC's Lanka Money Transfer service which is now linked to the Vardhana Virtual Wallet. The Wallet also allows users to organise their finances efficiently, empowering them to move funds between Wallet and bank account for further flexibility. If a DFCC savings account is linked to the Wallet, funds could be transferred to the Wallet when the need arises. As a result, the account holder can continue to earn the highest interest rate for balances in the linked savings account.
DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando said the Vardhana Virtual Wallet is an app that is revolutionising payments and extending immense convenience to users. DFCC Bank has an impeccable track record of over 60 years in the financial services industry and has now evolved into a technology savvy bank that is spearheading Sri Lanka's digital banking revolution.
DFCC Bank is committed to continuously add value to this popular cashless solution.”
The Vardhana Virtual Wallet merchant points have expanded to include supermarkets, fast food chains, retail clothing chains, online stores, salons, cinemas and many more, and this network continues to expand.
