Sony eyes record profit as  gaming hits boost earnings

The Japanese electronics firm raised its annual profit forecast to 870bn yen ($7.7bn; £6.0bn), up 30% from estimates given in July.
The upgrade comes after strong sales in its Playstation division drove revenues in the second quarter.
Gaming also spurred a strong rise in operating profit at rival Nintendo.
IDC gaming analyst Sam Reynolds said both Japanese firms had posted “impressive earnings based on the strength of the gaming market”.
He said Sony could credit strong sales to “the quality of games on the platform” which include bestsellers God of War and Spider-Man, while demand for Red Dead Redemption II has also been high.
Mr Reynolds said the gaming market was less competitive than Sony’s home entertainment businesses, an industry that had faced “substantial pricing pressure” over the last decade and aggressive competition from South Korean and Chinese rivals.
Along with gaming, Sony’s movie unit and music business also supported profits during the second quarter and helped offset challenges in its mobile division.
Operating income for the period was 239.5bn yen, the firm said in a statement. (chinadaily.com)
