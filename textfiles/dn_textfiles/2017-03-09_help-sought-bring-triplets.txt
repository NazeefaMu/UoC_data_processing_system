A benefactor in Diyabeduma agreed a provide four tins per month for a year on the intervention of Early Childhood Development Officer Mangala Udayakumara. But the three children needed 24 tins per month. She said she called over at the Divisional Secretariat to seek assistance through the Divisional Secretary.
She requests the public to assist them in raising their three children. contributions can be remitted to account number 11870711902979 at the People’s Bank, Bakamuna branch. Contact - 072-4912991.
