‘Govt spent Rs 7 bn for natural disasters’

Tissa Jayawera, past Chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka, said that the Government was very unfortunate as it was forced to spend around Rs.7 billion for various uncalled for natural disasters this year.
“These along with the global downturn led the country towards a lower economic growth rate of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2017,” he said.
He said that for the recent floods alone, Government had to spend around Rs. 3 billion.
In addition, the drought situation prompted the Government to spend around another Rs. 2 billion and a near Rs. 1 billion for the Meethotamulla garbage issue.
He said that the Salawa blast along with several other similar man-made and natural disasters also forced Government to move away from investing in infrastructure. (SS)
