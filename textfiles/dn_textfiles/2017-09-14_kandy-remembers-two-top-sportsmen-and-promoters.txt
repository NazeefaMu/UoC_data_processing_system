September 19 will be the 21st death anniversary of M.E. Marikar and September 22 will be the 30th death anniversary of Dr. C.D.L. Fernando, both versatile sportsmen and sports benefactors.
Twenty years ago on 19 September, Kandy lost one of its top journalists, who was a versatile sportsman, sports promoter and above all a gentleman M.E Marikar. Late M.E. Marikar was a fine cricketer; footballer, athlete, boxer, cadet and he also played hockey. In cricket he was a fine medium pace bowler and a hard hitting middle order batsman.
ME, Mariks or Thata Marikar to his friends, he was a household name in sports. At school St Sylvester’s College he was a top class sportsman, a fine boxer in Stubbs Shield meets, a public school athlete. He also played football and hockey and led both teams. After leaving school he continued his sports playing football and hockey for Young Stars SC, football for Green Field SC and Kandy YMMA. He also played for Saunders SC Colombo. Kandy District and Up-Country.
He started his career with the Marketing Department and played football and cricket and also for the Government Services team. He led the Government Service Football team in 1956, and later served the Army 2 SR and played and led their football and cricket teams before taking to journalism.
He worked for the 'Times Group' and later for the Wijaya Newspapers for 35 long years from 1962 to 1997.
Mariks used his pen to tell the country what was happening in Kandy in his own inimitable style of writing. He was an outstanding gentleman and highly respected journalist, who kept his levels.
Dr. C.D.L. Fernando started his school career at S. Thomas’ College and ended with Royal College. He played for Royal in the big match against S. Thomas known as the "Battle of the Blues".
He was a distinguished all-rounder at cricket and rugger, whilst attending Royal College, University of Ceylon, SSC and later Kandy United SC at cricket. He played rugger for Royal and was the first Bradby Shield captain and later played for University of Ceylon, CR and FC. He was the epitome of a cricketer, on and off the field. His prowess as a rugby player too was well known. Though he studied in Colombo, he made a name after coming to Kandy in the medical and sporting field. As a cricket and rugby administrator his fairness and integrity was never in question.
CDL was Kandy's versatile sportsman, sports benefactor, philanthropist, and above all a gentleman. He was president of the Kandy Football League for over a decade and when Sri Lanka achieved Test status, CDL was elected president of the Kandy District Cricket Association and under his leadership several Test matches were
played in Kandy at the Trinity College International Stadium in Asgiriya.
Rugger took pride of place in his career and he did much for the promotion of Kandy rugger. CDL was president of the Kandy Sports Club in 1978 and 1979.
