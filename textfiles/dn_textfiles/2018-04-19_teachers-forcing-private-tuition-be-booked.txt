Teachers forcing private tuition to be booked

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has instructed his top officials at the Ministry to take stern action against the school teachers who insist that their students attend their own private tuition classes.
Some school teachers are reported to have harassed students who had refused to attend such tuition classes.
Some parents have already complained to the Education Ministry that certain school teachers have penalized their children for not attending the private classes conducted by the teachers of these government schools.
