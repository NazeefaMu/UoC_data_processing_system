China bound SriLankan passengers allowed to hop in from Mattala

SriLankan Airlines which ditch the Mattala International airport sighting high landing and takeoff expenses is once again welcoming the airport to facilitate the airlines’ Chinese in bound and out bound flights.
In addition SriLankan Airlines has also allowed passengers to get in and get off at the Mattala Airport. “We will also give the option for passengers who have already purchased tickets to China to embark and disembark from Mattala.Passengers can go to SriLankan counters and change their flight preference to embark and disembark in Mattala,” an official from SriLankan Airlines said.
SriLankan has been unsuccessful in negotiating for a new timing slot in China due to the closure of the Colombo airport for runway repairs from January 6, from 8 30 a.m. to 4 30 p.m. for three months.All other airports have allowed SriLankan Airlines to adjust their timing slots to suit the airport closure timings in Colombo.
Hence they have to take off early in the morning and have to land to ‘while away the time’; they have to land in Mattala and be grounded for three hours.“We will offer a free meals for passengers while they are at the Mattala Airport.”This will cost the airline and additional US$ 50 million, a source from SriLankan said.
