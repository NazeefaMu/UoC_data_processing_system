Scientific Cabinet reshuffle after President returns: Minister

A Cabinet reshuffle will take place in a scientific manner after the conclusion of President Maithripala Sirisena's tour of India and Japan, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera said so following an inspection tour of the Ihala Elahera Ela project, affiliated to the Moragahakanda Reservoir on March 11.
The Minister said the President had decided that a mere change of heads in the Cabinet was superfluous unless a reshuffle was done scientifically by allocating subjects to Ministers having subject-wise knowledge and experience.
He said the Moragahakanda Reservoir project had been a dream of President Maithripala Sirisena and its full implementation would be a reality soon. He said he undertook the inspection tour on the direction of the President to look into outstanding issues and resolve them.
He also said the Ihala Elahera Ela project had an environment -friendly tunnel system.
Responding to questions raised by the media regarding the temporary ban on social media websites, Minister Amaraweera said there were two schools of thought on the issue. One said it should be totally banned while the other maintained that it should come under some sort of control. He said China for instance, had completely banned social media websites. Since a large number of people, including the President, were being subjected to character assassination through the social media websites and Facebook, laws would be introduced to bring them under some sort of control.
Industries Deputy Minister Vasantha Perera, Matale District Parliamentarian Rohini Kaviratne and the minister said big time businessmen were responsible for the high price of rice in the open market as they are involved in buying container loads of imported rice in Colombo and transporting them to rice mills for re-sale on the pretext of local rice in separate bags at a higher price.
Moragahakanda project officials were also present on the occasion.
