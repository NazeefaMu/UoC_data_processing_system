SMSC celebrates 20th anniversary in style : Over 200 automobiles for the Eliyakanda Hill Climb 2017

Southern Motor Sports Club (SMSC) proudly celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2017 with a magnificent record of entries for the Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb 2017. Over 200 entries were received including nearly 100 motor car entries.
The history of SMSC dates back to 1997, when it was established by a group of motor sportsmen from the South, with the aim of taking motor sports to the South and to elevate standards of motor sports in Sri Lanka.
These founder members included Suranjith Premadasa, Preethi Palliyaguru, Ashhar Hameem, Andrew Silva and Lalin De Silva.
Suranjith Premadasa was elected as the founder president of the Club with Preethi Palliyaguru as the secretary.
Among the events organized by the SMSC, the Southern Rally and the Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb are the two annual events that stand high as two premier events in the motor sports calendar of Sri Lanka.
Recently, after completion of the first speed rally run to FIA standards - Rally Sri Lanka 2016 which carried the tagline ‘Rumbling Wonder of Digamadulla’ and was run in the Hingurana Sugar Plantation premises in Gal Oya, in the Ampara district with the concurrence of the Governing Body for Motor Sports in Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS), the Southern Motor Sports Club got ready for their next big event ‘Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb'.
The hilly slopes of Browns Hill, Matara will be deafened by the incessant cry of motor vehicles on Sunday (Feb.26) with the flagging off of the 21st annual ‘Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb'.
Known as the only outstation club, unremittingly affiliated to the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS) since its inception in 1997, the SMSC plans to organize this event to perfection. The track preparation, safety standards, time keeping, vehicle recovery processes, competitor relations etc. are expected to be met best standards available in Sri Lanka.
The Southern Eliyakanda Hill Climb track is a unique track, with four extremely tricky and challenging corners; the Single Tree Corner, Southern Corner, Residency Corner and Tower Corner, which the conquering requires high driving skills and perfect man-machine combination.
This is the very reason for all well-known drivers in the country taking part in this event with a large scale public interest.
This year's event will have a practice day on Saturday (Feb.25) and will consist of 10 motor cycle events and 24 motor car events. Scrutinizing of competition vehicles will commence at 7.30 a.m. on the race day and the event will start at 9.00 a.m. The prize giving will be held at the Pearl Cliff Hotel, Browns Hill, Matara at 4.00 p.m.
