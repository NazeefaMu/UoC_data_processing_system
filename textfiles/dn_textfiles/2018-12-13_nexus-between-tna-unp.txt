Nexus between TNA, UNP

PLOTE leader and TNA member MP Dharmalingam Sidharthan speaking on the TNA-UNP discussion said that he believes that Ranil Wickremesinghe would have given in writing that he agrees with the proposals made by the TNA, to support him in Parliament.
EPRLF leader and former MP Suresh Premachandran commenting on the claimed agreements between the UNP and TNA, said, the TNA is forwarding conditions to support Wickremesinghe and not the Tamil people. “I do not see that there is any point now placing conditions to the UNP as the TNA right from the beginning was very supportive of the UNP Leader.
Those conditions should have been given to him right at the very beginning when the TNA decided to support Wickremesinghe. He also said there was no point in putting conditions to Ranil, but those should have been given to the President because it is the President who takes the final decision.
