GMOA ticks Auditor General on Govt funding SAITM

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the Auditor General alleging financial misuse for Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital without taking it over to the Government through a proper legal agreement. GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said yesterday the Health Ministry pumps Rs. 250 million for this hospital for drugs and other requirements since August this year and annually the Ministry will spend Rs.3000 million for this hospital.
According to Dr. Aluthge, all including the Health Minister has already accepted the fact that there is no legally signed agreement exist in connection with taking over the hospital and only a piece of paper named a `letter on intent'. Therefore he said the Government has not taken over this hospital legally. "There is no Act, gazette or an agreement existing,he said. The Government can provide money only for an institution which has been established through an an Act of Parliament. The GMOA requests the Auditor General to commence an immediate investigation into this.
