Royal Ceramics shines at Annual Report Awards

Royal Ceramics Lanka recently won the Silver award in the Manufacturing Organizations (Turnover above LKR 5 BN) category at the 53rd Annual Report Awards competition organized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka).
The event was held at the BMICH with Prime Minster Ranil Wickramsinghe gracing the event as the chief guest.
The Annual Report Awards competition of CA Sri Lanka is the most prestigious competition for Annual Reports in the country. The event has helped to enhance financial reporting standards in Sri Lanka, keeping them in line with globally acceptable benchmarks.
Known for its quest for elegance and luxury living, Royal Ceramics Lanka is revolutionizing the interior design landscape, both at home and around the world. It is this attitude towards achieving ground-breaking results in all aspects of their business that propelled the company to commit towards producing precise, integrated financial reports in line with the highest global standards.
“We are proud to be recognized by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka for our excellence in annual reporting. Our dedicated team works year-round to make sure that our reports are always cohesive, transparent, and clear. This award is a reflection of our good governance practices, ethical operations and commitment to our stakeholders.” said Aravinda Perera, Managing Director, Royal Ceramics Lanka. The organization received a similar accolade for their financial reporting by the same awarding body (CA Sri Lanka) in the year 2015.
This is the first integrated report produced by Royal Ceramics Lanka PLC, reflecting globally recognized reporting practices including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Guidelines to present its economic, social and environmental performance to all stakeholders involved with the business.
