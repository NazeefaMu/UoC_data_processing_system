MR ceded SLFP chairmanship to Prez to save Namal, Shiranthi et al: SB

 
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa decided to hand over the chairmanship of the SLFP to President Maithripala Sirisena to save Namal Rajapaksa, Shiranthi Rajapaksa et al. But the issue related to Namal Rajapaksa cannot be revealed, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, he said that they did not wish for a possible future arrest of MP Namal Rajapaksa.
“We regret about the arrest of Yoshitha Rajapaksa but we regret more about allowing children to get involved in large scale businesses. The entire country knows that Yoshitha Rajapaksa handled the business. Persons who invested in this business say that the money they invested is not theirs.
It is similar to the case of the big house and land located in Kaduwela,” Dissanayake said.
“Basil Rajapaksa says it is not one of his properties and Chamal Rajapaksa says he has no idea about it. The house and the land is under the Mahinda Rajapaksa Foundation which is headed by Chamal Rajapaksa,” he said.
Sri Lanka needs a special unit like the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) that should function under the Police Department but the country should not see it as a political institution. In the past it was revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa deposited some funds, which was received as aid for the Tsunami disaster victims, into his personal account . Now the same judge who blamed himself for giving a judgement in favour of the former President is supporting him [Mahinda Rajapaksa],” he added.
Former State Minister Hemal Gunasekara said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was compelled to hand over the chairmanship of the SLFP to President Sirisena after a discussion held at the former Speaker’s house with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena, former President Rajapaksa, Shiranthi Rajapaksa and MP Namal Rajapaksa.
“I helped the former President to get nominations for the previous general election on a request by Shiranthi Rajapaksa. I know the former President very well because we attended the same school and my father assisted him to obtain employment at Vidyodaya University Library. My father was the Registrar of the university at that time. The former President is a very grateful person and he will never divide the SLFP. He will learn his mistake and come into the right path shortly,” the former state minister said.
