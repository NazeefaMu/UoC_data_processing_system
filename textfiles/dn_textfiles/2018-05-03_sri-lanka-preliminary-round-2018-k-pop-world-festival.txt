Sri Lanka Preliminary Round for the 2018 K-Pop World Festival

The Preliminary Round for Sri Lanka for the 2018 Changwon K-Pop World Festival will be held on July 14, at the Bishop’s College Auditorium, organized by the Embassy of the Republic of Korea.
The Changwon K-Pop World Festival, which celebrates its eighth anniversary this year, will be held on 5 October 2018, in Changwon, Korea. Since 2011, More than 10,000 participants from over 80 countries around the world have gathered in Korea to perform on this international stage. Today, it has become one of the largest Korean Wave festivals in the world, which binds people together, leaving differences of countries, races, and religions behind. Several globally renowned K-pop idols will also perform live at this Festival to motivate the participants.
With the gaining popularity of K-pop in Sri Lanka, especially among the youth, the Embassy has hosted such preliminary rounds over the past 4 years. All k-pop enthusiasts in Sri Lanka can take part in this year’s Festival by submitting the duly completed application forms (to be found on the embassy website: http://overseas.mofa.go.kr/lk-en/index.do/ or facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ Koreanembassyinsrilanka), along with a youtube upload link to their auditions in either singing or dance categories, via email to [email protected]., by Sunday, 13 May 2018.
Shortlisted Participants will be invited to perform live on stage on 14 July at the Bishop’s College Auditorium, and the winners selected on this date will be awarded the opportunity to participate at the 2018 Changwon K-Pop World Festival held in Korea, in October this year.
