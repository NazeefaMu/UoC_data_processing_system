Society must correct political culture distorted by former regime: Prof. Wijesooriya

The present society is struggling to correct the political culture distorted by the Rajapaksa regime, Professor Sarath Wijesooriya said yesterday.
Wijesooriya made these observations at an event held to commemorate the second death anniversary of Reverend Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, which took place at Ape Gama, Battaramulla.
Professor Wijesooriya said that it is important to reflect as to why the majority of the country decided to defeat the Rajapaksa regime.
“This is a question we should always go back to. It is equally important to consider the answer to this question. It is but a mere dream to build a proper governance without being sensitive to this answer,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of this government to build the world that Ven.Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera anticipated. His expectation was a country ruled by law. President and the Prime Minister of this government still have time to fulfill Ven. Sobhitha Thera’s wishes. We may not be able to voice these wishes the same way Ven. Sobhitha Thera did. But we must say that we will be completely dedicated to realize the political restructure his reverend wished for.” Prof. Jayasooriya also said.
“Our struggle against the political culture created by the Rajapaksas, should not be misread as an attempt to rebel against the present government.
It has been three decades since we started speaking about a new Constitution. The Abolishment of the Presidency, change of electoral system, power devolution, and reconciliation were not just the promises given by the Common Candidate at the 2015 election. Former President Rajapaksa also gave the same promises,” Professor Jayasooriya further said.
