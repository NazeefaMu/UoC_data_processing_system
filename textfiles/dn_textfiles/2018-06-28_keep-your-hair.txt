There is nothing more attractive than a long and glorious mane which shines with natural health. For many people, hair loss in has serious implications. It can be quite a traumatic experience for some while it can have life altering consequences for others. Try out these fixes which might be the answer to your hair rising issue.
 
Risks of having hair transplantation
Hair transplantation is generally considered safe, but risks include:
* Infection.
* Bleeding and some scarring.
*Patchy hair growth, which can often be corrected.
*Grafts that fail to take, which would mean repeating the surgery
* Pain is usually rare and fairly minimal. Half of the patients do not require any pain relievers, and the others take Solpadine or Panadol for a few days.
Hair extensions
Hair extensions can cause strain on our hair, which can, in turn, lead to traction alopecia if you continue to have hair. We always advise that you get your hair extensions applied by a professional. This will lower the risk of the extensions putting any strain on your natural hair causing hair loss.
Habits to follow to prevent hair loss
* Wash hair with mild shampoo.
*Choose a suitable shampoo for your hair type.
* Look at the ingredients to find a mild shampoo.
* Use a good hairbrush.
* Try a scalp massage.
* Test your hair for thinning if you’re concerned.
