Close to nature

The ability to interpret what he/she detects from the mind of the client, the spoken and unspoken thoughts, and, his/her talent when it comes to transforming that home into a reality is one of the major talents of an architect. ArchWorld features Archt. Damith De Silva share his thoughts on interpretation.
“If two people have a separate set of anxieties and fears then obviously the house design will be very different. Even with the same set of anxieties or fears the design will depend on the degree or severity of the anxiety or fear,” said De Silva
Certain clients want family ties within the family. So you are talking about an introverted house- All the activities are within the house.
“Most of the Colombo houses we do are introverted houses. We normally have extroverted houses where the environment and building are merged together. To have a reasonably well-functioning and extroverted house you need a good 30 odd perches - The internal and external activities are working as a whole. In an introverted house, all the activities are concentrated inside. You may have a center courtyard and you may have a center pantry area where the family ties are developed. Extroverted house is a house that entertains lots of people. In introverted it is only the family as a unit.

Depending on the attitude the designs will vary– lines, colors and textures matter. If you want the space to be more introverted we will go for darker shades, darker materials, solid materials, smaller courtyards. For extroverted you use white colors, less lines, glittery sort of finishes. If you are getting a sort of concentrated sunlight I would say it is introverted. If you take ample sunlight it is extroverted. When it comes introverted and extroverted the relevance of wind is less,” explained De Silva
Being an architect you also need to be tactful because some clients want prestige and ‘power’ while ignoring their human needs – rest, relaxation, belonging, identity and security.
“They want their house to reflect power, prestige and wealth. Then we are talking about a house and not a home. House and home to me, are two different sort of buildings. Home is a place where you have relaxation and family ties. Good ties are developed within a home. Some people have the mindset to reflect prestige and recognition in their houses. Prestige and wealth can be there, but up to a certain limit. Because to me security, privacy and family ties are important. Once you have those there is satisfaction,” added De Silva.

Where architecture education is concerned, one particular subject area is psychology. That is one of the major areas that they need to learn. Though a full understanding of the psychology of the person may not be possible for an architect, through maturity he/she can design a home for the client that he/she wants.
“When a client meets me, he or she may not tell me about an insecurity, fear or certain complexity that he or she is facing. As a good architect once you have a one to one dialogue you will definitely understand that particular client. During the house designs we become intimate friends.
Relative
So if you understand the thinking, behavior and the pluses and minuses you gain insight. If you feel they have a fear or a difficulty in some sort of an area you tend to tune into that. In Architecture there are no cut and dry solutions. They are very relative,” stated De Silva.
A person’s personality and the creation of spaces are interlinked. There may be a person who does not like the wind or sunlight coming in the same way, but there may be someone else who does. When it comes to a project you will have to privatize the requirement
“So you have to identify the main requirement, the secondary and the tertiary and how you start with the design. Once you study the client, if you feel the client is very much involved with the environment, if the person is more conscious regarding those areas, we will be giving the primary consideration for those areas. At the end of the day that particular client will utilize that home for a good 30 to 50 years. The architect’s responsibility is to fulfill the clients’ requirement
But if some person does not like the volume of sunlight coming in, we may not be able to cut off the sunlight to the required volume,” explained De Silva.
In architecture it is nothing but spaces that we are talking about. Various other elements could be added to get the maximum ambience of that particular space.
“When it comes to Architecture my personal perception is, if you are doing a reasonably good house for a client you need to understand that particular client properly- his personality, his occupation and the family ties. All these areas are linked to each other. When you compare one particular house with another house, they are quite different to each other. They are from the same architect. There may be an element repeated but the total house will be quite different each other,” pointed out De Silva
When it comes to design, in a tropical country like Sri Lanka light, wind and ventilation are very important in design. Personality is reflected in the form and shape of the house.
“With the lines we create walls, and in Architecture what we are talking about is spaces and volumes. To create the proper volume, those lines should be initially there with the designing. Then it will be developed into three dimensional shapes. So when it comes to a personality, for example a lawyer or a doctor, those two people will have their own types of niches, to relax and enhance themselves,” informed De Silva
Communication and confidence Communication and Confidence in the architect are really important.
“Sometimes I feel that some of the cleints pretends that he/she understands the design. At the end of the day once the building is constructed then they have problems and are not satisfied. Architect may have visualized the house by designing, but as a layman the client may have not.”
But now the technology is developed – we talk about 3D images and sketch up images. So once we do the designs, we do the three dimensional views of the house- each and every room.
Still until the client is occupied and living in that particular place for a couple of months or years he may not understand whether the features are appropriate. From the inception if the client believes in the architect, his input and his suggestions, then there will be very less room for dissatisfaction in the long run,” explained De Silva
In architecture, maturity matters. As a seasoned architect in the field for many years he knows what is on the client’s mind.
“I am in a position to understand what sort of requirement that person wants of me. That is the maturity. The client may say- ‘I need a massive living area. My master bedroom must be on the ground floor. But I have three kids and they will be on the upper floor.’ So first I will be listening to them. I devote a lot of time to my client for his requirements.
At the end of the day the client will be spending a good 25 – 50 million on a house and if they are clueless as to what they are going to get at the end of the day then what?. The architect may enjoy doing that house but if the client is not happy with the house then what?,” questioned De Silva
These days’ clients are very knowledgeable. The way the architect answers will determine whether he/she is selected by the client to build his/her dream home. They are very well informed. They have enough and more information. If you are true to each other, then the project will go without a hitch.
De Silva feels that living in a tropical country, if we need to use the fan or the light in the daytime we have failed in our design.
“The sunlight and the wind is something very unique to our country. As architects we work with the nature. Light, ventilation and wind are the primary areas. I also feel that maintenance is important. There is no point hiring the best architect in the world if the client is not going to maintain the building. I also love incorporating water bodies in my designs. They are soothing to the mind as well as the eye. Birds chirping amongst the fruit trees in the courtyard is also a nice element.” said De Silva.
