Stepping up the rescue effort, two more Cedric Boats along with seven naval personnel attached to the Rapid Action Boat Squadron were also dispatched for the ‘Jumbo’ rescue mission.

Having safely guided the elephant to the Yan Oya area in Pulmodai , the animal was handed over to Wildlife officials, a Navy media release said.
