Railway Unions’ demands will be met within next two weeks: Ministry

The salary issues raised by the Railway Trade Unions would be resolved within the next two weeks, Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said.
Ministry Spokesperson Vajira Abeysinghe said the Committee headed by the President would make a final decision and it would be conveyed to them through the Secretary to the President.
The Railway Operations Supervisory Union (ROSU) and the Ceylon Railway Guards Union (CRGU) last week decided to launch an indefinite strike if their demands for a salary increase was not met. The strike was called off after a meeting held with the Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.
Ceylon Railway Employees’ General Union head S.P Vithanage said the workers of the Train Controllers’ Union, Railway Engine Drivers’ Union, Railway Station Masters’ Union and the Railway Guards’ Union were given a Rs. 2,500 increment through the 3/2016 circular to their basic salary, Rs. 16,650, and now they were demanding a Rs. 350 increment.
A Committee of seven officers including the President, the Prime minister, the Secretary of the President, the Secretary to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Union officers were assigned to resolve the issue.
The unions insisted on Rs. 350 increase and stated that they would resort to strike if their demands were not met.
