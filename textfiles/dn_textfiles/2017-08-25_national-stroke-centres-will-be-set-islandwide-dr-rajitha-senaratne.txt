National Stroke Centres will be set up islandwide: Dr Rajitha Senaratne

Stroke prevalence in Sri Lanka is around 10 per 1,000 population. Stroke is a leading cause of disability among adults and the third leading cause of hospital deaths in Sri Lanka, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had said.
Minister Senaratne had stated that the National Stroke Centre would be set up at Mulleriyawa Hospital, while similar centres would be set up island wide. A stroke has been identified as the leading cause for paralysis in adults. He had expressed those views after launching the registry of stroke patients which had taken place at the Colombo National Hospital recently.
Minister Senaratne had stated that all State Hospitals offered treatment and facilities for stroke patients and the Health Ministry had now paid attention towards improving their rehabilitation facilities. At the moment, 98 percent of stroke patients in Sri Lanka were able to get their urgently needed CT scans of the brain quickly. Strokes pose a huge impact on the life of the patient as well as his/her entire family.
Therefore people should be educated on the prevention of strokes and emergency management, the Minister had stated.
