CTB, you are wanted!

A bus service exists from Mt. Lavinia to Piliyandala through Katubedda under route No. 255, which provides a great service to students of Moratuwa University situated in Katubedda. The commuters who attend schools in Ratmalana/Mt. Lavinia area such as Prince and Princess of Wales, Lalith Athulathmudali MV and Girls High School are greatly benefitted.
Way back in the 1990s there was an efficient bus service operating on Borupana Road – both CTB and Private – under route No 256 from Golumadama Junction on Galle Road up to Borupana Junction – nearly 2Km away from Galle Road. At that time there was no bridge over the Weresse River and only a ferry service operated to take the public to and from either side of the river. After a few years, a bridge was installed over the Weresse River – where the ferry service operated – and the government took steps to widen the road from the bridge onwards up to the point it opens to Colombo-Piliyandala Road. Already a CTB bus from Moratuwa Depot operates on this road in the morning and afternoon only to provide a service to people attending offices situated at Maharagama and Piliyandala areas.
Initially, 15-seater private vans used to ply on this road, at 15-minute intervals from either end of Borupana Road providing a great service to residents of Borupana at peak hours. Later on, when the authorities banned 15-seater vans from transporting passengers, the van operators turned to bigger buses that usually run on main roads, and the waiting time on either end of Borupana Road got increased from 15 minutes to more than 30 minutes – to get a full bus load of passengers for each trip. At this point, the three-wheelers cashed in on the situation and started providing transportation at concessionary rates to passengers, taking four passengers in each trip and charging only Rs 10 from each passenger. Later on, the three-wheel mafia took a firm grip on the situation and private buses suffered a slow death and there are no more private buses plying on Borupana Road.
Now the situation has changed drastically. Hundreds of students attend Kotelawala Defence University situated at Kandawala and many of the students who are residing in lodging places quite a distance away from the university in Katubedda and Mount Lavinia areas – after getting down on Galle Road at Golumadama Junction have no other option other than using the three-wheeler service to attend the university and to get back to Galle Road. Further the Medical Campus and the newly constructed Teaching Hospital of the Defence University are situated at Werehera on Colombo-Piliyandala Road – through which the bus on proposed route No 256 would ply – and as such a regular CTB bus service on this route would definitely make the lives of all the medical students and supporting staff a bit easier – when they have to commute to and from the Main University Campus and the Hospital at Werehera.
Additionally, the Driving License Issuing Office is also situated at Werehera and a CTB service would be of immense benefit to hundreds who call over at Werehera Driving License Issuing Office from Ratmalana-Mt. Lavinia area.
The Hindu College, as well as the Vocational Training Institute under the Ministry of Skills Development too, are also situated on Borupana Road for which a large number of students as well as teachers attend daily. Accordingly, it's high time for the State-owned CTB to come forward and break the three-wheeler mafia that operates on Borupana Road and provide an efficient bus service – which the people of Borupana lost almost two decades ago.
