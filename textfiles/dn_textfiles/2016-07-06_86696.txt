Jayawickrama and Van Heerden shine on final day

St Sebastian’s College’s 17-year-old right-arm leg-spinner Praveen Jayawickrama took three wickets for 50 runs off 33 overs on the third and final day of the third under 19 test against South Africa which ended in a tame draw at Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
With a narrow first innings lead of 33 South Africa opted to bat out the final day reaching 201-4 with Joshua van Heerden (78) scoring a half century and sharing a first wicket stand of 81 with Ricardo Vasconelos (48)..
The three-match under 19 test series ended in a nil-all draw with all three matches failing to produce a result.
The two teams will next play a series of three under 19 ODIs beginning on July 9 at the P Sara Oval.
