LTTE and ethnic conflagration in 1983
On June 20, in the article ‘Whither Sri Lanka Economy - Part II’, the following statement was included; “…ethnic conflagration in 1983 which was totally mismanaged by President JR who by not declaring an emergency for three days literally promoting the brutal murder of around 1,000 Tamils in Colombo and destroying their property. This gave rise to the birth of the LTTE ”.
Is this correct? As everybody knows Prabhakaran who became the leader of the LTTE killed Mayor of Jaffna, Alfred Duraiappah in 1975. With a known history like that, why do some people continue to say the LTTE or the terrorism started due to 1983 incidents? And if it is so, how many persons from Colombo and other areas who were affected by 1983 incidents joined the LTTE.
According to available records, almost all LTTEers were from the North and East.
