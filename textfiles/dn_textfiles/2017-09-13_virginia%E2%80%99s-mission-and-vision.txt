Virginia’s mission and vision

Most of us who are readers of creative works, are familiar with the name Virginia Woolf (1888 – 1941) not so much as a trendsetter in English writing, but as the wife of the colonial administrator cum writer of the well known novel titled as ‘A Village in the Jungle’ namely Leonard Woolf. But as I observe the name of Virginia is more known as a writer of fiction that changed the conventional patterns with special reference to the narrative technique of the stream of consciousness.
As far back as early sixties, I had the chance of reading a book titled as ‘Virginia Woolf: Her art as a novelist’ written by Joan Bennett. A Cambrian scholar. There was a time when I read over and over again, the work with much interest. The work deals on almost all the works of Virginia, with a special emphasis on her narrative works like ‘The Voyage Out’ (1915), Night and Day (1919), Jacob’s Room (1922), Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), The Waves (1931), The Years (1937) and Between the Acts (1941).
Published posthumously
Followed by interpretations on these works, Joan Bennett goes on to other works that include various articles of interest written to periodicals and newspapers from time to time. Then the reader gets the chance to read the diary entries of Virginia titled as ‘A Writer’s Diary’ written in 1953, which deals mainly on the creative process and personal glimpses. These works are published posthumously. In all, there are eight chapters.
In the introductory Chapter, Virginia Woolf is said to have stated in her collection of literary essays, The Common Reader, a statement that remains as her creative wisdom.
“Our first task and it is often formidable enough is to master his (the writer’s) perspective. Until we know how the novelist orders his world, the ornaments of his world, which the critics press upon us, the adventures of the writer, to which biographers draw attention, are superfluous possessions of which we can make no use.”
As the researcher Joan Bennett points out the terms such as ‘formidable’ and ‘perspective’ carry a multi-faceted panorama of meanings. As the researcher further points out, this is clearly depicted in her novels as she takes the basic principles of the novel as she finds them and adapts them to her own vision. Characters are described and tehn gradually made better known to us by their sayings and doings. They are related to one another by a series of events leading to a climax. Examples are drawn from her well known novels such as The Voyage Out, Night and Day, The Waves and Between the Acts.
Conventional forms
As Joan Bennett states, the basic task of Virginia Woolf had been to rediscover a new form of narrative as deviating from the more conventional forms of writings of either Arnold Bennett or John Galsworthy. As such, there are two courses. Firstly to understand the limitations of the conventional forms and secondly two introduce her own way of expression when she knew the best form is to utilise the sensitivity of expression via a psychological narrative form.
She preferred the forms of expressions as used by writers such as James Joyce and Marcel Proust. As a conclusive measure, Joan Bennett says that her novels are penetrated through and through with a sense of the strangeness of human life as though there were some other life guessed at, more ordered and significant of which men catch an occasional glimpse.
She needed to express her own peculiar feeling about things, events, people and places. In her own way, she had been nostalgic as far as abstractions permit. To express all this, she was impelled to invent for the creative force a form akin to poetic form Joan Bennett’s work goes a step ahead in this analysis on characters and human beings in Chapter two. In this direction, the researcher takes three narratives: To the Lighthouse, The Waves and The Years.
Fullest expression
Virginia Woolf as a creative writer is shown as perceiving the variety of impressions made by one person upon the people round him and his own ever changing consciousness of the surrounding world. Re-reading Virginia’s works may be of use today to rediscover how characters portrayed have depth rather than width. This is observable in the particularly in the novel The Waves. Through the narrative which bears the fullest expression of the subjective aspect of her creative genius.
In it, the attention is wholly concentrated upon six people and the human experience is revealed from within their minds. In this novel, minor characters are very nearly non-existent. Joan Bennett too discusses some of the minor drawbacks of the creative flow of Virginia Woolf. As she states like most other novelists Woolf can only fully communicate the experience of a limited number of human types. Further Woolf also creates a limited range of intellectual and moral types.
