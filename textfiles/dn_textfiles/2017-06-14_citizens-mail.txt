Citizen's Mail

Criticism, ozone of public life
A piece of information published in the newspapers is subject to criticism. Readers have the right to make observations and lodge their complaints/appreciation. It is the duty of the newspapers to publish same with or without editor's footnotes.
Regrettably, some newspapers do not follow this. They feel that it is an insult to the writer. Newspaper’s duty is to give correct information to the readers and healthy criticism has to be recognised.
They sincerely feel that correct information should be published. They may be highly qualified professionals or aware of the true position due to experience. This is healthy and commendable.
Those who wish to show their intelligence and seek publicity. This is also fairly acceptable. Those who are biased against the writer and wish to undermine him. The intention may be to insult him and put him in an embarrassing situation. This also could be tolerated if it is correct.
Those who wish to suppress the correct information given in the papers for their personal benefits. They are afraid that the correct information published may affect their future.
Some politicians are of this type. This is called covering a pumpkin on a plate of rice.
However unhealthy criticism should not be encouraged. Personal vulgar attacks, filthy language, information which may spark communal, disharmony, violence etc should not be published.
The press should be mindful of this matter.
