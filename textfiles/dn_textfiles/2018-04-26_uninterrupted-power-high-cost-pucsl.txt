UNINTERRUPTED POWER AT HIGH COST - PUCSL

The Public Utilities Commission yesterday warned that power will have to be purchased from the private sector at a higher cost, and there is no issue in continuous power supply.
Refuting media reports of an impending power crisis as mentioned by the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers’ Union (CEBEU), Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe yesterday said power can be supplied through emergency power or various other mechanisms.
“It is not an issue of power supply, but it is an issue of cost. We are looking at the possibility of using generators owned by the government and government owned entities in emergencies.
“There are more than 150 MWs of government owned generators in various government institutions,” the DG said.
He further said that they are looking at the possibility of running these generators as soon as possible.
“The possibility is being explored and we will brief the government accordingly.” he said.
The PUCSL is also preparing a comprehensive emergency preparedness plan for the utility sectors.
“In 2016 and 2017 we had some natural calamities and there were some interruptions to these essential services. We have to be prepared for that,” he added.
Responding to a question regarding the Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGEP), the DG said that the generation plan was approved on July 19, 2017.
“Before the plan was approved, we conducted two public consultations and also held several discussions with the CEB and other relevant authorities. This plan has already been implemented and all the current CEB projects are done under this plan. But this plan has no solutions for the issues that came up in 2018 or later,” he said.
