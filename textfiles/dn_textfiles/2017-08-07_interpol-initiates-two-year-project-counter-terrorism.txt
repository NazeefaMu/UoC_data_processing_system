INTERPOL initiates two-year project to counter terrorism

The International Police Organization (INTERPOL) has initiated a two-year project to counter terrorism and related transnational crime in South and Southeast Asian countries.
The conference, a first step in the endeavour, is organised in full collaboration of the Sri Lankan Police and will be inaugurated on August 8 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the BMICH and continue until August 10.
Sponsored by the Canadian Government, the programme will help enhance law enforcement capacity in South and Southeast Asia and prevent and disrupt terrorism and related transnational crime. Understanding the laws applicable, common tactics and the human resource aspects and challenges will be the subjects of discussion.
The conference is to be attended by about 45 senior officers working in crime investigation, terrorist investigation, transnational crime, intelligence office, law enforcement and police training representing Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Sri Lanka. The conference in Colombo takes place under the guidance and support of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake.
