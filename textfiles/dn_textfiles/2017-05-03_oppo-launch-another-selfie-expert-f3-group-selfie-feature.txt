OPPO to launch another selfie expert F3 with Group Selfie Feature

Global smartphone photography leader OPPO is set to launch another new dual selfie camera smartphone, the OPPO F3, which enables users to snap both great selfie and group selfie shots with ease, thanks to its dual front cameras.
Since the first sale of F3 Plus from April 1st in Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and Myanmar, OPPO has been accelerating the group selfie trend across the countries. The new F3 will inherit the dual front camera -- onefor individual selfies, and another wide-angle cameradesigned for group selfies withtwice larger field of view.The F3 will also feature high performance hardware and optimized software to provide smooth user experience and satisfy consumers’ everyday use.
Say goodbye to the days when it was awkward to fit a large number of people into the frame, or having faces cropped out, or missing out the background in a selfie shot. OPPO aims to make easy to travel and snap selfies without ever to carry a selfie stick around. Leading the selfie revolution and the phone camera industry standards with the recent ‘Selfie Expert’ F-series, the new F3’s excellent ‘group selfie’, distortion minimizing features and beautify function will allow users to capture group selfies with an increased fieldofview.
“Selfies and group selfies reflect how people, especially the younger generation are socializing and sharing their lives with each other.” said Sky Li, OPPO Vice President and Managing Director of International Mobile Business.
“The new F3 will be another selfie expert to transform selfies and group selfies to more natural, beautiful, and most importantly, much easier to capture, even when taking with a large group of people.”
The F3 launch will kick start a series of group selfie campaigns in Sri Lanka to empower consumers the new group selfie trend, and encourage consumers to celebrate togetherness by taking group selfies. “Signs from Sri Lanka is very encouraging which we saw from the pre-order phase of F3 Plus, where Sri Lankans have embraced the new ‘Groupfie’ trend whole-heartedly. It is only natural from them to realize that they don’t need to be stuck with Selfie Sticks anymore and that OPPO will transform any beautiful moment with your friends & oved ones to an exciting cherished capture. “said Tom Zou, CEO, OPPO Sri Lanka.
OPPO is devoted to perfecting the selfie camera technology. In 2013, the N1 model pioneered the world’s first rotating camera.
In 2016, the F1 Plus was the first-ever device to sport a 16 megapixel front camera.
Taking one step further, the revolutionary dual selfie front camera F series is taking the standards of camera hardware and selfie photography to new heights.
