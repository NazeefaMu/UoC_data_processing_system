French loan to uplift dairy industry

France has agreed to provide Sri Lanka with a 13.9 million Euro (Rs. 2514 million) soft loan towards the implementation of a milk processing project covering six processing centres.
This symbolises the the long-standing and cordial relations spanning nearly 45 years that exists between the two countries, the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media said in a press release yesterday.
This loan would facilitate the full refurbishment and renovation of six small scale milk processing cooperatives and organisations with the ability to pasteurize and sterilize nearly 4,500 Litres of milk per day, the release said.
The new equipment would enable the production of high quality milk through the process of computerised observation. It would boost the government’s target of achieving self sufficiency in milk products by bridging the gap between demand and supply, drastically.
The MoU in this regard was signed by the Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge and Deputy French Ambassador Mrs. Isabelle Miscot at the Finance and Mass Media Ministry recently.
