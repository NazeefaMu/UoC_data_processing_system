Welikada Prison Riots
Suspects remanded till September 4

Police Narcotics Bureau Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa and former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who were in remand custody over the Welikada Prison riots in 2012, were further remanded until September 4 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage, yesterday.
The Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of Neomal Rangajeewa said they filed for bail application at the High Court, adding that the High Court Judge had denied it.
The Attorney-at-Law said that the CID were yet to conclude its investigations.
Prison officials informed the magistrate that former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa did not appear in Court due to ill health.
CID officials said that more time would be required to look into the suspects’ phone records.
