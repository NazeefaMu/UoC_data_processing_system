Kerry Packer’s World Series Cricket 40 years on

The first time Kerry Packer died was on Sunday 7 October, 1990. He had a heart attack during a polo match. Three minutes into the first chukka he slumped down, arms around the neck of his horse. He was clinically dead and stayed that way until he was brought back to life with a defibrillator.
When Packer was asked about the experience he replied: “I’ve been to the other side, and let me tell you son, there’s fucking nothing there.” When he died for the second, and final, time in 2005, they played a clip of a TV interview at his memorial service. “The good news is that there’s no devil, the bad news is that there’s no heaven,” he said. “There’s nothing.” The moral, Packer suggested, was that you should do what you want.

World Series Cricket reeled in some big names in the game. 
And for much of his life, he did. Packer collected tall stories like a general does his ribbons. Wisden once listed five favourite tales that, it clarified, were “believed to have a basis in truth”. Even the punctilious staff of the Almanack were happy to relax their strict adherence to the facts for the sake of a good Packer yarn. They included the time he shut up a loudmouth American who kept bragging he was worth $200m by offering to toss him for it, “double or nothing”. And another when, turned away from one pub, he ate somewhere else, settled the £100 bill by writing a cheque for £100,000 and told the publican: “Before you bank it, take it to the other pub and show it to the bloke who wouldn’t give us any food.”
There was plenty more of them on BBC Radio 5 Live last Wednesday when it aired a programme about the tallest Packer tale of them all, World Series Cricket. Ian Chappell tells one about the TV director Peter Faiman, who used to do the live shows for Packer’s Channel 9. When Faiman tried to quit his job, Packer offered him more money to stay on. Faiman turned him down. So Packer offered him a new job title too. When Faiman explained his decision wasn’t anything to do with influence or affluence but just because he was “feeling so bad now I could kill myself” Packer pulled a gun out of his desk and said: “I can fix that too.”
The World Series Cricket story first broke 40 years ago this week, in early May 1977, after it was leaked to Ian Wooldridge and the Daily Mail. “Cricket ‘Circus’ Threat to Test Matches” ran the Guardian’s front page headline. Those first reports suggested Packer was planning a series between Australia and the Rest of the World, that Tony Greig, Derek Underwood, Alan Knott and John Snow had signed up, and so had Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Andy Roberts, Imran Khan, Barry Richards and Mike Procter. In the end WSC was much grander than that. Packer eventually hired 70 players for 16 “Supertests” and 38 one-day games over two seasons.
Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote “with the possible exception of WG Grace” – astonishing that he thought he had to add the caveat – “there has been no more influential figure in the history of cricket”. It was Packer who brought in coloured kit, floodlit day/night matches, white balls, and drop-in pitches grown in greenhouses. It was Packer who insisted players start wearing helmets, because, as he told Chappell: “I’m not paying you to lie around in hospital for six months.” It was Packer who overhauled the way the game was televised and marketed. And it was Packer who forced the boards to start paying the players more. Before WSC, England’s players were earning £210 per Test. Soon after it, they were on over £1,000.
Packer was always honest about why he did all this. It wasn’t for the love of the game. “Is it right that you went into the Supertest business to make money?” he was once asked under cross-examination in the high court. “Of course,” he replied, “I have never said anything else.” All he wanted from it were the exclusive broadcasting rights to Australia’s matches. It took him three years to win them, and in that time he changed the game forever.
On the BBC, Chappell argues the IPL is a “descendant” of the WSC. And there is truth in that, in the way the IPL is packaged and sold to a mainstream audience, the pressure it puts on players to choose between representing their country and playing in a lucrative league. Like WSC, the IPL has forced the sport into accelerated evolution.
There are broader trends, too. Now, as then, Cricket Australia finds itself in the thick of a dispute with its own players over how much it is paying them. The players today may not be on “fish and chip” money, as Chappell used to call it, but the Australian Cricketers’ Association have just knocked back CA’s proposal to pay them AU$419m over five years, an offer the ACA say will short change female players. Now, as then, the question of TV rights is up in the air, in Australia and elsewhere.
So many of the currents that swirled around Packer and the WSC are eddying again today and the game once again seems to be entering stormy waters.
The difference is that WSC was only ever a means to an end. Packer wanted the TV rights and when he had them WSC was shut down. But who knows where the IPL and Twenty20 cricket goes from here?
