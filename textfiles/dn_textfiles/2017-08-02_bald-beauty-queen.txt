Bald beauty queen

 An 18-year-old teenager who was left bald after pulling out all her hair while battling anxiety is now a beauty queen.
Sarah Pennington, 18, from Pottstown in Philadelphia shaved her head after developing ‘embarrassing’ bald spots while battling anxiety and depression. It turns out that Sarah has trichotillomania, a disorder which saw her pluck out all her strawberry blond hair, eyebrows and eyelashes after she developed the condition seven years ago.
Sarah covers her hair, which is shorter than an inch, beneath hats and wigs, describing it as an 'irresistible urge' to pull her hair out.
But two-years-ago, after receiving psychiatric help she started to embrace her condition and stopped hiding her baldness in public.
The young girl then decided that she wanted to raise further awareness about the condition by entering beauty pageants.
Sarah's been entering beauty pageants for two years now, winning first place and runner-up positions and using her platform to talk about trichotillomania. AP
