Indonesia beat S. Korea to reach Thomas Cup final

KUNSHAN, FRIDAY: Indonesia beat South Korea 3-1 on Friday to reach the Thomas Cup final and raise hopes of their first victory in 14 years in a competition they once dominated.
Indonesia, who have won the men’s team tournament a record 13 times, proved too strong for South Korea, who stunned hosts China a day earlier.
Son Wan-ho, who beat world number one Chen Long in a pulsating quarter-final, glided past Indonesia’s Jonatan Christie 21-10, 21-16 to put South Korea ahead.
But Indonesia rallied in the following match, with Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan securing a 21-15, 21-12 win over Lee Yong-dae and Yoo Yeon-seong. AFP
