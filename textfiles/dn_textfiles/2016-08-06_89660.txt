“Ranjan Wijerathna MV is a school situated within the Pelawatta sugarcane plantation and the livelihood of most families is farming and providing manual labor. The girls who were well aware of the financial dificulties faced by their families had worked in the sugarcane fields to collect money for their sportswear to attend the championship in Matara. It was with great difficulty that I convinced the parents to permit their children to take part in sports and attend practices. Today the girls’ enthusiasm and dedication paid dividends. I am lucky to have the fullest support of our principal” she added. Lasses from Buttala overcame Buwanekaba MV Maharagama 10/0, Mahinda MV Gettuwana 11/9, Anurudhdha MV Lunuwila 14/8 and Devi Balika MV - Dompe 22/17 to bag the division B crown in Matara.
