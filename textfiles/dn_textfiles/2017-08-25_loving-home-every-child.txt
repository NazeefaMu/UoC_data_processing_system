A loving home for every child!

Families are where we connect ourselves in relationships to past, present and future generations. Family is where we experience our biggest triumphs and deepest vulnerabilities. It is the fundamental building block of the society and is the foundation for civilization. One learns loyalty, cooperation and trust. Within this smallest unit of the society, people learn to love themselves and each other, to bear one another’s burdens to find meaning in their own life while giving a purpose to the lives of others and to feel the value of being part of something greater than them.
There is a universal desire of oneness among human beings which gives them the need to belong. That is why humans collaborate, support common causes, cheer for sports teams, feel patriotic and build villages, towns and cities. For the fortunate the desire to belong begins with loving parents and siblings in a home which is a privilege. Those who had less than this ideal situation of growing up, still have the capacity to forge families of their own making. SOS Children’s Villages in Sri Lanka provides alternative care for the children who have lost their parental care around the nation thus making them a part of a family.
Deputy National Director/Director Programmes, SOS children’s village Sri Lanka, Divakar Ratnadurai said in Sri Lanka an estimate of 340,000 children have lost parental care due to different reasons.
“Some have lost parental care due to unavoidable circumstances such as death, illness, accidents or a natural disaster while others lose family due to poverty and social issues. These children grow up without basic human needs such as food, water, clothing and shelter. They also lack sanitation, healthcare and education. Some children face physical, sexual, verbal or emotional abuse,” he said.
“We provide the victimized children love, care and education while emotionally stabilizing them. SOS model is based on the belief that every child needs a mother, a safe home, siblings and a stable community. SOS families live together forming a supportive village environment where children enjoy a happy childhood. Every child here receives education and skills training so that they may be successful and contributing members of the society. The village has a kindergarten and a school not only for SOS children but for the residents in the area as well. The curriculum in the school is managed by the government and is in line with local education guidelines,” Ratnadurai added.
Four main aspects
SOS Children’s village stands for – a loving home for every child and is a concept of Hermann Gmeiner who set up the first SOS Children’s Village in Austria in 1949. At Present SOS children’s villages is a private, non-governmental child welfare organization that is active in 135 countries. It mainly focuses on providing a family environment for orphaned, abandoned and neglected children and developing comprehensive community based social programmes for disadvantaged families. Gmeiner’s concept was based on four main aspects: every child needs the care of a parent who establishes a close relationship with each child. The children grow up in a family with girls and boys of different ages as their siblings wherebiological siblings are not separated if possible. The family is a part of a community that functions as a support system.
“SOS villages also has youth facilities that enable the children to make the transition to independent living and become responsible adults. At the age of 14 boys are moved into youth facilities while for girls the age of transfer is 18. At the youth facilities they develop realistic perspectives for their future, learn to take increased responsibilities and make their own decisions. However the bond with the SOS mother and siblings is unbreakable and the children are always welcome into their homes,”Ratnadurai said.
Sacrifice

In each children’s village, they are cared for by women who have dedicated their lives to being SOS mothers. “SOS mothers raise a generation of children as their own and are capable of meeting children’s physical and emotional needs from infancy right up to adulthood. There are SOS aunts who assist the mother when the need arises. The villages are equipped with retirement houses for these mothers who render a valuable service sacrificing and dedicating their lives to raise these children although not biologically theirs,” Ratnadurai said.
“We are extending our work with families through Family Strengthening Programmes where we assist disadvantaged families to prevent crisis leading to the worst scenario of the children being placed out of home care. We help the mothers to be self-employed so that they can live independently caring for their children,” he added.
History
SOS was registered as a charity organization in 1980 and for the past 36 years has supported over 41,000 children in the country. The first SOS Children’s village in Sri Lanka was established with sixteen family houses in Kesbewa close to Piliyandala town. The SOS kindergarten, medical center and the Hermann Gmeiner School cater the needs of many adults and children of low income families in the area. The village supports around 583 children and young adults through Family Strengthening Programmes at present.
The second SOS center was opened in 1985 in Nuwara Eliya and is an example of unity and co-existence among children of Sinhalese and Tamil communities. The third SOS Children’s Village in Mampitiya, Galle consists of twelve family houses, SOS kindergarten, Hermann Gmeiner social centre, youth facility for boys and girls and a home for retired mothers. Around 316 children and adults receive assistance under FSP. Fourth and Fifth SOS villages are situated respectively in Anuradhapura and Monaragala housing hundreds of children while supporting many more low income families scattered around the area. The SOS Children’s Village in Jaffna is home to 95 children including the SOS youth facility. Additional 308 children are supported under the FSP programme.
However SOS children’s villages now need to raise awareness among the public in Sri Lanka regarding the need for funds to protect and care for children under the organization.
“During the past 36 years, SOS was mainly funded by international individual donors and other philanthropists mostly living in Europe. With the end of the war Sri Lanka is now considered as a middle income country in Asia and SOS children’s villages international has started to channel more international subsidies to poorer countries in Asia and in other continents. From year 2016 onwards part of our subsidy was syphoned. By the year 2023, SOS children’s villages in Sri Lanka has to be self-sufficient through local sponsorship and donations in order to continue helping children who have lost parental care and who are now loved and cared under SOS banner.
We hope that individuals and corporates will assist our children and that this journey continues benefiting many more children in the country,” Ratnadurai said. To sponsor a child or for further information email [email protected] or log into www.soschildrensvillage.lk
