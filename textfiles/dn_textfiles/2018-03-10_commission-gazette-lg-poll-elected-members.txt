Commission to gazette LG poll elected members

The Elections Commission said it has confirmed the gazette notification containing the list of elected members to be finalised at the recently held local government elections.
The gazette notification will reportedly include the 25% of female representation as required by the Elections Commission.
The Commission reports that 535 females have been elected for local government bodies at the divisional level. However, the Commission sources point out that the requirement of 25% of female representation is not met at 15 local government bodies from the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
In the recently held local government election, 8,690 members were elected in total. Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said the elected members will assume duties on March 20.
