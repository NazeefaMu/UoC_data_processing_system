Cabinet nod for financial sector reform

Cabinet dealt with much needed financial sector reform as a series of bills and acts on regulating capital markets and reforming the tax structures were approved this week.
Approval was granted to introduce a new Securities Exchange bill replacing the current Securities and Exchange Commission Act No. 36 of 1987.
It is expected to strengthen the independence of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and make attractive the capital markets of Sri Lanka. The bill also proposes to grant wide ranging powers to the SEC to regulate capital markets thus making it safer and attractive for investors when they choose to raise capital through it.
The much awaited New Inland Revenue Act, also recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) received approval for its concept paper Cabinet. The legal draftsman will now be directed to draw up the bill.
The new Act seeks to “create a better tax structure by modernizing tax administration based on noncomplex tax principles and improve efficiency of the department of Inland Revenue”.
In addition, the Prime Minister also has sought to introduce the drafting of a ‘Voluntary Disclosure Bill” and a “Foreign Exchange Bill”. The former aims to “encourage the payment of income taxes and similar programmes implemented in various countries have increased their tax earnings”.
As the above acts and bills seek to make the investment environment within the country more attractive while ensuring a greater tax base for the government, the Prime Minister also sought approval to set up a, “Negotiation Committee and a Project Committee to prepare a suitable mechanism to attract foreign investments through Public-Private Partnerships”.
