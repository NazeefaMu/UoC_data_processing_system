Bulges wobbles and bubble butt troubles

Leg-hugging strides may be the pinnacle in pants fashion, but skinny jeans are likely to be squeezing their male hosts too tight in a particularly sensitive area, new medical research shows. British researchers warn that skinny jeans are responsible for the occurrence of health problems around the groin.
The skinny jean has been linked to inflictions including low sperm counts, twisted gonads, bladder weakness, urinary tract infections and fungal irritations, according to the research reports. Which effectually means that men encased in extremely tight pants greatly reduce their chances of fathering children. If an adult man wears tight pants all the time, it will keep him bunched up, so to say.
The ones in tight pants will remain fruitless while the ones with comfortable tailored pants remain heir-conditioned. Oh, the insufferable cruelty of tight jeans. Some sadistic, voyeuristic designer out there should be charged with the tyranny of discomfort. Hey, aren’t you tired of trying to shoe-horn yourself into tight little jeans? Don’t you feel that the world of fashion is decidedly strait-jacketing your nether regions and you are paying for the ache and discomfiting torture?
Now, the logical thing to do is to base most of our fashion sense on what doesn’t pinch, itch or tickle. After years of giving it some thought I have figured out with brilliant perception how they squirm into their tight pants. Rationally speaking they must start with a left leg wiggle, a jump and a squat. Then resort to a right leg wiggle, another jump, and a heck of a stretch. Then scream ouch on a couch and you’re done!
But somehow, many of you, both sexes included, have all decided that smashing yourselves into jeans is really pretty awesome. This needs to stop. I mean, at what age is it okay for a woman to stop warring with her womanly curves? I am dead weary of watching women fighting their curves.
And then come a different type of pants. You know, the kind that inspired me to coin the phrase that people in low-rise pants have recessive jeans. Sure, they might be in among ‘rappers’ and ‘gangstas’, but sagging pants on most people are just gross. No one wants to see the parts of your body you should be keeping covered under those jeans. Once thought of as a fashion faux-pas, shockingly, now some people actually wear their pants like this on purpose. If you are not in a ‘hip-hop’ group, buy yourself a decent belt and hike up those pants, please!
We all can appreciate a good body in tight jeans. However, some jeans, pants or shorts are simply too tight, leaving nothing to the imagination, or making even the most fit people look like a sausage. If you have to lie down and suck in your gut every time you put on your favourite pair of jeans, chances are they should no longer be your favourites. Ever heard of a nasty term that has to do with exposing in outline a woman’s womanliness? And guys, in the name of everything that’s holy keep your pants on at a decent level. We do not need to be able to see what religious denomination you belong to.
Thanks and God bless you. As long as you are reasonably shaped and you have mostly straight lines, you can ‘rock the look.’ Still skinny jeans should not look like denim pantyhose! They resemble unmentionables, those articles of ladies’ apparel that are never discussed in public, except in full-page, illustrated ads. Hear, hear people! We do not need our men looking like they have sausage casings on.
Leave the skin tight jeans for your girlfriends and sisters please. They should sit just below your waist and have enough room in the legs, butt and crotch area. Think less skinny, more slim, with just a slight little taper at the ankles. Buy your jeans a size larger and wash them a few times to get a good fit. Do not wear your skinny jeans or pants below your butt. It is not sexy. It makes you look like toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube and might inspire some uncharitable types to call you “Butthead!”
For one thing it is uncomfortable. Come to think of it, I do not deserve the punishing view of you overflowing your denim or pants either. Look, no one likes to see such a brimful of flab spilling out of anybody’s body. No one wants an eyeful of your jelly belly or your ‘blacmanging’ bottom either. Besides, as mentioned for the male wearer there is the danger of cutting off your circulation to a vital part of your anatomy. And one for those chunkier dames out there: Don’t you think that wearing jeans must just feel like such a cruel thing to do to your childbearing hips?.
Then we observe the ridiculous ripped jeans trend, always an unusual choice of garb that beggars belief that people actually seem bent on imitating the impoverished vagrant look. The question is how much did you pay for a torn garment to look like the victim in a runaway lawnmower hit-and-run case?
What you really need to do is to dress for comfort with clothes that provide the ease of movement and allow for breathable breeziness. Slightly looser well- tailored pants have that air of ‘swooshability’ about them because no matter which way you move, you are covered - no crack, no bulging bum-bums, no patti-whack!
At church Sunday services women in excessively tight pants are certainly a distraction. Not because of any sensual thoughts but because the rest of the congregation I believe, fear for the wearers’ modesty. Each time they kneel their rear view fellow worshippers pray that the trouser material encasing their sagging bottoms would be able to withstand the bulging pressure. Those tight pants are at times so darned taut, that many could hardly breathe simply being forced to look at them.
Fortunately, so far prayers appear to have been answered. There have been no ominous ripping sounds. The materials have not split asunder and bottomed out. Thanks to what only could have been divine intercession sparing the congregation bare ‘bottomous’ viewings.
As for the constrictive male nether garments, all I can say in their defence is that the term ‘egotistical’ may be an apt description of the wearers’ vanity. But hold on! It has absolutely nothing to do with any phrase that helps accentuate any free-wheeling bulges they choose to flaunt in skin-tight pants.
