Deshamanya R.K.W. Goonesekera was an inspiring teacher with a tremendous passion for his work. He was well-known for his ability to explain complex legal concepts and judicial decisions in relatively simple terms, Chief Justic K.Sripavan said.
The Chief Justice was speaking at a ceremony at the Colombo Law Library to unveil a bust of respected lawyer and academic Deshamanya R.K.W. Goonesekera yesterday.
Many notable judges,lawyers, and scholars attended the ceremony at the Law Library. Several legal luminaries also spoke about Goonasekera, who served as the Peradeniya University Chancellor and the Sri Lanka Law College Principal.
He died in November, 2014 at the age of 86.
CJ Sripavan studied under Goonesekera during his time at the Sri Lanka Law College and paid a glowing tribute about his former teacher.
“He was a profound scholar,a distinguished member of the legal profession, a gentleman par excellence, an advocate for human rights, and a citizen of integrity and vision,” Chief Justice Sripavan said.
Bar Association of Sri Lanka president Geoffrey Alagaratnam rememberd Goonesekera as a legend of the legal profession.
“R.K.W. was not merely a great lawyer with a great legal mind. He was an academic, a scholar, and a jurist of exceptional calibre.”
“He demonstrated in his teaching career, both at the Peradeniya University and and as Law College Principal that he was an exceptional teacher. Above all, he was a genuine and sincere human being whose thought patterns were sound and strong,” he said.
Human rights lawyer J.C. Weliamuna praised Goonesekera for his commitment to free speech and his respect for dissenting views: “He encouraged dialogue between those who disagreed on certain issues, and he openly encouraged junior colleagues to discuss things openly with him,” he said.
