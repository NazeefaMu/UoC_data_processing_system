Beauty trends that are expected in 2019

Dip powder nails: These aren’t exactly new per
se - they’ve actually been available in salons for years - but thanks to social media, the manicure is staging a comeback. Think of them as somewhere
between a regular manicure and a fake nail
 
Baby Bangs: They’re certainly not for everyone, but as the photos for cropped bangs prove, when you go short, the payoff is big.
 
Glossy makeup: After years of liquid lipstick, the tides are turning and its lip gloss’s time to shine again.
Standout lips: Well, this one seems kind of obvious. When isn’t bold lipstick in?
 
 
Almond nails: It looks like we’re all ready to put coffin nails to rest. Almond nails - long nails that come to a rounded point - is gaining momentum for 2019. It makes sense, given that the shape makes your fingers look longer.
 
Going gray: 2018 was a big year for embracing your natural grays. Celebrities like Chrissy Teigen, Jessica Biel, and Katie Holmes all did it on the red carpet, while women at home shared their own personal gray journeys. The trend will continue in the New Year.
