Melsiripura residents up in arms against water bottling plant

Residents of Melsiripura held a demonstration blocking the Kurunegala–Dambulla main road yesterday morning protesting against a water bottling plant run by a private firm in Omaragolla.
The convener of the protest J. K. S. Dharmawardene said 1,000 families in the area were threatened by an acute shortage of drinking water as the plant had dug over 100 feet deep wells to obtain water for bottling.
He said the underground water sources would dry up in the near future. The protesters demanded the closure of the plant.
Hiriyala UNP Chief Organiser Jagath Manjula Yapa arrived on the scene and told the protesters that the owners of the plant promised to close it temporarily following discussions held with him.
He ensured that it would be closed down altogether very soon.
Gokarella police said the demonstration obstructed vehicular movement in the area for nearly two hours.
