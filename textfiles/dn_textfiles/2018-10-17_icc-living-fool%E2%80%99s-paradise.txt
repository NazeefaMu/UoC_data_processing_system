Is the ICC living in a fool’s paradise?

The senior manager of the ICC Umpires and Referees was seen issuing a statement carrying a brief for their Match Referee and chairman national selection committee of Sri Lanka Graeme Labrooy. The statement articulated the stance of the ICC clearly stating that the ICC does not see any “conflict of interest” in his role in performing dual roles. By the language used in the press release it was clear it was done at the behest of Labrooy as it contained hints of a spin where it had attempted to give the impression that the ICC engaged his services only in women’s cricket which as everybody knows is furthest from the truth.
For the benefit of the senior manager we highlight below a few sensitive areas of “conflict” which may encourage him to reconsider his stance:
a) Does the ICC really think that the coach and the manager of the Sri Lanka cricket team is going to keep the national team from taking the field in a Test match without the concurrence of the chairman, national selection committee?
b) That being the case, is the ICC “satisfied” that a referee affiliated to the ICC chooses to confront (albeit wearing a different hat) members of their elite panel at a Test match on an extremely serious charge of ball tampering? Does such a situation not construe a “conflict of interest”?
c) When decisions made by members of the ICC’s elite panel of match referees and umpires are challenged by way of an appeal on perceived “technical/procedural errors” on the part of the match officials, and the matter is referred to the ICC’s Judicial Commissioner for arbitration who does the ICC think was offering technical advice to the attorneys?
d) How does the ICC expect the chairman, selectors of any member country to be in charge of “team selection” whilst being thousands of miles away carrying out “refereeing” duties for the ICC?
e) Should it surprise anybody that in such a loose environment selections are going to be influenced and manipulated by corrupt administrators? The normal protocol is for the entire selection committee to affix their signature on the “selection book” as dictated by the Sports Law of the country. There is a clear violation of the law of the land where the chairman is sanctioning team selections via Skype (as reported over the press) whilst being engaged by the ICC in the capacity of a match referee. In fact the guidelines stipulated under the Sports Law reads thus:
“The Chairman and all the members should sign the recommendation of the selection. If any member does not agree with the majority he still has to sign the document indicating his dissent with the majority decision. However, due to some reason beyond the control of the committee signature of any member or members cannot be obtained, the Chairman is expected to make a note indicating use of the particular member or members. If the member is not available for some reason, the Chairman has to make a note explaining the position.”
All these conditions laid out in the Sports Law are blatantly violated when the Chairman is engaged on match refereeing duties many miles away. Can the senior manager of match referees and umpires truly espouse “satisfaction” that laws of a member country is openly violated on account of the ICC?
f) In such a backdrop should the ICC be surprised that members of their anti-corruption unit is running round in circles trying to stamp out match fixing and corruption? There is speculation that a former chairman selectors is under investigation by the ACU. Isn’t the ICC taking a major risk is promoting dual roles in such a sensitive function? In an environment where several administrators, coaches, selectors and players are supposedly under the scanner with several phones being confiscated for forensic examination wouldn’t the image and reputation of the ICC be sullied should any untoward evidence emerge during the course of these examinations?
A clear example of external meddling in selections is the exclusion of Lasith Malinga from the national side for well over a year. In fact the chairman went to the unprecedented extent of declaring that Malinga was not in his World Cup 2019 plans. Anybody with a little interest in cricket knows that he was a victim of falling foul with the former Sports Minister and former president of SLC who ensured that he was sidelined from the team in concurrence with the chairman selectors. Is it not the country and cricket overall that is poorer when such players are sidelined? If iconic players such as Malinga can be victimized in the toxic system that is Sri Lanka cricket where double hatting is considered the norm, the ICC is surely living in the clouds.
It is understandable for the ICC to find it convenient and cost effective to engage officials performing dual roles. However, is it a “penny wise pound foolish” policy that is being adopted by the ICC given the untenable negative press that is being generated for the game of cricket due to match fixing, corruption and what not? It is common knowledge that “selections” are a key area being targeted by illegal bookmakers to include players under their control through corrupt channels. It is alleged that peripheral players are promoted through corrupt coaches and administrators for selection into teams.
It is suggested that such malpractices dates back to the nineties when the germ of match fixing first entered our cricket. The senior manager of referees and umpires may have little knowledge of cricket and the inner workings of the processes involved. However, he will hopefully contemplate the virtues of the dangers cited and take necessary safeguards to sanitize the processes in the larger interest of the game.
It must be admitted though that the main responsibility of rectifying this clear violation of the Sports Law rests with the Minister of Sports where a position of national importance is being degraded to the detriment of the reputation of the country.
