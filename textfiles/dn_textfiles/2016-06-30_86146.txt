Nissanka blunts Proteas  with brilliant 150 not out

 
Opening batsman Pathum Nissanka hit a brilliant unbeaten 150 and shared in an unfinished fifth wicket partnership of 162 with Ashen Bandara (52 n.o.) to put Sri Lanka on a firm footing against South Africa on the second day of the second under 19 test played at the Welegedara Stadium in Kurunegala yesterday.
The pair came together with Sri Lanka struggling at 69-4 in reply to South Africa’s first innings of 244 and batted right throughout the final session to put their team firmly in the saddle.
By the close Sri Lanka were 251-4 with Nissanka having hit 20 fours and one six in his 257-ball innings and Bandara eight fours in the 186 balls he has so far faced.
Fast bowlers Akonya Mnyaka and Wiann Mulder threatened to redress the balance when they grabbed two wickets apiece with the score stagnant at 31 and at 69, but Nissanka and Bandara put up staunch defence to thwart any further breakthroughs for the Proteas with a disciplined display of batting.
With today being the final day the match seems headed for a draw.
