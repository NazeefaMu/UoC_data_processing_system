First two projects launched

Power from garbage:
President Maithripala Sirisena inaugurated the first two projects (Nikasala Javaya) for generating 20 Mega Watts of electricity from garbage with an investment of Rs. 27 billion by two private organisations in Kerawelapitiya yesterday.
The government can solve the solid waste disposal issue within two years if there are no more barriers by the people with personal agendas, Mega polis and Western development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. Addressing the gathering at the inauguration ceremony, the minister said there are myths about garbage disposal. The people easily point their fingers at the government when something goes wrong, he said.
“There are four major garbage dumps in Colombo. Measures are being taken to turn those lands into urban gardens or parks," he said.
The minister said generating electricity from garbage was not a profitable project, but the government had to initiate the project to control the crisis.
“Through this project, we cannot earn the money that we spend on garbage collection. But the government has managed to control the crisis by recycling, making compost and generating electricity using garbage," he said.
He said many projects started earlier were stopped due to various reasons.
The ministry would continue the project if the companies fail to complete it, he said.
The minister requested the support of the authorities as well as public to carry out the Aruwakkalu project.
He said some elements are objecting it and requested them not to obstruct the project.
