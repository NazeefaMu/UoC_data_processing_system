Combating mob violence

There are a number of reasons that can turn otherwise non-violent individuals into a fierce mob. Lack of faith in local law enforcement agencies, distrust in judicial system, lack of education and potentially violent mindset further reinforce the urge to take law in hands. Mob justice is by all means a violation of basic human rights. It is an evidence of failure of law enforcement agencies in curbing crime, maintaining peace in society and ensuring the safety of its citizens, even if they are suspected of involvement in a crime
‘Mob justice’ is when a group of people take law in their hands and punish an alleged criminal themselves rather than getting the authorities involved and following proper prosecution. Incidents of mob violence are a clear reflection of a society that has lost all morals to be humane. Practices of ‘mob justice’ are common in many parts of the world and yet in 21st Century, mob violence results in assault of suspected criminals and most of the times death at the hand of a group of people comprising of co-operators and spectators.
These days people would incite the onslaught, make videos on their mobile phones and howl in excitement. It has also been, sadly, observed that many of the incidents take place amid the presence of security personnel who act as onlookers, forgetting their moral and constitutional duty.

Combating the scourge of religious persecution: Changing hearts and minds in the Middle East
The overriding lesson is that violent religious extremism had hurt everyone there. This shared experience promoted the message that religious persecution was an affront not to one faith or another, but to all people as they sought their own understanding of and response to the transcendent, including sects little known in the West, such as Baha’ism and Zoroastrianism.
Christians and other religious minorities obviously need to learn how to better organise and defend their right to practice their faith. But they also need allies among religious majorities to turn religious freedom into a legal principle and political practice. Such a transformation also is necessary to reduce the social discrimination and violence which characterizes many Muslim societies, in particular. While individual transformation seems slow compared to the sort of political solutions most people advocate, it is the best and only firm foundation upon which to build other changes.
In many countries around the world believing differently than the majority about God carries a high cost. We all have a stake in promoting a more humane and tolerant vision internationally. Thankfully today there are people doing so, and doing so successfully, in the centre of violent regions.
 
Racial intimidation
This is a post made by a Sinhala Buddhist who was caught up unintentionally when a group threatened 31 Rohingya Refugees comprising 7 men, 7 ladies and 17 little children in Mount Lavinia.
“Before people start justifying or criticizing let them first question as a Buddhist country should we have intimidated those poor refugees regardless of if we agree if they should be here or not. There were 7 men 7 women and 16 children some infants – these were not armed terrorists but frightened people surrounded by a mob asking for their blood – we must ask ourselves is this the Buddhist way – next where in Buddhism does it promote or condone violence this behavior is unacceptable. If the Buddha was here his eyes would be filled with divine tears and his heart would break to see those in robes and those professing to speak in the name of Buddhism promote violence and hatred. This was a very sad and disturbing day for me personally when will we learn and where is what we Sinhalese say about 83 etc. Never again to me it seems disturbingly worse if it can be so. When you are threatened or when you are faced with violence then you might realize the urgency of the need for positive action in this beautiful island home”.
BILL ON MOB VIOLENCE
All India Majlis-e-IttehadulMuslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Lok Sabha MP Asaduddin Owaisi sent notice of a private members’ Bill to combat incidents of mob lynchings.
Provisions of the Bill
The Bill enjoin penalties of a minimum of ten years imprisonment on public servants for “acts of omission”.
The Bill criminalizes the act of mob violence as well as acts of omission by public servants.
Provisions such as the establishment of Special Courts for the trial of mob violence, with judges for the same being appointed by a collegium of the five senior-most judges of the High Court are in the Bill.
The Special Courts shall also have the additional responsibility of receiving complaints of mob violence, and has the responsibility of setting up Special Investigation Teams (SIT) and appointing a public prosecutor. The SIT and public prosecutor, besides reporting to the Special Court, shall also be under the supervision of the Supreme Court (via the appointment of an amicus curiae).
Punishment of up to life imprisonment for those found guilty of engaging in mob violence, and special compensation and witness protection are also included in the Bill.
The most significant portion of the Bill is, however, the awarding of penalties on public servants for failing to investigate properly due to malafide intentions or wilful neglect of their duties.
Mob violence has been defined to include “any act where two or more persons injure, harm, oppress, and threaten any person’s enjoyment of a right guaranteed under the Constitution of India or on the basis of their identity.”
 
Punishing lawbreakers
First and foremost, the local policing system and judicial systems need to be improved. That not only involves punishment against those who commit a crime but also those who resort to mob violence falsely supposing it to be the only way of justice and assuming it to be their responsibility to do so. Only then we can expect a shift in the trends prevalent in our society. Secondly, it is very important to educate people with basic human rights. It is a way of empowering the individuals and making them realise that if today they violate someone else’s rights, tomorrow their rights might be violated too. There has never been such an urgency of teaching our children the lessons of non-violence. Violence is no remedy. The least we can be trained is to not become a part of such violence. Creating a social sense of refraining from violence would ultimately lead to a peaceful, tolerant society we all strive for.
