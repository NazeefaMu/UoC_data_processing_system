Musing moods

‘Musings’ by Hiranthi Jayasundara will be held at the J. D. A. Perera Gallery, 46, Horton Place, Colombo 7, on November 23 and 24 from 8am to 8pm.
Hiranthi explains what made her come up with the idea and what she wishes to encapsulate through musings. “When I was at ACAD (Alberta College of Art and Design) Calgary, I have seen galleries of Art from talented Students and Artists. I have visited many such Art exhibitions and Art Museums. People display their work to show the world their talents and also to be admired. As I have a reasonable collection of my paintings, I thought it may be a good idea to display them in a solo art exhibition, and some art loving people in this country may find them fascinating. And also, it will be a platform to display my artistic talents to the local audience,” she said.
Her ambition is to take her paintings into international art exhibitions in future. “Musings therefore is the stepping stone in my journey as an artist and to be recognized as an artist through my talents,” she said.
Hailing from the Southern Province of Sri Lanka Hiranthi is a talented upcoming artist in town. She had her primary and secondary schooling in Galle. While in grade 9, Hiranthi was selected for Canadian Crossroads International Student Exchange Program as the only student from Sri Lanka. She stayed with a young host family in Canada for three months and had to interact with children from over 100 countries across the globe for various social and cultural programs. This was one wonderful opportunity which opened up a whole new world for her at a very young age.
Hiranthi says she would rather consider her painting as a fulfilling pastime and a hobby which gives her immense satisfaction. “I do my painting during my free time and when I’m in the right mood. This kind of a thing need a lot of time and freedom and you just cannot rush through. But, finding a free time is little tough as I am a mother of two loving sons who constantly seek my attention. However, with my present engagement as an Art Teacher at Asian International School (AIS), I consider being an art teacher is a fitting metaphor for my life and career. After all it is my passion,” she said.
“I left for Calgary, Canada in 2009 to take up an assignment as a teacher and served in Canada until 2014. During that time I entered “The Alberta College of Art and Design” as an external student and studied Acrylic painting. Graduating from this academy was a big achievement for me, as I wanted to learn the proper techniques and obtain a deeper subject knowledge and I got the opportunity to sharpen and enhance my skills,” she added.
Hiranthi says when it comes to painting it is all about imagination and self-expression. “I only do Acrylic paintings right at the moment because the colours are easy to mix up to get vibrant shades and tints.I prefer to do figurative and Abstract Art, I do landscape Art as well. But I think my passion is for dancers and horses,” she added.
Musings will have a collection of 37, Figurative, Abstract and Landscape Art displayed to be admired and for sale
