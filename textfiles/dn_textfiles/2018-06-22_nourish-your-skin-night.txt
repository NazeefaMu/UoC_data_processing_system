Nourish your skin at night

NNO was the first skincare nourishment brand for night time use to be introduced in Sri Lanka. Women are generally habituated to apply something on their face before they leave home, during the day but nothing really before they go to sleep.
Mega Lifesciences a science based company realized the importance of night nourishment as the best form of skin nourishment, rejuvenation and revitalization through tons of scientific papers and articles published on this subject.
Doctors and experts recommend about eight hours of sleep every day to help the body reinvigorate itself. The body including the skin is exposed to stressors during the day that plays a damaging role and a sound beauty sleep of about 8 hours helps the body get back in shape and makes the skin look fresh and beautiful.
Anything applied on the skin at that point of time has the best possible chance of getting absorbed and work its magic. As far as the skin is concerned cell renewal and repair happens at night.
NNO was based on this concept of nourishing the skin at night which is the best time for absorption and nourishment to happen and ensuring that the skin gets enough moisture, firmness, elasticity, strength and smoothness to face the onslaught from the environment the following day. That’s why we say wake up to a beautiful skin, every day.
Valid scientific studies done on NNO prove that it has an excellent global safety record as proven by the Spin Control Institute, France on consumer trials and that NNO improves the key essential parameters of the skin such as moisture, firmness, elasticity and smoothness in as early as two to three weeks time.
NNO is probably the only brand of its kind with studies done on it to prove its safety and efficacy.
NNO is especially of great use for mothers in their middle age who might face problems of dry skin and wrinkles, which also has to do with their hormone changes leading to drop in the skin density and ability to retain moisture. This results in the skin looking dry and old. NNO is a sure remedy for this problem and its satisfied customer base both in Sri Lanka and overseas proves this fact.
