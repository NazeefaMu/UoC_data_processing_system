SL Economic Summit from Sept. 12

Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2018, organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Sri Lanka’s premier business chamber, is to take place from September 12-14 at Cinnamon Grand Colombo.
The theme for this year’s Economic Summit is ‘On the Fast Track to a Turnaround’.
Sri Lanka’s economy is once again at a crucial juncture in need of a swift and well strategized turnaround to bring about economic stability and development. This is in the backdrop of weak local economic growth, rising global commodity prices and uncertainty in global trade.
The summit, spanning over the course of three days, will be a wholesome opportunity to learn about government plans to develop the Sri Lankan economy (as well as the progress in implementation of plans), to improve business through knowledge enhancement pertaining to relevant sectors, to identify potential sectors and projects for investment in Sri Lanka, to clarify concerns with key government officials/industry leaders, and also to meet and network.
Last year’s Economic Summit saw the participation of many Chairpersons, CEOs, Directors, Senior Managers, foreign investors, senior government officials, and academics. Furthermore, over 40 resource persons, consisting of high profile cabinet ministers, policy makers, business leaders and academics shared insights and made recommendations on how Sri Lanka can transform its economy to realize its potential.
The outcomes of the discussions held at last year’s summit have led to policy strategies such as the Innovation and Entrepreneurship strategy and Digital Economy Strategy. Furthermore, at last year’s summit, the discussions around trade policy and in particular the Singapore FTA has moved forward with the signing of the SLSFTA earlier this year with a policy focus on accessing the ASEAN region.
At this year’s summit, the emphasis will be on shaping a turnaround for the Sri Lankan economy whilst delving deep into areas such as trade, investment and services that will help drive this. The focus will also be on learning from successful companies and steering the bureaucracy to work more effectively, thus meeting the emerging challenges.
