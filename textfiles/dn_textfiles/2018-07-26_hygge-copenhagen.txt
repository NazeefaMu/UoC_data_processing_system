Hygge in  Copenhagen

Denmark’s capital city, Copenhagen, is known as the happiest city in the world. For world-renowned Danish author, the late Hans Christian Anderson, it was a ‘wonderful city’. Today, the tourists who flock to Copenhagen can’t help falling in love with this ‘happy and wonderful’ city for its rich culture and ambience coupled with vast entertainment activities. A statue of Anderson, best known for his fairy tales, sits alongside the main Municipal Council hall of the city centre - as if he is still enjoying the wonderful feeling of the city. These were my first impressions of Copenhagen as a first-time traveller to the city.
The day I visited the city centre along with a group of Asian journalists, there was a carnival atmosphere everywhere with hundreds of football fans and seasonal tourists enjoying the sports spirit.
Danes often use the word hygge (pronounced “hoo-geh”) in Danish to express the feeling of this good social atmosphere and happiness – which we too enjoyed for a moment.
One of the most exciting things we noticed as novice travellers to Copenhagen was its bicycle culture. Our host, Dorte Maach (Manager, Group Communications of Grundfos Denmark) told us Danes love their bikes - it is one of Europe’s most bicycle-friendly cities where half the people pedal to work. There seem to be special bike lanes everywhere. Dorte often reminded us about the cycle lanes and to make way for cyclists. There are also plenty of places where visitors can hire bikes to explore the city if not rickshaws are also a common facility of the city. Most of us preferred to walk because it was one of the best ways to see the city and experience its vibrancy.
Since the city area is flat and built around waterways, it is also convenient to walk around the city covering some of the key points of interest such as City Hall Square, the Central Station and shopping and restaurant lanes. Besides, visitors are also interested in its royal palaces, Viking history, colourful houses along the Nyhavn canal and waterfront.
Nyhan’s glamour
We were told, around this time of the year, the city transforms into a magical metropolis with thousands of visitors and pleasant weather. Moreover, picturesque Copenhagen is a photographer’s dream. One of the best ways to see the city is to take a boat ride; the boats depart from Nyhavn, the old harbour and also one of the biggest attractions of the city. Along the waterfront are some of the most photographed colourful buildings of Copenhagen. Boats from Nyhavn drift past landmarks such as the Amalienborg Palace, home of Denmark’s royal family, Copenhagen Opera House, the Black Diamond library and student accommodation made from freight containers and the famous Little Mermaid statue. Our host Dorte organized a lovely boat tour for us and the fellow journalists with a ‘photographic-eye’ took the advantage of this tour to capture some of the best shots of the city on that sunny afternoon.
We also got the opportunity to visit Copenhagen’s famous amusement park known as Tivoli. It is the world’s second-oldest amusement park opened in 1843. Tivoli is open in summer from April to September. There’s no euro in Denmark; their currency, the Danish Krone is quite strong and one Krone is equivalent to Rs. 25.
Dining
Dining in Copenhagen is a delightful experience with restaurants serving an array of food - from open sandwiches and salmon delicacies to organic chocolates. However, the city is one of the most expensive places in Europe. Our host Dorte was keen to introduce us to original Danish cuisines and took us through some of the memorable, celebratory meal experiences at famous restaurants such as Flammen or Hereford Beefstouw. Flammen is an ideal place for foodies; it offers a large array of dishes that are almost works of art.
For a quick bite or an open sandwich (Danes love their open sandwiches), Tivoli Food Hall would be the best. The issue that the visitors often encounter in Copenhagen is the competition for tables and the poor service.
Danes love recycling. They have clean harbours and shops selling clothes made of organic bamboo. Most food served in public institutions is organic. By 2025, Copenhagen plans to be the world’s first carbon-neutral capital.
During a short stay in Copenhagen recently, we experienced some memorable moments which are better seen than explained.
