Court rules Geetha Kumarasinghe disqualified as MP

 
The Appeal Court ruled today that Galle District UPFA MP Geetha Kumarasinghe could no longer function as a MP as she had contested the election while bearing dual citizenship.
Kumarasinghe holds dual citizenship in Sri Lanka and Switzerland.
Under the constitution of Sri Lanka, no person can be elected to the parliament if they hold dual citizenship.
