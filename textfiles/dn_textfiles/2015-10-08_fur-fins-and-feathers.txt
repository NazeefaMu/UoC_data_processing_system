Of fur, fins and feathers


Head of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Peradeniya, Dr Asoka Dangolla
Gone are the days when people would domesticate only canines, felines, livestock and cattle. These days, people prefer having pets for shock factor. Yes, exotic is the buzzword when it comes to having a pet. From horses to guinea pigs, parakeets and white mice, Sri Lankans are increasingly choosing the more unusual option.
“Reptiles, tortoises and elephants are some of the unusual types of pets found in Sri Lanka. However dogs are still the most popular category of pets among Sri Lankans. This is because a dog can serve many purposes for many individuals in a family and society. Many rare and exotic pets cannot meet these requirements,” University of Peradeniya Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science Head of the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences Dr. Asoka Dangolla says.
He notes that having a pet is a popular concept in Sri Lanka. However the number of pet dogs and cats or any other pet variety has not been estimated yet. The total dog population (including stray and community dogs) has been estimated. The cat population has not been estimated. Though it has not been put into practice thoroughly yet, all dogs need to be registered.
“Pets are kept for various purposes. They keep company, share love and protect the owners. They are kept for services like guiding visually impaired people. They also serve the police, army, navy and air force. Pets generate a good income for breeders. Many people keep pedigree or exotic pets to show off. Some even keep them just for the sake of having a pet,” Dr. Dangolla said.
Cats and dogs are the usual choices when it comes to pets but there are people across the globe who prefer iguanas, snakes, frogs, crabs, cockroaches, geckos, llamas, tarantulas, scorpions and many other unusual companions.
Unusual pets
Unfortunately, people trying to keep up with the Joneses are buying unsuitable animals as status symbols today. Even though wild animals are by definition unsuitable for domestic settings, they end up being kept as pets by people who are not aware of the pitfalls of doing so.
“They have either little or no knowledge about them. Therefore it will be harmful to the animal as well as the owner. Also, others who are in contact with the owner of the unusual pet too might become affected. The animal may wound or injure people. Wild animals are often susceptible to known and unknown diseases. At least 60 percent of human illnesses are generated from animals. These, of course, do not come from domestic pets,” he added.
The most unusual kind of pet he has come across in Sri Lanka is a colony of ants which have been reared by a senior university professor. If you are going to keep a pet for the first time, educate yourself about how to care for the little creature.
“People don’t realize that buying a pet requires a lifestyle change. Dogs with long fur are not suitable for Sri Lanka. They are comfortable in cool climate. Sometimes people keep exotic pets without knowing how to handle them. The owner may like the animal but those around him or her will develop hatred towards the creature,” he noted.
Before you set out to choose a pet, be aware of some very important factors. The first is that certain varieties of animals, birds and reptiles are actually illegal to own as pets. There are many varieties of animals such as parrots, myna, chipmunks and other wild animals which are illegal to be kept as pets in Sri Lanka. Some animals like elephants require a permit to be kept in domestic settings.
Stress reviving
While caring for a younger sibling teaches children to be responsible and mature, another great way for children to learn these important lessons is to care for a pet. Family pets like cats and dogs are common in Sri Lanka. In other parts of the world, and particularly in European countries, it is common to give children their own pets to care for. Some dogs maybe too big for children to handle on their own, which is why there is an entire category of smaller pets that are ideal for children. Hamsters, Guinea pigs, tortoises and parrots make very popular pets for children.

“Everyone needs emotional comfort. There are certain people who are marginalized from society. They need a companion. Keeping a pet is also stress-reviving. Children learn how to communicate, share and care by keeping pets. They learn to recognize the pet's needs by reading their body language,” Dr. Dangolla said adding that he believes that dogs make the best pets.
“They are artificially bred by man to share their life with human beings. However if you are going to go for a pedigree you need to know a lot of details about the variety. People need to identify their needs and recognize what kind of pet they want. They should not get a pet for the sake of keeping a pet. Many want to have ‘some cat’ or ‘some dog’ as a pet. That is not fair by the pet. For example you should not buy a Doberman and expect him to keep companionship. Dobermans are guard dogs. Labradors, Pomeranians and Terriers make good companions,” he said.

Insects are preferred by people who love their unusual nature. A few preferred insects are stick insects, Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches, Doodlebugs, Praying Mantis and Giant African Millipedes. What keeps them from becoming more common pets is the fact they tend to be unclean.
“People are becoming more experimental about the kind of pets they want. Smaller species like hamsters are becoming popular. That’s because people can keep them in smaller places and flats,” says Nalindra (33), who lives in an apartment in Havelock Street. He is a father of two, who has bought his children two hamsters to tend to.

“They were not stuck on getting any one particular pet. So my wife and I began to research different animals. We couldn’t have gotten a dog because we travel a lot and don’t have a big house. But we were clear that we wanted a pet that’s affectionate, responds to us and is easy to keep in a small house. That’s when we zeroed in on a hamster,” he said.
Popular notion
His wife, Shazrina (30), adds, “Keshiya and Dulen love their pets and wouldn't exchange them for a dog now. The hamsters, Chip and Squeaker, are also very lively.
They wake up if we make too much noise in the night. When I come back from the market, they start jumping and making strange sounds. We feed them vegetables five to six times a day - cucumber, tomato, radishes, even lettuce. They get very excited when the fridge door opens.”
Kaduwela resident Balendran (40) who has a pet Pomeranian and Tortoise says, “My home is livelier and I feel less alone when my pets are around. I feel calm when I am with them, especially when they react to me.”
Harshini’s (38) love affair with Persian cats began when her son joined a piano class. When she once accompanied him to his lesson, Harshini realized that Dinuka was more excited about playing with the teacher’s cat than learning his chords. “My dog had died not too long ago, so when I saw Dinuka with the cat, I decided to get one.” Today, her four cats, all named after the ‘Ice Age’ characters: Manny, Diego, Sid and Scrat - are a dominant feature in her apartment.
The popular notion of cats is that they are cold, demanding and unaffectionate pets but Harshini poopooed this idea. “They sleep most of the time; then there is a sudden burst of energy when they play with anything and even give you a high five. Then they get exhausted and drift off to sleep again,” she says.
In the Colombo modern society today, when professionals are old enough to gain financial independence, but not willing to give up their social independence, out goes the roomie or family, and in comes a pet. Animal company fills a home without intruding it, so it's no surprise that many youth prefer taking up the extra responsibility of walks, vet visits and feeding.
It's still less interfering than living with an actual person and is a small price for playful companionship and uninterrupted cuddling.
Jehan (28), a budding young entrepreneur, got his first cat when he was still living with roommates.

“Animals are so simple. They know what is important in life: eating, sleeping and sun-bathing! Once I joined my cat by idling on the balcony but my phone kept buzzing. Miranda gave me a look as if to say, ‘you don't know your priorities’,” he recalled with a smile.
Kumar (58) owns, Belle, a brown mare, which he grooms especially for his grandchildren.
He notes, “Belle can be ridden bareback. She is hardy. She needs about two pounds of oats a day, some grass and regular grooming.” Exotic pets are a huge responsibility. You need to think twice before getting one to keep you company. After all, animal are born free and should remain so.
