Speaking of the reshuffle

Politics is the art of the impossible, some say. Perhaps it is quite true, for how else one could explain the removal of the ‘Best Finance Minister in the World’? Perhaps His Excellency may want to make affable Ravi K the best Fo reign Minister too. Good luck!
A little bit of reflection would, however, show that removal of the ‘best’ is something inherent in our political culture itself. It is only necessary to remind oneself about the removal of the ‘Best Army Commander in the World’. What more, he was not only removed but also stripped of rank, dragged along, humiliated and incarcerated.
The above development is only one aspect of the much talked about, much publicized and less thought about Cabinet re-shuffle that took place Monday, most probably at an auspicious morning hour. Hence, the inevitable compulsion to make our comment also known. Yet a Cabinet reshuffle is a serious business beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals like your columnist.
In order not to venture into dangerous ground or trespass into the domain of politicians whose numerous and solemn comments on the event are greedily consumed by the media and the public we would only attempt to make a few comments in lighter vein for the benefit of the public (Hudee jana pahan sanvegaya sandaha). It is hoped they would be taken up in good spirit and cheer and at the worst considered as a monologue of an eccentric for the latter also belongs to the category of critics throughout millennia.
Jumbo Cabinet
The first impression upon the receipt of information on the change was that it resembled somewhat a home cure for headache - changing pillows. It is wrong. What it looks like is not a change of pillows but the dressing of them with the same soiled covers inside out leaving the same dirty bed linen and the creaking ramshackle bed intact.
What more the jumbo Cabinet which is bursting at the seams has become even bigger though by a few percentage points. This causes anxiety for even a straw added to the weight could become critical at times. The public is nonplussed whether this is one of the exigencies of service required for Yahapalanaya or good governance. In contrast, the French seem to be eccentric to reduce their Cabinet from 18 to 15. The more the merrier is our motto! The mass consciousness in this country accepts that our Cabinet is not an exclusive club of saints or clean uncorrupt personalities. And there is no smoke without fire! Even the highest in the land has accepted the reality of corrupt fellow-travellers, those who hold skeletons in their own cupboards, in the Cabinet of Ministers. Had at least one of them been removed from office the reshuffle could have been seen in a much more positive light. Clean up and not shake up is the need of the hour.
At the depth of the heart of the man in the street there was a faint hope, however irrational, that the reshuffle would amount to a course correction for the ship of state drifting afloat in the wide ocean without a compass. It still remains in the realm of hope and not reality.
Finance and media
By far the largest beneficiary from the reshuffle is energetic Minister Mangala Samaraweera who has been entrusted with two vital portfolios – finance and media. It is to his credit that he accepted the responsibilities with a touch of humility even mentioning that it is with some trepidation that he is stepping into the shoes of former great personalities such as Dr. N M Perera, J R Jayewardene, Ronnie de Mel and Felix Dias Bandaranaike etc. Incidentally, in referring to those great men he has positioned his immediate predecessor- the best Finance Minister - in the proper perspective and stature.
Media has been his home turf even earlier though he has turned from blue to green in the interim period. Media also has become freer. However, the real test of his capabilities would be in handling finance. Of course, he has an unenviable job in view of the fact that there is neither a clear-cut national economic policy nor any mapped out economic strategy and planning.
Though cynics would say that as a finance minister in a Third World Country with limited resources he has only to present a budget tailor-made by the International Monetary Fund, his real challenge would be to harmonize the diverse demands of varying social forces that support the Government and those of the financiers – both local and global, to achieve a growth and expansion of the economy that would ensure the country's escape from the debt-trap it is engulfed in. Development means no longer cosmetic improvement of infrastructure as the case has been so far but development of the productive spheres of the economy which could generate new wealth and create more jobs for the people.
Whatever the rhetoric of politicians, whatever are the bouquets and brickbats in the media, whatever the reactions of all sections of the people the ultimate success or failure of the reshuffle would be seen only in the future.
In the meantime, since impermanence is in the nature of things we pray that a more realistic purposeful and prudent course correction would overtake the changes envisaged at present. With that we conclude our observations on a note of optimism for otherwise despair would overwhelm us and paralyze the body politic.
