Citizens' Mail

Swallowed up by cost
I am compelled to write this story to this column to make public aware of a transaction done in a certain leading private bank best known for offering pride of place to the Buddhists.
On December 31, 2017, I tried withdrawing cash through the ATM in Rambukkana around 6 p.m. The balance of my savings account, I was certain, was placed at Rs 37,000. I keyed in the amount I require as Rs 25,000. But then what went on the screen made me gasp with surprise. Funds not available, it read, and vanished in a few seconds. I tried three times only to get the same results.
The security guard was witness to this scenario and demanded an explanation. Following my brief explanation, he suggested to request the amount in small portions because the machine is to be reloaded. I requested for Rs 10,000 in a hurry.
The machine responded to my request. I hurried out because I was a bit concerned about the expanding queue outside. In leisure I started counting the notes to find out that I had been issued only Rs 4000 (five notes of Rs 500 and 15 notes of Rs 100). I reported this immediately to the security guard who consoled me promising that the bank would credit the balance in a day or two.
As the following day was Duruthu Full Moon Poya, I could not submit the perfected form to the Rambukkana branch. I submitted the same to the Galewela branch of this bank on January 2. I had been assured that my request would be immediately forwarded to the Rambukkana branch.
After the lapse of two days, I inquired from the Rambukkana branch. The case had been referred to the head office, I was informed. On January 10, I was called by the Rambukkana branch to be confirmed that the account balance as well as the monies I had been issued stands accurate.
That explanation was not convincing enough! The lady officer shot a few questions to ascertain my workplace and the notes I had been issued from the machine. Finally, she promised to contact me after getting in touch with the Head Office.
I rang her the following day. The lady offered me the same conclusion adding that she needs to check the CCTV camera system to check how much I counted at the ATM door. In case the cameras failed to detect how much I had counted, I have to bear the brunt of that loss.
Who is at fault now? The faulty, outdated, ATM systems of this so called super bank or otherwise?
Let me pose this question to the administration of this bank that claims to present our future in their motto: Is this the way you treat the poor customers struggling with their hard-accrued money?
