The Chief Guest at the opening ceremony was Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka while the Guest of Honour was the Ambassador of Japan Kenichi Suganuma.
Speaking on the launch of the lounge Chairman of Waters Edge Chamath De Silva said, “Sri Lanka and Japan have very close bi-lateral ties and a large Japanese community has made Sri Lanka their second home. A lot of Sri Lankan’s also enjoy Japanese food because of its simplicity and preparation methods. We are confident that this new addition to Waters Edge will be a crowd pleaser among locals and foreign guests alike.”
Also speaking on the launch Proprietor of Ginza, Richard Balasooriya said “Ginza is the first star Japanese restaurant in Sri Lanka (est. 1987), and the specially designed A/C lounge is perfect for guests who are looking for that extra comfort while they enjoy the most authentic Japanese cuisine.”
The “Ginza Teppanyaki Lounge” will serve traditionally prepared Teppanyaki recipes in a cool, chic lounge. Teppanyaki is a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. The word teppanyaki is derived from teppan, which means iron plate, and yaki, which means grilled, broiled, or pan-fried.
The lounge will not only serve grilled meats and vegetables but will also have desserts that are made on the hot plate giving guests novel experiences of Japanese cuisine. The Japanese consider Teppanyaki to be a leisure activity as much as a meal and an opportunity to spend time with family and friends.
The Ginza Teppanyaki Lounge overlooks the breathtaking beauty of the waterworks and will be the ideal location for small gatherings or intimate dinners. Seating a maximum of 30 pax, each table is an eight seater but can accommodate couples as well.
Ginza Teppanyaki Lounge is the 11th F&B outlet at Waters Edge making it truly a hub for all things gastronomical.
