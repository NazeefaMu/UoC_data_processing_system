Brigadier Priyanka Fernando reinstated

The Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, Brigadier Priyanka Fernando, who was suspended, has been reinstated on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena.
However, an inquiry into the incident has been initiated. Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said the Army will cooperate with any investigation conducted by the Foreign Ministry. He said a decision cannot be taken to punish him immediately, based on a video clip alone. He said there was a tense situation at the time of the incident and as such, an inquiry has been initiated to determine what had transpired.
Brigadier Fernando had assumed duties as the Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lanka High Commission in London in May 2017.
Having a military career spanning 32 years, he had spent 2/3rd of his service on the field and had contributed significantly to the war. An officer of the Gemunu Watch, he has a good service record, according to the Army.
It is also reported that the President had instructed the Foreign Ministry Secretary to reinstate Brigadier Fernando and reprimanded him for having suspended him without a proper inquiry.
However, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maheshini Colonne told the Daily News, that she had not received any information regarding the reinstatement orders by the President.
British Parliamentarians Joan Ryan and Siobhain McDonagh had earlier called on the British Foreign Secretary to withdraw Brigadier Priyanka Fernando’s diplomatic papers and expel him from the UK, after he was filmed making ‘unacceptable gestures’ to those protesting outside the Sri Lankan High Commission in London, on February 4.
Ryan and McDonagh, the Vice Chair and Senior Vice Chair of the Tamil All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), also said in their letter to Boris Johnson MP that the conduct of Brigadier Fernando was inappropriate, unacceptable and threatening, being someone who is serving in an official capacity as a guest of the UK.
