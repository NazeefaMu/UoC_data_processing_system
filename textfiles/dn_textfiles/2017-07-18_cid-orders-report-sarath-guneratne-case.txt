CID orders report on Sarath Guneratne case

 
The Colombo Chief Magistrate ordered the CID to file a comprehensive investigation report in Courts on October 31 regarding former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project, today.
Chief Magistrate made this order following a complaint lodged by defence counsel alleging that the CID had failed to initiate a comprehensive investigation into the incident. 
Six suspects including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe and four other officials at Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) were arrested by the CID for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to CFHC during the last Presidential election.
They are currently out on bail. 
In this case, the CID named six individuals including Gunaratne as the suspects following the instructions of Attorney General.
The Special Presidential Investigation Commission had recommended that the Attorney General’s advice be sought to institute legal action against the persons responsible for the alleged financial frauds.
Senior Counsel Lal Kularatne appeared for the suspects.
