LAVISH : IN LUSCIOUS LOCKS

Keeping your strands hydrated and smooth in the burning temperature is a difficult feat. Between chlorine, frizz and the tendency to plunge into salty beach waves, we are left with hair that is far from happy. Although we wash our locks, we might be making hair conditioning mistakes without even realizing it. This can happen especially when time is a factor. However keep in mind that conditioning plays a key role in owning a shiny and lustrous mane.
Types of conditioners
Surface conditioners – These add moisture to the surface of the hair and smoothens the cuticle scales. These can be used on normal hair.
Penetrating conditioners – These enter the hair shaft and help to repair the hair structure and strengthen the hair. These conditioners can be used on heat, chemically, or environmentally damaged hair.
Leave in conditioners – These products also make detangling easier and help tame frizz. Leave-in conditioners moisturize dry hair, and make it softer, smoother, and shinier. They serve as detanglers, stylers, and heat protectants. Leave-in conditioner is one of the most widely used hair products to protect curly hair from dryness.
Scalp treatments –These are used to treat scalp conditions such as oily/dry scalps and dandruff.
Hair conditioner as a gel
You can apply a hair gel to dry hair to give added stiffness and substance, but if you apply a conditioner after drying, your hair will look greasy.
Hair conditioners are designed to coat the hair shaft and keep the hair soft and manageable. Styling gels on the other hand contain agents that coat the hair and give it added volume. Many gels contain adhesive agents which will make the hair stick together and give the style added strength to hold longer.
Conditioners are designed to be left on the hair for a short period of time and rinsed away. As the hair dries, it appears soft and shiny. Conditioners have a heavy consistency and can leave a greasy appearance if it is left on the hair.
Adding conditioner to dry hair would only make the hair wet. Therefore you cannot use a conditioner as a hair gel and get similar results. You can use conditioners on dry hair, but the results you get will be different than those achieved from gel.
Overusing conditioners
Although you cannot “over-condition” your hair, you should use conditioner as needed, as overuse could leave a lot of build-up on the hair.
How often you condition, how heavy a conditioner you use, and for how long you keep it on each time varies, depending on hair type. For someone with natural hair (no colour/straightening), they can condition less frequently than someone who colours their hair or does chemical services.
Too much moisturizer
You can actually over-moisturize your hair. This causes more harm than good. Overly soft hair that is breaking and won't style has too much moisture. Constantly spraying your hair with water, deep conditioning your hair well beyond the time recommended by the manufacturer or even overnight on a regular basis can cause over-moisturization. Too much moisture breaks down the proteins in your hair and causes over moisturized hair.
Detangling conditioner for unmanageable hair
Detangling conditioners are good options for either a rinse-through or leave-in formulas. Use conditioner just enough to coat the hair. Work it through carefully and then rinse it thoroughly with lukewarm water. The hair will become manageable and the frizz will be reduced.
Faster hair growth and adding volumes
Hair typically only grows about a half an inch per month. While shampoo alone can’t determine the length or strength of your hair, having the right shampoo can help your hair grow longer and faster. Using nutritional shampoos which are rich in essential natural ingredients such as essential Aminos, Proteins and Vitamins will help to make hair grow faster.
Volume or volumizing shampoos make hair more bouncy and give it more body. Volumizing Shampoo amplifies fine, lifeless hair. Proteins and vitamins such as panthenol (vitamin B5) help to create body and fullness.
Adverse effects of shampoos and conditioners
Adverse reactions to shampoos and conditioners are rare. It is known that a pH higher than 5.5 may cause irritation of the scalp. If no conditioners are applied for protection and restoration, damage to hair shaft can occur if the wrong kind of shampoo is consistently applied with respect to the type of hair a person has.
Natural hair care results
There are a number of things we can do to strengthen our hair. Using natural treatments like oil (castor oil or coconut oil) is one such an example. There are several oils that you can use for hair growth and hair strength.
They contain numerous minerals and fatty acids.
You might not notice results immediately after washing.
However you should be able to see positive changes approximately within a month if these warmed oils are applied, and massaged on at least twice a week.
