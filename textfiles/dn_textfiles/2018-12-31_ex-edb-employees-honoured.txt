At the 5th AGM of Ex-EDB Employees’ Sansadaya where all retired and left, met up with the present staff at the EDB Auditorium, the four top pillars who were also members of Sansadaya were honoured by the gesture of handing over of plaques to complement their dedicated steadfast commitments rendered towards the Sri Lanka’s apex organisation (EDB).
