Korean community donates relief goods for flood victims

The Korean Businessmen’s Association (KBA) of Sri Lanka donated relief goods worth about LKR 15 million to Sri Lanka Police yesterday, including 5,000 pairs of long boots, 10,000 pairs of rubber gloves, 1,000 pairs of gloves for industrial use and 2,500 soaps. The goods will be distributed to the people affected by the recent floods and landslides as soon as possible. The relief items were sponsored by member companies of the KBA, such as S&S Lanka Gloves Ltd. (S&S) and Carnival World Ltd.
Apart from this, one of Korea’s leading companies, SK Engineering and Construction (SK E&C), has made a cash donation of USD 20,000 as relief assistance to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Korea.
Meanwhile, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) is also expediting the process to deliver humanitarian assistance worth of USD 300,000 (comprising family tents, blankets and tarpaulins), which the Korean government pledged to provide to Sri Lanka following the disaster.
