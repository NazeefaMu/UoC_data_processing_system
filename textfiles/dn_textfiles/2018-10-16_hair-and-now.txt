Hair and now!

The Sri Lanka Association of Hairdressers and Beauticians (SLAHAB) held a press conference to shed light on a few important areas SLAHAB had identified and to announce the victory of the Sri Lankan team at the recently concluded Hair World Championships in Paris recently.
Led by SLAHAB Founder President Nayana Karunaratne and SLAHAB President Sumudu Wasantha the discussion was divided into three main focus areas. The standardization and registration program that SLAHAB wishes to implement for all hair and beauty salons in Sri Lanka was the first matter they dealt with. It is an initiative that has received the patronage and guidance of Charitha Ratwatte, Senior Advisor to the Prime Minister and Head of the Central Programme Management Unit, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs. It presented how the registration of hair and beauty salons in Sri Lanka largely happens in an ad hoc manner and how many hair and beauty salons aren’t even registered with a central body or authority.
The standard and quality of, both, services and products offered suffer as a result and there are numerous health and safety concerns that are a byproduct of this informal culture of hair and beauty salons. It was informed to all that the Sri Lanka Standards Institute has approved and completed the document governing the standardization of hair and beauty salons. The Prime Minister’s Office will support the implementation of the standardization program, while selecting the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) and the Sri Lanka Association of Hairdressers and Beauticians to spearhead the effort. The registration and business aspect of the standardization programme will be handled by FCCISL. They will issue a privilege card to the hair and beauty salon or individual concerned upon satisfactorily completing the assessment. The assessment of the salons’ standards plus the level of skills and qualifications of employees will be carried out by SLAHAB.
The health and hygiene factors involved will be inspected by the relevant local authorities. Matters of workplace safety and first aid will be dealt with by the Red Cross. The entire process will be coordinated by the Prime Minister’s Office and it will allow a proper grading system to be implemented across hair and beauty salons islandwide.
The Sri Lankan Team who took part in the Hair World Championships organized by the Organisation Mondiale Coiffure (OMC) in Paris won top accolades at the event. The OMC Hair World Championships is a hairdressing competition that features professionals from all parts of the world. OMC Hairworld Paris 2018 included dozens of categories to promote a wider range of talent and it, truly, was a competition that celebrated diversity of culture. With over 1,000 participants from across the globe, the attendees this year bore witness to several days of daring competition on the opulent Parisian stage.
The styles displayed, as always, were unique and extravagant, and they also featured a large number of artists who specialized in contemporary beauty trends. Two Sri Lankan makeup artists took both Silver and the fourth place in the Ladies Aesthetics Commercial Bridal Make-up category.
The Silver Medal was won by Kayalvily Jayapragash and Theekshanee Kariyawasam won fourth place at the event. Both are members of SLAHAB and have been guided by OMC Asia Zone President Nayana Karunaratne.
The team also spoke about several issues which have raised in the hair and beauty industry in Sri Lanka. The fraudulent activities of Kariawasam were discussed at length, including his issuance of bogus doctorates and certificates to individuals from the local hair and beauty industry and the manner in which he extorted money from them while, entirely, misleading them. He was arrested and placed in remand custody by the CID.
