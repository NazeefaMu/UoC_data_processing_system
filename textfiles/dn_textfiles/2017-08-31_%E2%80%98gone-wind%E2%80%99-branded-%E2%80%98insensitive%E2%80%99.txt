‘Gone with  the Wind’  branded as  ‘insensitive’

A cinema hall in Memphis, Tennessee has canceled the screening of the 1939 Hollywood classic ‘Gone with the Wind’ as its content was deemed “insensitive” by the viewers.
The board at The Orpheum Theatre decided to take down the film after they received “numerous comments” that stemmed from a screening on August 11.
“While title selections for the series are typically made in the spring of each year, the Orpheum has made this determination early in response to specific enquiries from patrons.”
“The Orpheum appreciates feedback on its programming from all members of the mid-south community. The recent screening of ‘Gone With the Wind’ at the Orpheum on Friday, August 11, 2017, generated numerous comments. The Orpheum carefully reviewed all of them,” read a statement from the theatre group.
The Victor Fleming-directed movie has also been dropped from next year’s planned summer cinema series.
The statement continued that since the movie was found to have hurt the feelings of a larger audience, the group will not showcase the title from now on, till further notice.
“As an organisation whose stated mission is to ‘entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves,’ the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population,” the statement further read.
One of the users, who commented on the Orpheum’s Facebook page, called the film “racist”, while another remarked over news of the cancelled screening, saying “slowly but surely, we will rid this community of all tributes to white supremacy.”
‘Gone with the Wind’, which won eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director, features life on a Southern plantation during the Civil War and Reconstruction periods. PTI
