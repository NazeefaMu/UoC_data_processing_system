‘Liberalisation of shipping: good move’

Finally, the government of Sri Lanka has come to its senses that liberalising of shipping is needed for Sri Lanka to become a vibrant maritime economy and hub.
It is only right that we commend the Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe and Minister of Finance, Mangala Samaraweera for this bold step taken towards enriching our countries economy and competition to prevail for the betterment of the end consumer.
When the big shipping giants such as Maersk, MSC, CMA-CGM, APL, NYK, MOL, Hapag Lloyd, Cosco, OOCL and Evergreen can have their own offices here and contribute to the Sri Lankan economy having an agent will be unnecessary. It is the case of economies of scale.
By not having agency houses and inviting the shipping companies to open up their own offices in Sri Lanka we are promoting them to bring in their logistics activities, supply chain activities and cold chain activities to our country which will help our country to be the No 1 maritime hub in the Indian ocean.
As the vessel owners will be opening up their own offices in Sri Lanka, they will be pumping much needed foreign exchange into our economy by purchasing buildings to house their offices and paying higher salaries to their employees, unlike agency houses. This is a good opportunity for our graduates in the Katubedda University who study the logistics degree as they would be provided with jobs with high salaries by the vessel owners compared to working in an agency house where the agent would pay a salary of maybe Rs. 30,000.
For the case of losing foreign exchange, this is yet another bogus strategy set out by the shipping agents to stop the liberalisation process in Sri Lanka, foreign exchange would increase once restrictions are removed.
As the Principals/Carriers will make Sri Lanka their transhipment hub where all containers will have to transship through the Colombo port this will increase our foreign revenue two folds but by having an agent represent the principal they would not act on the interest of the principal but act only to protect their own interest. It is not Sri Lanka who will lose the foreign exchange but the people with hidden agendas as the foreign exchange will stop accumulating into their own pockets and they are uneasy about this situation.
If the so-called top agency houses are afraid to lose their agencies why not after liberalisation, they too work for their principals for higher salaries? this they cannot do as they want to keep all the foreign exchange for themselves so that they can hire people for far less salaries and have shared documentation centres which are banned in the shipping industry as they lead to rate fixing and rate discussion of lines which have been cartelised in these top agency houses.
Some may argue that the shipping lines will be able to take them earning out of the country, Yes, of course, they will take their earnings out of Sri Lanka but they will pay tax and dividends on earning before doing so. This is yet another bogus strategy of the so-called two or three top agency houses in Sri Lanka to retain the agencies with them and not allow their principals to open up their own offices.
By most of the shipping agencies being with two to three players in the industry, this also promotes cartelisation of shipping lines into two or three groups which are forbidden by international law.
If need be the government of Sri Lanka can get the shipping lines to invest 50% of their profit inside our country and help build infrastructure, hotels, maritime universities etc. which they will be happy to do so as a part of their CSR initiatives.
The government should not head to the pressure of the so-called association of shipping agents as it is controlled by two key players in the industry with vested interest. Thus there is no independent opinion from the so-called association of agents. The two top players in the industry use the association to get things done their own way and only to protect their own interest this is known to many of the members in the association.
Due to the greed of these top players in the industry the small time, SME players have been crushed and cartelisation of the industry has happened for decades.
Further, the top shipping agency houses should be protecting the interest of their principals and not their own interest. Their action today shows that they do not want to protect the interest of their principals but their own interest by lying to the government and to the general public about the loss of foreign exchange and jobs, this is truly their hidden agenda.
Liberalisation will encourage competition, which the top shipping agency houses are afraid of as they have hidden agendas to cartelise and fix rates in the industry. Competition is vital for a growing economy like ours and will help benefit the end consumer.
Due to the agencies cartelising with two to three agency houses, the lack of competition in the shipping industry is only filling the pockets of these agency houses with agency commission as per the tariff set by them since they control their own association.
This is truly a bold step and the general public should commend the government is steering Sri Lanka on the right path in order to become a global logistics hub in the Indian Ocean.
