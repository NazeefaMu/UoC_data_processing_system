‘Family of four needs Rs. 61,300 monthly for food’

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Administrative Secretary Renuka Perera told a media briefing in Colombo the cost of living has increased and a family of four has to spend Rs. 61,300 per month for food.
He said the government has not taken adequate measures to bring down the cost of living and people were having a difficult time.
Its Speaker Sanjeewa Edirimanne said the crime rate too was on the up due to government's failure to bring wrongdoers to justice swiftly. He said the government had failed to take action against offences committed by some high profile people including politicians. If the tend continues, ordinary people will believe they too can get away with crimes, he said.
