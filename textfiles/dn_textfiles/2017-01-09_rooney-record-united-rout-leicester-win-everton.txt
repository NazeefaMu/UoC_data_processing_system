Rooney record in United rout, Leicester win at Everton

LONDON, Saturday: Wayne Rooney left his footprint on FA Cup third-round day with the first goal in holders Manchester United's 4-0 rout of Championship side Reading on Saturday to draw level with Bobby Charlton as the club's record scorer.
His seventh-minute effort took his United tally to 249 since joining the 12-times Cup winners in 2004, but Rooney failed to surpass Charlton's long-standing mark as Anthony Martial and two late goals from Marcus Rashford completed United's comfortable victory at Old Trafford.
“I think it's just a question of time to score one more goal and become in the history of Manchester United. It's arriving; the big moment for him is arriving,” manager Jose Mourinho said after his side's eighth straight win in all competitions.
Premier League champions Leicester City enjoyed some respite from a poor campaign as they claimed a first away victory in domestic competitions this season with summer signing Ahmed Musa scoring twice in a 2-1 victory at Everton.
There were a few surprises on one of the standout days in the English soccer calendar with three of the five top-flight sides to depart being beaten by lower league sides. Arsenal were in danger of becoming a sixth when they trailed 1-0 at second-tier Preston North End at halftime but Olivier Giroud's 89th minute winner sent them through 2-1.
Aaron Ramsey curler one minute after the break had cancelled out Callum Robinson's early opener.
The biggest surprise of the day came in south London where League One (third tier) Millwall humbled top-flight Bournemouth 3-0.
Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe made 11 changes to the side that drew 3-3 with Arsenal in midweek and it showed as Steve Morison, Shaun Cummings and Shane Ferguson struck for Millwall.
“We are so stretched, the Premier League is such a demanding league, we feel we need our best players available for selection,” Howe said in defence of his team selection. – Agencies
