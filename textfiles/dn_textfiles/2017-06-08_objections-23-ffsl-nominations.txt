Objections to 23 FFSL nominations

Twenty three nominees including presidential candidates Ranjith Rodrigo and Anura de Silva were challenged with objections questioning their eligibility to be elected for the forthcoming Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) office bearers. The Sports Ministry drew the dead line for objections by 1.00pm yesterday. The Football Election Committee headed by Deputy Sports Director R. B. Wickremasinghe will announce their decisions after considering the objections tomorrow. The aggrieved individuals can appeal to the Sports Ministry until June 13. The FFSL election is due to held on July 1.
A serious allegation was leveled against a presidential candidate where documents were submitted along with the objection to prove that he has been deported from Japan to Sri Lanka after staying four years in Japan without visa. The objection also stated that he went missing after watching the Football World Cup in japan and appointing such a law-breaker for the FFSL top spot will bring disgrace to the country.
Another objection demanded that all candidates must have played football and there is one who has never played the game. A candidate for the secretary post, Trevor Rekaman was challenged, stating the document he submitted from a sports club to prove that he has played football is a forged one. Candidate for the secretary post, Balendra Anthony filed an objection against vice presidency candidate U.L. Jaswar who represents Football Referees Association. There were few objections on the basis of not fulfilling the minimum qualifications for treasurer and assistant treasurer posts.
