Christmas AT OZO KANDY

With the festive season approaching, celebrate the feast of light in the hills with OZO Kandy, as they put together something special for the whole family for Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve.
To ease the workload and make this Christmas a truly memorable one, indulge in a traditional dinner buffet on Christmas Day from 8 pm onwards at EAT restaurant at OZO Kandy. While you enjoy a decadent spread, the kids can enjoy a special children’s buffet full of sweet treats. There will also be exciting prizes to be won through the evening with a raffle draw and a special visit from Santa himself. While you bask in the presence of those you love, listen to live music from Odyssey band.
OZO Kandy has planned a Caribbean-themed night to bid adieu to 2018 and welcome 2019 on December 31. This will be a truly exclusive experience for those who will attend, with a majestic firework display at the dawn of the New Year and the tracks of DJ Kush creating the perfect ambiance for an electric dance floor experience. A Caribbean-themed party, good food, good music, special awards for the best-dressed couple and the couple with the best display of dancing on the floor all make for a great final day of the year, so go make the most of it.
