Governor’s help sought to stop Sevanagala Sugar privatisation

Sevanagala Sugar Company unions met with Uva Province Governor, Attorney M.P. Jayasinghe and urged him to intervene against the privatisation of the company. The unions had written to the President in this regard and the Governor had been instructed to investigate the matter and submit a report.
During the meeting held at the auditorium of the Governor’s office, the unions noted that the Sevanagala Sugar Company had recorded significant profits during the period it was a state company, but its production had suffered a setback subsequent to it being privatised, which had a negative impact on the country’s sugar production.
However, they said the current Chairman and board of directors were committed to the uplift of the company which had resulted in the production capacity of Sevanagala Sugar increasing from 800 tons to 1,200 tons. They said that the company could be made productive again and it was currently in the process of paying back debts owed to the government.
Union members further said that they had held discussions with Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in this regard and they had assured them that Sevanagala Sugar Company would not be privatized.
The unions further noted that there are 974 workers employed at Sevanagala Sugar Company, with 200 tractor owners and 4,500 farmers and 2,000 indirectly employed. The total workforce is almost 8,000 and if their employment is to be secured, Sevanagala should remain under the government, the unions said.Uva Governor’s Secretary H.M. Somatillake, Uva Province Agriculture Ministerial Assistant Secretary R.B.N.R. Priyashantha, Secretary of Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya L.A. Kokila Chaminda and several other union members participated. They expressed their gratitude to the Governor for having called them for a meeting in order to obtain their views and include them in his report.
