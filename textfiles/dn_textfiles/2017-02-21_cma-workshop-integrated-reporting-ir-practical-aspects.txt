CMA workshop on Integrated Reporting (IR) practical aspects

The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) will hold a workshop on "Integrated Reporting- Practical Aspects" to be held on Tuesday February 28, at Taj Samudra, Colombo from 1.30 pm to 5.00 pm.
This workshop will enable companies preparing Integrated Reports (IR) to achieve excellence, improve their reports and enter the CMA Excellence in IR Awards which will be held in July this year at the inauguration of the Annual Conference. The Ten Best IR will receive awards together with the Overall Winner and Runner Up. A special award will also be made for the most concise report.
IR is enhancing the way organizations think, plan and report the value creation story of their business and will be based on the IIRC Reporting Framework.
Organizations are using IR to communicate a clear, concise, integrated story that explains how all of their resources are creating value. IR is helping businesses to think holistically about their strategy and plans, make informed decisions and manage key risks to build investor and stakeholder confidence and improve future performance. It is shaped by a diverse coalition including business leaders and investors to drive a global evolution in corporate reporting.
IR applies principles and concepts that are focused on bringing greater cohesion and efficiency to the reporting process, and adopting 'Integrated Thinking'as a way of breaking down internal silos and reducing duplication. It improves the quality of information available to providers of financial capital to enable a more efficient and productive allocation of capital. Its focus on value creation, and the 'capitals' used by the business to create value over time, contributes towards a more financially stable global economy.
The purpose of the IR Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the Fundamental Concepts that underpin them.
In order to assist companies in the preparation of Integrated Reports CMA is organizing this workshop to give participants an overview of the process and practical aspects of preparing an Integrated Report followed by a panel discussion by experts in IR to enable participants to solve their practical problems in the preparation of IR.
The welcome address and introduction to the workshop and Excellence in IR Awards will be delivered by Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala, President of CMA.
