SLFP, UNP  alliance must  continue: Arjuna

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunge said it would be a betrayal to the people’s mandate if the system of consensual governing currently in effect did not continue after the local government elections.
He added that even though the SLFP and UNP are contesting the LG elections separately, they should unite for the betterment of the country at its conclusion. He said so during the welfare programme of Game Pansala - Gamata Saviyak, held at the Kolonnawa Rajamaha Viharaya yesterday. He further added that the President and the Prime Minister have a good mutual understanding concerning this issue.
“People believe that there is a dispute between the President and the PM. It’s a matter of change in attitude, just like among husband and wife. They can provide wise solutions, because they are intelligent persons,” Ranatunge stated.
“Even though the SLFP and the UNP have different principles, they are united for the betterment of the country. There’s freedom of the media now, which people asked for. Democracy is given so that people can live freely. People requested us to punish the wrongdoers. That is the only thing we could not do. But we are happy about what we have done,” he added.
“In the last presidential election, people voted for the President and the PM without considering political parties. No party received a majority, because expectations of the people were the unification of two main political parties. We don’t require party politics now. We can build up political parties anytime, but not the country. Therefore, the two main political parties should be unified after the LG election; if not it will be a betrayal to the people’s mandate,” Minister Ranatunga stated.
