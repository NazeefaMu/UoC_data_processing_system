Tyre - Inspired

Tyres are a highly versatile open ended resource that can be used by schools and settings for children of all ages and stages. They take hundreds of years to break down if sent to a landfill site, so opportunities to re-use them make a positive difference.
Children love the feeling of enclosure and will frequently stack tyres up for this purpose.
Painting tyres is popular. It is simple, effective and easy to do – the idea came from the children who wanted a place to sit in their rainbow garden. Using the markings on tyres can also lead to some lovely designs.
