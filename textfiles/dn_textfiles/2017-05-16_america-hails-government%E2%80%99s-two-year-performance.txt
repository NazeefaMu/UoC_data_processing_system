America hails government’s two-year performance

Sri Lanka has achieved economically to a stable level under the Good Governance during the last two years, American Congress Member Bill Johnson said.
He points out that he sees ruling the country by two main political parties a unique situation. Johnson expressed these views during a meeting with Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on May 15 held at the Finance Ministry.
After making a tour of the North, Johnson told Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake that the ongoing rehabilitation and development activities in the North are successful. He said he is confident that the government would take necessary action to fulfil any more aspirations of the people in the North, if any.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said all parts of the country have been put under development by the Good Governance. He said Sri Lanka is internationally succeeding under the abled guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He said the responses received by Sri Lanka at the recently concluded biannual conference of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund held at Washington DC are clear example to this situation.US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap was present.
