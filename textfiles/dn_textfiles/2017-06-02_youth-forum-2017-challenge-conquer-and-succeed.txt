Youth Forum 2017: Challenge, Conquer and Succeed

Hilton Colomborecently held [email protected] Week, Hilton's annual global career event showcasing the many opportunities available in the hospitality industry for youth and other job seekers. From May 15 to May 21, Hilton hotels and corporate offices around the globe are hosting hundreds of events to inform young people about the exciting and diverse career opportunities in the hospitality industry.
This initiative is a part of Hilton's Open Doors commitment, which aims to positively impact at least one million young people by 2019 by connecting them to opportunities in the hospitality industry, preparing them to reach their full potential or directly employing them.
In addition Hilton Colombo also organized the 'Challenge, Conquer and Succeed' Youth Forum 2017 for the fourth consecutive year. The Youth Forum saw the participation of over 350 students from schools and institutes in Colombo and the suburbs. "We have been able to touch 5,000 students during the four years. Some of them are a part of Hilton family while others have pursuit their career under our guidance. At this forum we assist students explore the career opportunities within the hospitality industry," General Manager of Hilton Colombo, Manesh Fernando said.
The skills required for employment today are totally different. Youth have to stay relevant with the changes that occur in technological and social changes. Through this initiative, we want to ensure that all job seekers, including youth, have access to the best available information and opportunities the industry provides," Fernando added.
He also pointed out that hospitality industry is one of the simplest industries. "If you have a heart and the passion to serve you can be successful in this industry. There are prejudices that prevail in the society about hospitality industry which bars youth from exploring opportunities but this industry is highly potential. We hope to bring in more females as the current statistics of female employment in the industry is pretty low," Fernando said.
During the event, the students discussed about the future of hospitality industry in Sri Lanka in 2020 and beyond. Through various group activities and Q&A sessions, the participants also explored topics on the importance of continuous personal and professional learning and development in the fast changing world of evolving technology.
[email protected] Week events are a unique opportunity for Hilton to inspire job seekers about careers in the hospitality industry, and to support them by providing guidance on the skills that are vital to succeed in the workplace and beyond. Participants join Hilton for events ranging from résumé clinics to networking, as well as presentations from current employees about their career paths in hospitality.
