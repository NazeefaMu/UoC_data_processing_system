Twelve drown in unsafe waterways

According to Kurunegala District SLFP Parliamentarian and Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, about twelve persons have died of drowning due to bathing in unsafe village tanks and waterways countrywide during past two weeks.
The Minister said, "all should not bathe in unsafe and risky places during rainy days and upcoming New Year festive seasons with their little ones.
However, sign boards of warnings have been erected at such places by now by the Disaster Management Centre to educate and caution people who visit such areas as visitors and strangers. But unfortunately, many don’t care these warnings and fall into trouble resulting in tragic deaths.
About 1,200 volunteers have been deployed countrywide to save those who face such accidents while bathing at unsafe places during New Year festive season and Vesak festive season of this year”.
The Minister said these when he was contacted by Daily News yesterday (10) from Kurunegala.
