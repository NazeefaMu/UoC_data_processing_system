Indian party wants to hoist Indian national flag at Katchaitheevu

Indian party Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK) has said it would hoist the National Flag at Katchaitheevu, ceded to Sri Lanka by India, on the Republic Day, if the Centre or Tamil Nadu government failed to do so.
In a memorandum submitted to the district collector here, IMK President, Arjun Sampath said that Tamil Nadu fishermen have the right to catch fish in Katchaitheevu area and also the right to worship at St. Anthony Church there, as per an agreement between the two countries. However, Sri Lanka was violating the agreement and not allowing Tamil Nadu fishermen there, he said. Stating that the Centre or Tamil Nadu government should take steps to hoist the Tricolour tomorrow, he said that either the collector of Ramanathapuram district or senior officials in Indian Coast Guard can hoist the flag there.
If both are failing to hoist the flag, the HMK workers will go and hoist the flag, Arjun Sampath said. - PTI
