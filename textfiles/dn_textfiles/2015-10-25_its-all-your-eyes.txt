It's all in your eyes

Eye is the major attraction of any face and everybody wants their pair of eyes to sparkle with good health and happiness. But Puffy eyes can make you look ill and tired. Dark circles under the eyes make you look older. Today Hasini Gunasekera ,Course Director, International Academy of Beauticians Beauty Talks with T n'c on how to get rid of puffy and tired eyes.
Q: How to treat tired and puffy eyes
Cold Spoons
Applying cold spoons in the eyes is an easy and effective treatment that anyone can try at home and as frequently as they wish. This helps to tighten up the skin around your eyes as well as relax the blood vessels, and giving relief to puffy and tired eyes.
Step 1: Chill a metal spoon in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 2: Hold the rounded portion of one of the cold spoon against your eye for a few minutes until the spoon becomes warm.
Tea Bags
Be it green tea bags or black tea bags, both can help soothe puffy and irritated eyes. They contain anti-irritant properties that help reduce swelling around your eyes. They can also relieve redness and inflammation.
Q: People spend a lot of money on artificial chemical products to get rid of under eye darkness. What is the best home- made remedy to treat dark eyes?
Potatoes
Just like cucumbers, potatoes are also effective in getting rid of puffy eyes. The starch present in potatoes has anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce under-eye bags. This remedy is also helpful for fading dark circles under eyes.
Step 1:Peel, wash and dry a medium-size potato.
Step 2:Grate the potato and put the shavings in a clean cotton cloth and tie it up.
Step 3:Place this cloth over your eyelids for several minutes.
Q: There are mixed views about using green tea eye wash solution on your eyes. Is it safe to use it to cleanse your eyes?
Researchers say the compounds responsible for many of the health benefits of green tea are capable of penetrating the tissues of the eyes and can have antioxidant activity there. It has a high concentration of antioxidants called catechins. This is known to help protect the delicate tissues of the eyes, yet it's important to use it with great care. This is definitely not to cleanse any makeup applied to the eyes but rather for its soothing ability.
Q: How to get rid of under eye wrinkles?
* Avoid the sun as much as you can
* Wear sunglasses
* Drink plenty of water
* Get adequate sleep and rest
* Avoid scratching your eyes as a habit
Q: What are the best eye care practices one should follow to get glowing healthy eyes. Also comment on the importance of wearing sunglasses, drinking water and getting adequate sleep.
Water
The easiest way to get rid of puffy eyes is to drink water. When the body is well hydrated, there is less chance of water retention that can cause your under-eye area and other parts of your body to swell. Water also helps flush toxins out of the body.
To stay well hydrated, drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water each day. In addition to this, you must reduce the amount of salt you eat to reduce water retention in the body. Also, avoid caffeinated and carbonated beverages that can be dehydrating.
Get adequate sleep.
When you don't get enough sleep, the body produces excess cortisol, a hormone that breaks down skin cells. Get enough rest, and you'll produce more human growth hormone, which helps skin remain thick, more “elastic,” and less likely to wrinkle.
Sunglasses
Sunglasses can block out UV rays so the fragile skin around the eyes is protected from sun damage. But, the glasses must have adequate UV filters in them.
Q: Is applying eye creams a must?
What the eye area really needs are antioxidants, cell-communicating ingredients, and skin-repairing ingredients, in a soothing, fragrance-free formula, just like what you need for the rest of the face. In fact, if you're already using a gentle yet effective moisturizer or serum, it may be perfect for the eye area, too.
The exception is if the skin around your eyes is drier (which is true for many of us), in that case you need a more emollient formula, and that's where the best eye creams excel.
This is especially true for those with oily skin who may not be using a moisturizer on their face at all or are using only a very thin gel or liquid-based moisturizer. In that case, an eye cream must be purchased to only use around the eyes.
Q: What is your beauty tip for this week?
A home remedy for wrinkles under eyes:
Pineapple
The juice of pineapple is known to have active enzyme known as bromelain, which is an anti inflammatory agent and a natural alpha hydroxyl acid that can help treat wrinkles. Pineapple has astringent properties as well as it helps exfoliate the skin.
Take some juice and apply on the eye wrinkles.
