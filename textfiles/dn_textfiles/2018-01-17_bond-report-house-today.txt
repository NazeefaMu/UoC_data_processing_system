Bond report in house today

Secretary to the President Austin Fernando yesterday confirmed that the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond issue will be handed over to the Secretary General of Parliament today.
Fernando said that reports of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) will also be handed over to Parliament today.
The Secretary to the President said that he promised on January 10 that these reports would be forwarded to Parliament and he would keep that promise.
Meanwhile, Chief of Staff of Parliament Neil Iddawala said the reports, once received, would be sent to the Office of Leader of the House.
Inquired by the Daily News, Iddawala said uploading the reports online has to be done by the Presidential Secretariat and that the tabling of the reports would be only after Parliament resumes on January 23. A date on the Bond issue and PRECIFAC reports will be decided after the receipt of the reports.
Meanwhile, the Speaker’s Media Division said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya intends to take disciplinary action against the MPs who misbehaved in Parliament on January 10 following an inquiry. Issuing a press communiqué on Monday, the Speaker charged that the unruly protest staged in the Well of the House was a pre-planned attempt to disrupt the sittings.
He said the information received by him and the Security Division confirmed it.
The Speaker also pointed out that MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena,MP persistently asked for a copy of the Bond report disturbing Parliament business despite the written assurance by the President that copies of the report would be made available within a week. He accused MP Gunawardena for inciting the unruly protest in the House when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was on his feet making a special statement.
President Maithripala Sirisena has previously agreed to send a copy of the report to Parliament on or before January 17.
