What actually happened to NCMC students
I refer to the letter from Prof C Deepal Mathew published on April 12. It is not correct to state that the medical students’ protest evolved into an armed struggle to overthrow the government.
After the 1971 insurgency, JVP activities have increased in 1986. Signing of Indian Peace Accord on July 1987 made the matters worse. The armed struggle was geared in full by JVPers between 1987 and 1989.
This was led by Rohana Wijeweera supporters, and not by students.
Please do not pass the blame on to them, Professor Mathew! A common examination was held and the students of NCMC scored good results. When the final examination was to be held, the Colombo Medical students protested against NCMC students.
The NCMC students had to undergo clinical training as well as local violence. Between 1987 and 1989 there was unrest in the circles of business establishments, government departments and universities. These institutes were shut down on a regular basis.
President Ranasinghe Premadasa then nationalized NCMC to satisfy the public as well as medical students. But the foreign students were not sent back. No damages were compensated. Most local students went abroad and sat for examinations held by foreign universities who recognized their knowledge.
This move by the foreign universities was appreciated. Our concern, quite naturally, is then why the same cannot be executed in the case of SAITM too. I admit that SLMC should regulate medical education. But remember, Supreme Court is above all. Even parliament must not try to overrule the Supreme Court’s decisions.
Let us, then, wait for the verdict of Supreme Court. Please do not make it a political issue.
