Sancharaka Udawa unveils for 2017

The seventh edition of ‘Sancharaka Udawa’ will be held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Center at BMICH May 5 and 6. This exhibition was first organized on a small scale seven years ago, by the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), with the intention of providing a platform to showcase products and services offered by the smaller stake holders in the tourism industry.
Though it has has grown significantly over the years the focus still remains the same, and is still the only platform available to the small and medium service providers, from all regions, to exhibit and meet their buyers under one roof.
The success of the exhibition, is amply displayed by the demand for stalls which currently stands at around 190 and growing. Last year ‘Sancharaka Udawa’ had over 160 Companies/individuals participating, with over 230 stalls at the exhibition grounds. Exhibitors range from Boutique Hotels to Guest Houses to Camping Operators on the accommodation offerings, as well as Adventure and Activity Service providers such as Safari Jeep Operators, rafting, canoeing and surfing operators from around the Island.
Due to the success of the seminars that were held last year during the exhibition on various topics related to the tourism industry, the organizers are planning to add several seminars to this years’ exhibition too.
These seminars will be open to all visitors free of charge. The primary focus of the seminars this year will be to give young school leavers (and others interested in the field) an opportunity to learn more about the industry and explore the variety of career opportunities available to them within the industry. In 2016, ‘Sancharaka Udawa’ had over 6000 visitors and the organizers believe that this year, the numbers will grow further.
