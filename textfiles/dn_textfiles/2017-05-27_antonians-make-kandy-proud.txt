Antonians make Kandy proud

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP:
St. Anthony’s College made Kandy proud by winning the “Plate”. The eight-team Plate contest, took place on par with the Cup championship and SACK came out with some top class rugby to win the first league title for the Katugastota school. From next season they will be playing in the Division I. A big hand should go to their players and the rugby committee. Their quarterfinal game in the President's trophy knockouts is with Isipathana College. St. Anthony’s took to rugby long after the school introduced sports like cricket, boxing hockey, football and athletics. It was in the ‘1950s that they started rugby with Bruce Winter as their first rugby captain. Credit should go to Old Trinitian Bobby Jayaweera, the man who taught them how to handle a rugger ball and later Maurice Perera, another Trinitian gave the final touches to the Antonian rugby team. From the day they took to the game, this sport became very popular. Though they started rugby in the 1950’s it was only in 1961 that enthusiasm was created and rugby received a big boost at St. Anthony’s and backing from all quarters. At the inception, most of the schools provided the Antonians with the 2nd XV fixtures.
It was only in 1962 that they were permitted to play against the 1st XV teams. It was H.M. Kuthdoos who led the Trinitians to draw the match for the first time against Trinity led by Ajith Abeyaratne in 1969, and in 1972 Tuan Doole led the Antonians to beat Trinity for the first time. Then in 1988 under Leroy Fonseka they emerged runners-up in the League Championship. Of all the ruggerites produced by St Anthony’s, Priyantha Ekanayake stands tall and above all should be very proud of being the first to captain the Sri Lanka rugby team from the school and that too for a record ten consecutive years. He also had the privilege of leading the national team for four consecutive Asiad’s a record yet to be broken. At present the 1991 skipper Lasantha Wijesuriya is the Rugby technical committee chairman. Lasantha and the coaches went all out to tune the side to win the Plate.
