GMOA threatens serious action over SAITM

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), students' organisations, lecturers' organizations and all other professional organisations will take stern action, If the authorities fail to stop SAITM continuously exploiting new students within one week, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
He said efforts are being taken to justify this illegal institution through Parliamentary Committees. All medical students in the country will boycott lectures from next week and have informed the GMOA. Lecturers and all professionals will join shortly.
According to Dr. Zoysa the public will be educated on the illegal existence and money collection of SAITM. Arrangements will be made to hold protests countrywide. The GMOA Central Committee will meet on January 19 and take serious decisions in connection with the issue, he said. The GMOA demands all authorities to intervene immediately and stop SAITM from collecting money from students by misleading them. SAITM does not have the Sri Lanka Medical Council approval and violates medical education standards, he added.
