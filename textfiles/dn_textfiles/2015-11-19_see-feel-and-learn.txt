See, feel and learn

Rome wasn't built in a day or so they say! It started in bricks when it all began in 753B.C. according to Roman Mythology, maybe even years before. Rome was a city state and an empire while Sri Lanka is an island with a civilization as old as 2500 years. Regardless of the differences Architecture is Architecture whether in Rome or Sri Lanka. Today also Arch World speaks to Channa Daswatte who takes us through the highlights of living in Sri Lanka.
"The inward looking urban house has often been the model though of busy urban environments from Roman times where congested cities were part of the culture.
Homes are essentially places which people retreat to, from the distractions of the outside. There should always be places that do that within the house. In old style urban houses one had verandahs overlooking the streets and outside so that the occupants could connect with the outside but internal courtyard spaces allowed them to retreat into a place that did not have that connection. Today's urban houses are similar. High walls lee the outside out," said Channa
The offspring of Mother Nature which is greenery and water can be incorporated into the home operating as a balm when one comes back tired from a hard day at work.
"I don't particularly try to incorporate water and greenery, but it goes without saying that in
Sri Lanka, greenery is inevitable. My work makes an effort to connect with the environment
outside and try to make the occupants conscious of their surroundings. This makes for the
spaces being very much a part of the greenery. Water can happen either as a pond or pool that occupants may request and also how you control the rain. Watching and hearing the monsoon from a sheltered and dry space, is in my opinion one of the highlights of living in Sri Lanka."
Feathers in his cap
Daswatte has many trophies in the form of houses. Some more memorable than others but all are feathers in his cap.
"Of my work, two small projects are perhaps my most memorable and most important to me.
Renovating a hundred year old bungalow and the junior school of Methodist College taught me the importance and joy of recycling old buildings.
Many other projects followed, such as the Dutch House in Galle and the Kandy House, but this was where I cut my teeth on conservation and addition to give new life to a building.
And of course building my own home in Madiwela. Here I explored many ideas that I always had in my mind and it has since been a joy to live in."
Custodian
A house can be a custodian of interpersonal relationships with all its dynamics, are all taking place within the house. "A house comes alive not so much with the inhabitants or occupants interacting with the
house, than by how the house allows the occupants to interact between themselves. Houses
by the way they are designed, can allow for individuals within it to either avoid or interact
with each other preserving levels of privacy and connection. This is especially true in today's
society where the individual and individual aspirations are as important as the joint aspirations of family and community."
Architecture is finally a labor of love for any architect. When you are in the thick of it, it is almost impossible to let go.
"It's difficult to disengage from thinking about a piece of architecture when you are into it.
But the good thing is designing is always a pleasure. Procurement is always stressful. Here
you are doing what you can to make the various people involved in a project understand the
vision you have in mind.
Steps
First it's how you interpret it as a drawing sketch. Next it gets interpreted by a technical person that might then be passed on to a contractor whose craftsman or bricklayer must lay the material in the right place and order. This is the stress. But the solution to this is usually to have worked with people who understand the ideas in your mind and hopefully interpret correctly.
This is both physically and mentally challenging. But that bit is what I consider work and often try not to take it home!
If the architect takes on board the variety brought in by the individuality of the client, the context, the specifics of the environment and its effects on the site, there is enough means by which a house will be naturally different from others. It's not tiring or exacting, it's what I enjoy most." The diversity of it is what is so addictive - the challenges that come with the diversity. That is the joy of any profession and particularly architecture. Each day and each problem is
different. Each person means a different negotiation. This keeps Channa alert and happy!
Learning everyday
"You learn every day from the work you do and from what you see. Yes magazines
tell you what other people are doing, what new shapes and forms are coming out and different solutions to different architectural problems around the world.
But for me what I see and feel the actual experience of architecture is the best way to learn. So all my holidays are travelling to new places and having experiences, like when walking through a land- scape, a town, a house - those are my greatest learning experiences.
I don't do trends. They are usually very short lived and transient. Architecture to me is a
bit more than this. It is timeless, so any passing trend can fit in and fade around it. Interior designs can be trendy and occasionally when I do put on that hat, I do accommodate the transient trends in it. In hotels for instance they change every 5 years! But architecture cannot really do that, it will be economically illogical and harmful to the environment," he noted finally.
