A student of Mahiyangana Haddaththawa Secondary School was attacked by a wild elephant while on her way to sit for the Grade 5 scholarship examination yesterday.
Her mother who was taking her to school on a bicycle was also attacked. They had to seek treatment at the Mahiyangana Hospital.
The girl was identified as Sayuri Sathsarani (10) and her mother, D.M. Sepalika Kumari. Sathsarani lost her father and her mother makes a living as a labourer at a sand mine.
