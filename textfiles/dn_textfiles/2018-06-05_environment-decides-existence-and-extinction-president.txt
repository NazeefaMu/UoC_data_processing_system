World Environment Day message
Environment decides existence and extinction: President

The whole meaning behind the wide gamut of knowledge offered to us within the past century is that the environment is the prime aspect, which decides existence or extinction of the future of the human civilization, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in his World Environment Day message.
The message stated: “The era which arrived after the scientific renaissance, identified as the development, which offered a competitive lifestyle filled with material abundance, severely destroyed the live connection between man and the environment. We, Sri Lankans who inherited a sustainable mundane lifestyle based on agriculture, embraced a materialistic lifestyle without any critical understanding. We have to logically understand that from the calamity of mosquitoes and insects to natural disasters such as floods, avalanches and landslide, and all the health problems that we are victimized to, including non-infectious diseases, are catastrophes brought on ourselves through the so-called development process.
“We cannot celebrate the World Environment Day, avoiding this dilemma of development. The theme for Environment Day this year, “Let’s avoid the environmental pollution caused by plastic waste” comes on stage as a result of this.
“This theme forces us to move forward towards an environment-friendly way of life by understanding deeply the threats caused to the environment through our lifestyles, instead of praising the environment by exaggerated artistic expressions.
“Understanding that man is also just one creation of Mother Nature and with the comprehension to get close to nature, I warmly welcome everybody to join hands with all the friends of the environment who are marching towards celebrating World Environment Day.”
