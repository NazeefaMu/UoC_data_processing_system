[APPRECIATIONS - (03-07-2017)]

Asela (Stanley) Navaratne
Man of integrity
I sat down several times to write about my father who passed away about an year ago, but never thought that it would be so difficult and painful. Many tears came down when I thought about him. Finally, I decided that I will make up my mind to write something about him who has been very close to my mother, my sister and to me. Another reason for me to write about him was that he was my mentor throughout my life. If he was alive, he would be 91 years on September 20.
He was born on September 20, 1926, at Wattappola, in a remote village in Udunuwara close to Kandy, to a respectable Kandyan family and his parents were Navaratne Mudiyanselage Medduma Banda Navaratne and Soma Kumari Ganhatha Navaratne. His father was the principal of the Jinaraja College, Gampola and his mother was a housewife. When my father was 13 years of age, his mother died at a young age. His father passed away in 1945, after my father got married to my mother Anula Tittawella. He had one sister and seven brothers and my father was the eldest in the family. After his father’s death, he had an additional responsibility to look after the family until they were employed and married, which he did willingly as the eldest brother.
My father had his early education at Jinaraja College, Gampola and thereafter, at Dharmaraja College, Kandy. He was always proud of the two schools where he studied. Thereafter, he entered to University of Ceylon in 1946 and studied Pali, Sinhala and History and graduated with a BA degree in 1950. Some of his lecturers at the University were Professor B.E. Hettiarachchi and G.C. Mendis. He used to be proud that he was an undergraduate, while Dr. Ivor Jennings was the Vice Chancellor. Some of his contemporaries at the University were former Speaker of Parliament Stanley Tillekaratne, former Governor of the Central Bank Dr. W.M. Tillekaratne and Professor of Political Science at the University of Peradeniya Professor K.H. Jayasinghe.
After his graduation, he taught for about six months at the Sivali College in Ratnapura District and thereafter, joined the Public Service in 1950 as a Divisional Revenue Officer (DRO). His first posting was to the Kuruengala Kachcheri. Thereafter, he was posted to Batticaloa (Binthanne, in 1952), Badulla (Wellasa, in 1954), Mahanuwara (Ududumbara, in 1956), Mahanuwara (Medadumbara, in 1960), Kegalle (Dehigampala and Pahala Bulath Kohupitiya, in 1961), Mahanuwara (Harispaththuwa, in 1964), Mahanuwara Kachcheri.
He was the Deputy Director (Administration) at the Department of Agriculture until he was appointed Government Agent of Matale District. In 1977, after the general election, he was transferred to the pool at the Ministry of Public Administration and he refused to accept the said transfer and made a written appeal to the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration as he knew that some politician in Matale District who came to power in 1977 was behind his transfer and their motive was to get another officer whom they knew who was junior to him. The net result of his appeal was a transfer to Colombo as the Government Agent.
Thereafter, he assumed duties as the Government Agent of the Colombo District in 1978 and worked until he retired from the Public Service in 1986. During his career in the Public Service, he handled many elections and had been the Returning Officer for Matale and the Colombo Districts. He was involved in the Buddha Jayanthi Celebrations, Rural Development activities, National Savings Movement, Dharmaduta Missions and the Victoria Home for incurables at Rajagiriya. He worked under Stanley Maralande, W.H. Fernando and Dr. Ernest Abeyratne. He had many friends in the public service and associated with them until his death. He was very proud that by joining the Public Service, he was able to help the poor while he was serving in remote areas of the country. He used to relate stories on many incidents and from that I knew that he enjoyed working in outstations more than in the cities.
Thereafter, he joined the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooporation as Chairman and a Director for the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooporation. During the period that he worked in the Institution, there were many employees who were killed by terrorist activities which affected him personally. There were even death threats to him and we all were scared for his life during this period, but my father was not so; he only said that it was his duty to protect the Institution as well as the employees from terrorist activities. During this period, the Indo-Lanka Peace Accord was signed and there was public unrest all over the country; the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Cooporation had a major role to play to keep the public informed of the true situation.
Thereafter, he joined the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation as Chairman and a Director of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. The period that he worked in the Institution there were many employees who were killed by terrorist activities which affected him personally. There were even death threats to him and we all were scared for his life during this period but my father was not so and he only said that it was his duty to protect the Institution as well as the employees from terrorist activities. During this period the Indo-Lanka peace Accord was singed and there was public unrest all over the country and during this period the Sri Lanka Rupavahini corporation had a major role to play to keep the public informed of the true situation.
Subsequently, he was appointed as a Director of the Sri Lanka Aviation Authority and as a Commissioner of the Mediation Boards Commission. He always enjoyed working in the Government Sector and he did not have any majro problems with the Government in power as he was not affiliated to any political party. He closely worked with the then President J.R. Jayawardena, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranayake, Presidents Ranasinghe Premadasa and D.B. Wijetunga and Ministers T.B. Illangaratne, Hector Kobbekaduwa, Ananda Tissa de Alwiss, A.C.S. Hameed, Major Montague Jayawickreme, but he never asked for any favours for him or his family.
He was appointed to many Commissions of Inquiry, including the inquiry into the incident which occurred at the new Magazine Prisons in 1991 of the Remand Prisoners and the one-man Commission of inquiry to examine and report of the Security Division of the Peoples Bank. During his career in the Public Service, he worked hard with commitment and dedication. He was able to work long hours as Amma looked after the home front.
He was a person who distinguished clearly between right and wrong. He had the common touch and that was why he was loved and respected by many, including the staff who worked under him.
Everyone who had worked under my father had always endorsed this view and said that what they learnt from him had been utilised in their day-to-day work while he was living as well as after hearing of his death. According to them, he was a good administrator who was honest and had always been firm but kind and patient. Some of them had end up by being Secretaries of Ministers. He was prod of his juniors who did well in their chosen fields. Some of them used to visit him in Kandy or phoned him and used to have long chats till he passed away in July last year. He used to enjoy those chats very much and used to relate them when I visited him during the week ends when we used to have small chats at the Balcony at our Kandy house. But above all he was a man of integrity. I must proudly say that he had served the country in Silence.
He was devoted Buddhist. After his retirement, he was fully involved in Buddhist activities in Kandy and worked for the Buddhist Publication Society (BPS) and at the Center for Buddhism for many years. The center for Buddhism gave an alms-giving after his death in memory of him and some others who had worked for many years at the Centre, in January, this year. He wrote many articles to the newspapers on Buddhism and had done research in this area. The knowledge that he had about Buddhism was immense, which is ample testimony when I looked into the notes that he had made during his life time, after his death. He had lot of admiration towards ‘bhikku bodhi’ and used to read his books. In addition, he used to read books written by Ven. Narada and Bhikku Nyanaponika and many others. His knowledge of ‘dhamma’ was vast and he was able to have a good discussion on ‘dhamma’ with his friends, neighbours and relations. He had collected many Buddhist books and magazines and akka and I will be the beneficiaries of his large collection of Buddhist books, articles and research papers which will help us to follow the path of ‘dhamma, ‘which he always believed.
Apart from Buddhism, he was interested in history, environment, constitutional laws, human rights, Terrorism, ethnic Issues, religious conversions, health issues, rebirth, drug policy, education and wrote to newspapers on many topics which I had the opportunity of reading after his death. He was so concerned about the motherland and proud to be born in Sri Lana. He always believed that terrorism could be curtailed by peace full negotiations, but by defeating them with power. He was of the view that this should be done for the sake of the Tamil Community in the Northern and the Eastern Provinces who were silently suffering due to terrorism.
Further, he always believed that devolution was not suitable for a small country like ours and that it is topic for the politicians to be in power. As an administrator throughout his life, he was of the view that the Provincial Council system was a white elephant. He always said that the common man, whether he is Tamil, Muslim or Sinhalese, only wanted a peaceful environment to live in with their families and to have decent living with a reasonable income to give a good education for their children. He was of the view that the ordinary man was never interested in political power.
He was calm and collected. He was a good listener and had lot of patience. He hardly got angry. His juniors and his friends always told, when he was living and as well as after his demise, that he had many good qualities and was a good human being who had helped many. I read many letters sent by many thanking him for such help (eg. To get a pension, a small land, for children’s education, to get jobs).
During his lifetime, he did many meritorious activities in silence. He used to contribute to many charitable organisations like Helpage and the Sri Lanka Cancer Society. He helped many children with their education and some of them got good jobs in Banks and Government Institutions. He used to give alms to the Buddhist monks at the Malwatte Temple annually which he did until his death. My father was the person who wanted me to joint the Attorney General’s Department and to please him, I allied and worked for almost 32 years. He was proud of my achievements and when I think back about him, I am happy that I did what he wanted me to do in life and I enjoyed it very much. The credit should go to him and Amma for my achievements.
Recently, I found a letter written to me in year 2007 when I was ill which I had kept in my safe custody. When I read it, I felt the love and the caring nature and the advice that he gave me to overcome the illness through Buddhist principles, which gave me the courage and the will to overcome the difficult period in my life.
He looked after my mother who is not in good health for many years with love and care, which is rare these days and that alone will give him merit to shorten the journey in sansara.
He led a simple life throughout his life. He selected Kandy, his hometown, to live in his retirement, in the house he built. The simple funeral in itself was a testimony for the life he led. One year has passed after his death. I really miss him. His demise from this world has created a void in my life and in our family.
The house is empty and the balcony that we used to sit and have chitchats on many topics during the weekend are only but a memory now. But his memory will live on in our hearts forever. But our lives will not be the same.
He has been a wonderful person to our family, relations, friends and others who associated with him.
I am thankful to him for everything he has done for Amma, Akka and I. I wish I could have written this while he was alive. I will try to live up to his expectations, which is not easy.
The only promise that I can give you, Daddy, is that I will look after Amma the way you looked after her, with love and care and make her life comfortable. I will try to lead the Buddhist path that you lived, following the teachings of the Buddha which you always believed.
May your journey in sansara be short, smooth and fruitful until you reach the ultimate goal of nibbana according to the Buddhist teaching that you always believed.

S (Vama) Vamadevan
Astute officer
Retired Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police S. Vamadevan passed away in Sydney on June 1, almost three months after his 84th birthday. He was the one who brought credit to Ceylon (later Sri Lanka) Police, both, by his ability, as well as personal example. I write this appreciation as a colleague who was perhaps the closest to him in the service. In fact, my wife and I were the only Police family at his wedding.
Vama and I were at the University of Peradeniya together. He was two years senior to me and was well-known as a soccer player of repute, captaining the Peradeniya side successfully. A very popular student, he was well-known for his sense of humour, perhaps something that created a comradeship between us. Several articles have appeared in the press about him, but I want to write mainly about his career in the service, which should really serve as an example to current members.
He joined the Service as a Probationary ASP in 1957, two years before me. His first outstation posting was in Kandy, where I succeeded him in 1961. Both of us served under Supt. Karl Van Rooyen, a tough, no-nonsense type officer, who instilled in us one of the most important dictums; we were there to serve the public, not to be slaves to departmental orders. Vama took to it like a fish to water, sometimes letting his feelings of duty overcome routine orders. Then he had a brief stint at Matugama until the attempted Coup of 1962 pitchforked him into the cauldron that was Colombo. He ran the Colombo West District, the toughest of the lot, covering the Fort and Pettah areas. Political turmoils, trade union chaos and serious crime had to be tackled with a depleted, demoralised force reeling in the aftermath of the attempted coup. This he accomplished despite having less than five years of Service under his belt.
Some tense situations were diffused through direct contact with the leaders. I know what it was like, as I too, was thrown into the same soup with even fewer years of service and allocated two districts, South and traffic, to run. Our predecessors were either in remand jail or on compulsory leave. Supt. Ivor Van Twest was brought in as SP Colombo and the two of us with another handful of junior ASPs were to help him restore morale and provide law and order to the city. Nothing loath, we stood four square to the wind and got on with the task. Vama, following the lead of Van Twest, led from the front and established a reputation as a firm, but fair officer, with a penchant for demanding immediate results. This earned him the sobriquet “Vahama devan.”
It was not all work. We had the good fortune of jointly participating in sporting activities, get-togethers, and most enjoyable of all, horse riding. Cross-country rides ending with a good breakfast or cantering along the beach to Mt. Lavinia, was indeed, fun. A keen horseman, Vama never missed these opportunities and as the Mounted Division was under his command, he and I spent considerable time on horseback. During this period, he commanded a parade to welcome the new IG S.A. Dissanayake. Vama commanded it on horseback, achieving a first ever record of commands being given in Sinhala, a little tongue-twisting for this lad from the North. He dealt with politicians and trade union leaders on a personal level, to prevent confrontations. The event I remember best was when he confronted a political heavyweight in maintaining peace in front of the Queen’s House and indeed, in the country. Sadly, it led to a posting to Nuwara Eliya. His great contribution was that the men under him gained the courage to stand up for what was right; they could count on his backing.
His next phase was undertaking training in intelligence work, in Tel Aviv and London and supporting the late IG Ana Seneviratne in reforming the Special Branch. Once again, I was part of the four-man group selected for the task. Later, Cyril Herath, one of the four, and Vama, headed the Intelligence Division; Vama being Intelligence Director General as his last post before retirement.
Vama’s crowning achievement was the setting up of the Sri Lanka Police Reserve (SLPR) with retired SP Rajasuriya. The old police reserve could no longer meet current needs. The failed insurrection showed the need for a strong Reserve to support the under-strength Police Force. Starting in April ’71, Vama built the SLPR from the bottom up. He handpicked a small, volunteer staff of Reserves led by an able Reserve Officer (who incidentally was to remain in that role for nearly 15 years) and developed it into an efficient, respected machine, providing much needed support to the regular police. This achievement never received due credit.
His stint as Commissioner of Police was also noticeable for the same qualities. He was a charismatic commander, and provided the City a period of peace despite some political turmoil. He left the post on promotion to the rank of DIG.
Vama was one of the few senior officers selected for the Overseas Command Course in UK. He implemented many things from his training in running Colombo Division. He was also responsible for the setting up of the Sri Lanka Branch of the International Police Association.
Deeply attached to his family–wife Rajes and their two children, Vama was sometimes torn between the call of duty and the attachment to the family. I am sure that it gave him some anguish. Vamadevan retired from the Service in March 1983. He was just 50 years old. Perhaps that anguish had some say in that decision, as was perhaps the difficulties in working under seriously deteriorating conditions of political instability. By that time, I had left the country, but was in touch with him regularly. When I met him shortly afterwards in Colombo, he was looking forward to a peaceful life in retirement. A few months later came the disaster that was July ‘83.
The house he and his wife built with love, and all their belongings were destroyed. He had nothing more left in the country. The hurt that it caused, and also the fact that it had to be an Air Force Officer who removed the family to safety created a bitterness in him, as he had said so many times to me in Australia. Perhaps it was the reason why he never visited Sri Lanka again.
He was a great police officer. One of a rare breed, indeed.

Khairun Nisa Reyal
Teacher beyond compare
Khairun Nisa Reyal was a teacher at Gampola Zahira College at the time I was serving there as Principal. I remember her as a dedicated, hard-working teacher, always ready to shoulder any responsibility that would lead to the betterment of children in both, curricular and extracurricular activities of the school.
Khairun Nisa Reyal was blessed with three children and left no stone unturned to bring them up; she endowed them with sterling qualities which stood them in good stead later in life
This love and concern she extended to all students of Gampola Zahira College, will always be remembered with a sense of gratitude. She showered deep and abiding affection on all children without any regard to whose children they were. I have the happiness of reminiscing an incident some 42 years ago and this I do to demonstrate the importance of the contribution by individuals like Reyal, who made a collective effort for the welfare of children.
Gampola Zahira College had just ended a week-long celebration Zahira week to commemorate its 25th year, culminating in the college prize-giving. As dusk descended, the lights on the Gampola Zahira College gorgons were switched on, signalling the start of the carnival which was expected to be the grand finale celebration of the College. But we were asked by the police and the educational authorities to close school immediately as the JVP insurrection had erupted all over the country.
On the following day, all schools closed until further notice with only the teachers reporting at the school. What were we to do with the teachers when students are not present? At this juncture, a decision was made that we should utilize this time to develop a model agriculture farm in the school premises. The staff participated in this initiative for the sake of the students. They prepared vegetable beds on which a variety of crops were grown. An experimental paddy field was also developed.
A thriving livestock and poultry farm also emerged. When the students returned, they were surprised to find a model farm developed by their teachers to enable them to involve in practical and applied agricultural studies.
It was at this time that Reyal joined the staff of Gampola Zahira. She took great interest in the farm and spent her spare time, weekends and holidays to help the farm to grow in stature.
She, along with the other teachers, encouraged and motivated the students to give their shoulder to their effort and as a result, the farm became a throbbing entity and helped in enhancing the image of the College.
Very soon, this farm was adjudged the best model farm among government schools in Kandy District. Students were also encouraged to set up home gardens using the knowledge they gained in the College farm.
Khairun Nisa Reyal, a exemplary teacher, any school would proudly have on its staff. Even more than ten years into her retirement, she, ably assisted by her daughter, was seen in the college premises supervising the improvement of infrastructural and learning facilities in the primary section initiated by her son Rizmi, using his personal funds.
It is my prayer that Gampola Zahirians will continue to be inspired by their teachers who contributed their share to make them what they are today. Gratitude, after all, is the hall-mark of Islam. May Allah grant Khairun Nisa Reyla Jennathul Firdouse.
