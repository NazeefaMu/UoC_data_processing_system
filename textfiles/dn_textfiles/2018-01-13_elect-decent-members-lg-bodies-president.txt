Elect decent members to LG bodies - President

President Maithripala Sirisena said decent people’s representatives should be elected to the local government institutions to achieve the development plans of the country fast.
The President was addressing a public rally at Hingurakgoda on Thursday evening held to ensure victory of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) candidates for the Hingurakgoda Pradeshiya Sabha.
President Sirisena said people should fulfil their duty responsibly at the elections.
"They can rectify the errors and form a people-friendly, corruption-free political culture in that way," he said.
"We should elect disciplined political representatives for the LG bodies as it is the first step to form national political leaders," the President said. He said honest people’s representatives would form a clean political culture.
President Sirisena emphasised that he will not allow any people’s representative elected under the SLFP banner to commit erroneous activities. He said he would take that responsibility as the SLFP Chairman.
Several prominent UNP activists in Moragaswewa, Ulpath Wewa, Giritale, Ulkatupotha, Hathgampaththuwa, and Siriketa joined the SLFP extending their support to the President.
The Maha Sangha of the area, religious leaders, people’s representatives and many others participated.
