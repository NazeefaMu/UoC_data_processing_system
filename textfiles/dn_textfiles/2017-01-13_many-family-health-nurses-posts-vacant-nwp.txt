Many family health nurses posts vacant  in NWP

 About 158 posts of family health nurses have fallen vacant in the North Western Province.
Mothers said they are unable to get information with regard to maternity care and treatments to their babies since maternity clinics too are not held due to the shortage of family health nurses.
A senior official attached to the North Western Province said that the Health Ministry will recruit 2,000 family health nurses shortly.
