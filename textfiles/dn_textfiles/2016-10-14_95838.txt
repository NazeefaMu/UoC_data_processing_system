Singh’s career best puts  West Indies A in command

 
West Indies A played themselves into a strong position by the end of the second day of the second 4-day unofficial test against Sri Lanka A at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday when they ran up an impressive first innings total of 509 for 9 declared and captured four home team wickets for 128 runs.
West Indies A owed their present position to Guyana’s 27-year-old left-hand middle order batsman Vishaul Singh who carried his overnight score of 81 to a career best 161 scored off 306 balls with 16 fours. It was a faultless display of batting by Singh who was given good support by Rajendra Chandrika who resumed his innings from 51 to score a useful 84 off 148 balls (9 fours) and Kemar Roach who frustrated the Lanka A bowling with a valuable 39 off 80 balls (4 fours, 2 sixes).
Pick of the bowlers was Sri Lanka under 19 captain Charith Asalanka playing in only his second first-class match he returned career best figures of 4 for 104 off 33.4 overs.
Sri Lanka’s top order batting was rattled by Kemar Roach and Keon Joseph who reduced them to 37-4 by the 18th over. Joseph accounted for the wickets of Lahiru Thirimanne for three and Roshen Silva for a first ball duck. Roach trapped opener Avishka Fernando for seven.
Off-spinner Rahkeem Cornwall who returned career best figure of 8 for 108 in the first ‘test’ also got into the act trapping Asalanka lbw for one.
Skipper Dimuth Karunaratne who hit a superb century in the first ‘test’ held the batting together with a fighting unbeaten half-century. With another Test player Niroshan Dickwella the pair has added a valuable 91 runs for the fifth wicket.
Karunaratne was unbeaten on 66 scored off 124 balls with 12 fours and Dickwella on 38 not out off 65 balls (2 fours).
Sri Lanka A trail West Indies A by 381 runs with two days play remaining.
Sri Lanka A leads the three-match series 1-0.
