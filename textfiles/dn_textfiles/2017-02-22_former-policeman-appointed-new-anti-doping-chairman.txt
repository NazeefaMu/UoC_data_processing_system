Former policeman appointed new anti-doping chairman

LONDON, TUESDAY: Retired former senior policeman Trevor Pearce is to replace David Kenworthy as chairman of United Kingdom Anti-Doping (UKAD) it was announced by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport Karen Bradley on Tuesday.
Pearce, who retired from the force in 2015 having amongst other senior positions been head of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, will take over on Thursday on a four year contract.
Kenworthy, also a former policeman, has been chairman since 2009 having been re-appointed in 2013 by the then Sports Minister Hugh Robertson. “Trevor Pearce brings with him a wealth of experience in investigations and intelligence -- areas that are crucial in the fight against doping in sport,” said Bradley in a statement.
