Kotagala Kahata Rasa Wasana promotion Ends

The ‘Kotagala Kahata – Rasa Wasana’ consumer promotion, which took place from June 7- August 10, recently came to a successful conclusion.
Twenty TVS Scooty Peps were awarded to the winners of the competition at a special prize giving ceremony on the 2nd of November at the Grand Oriental Hotel.
To qualify for the competition customers were required to post Kotagala Kahata wrappers with their name, address and telephone number to “Kotagala Kahata Rasa Wasana” Colombo.
Considering the convenience of the customers and giving them ample opportunity to participate, the Kotagala Kahata propaganda unit visited 112 towns islandwide covering 20 districts, during the promotion period.
Expressing his views on the Kotagala Kahata consumer promotion, the Company’s spokesperson stated, “This is the third time we have conducted this consumer promotion. The promotions concluded with a tremendous success in the past 2 years. Taking into consideration our customers’ huge responses in the previous round, we organized the same consumer promotion this year as well.”
He further commented on Kotagala Kahata’s journey, which began in 2012. “We are very enthusiastic about the enormous success our brand - Kotagala Kahata has achieved today in the Sri Lankan market within a short span of 5 years and its accomplishment today as the third biggest dust tea brand in the Sri Lankan market”.
