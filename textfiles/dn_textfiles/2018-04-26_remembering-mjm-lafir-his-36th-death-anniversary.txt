Remembering MJM Lafir on his 36th death anniversary

Sri Lanka's first world title winner M.J.M. Lafir will be remembered on his 36th death anniversary which falls today (April 26). Lafir won the first world title for the country with victory in the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay, in November-December 1973.
He was victorious against all his opponents and also scored the highest break of 859. It is an achievement without parallel in the annals of sports in Sri Lanka. Prior to this pinnacle of his success, Lafir had participated in international championships in Billiards and Snooker in Edinburgh, Scotland, Malta, and Auckland since 1970, but had not won any of them.
At the World Snooker tournament in Edinburgh, Scotland, in Oct-Nov 1970, Lafir defeated I L Glozier (NZ), Paul Mifsud (Malta), John Clint (N Ireland), D Sneddon (Scotland), but lost to John Phillips (Scotland) and Sidney Hood (England).
At the World Amateur Billiards Championships in Valeta, Malta, in Nov 1971, Lafir finished fourth defeating D Sneddon (Scotland), Paul Mifsud (Malta), Lance Napper (New Zealand) and lost to Manuel Fransisco (South Africa) in the preliminary rounds.
In Nov-Dec 1972, at the World Open Billiards Championship, held in Auckland, New Zealand, in which professionals as well as amateurs participated, Lafir lost to Clark McConachy (New Zealand), Eddie Charlton (Australia), Paddy Morgan (Ireland), Satish Mohan (India), Leslie Driffield (England) and Michael Ferreira (India) but won against C Everton (Wales), Jim Fryer (England), Kinsley Kennerly (England) and Jack Karneham (England). He failed to qualify for the final round.
So, it was in 1973 that he finally reached the pinnacle of his career by winning the World Amateur Billiards Championship in Bombay. He defeated Clive Everton (Wales), Michael Ferreira (India), LU Demarco (Scotland), Alfred Nolan (England), Satish Mohan (India), Eric Simons (New Zealand), Brian Kirkness (New Zealand), Phil Tarrant (Australia), and Paul Mifsud (Malta) and wrote his name in world spot, especially billiards.
On his return to Sri Lanka, after winning the World Amateur Billiard Championship, he was given a red-carpet welcome on Dec 22 1973. He was received and garlanded at the airport by the Sports & Parliamentary Affairs Minister K.B Ratnayake, Minister of Finance Dr N.M Perera, Minister of Education Dr Badiuddin Mahmud, Minister of Transport Leslie Gunawardena, Deputy Speaker IA Cader, Sir Razik Fareed and officials of the Cue Association and members of MICH. Lafir and his wife, Misriya, were conducted in a long motorcade from the airport through the more populous streets of Colombo where large crowds gathered to welcome him home and cheer his victory. He was given a rousing welcome at the MICH Fort. He also paid a courtesy visit, and met Governor General William Gopallawa, and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, both of whom received him with right royal cordiality. The Colombo Municipal Council accorded him a civic reception in his honor on Dec 31, 1973 with Mayor Vincent Perera.
In January 1974 he was given a grand welcome in Kandy, and an exhibition billiard game was played between him and MSU Mohideen at the Trinity College hall on the table borrowed from Kandy Garden Club. The people who organized this match were Chandra Wijenayake, A.M.I.N. Marikar, Dr. C.D.L. Fernando. M.E. Marikar, A.C.M. Faleel, E.W. Balasuriya and Simon Marawanagoda.
MJM Lafir was born on May 27, 1930 at St. Joseph's Street, Grandpas would have been lost in the "desert air" of Hulftsdorp but for two happenings. He joined MICH (Moors Islamic Cultural Home) in 1947 and played for them in their regular friendly games with other clubs and the founding of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association in 1948. Lafir was grateful to the MICH for discovering, nurturing and grooming him for big time billiards. He was well backed by late M.M. Thawfeeq, the first secretary of the Ceylon Amateur Billiards Association for providing the opportunity to play against visiting champions and to go overseas for international competitions. Though he was unafraid of facing the cue greats on the table he had one handicap that was his lack of adequate knowledge of the English Language, which would have helped him to familiarize and mix with the other players in tournaments. He however managed to master the language so well that he soon began to joke and nag his opponents on the international field and won their hearts. The launch pad for many of Lafir's triumphs overseas and boosting Sri Lanka's image overseas was provided by the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who presented him with a cheque for Rs. 100 which started the fund to send Lafir overseas to train and play with world champions.
Lafir reigned supreme for 24 years between 1949 and 1973, he annexed the National Billiards title of Sri Lanka 16 times and the National Snooker title on 15 separate occasions. He was not satisfied; he went across to India and won their National Snooker title on seven occasions from 1956 to 1976, defeating some of the best Indian stalwarts. Lafir's achievements were commendable to Sri Lanka at that time. The Colombo Municipal Council re-named Messenger Street, as M.J.M. Lafir Mawatha, as a tribute to his contribution to the cue game. He passed away on April 26 1981, a month before his 51st birthday.
