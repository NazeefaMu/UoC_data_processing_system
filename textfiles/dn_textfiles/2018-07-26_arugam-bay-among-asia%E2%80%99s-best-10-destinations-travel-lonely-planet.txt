Arugam Bay among Asia’s best 10 destinations to travel - Lonely Planet

One of the world’s most read tourist magazines, Lonely Planet has named, Arugam Bay, Sri Lanka among Asia’s best 10 destinations to travel for 2018.
“Asia is such a vast and diverse continent for anyone dreaming of an escape,” Lonely Planet Asia-Pacific media spokesperson Chris Zeiher said in a statement.
“Our experts have combed through thousands of recommendations to pick the best destinations to visit over the next 12 months. Much of the list highlights destinations that aren’t considered travel hotspots. For instance, Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay, a surf town on the east coast, is applauded for managing to “retain its cool as holidaymakers swarm the rest of the country’s ancient citadels and hiker-strewn hill stations.”
Lonely Planet’s annual Best in Asia list, now in its third year, features the travel guidebook publisher’s top 10 recommended destinations to visit in the year ahead. Lonely Planet’s Best in Asia 2018 are: 1. Busan, South Korea, 2. Uzbekistan, 3. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, 4. Western Ghats, India, 5. Nagasaki, Japan, 6. Chiang Mai, Thailand, 7. Lumbini, Nepal, 8. Arugam Bay, Sri Lanka, 9. Sìchuan Province, China, 10. Komodo National Park, Indonesia.
