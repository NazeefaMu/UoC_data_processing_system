Moving towards an export oriented economy
Lionel Wijesiri’s recent article titled ‘Moving towards an export-oriented economy’ published on July 13 is beautifully written with facts. As a lecturer with interest in global economics, I wish to add three more points to supplement his article.
First, the global economic environment is constantly changing and the conditions that made export-oriented growth a success story in previous decades need to be modified to fit into today's atmosphere when drafting an export-oriented strategy.
Second, the growing importance of successful export-oriented economies provides not only an example to be followed but, at the same time, it narrows the manoeuvring room of late comers and exerts a certain “crowding-out effect”. Third, even if there are a lot of convincing arguments, any change from one economic strategy to another one is not a question of desire and aspiration, but fundamentally depending on the availability of the necessary resources and instruments at home and of a favourable international environment that could support successful reorientation towards an export-led growth pattern.
We need to take extra precaution considering these points also, when we move in to the implementation of an export oriented economy in Sri Lanka.
