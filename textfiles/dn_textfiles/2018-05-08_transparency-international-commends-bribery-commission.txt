Transparency International commends Bribery Commission

 
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) commended the Bribery Commission for taking swift action against the two top government officials who solicited and accepted a bribe.
The TISL in a statement said it applauds the steps taken by the Bribery Commission to arrest President's Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and former Chairman of the State Timber Corporation P. Dissanayaka, on charges of soliciting a bribe and accepting a sum of Rs. 20 million as an advance payment.
TISL said it believes this sets an excellent example of collaboration between the private sector and CIABOC to counter public sector corruption.
Whilst welcoming President Maithripala Sirisena's approval to immediately interdict the officials concerned and instructions to authorities to enforce the law without obstruction, TISL said it wishes to highlight the importance of transitioning to a system of accountability that functions independently of political power, without requiring 'political clearance' to proceed.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said the need for political approval before proceeding highlights the potential for political interference. When political approval is no longer sought, that is when anti-corruption will move from having ad hoc success to gaining true public trust in upholding the rule of law'.
TISL also called on CIABOC to actively pursue investigations into other stalled investment projects which may uncover further instances of grand corruption.
