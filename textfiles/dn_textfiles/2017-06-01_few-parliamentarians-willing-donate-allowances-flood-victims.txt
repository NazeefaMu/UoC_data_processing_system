Few parliamentarians willing to donate allowances to flood victims

No parliamentarian, in writing, has expressed their willingness to donate their monthly allowances to flood victims, said Accountant and Finance Director of Parliament K.G.M. Jayashantha yesterday.
He said, if any minister or parliamentarian had the desire to donate their allowance to help the flood victims, he or she would have to inform parliament about it in writing. Kandy District Parliamentarian Lucky Jayawardene has informed the parliament in writing to donate his monthly salary to the flood victims.
Two parliamentarians have so far expressed this desire verbally to parliament. They are S.M. Marikkar and Sirinal de Mel.
A minister and state minister receives a monthly salary of Rs. 65,000. A deputy minister gets a monthly salary of Rs 63,500. Fuel, transport, telephone and office allowances and daily attendance payments of parliamentarians, as well as ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers, are paid by parliament. If any MP or minister desires to donate his or her monthly allowance now, only their June allowance would be deducted.
The Speaker, however, has donated his entire salary of Rs 68,500 and allowance for this purpose.
The UNP, UPFA and the JVP decided to donate the monthly allowance of parliamentarians and ministers towards disaster relief.
Parliamentary staff numbering 1,100 have taken steps to hand over yesterday's noon meals to the Elpitiya Divisional Secretariat for distribution among disaster affected people in their area.
