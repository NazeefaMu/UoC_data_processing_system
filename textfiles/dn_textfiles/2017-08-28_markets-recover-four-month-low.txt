Point of view
Share markets fell for the 6th consecutive week as uncertainty over the new tax reform bill negatively impacted market activity.
Markets lost ~54 points W-o-W during the start of the week to close at 4-month closing low on Thursday, but reversed its losing streak on Friday by adding ~27 points after the State Minister of Finance assured that the Government would exempt stock market trading from tax with no change to the current share transaction levy1.
The 1st draft of the Inland Revenue Bill proposed a 28% tax on trading stocks1. Average turnover levels however, declined over the week to amount to LKR 0.53Bn, 19% lower than last week’s average of LKR 0.65Bn and 39% lower than Y-T-D turnover levels of LKR 0.86Mn.
Crossings meanwhile, declined significantly during the week, amounting to 19% of total market turnover compared to the high 49% recorded last week.
Net foreign flows meanwhile declined to LKR 0.25Bn this week, ~75% lower than last week’s net flows of LKR 0.98Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for signs from the Inland Revenue Bill which is expected to be passed by Parliament today.

June external sector performance improves
Sri Lanka’s External sector performance improved in June with the trade deficit contracting to $554Mn cf. $775Mn in June’16.
The improved trade balance was largely due Export earnings increasing (+9.6% Y-o-Y) for the 4th consecutive month while expenditure on imports declined (-8.0% Y-o-Y) for the 1st time since Sept’16.
Lower import expenditure was primarily due to lower imports in all major categories, especially intermediate goods which declined 12.9% Y-o-Y amid lower fuel imports (-34.1% Y-o-Y).
June performance was also aided supported by continuous inflows G-secs and equities. Nevertheless, workers’ remittances declined over June amid economic and geopolitical issues in the Middle East while tourist earnings remained largely flat as arrivals from the Middle East fell and Chinese tourist arrivals remained stagnant.
Reflecting in part the stronger performance over Jun’17, the overall B-o-P recorded a surplus of $1,563.4Mn during H1’17 relative to a deficit of $1,186.1Mn in H1’16.
The country’s gross official reserves meanwhile rose to $7.0Bn by end June 2017(amid proceeds from the ISB and syndicated loan) and the YTD LKR depreciation (against the USD) over the period was consequently 2.0%.
