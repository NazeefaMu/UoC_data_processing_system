University of Moratuwa launches SL Design Code 2017 Exhibition

The University of Moratuwa's Department of Integrated Design announced the launch of the Sri Lanka Design Code 2017 exhibition, to be held on May 20 and 21, catering to the emerging design economy in Sri Lanka.
The exhibition will be held at Trace Expert City, Maradana.
It is a well-known fact that the University of Moratuwa is the most sought after technological university in Sri Lanka. The Department of Integrated Design stands as the peerless government university specialized in the field of design in Sri Lanka.
Addressing the necessities of the Sri Lankan design industry through a unique learning process, it acts as the integrated solution in design innovations.
Design Code 2017 Exhibition is part of the Department's mission. The announcement was made at a media conference held on May 17 at the National Library Auditorium.
The creativity of students, which is challenged by the conventional method of university entry based on the Advanced Level examinations, is to be preserved as a national responsibility.
In the Department of Integrated Design studies are conducted via three streams: Media and Communication Design, Product Design, and Fashion and Lifestyle Design.
Continuous assessments based on modules are used to assess the students, which are supported by field visits, and workshops. Building connections between foreign and local universities and so widening the exposure of students in the design industry has been identified as a social and an economical need.
The exhibition is a step in fulfilling this need and will include talks, a series of discussions by industry experts and foreign designers, and workshops focused on school students to enhance their creative abilities.
The design executions of students in every academic year will be exhibited. Products developed by using bamboo as a raw material, empowering young design entrepreneurship and the local craft economy will be presented by second year students to fulfill an academic and national need.
As the climax of the event, avant garde and graduation collections will be exhibited on an outdoor fashion ramp. This exhibition will open up new opportunities for the Sri Lankan design community.
