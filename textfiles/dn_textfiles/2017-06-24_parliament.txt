Parliament

SAITM will be brought under a Managing Committee and introduced to Share Market: Health Minister
SAITM would be brought under a Management Committee and would be introduced to the Share Market, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He assured that SAITM education would be standardized and made available to students to continue with their education. He added that Dr Neville Fernando could only remain as the Chairman. The SAITM would be managed under a board of professionals which would have financial control. He also said that admissions to the SAITM had been halted temporarily.
The Minister also assured that the Unity Government would not do anything that would affect free education, including medical education. He added that the government would guarantee education to all.
He made these observations in Parliament yesterday in response to the Adjournment Motion moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. "Under this unity government, not only free education is guaranteed, but free health as well," Minister Rajitha Senaratne said. "Under this government in which the UNP is a co party, limits to treatment in public hospitals have been lifted unlike during other previous governments in line with their pledges.
"He also said that socialism is commendable, but should be tolerable in the country. He added that socialism should be modernized in such a manner as that of Latin American Socialism.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne also said that there was no standard even to medical faculties of government universities.
"It was me who took measures to draft a standard to the medical education in the country," Minister Senaratne said. "I received it two days ago from the Sri Lanka Medical Council and I asked them to hand over a copy to the Legal Draftsman's Department as well."
He also said that when the standard of medical faculties are concerned, the standard and facilities of some government medical faculties are far below than that of SAITM. He admitted that there were less patients at the SAITM hospital though it has commendable facilities. "It should be the government's responsibility to grant a hospital to them," Minister Senaratne said.
He said this government would take measures to strengthen free education. "By 2018, all university students would be given hostel facilities," Minister Senaratne said. "Kuliyapitiya and Sabaragamuwa hospitals would also be given medical faculties. The intake of the Karapitiya Medical Faculty would be increased fro, 150 to 300. The Moratuwa Medical Faculty too has requested for a medical faculty," he said.
He added that the first Batch of the North Colombo Medical Faculty in Ragama has produced 13 leading professors of medicine.
"So we cannot belittle the abilities of students of private medical faculties," Minister Senaratne said. "The KDU Medical Faculty had nothing when it was granted approval. Within 45 minutes, approval was given. It had only two chapters. It was given due to the intervention of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa."
He added that the Medical Faculty in Chittagong, Bangladesh, where our students study medicine has minimal standards. "Its a pathetic situation," said Minister Senaratne.
"We have made health service available free for patients. Cancer Hospital patients are given free medicine unlike before. Free drugs were provided for less than Rs 1.5 million. Stents and the eye lenses are provided free to patients."
He also warned the JVP not to stop talking of taking clubs and poles into their hands against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine as such action would pave way for Frontline Socialist Party members to take T56 rifles into their hands.
AITM will be taken over and converted into a dengue hospital: Minister Kiriella
The Government would take over SAITM and convert it into a Dengue Hospital, said Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He said that whatever the Joint Opposition says, the government would not take over the SAITM. He also thanked MP Dinesh Gunawardena for moving the gazette during the previous regime to set up the SAITM.
"It was set up during the last regime as an institution which conducts courses for MBBS," Minister Kiriella said. "The Mahinda Rajapaksa Government granted a loan of Rs 600 million. But now MP Gunawardena is speaking against the same. However we thank Dinesh Gunawardena for setting up the SAITM." He made these observations in response to the Adjournment Motion moved Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
Minister Kiriella said the Supreme Court case was to be taken up on Thursday. The students protested and the GMOA staged the strike to influence the Court and the Court order. "But this will have a boom-rang effect on those who protested and staged the strike," Minister Kiriella said.
He also stated that Dinesh Gunawardena said that student representatives went to the Health Ministry for discussions. "But there were around 1,000 students with iron poles in hand," Minister Kiriella said. "We saw it on television.
They destroyed the iron gates. Students cannot decide the education policy of the country. It is decided by the government. The Last government took a policy decision to set up SAITM. It was Dinesh Gunawardena who presented the gazette of SAITM on December 11, 2013. We appreciate it and thank Dinesh Gunawardena for it."
Minister Kiriella said that a secret vote was taken in two medical faculties last week, while 99 percent of the medical students voted for following lectures. "Then who does them?" questioned Minister Kiriella. "The Sri Lanka Medical Council only takes decisions on medical studies. The GMOA is a trade Union."
Minister Kiriella also said that the doctors' strike was a failure. "The people would provide their answer to the doctors in a few days if the strike continued," Minister Kiriella said. "Some people have answered to some doctors in Chilaw. This would happen everywhere in the country."
He added that the government would takeover the SAITM hospital and convert it into a Dengu Hospital.
He also said that whatever the Joint Opposition says, the government would not take over SAITM. He made this statement while Sriyani Wijewickrama was speaking joining the debate.
 
SAITM issue: Government's Battle of Waterloo near at hand:Handunnetti
The day the country's youth take to the streets with iron bars would not be far if the Government does not shut down the SAITM in Malabe, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said in Parliament yesterday.
The MP speaking at the Adjournment Debate said the JVP would give leadership to a broader alliance comprised of different political parties and professional unions against SAITM. He predicted that those in the Government too who hold dissenting views would also join with this coalition against the SAITM.
“We vow to take this struggle forward until the Government shuts down the SAITM. If the Government hesitates to do so, it will be sent home. The Battle of Waterloo marked the final defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte despite many of his successful campaigns prior to that. Likewise, the SAITM struggle would mark the end of this Government. Now this is a battle being fought on the streets,” he warned.
“IUSF Convenor Lahiru Weerasekara has been arrested. He was demonstrating unarmed, but the day the protestors bear iron bars and clubs would also not be far,” he stressed.
The MP said the internal differences of the Government would reach a climax with the SAITM issue. “Not all in the Government hold the same position with regard to SAITM. There are a considerable number of Ministers and MPs holding different views. However, a few in the Government, who take arbitrary decisions, try to control everything. It is the Government that pushes the doctors to strike,” he added.
JO warns impending recurrence of 1988-89 riots if students are further suppressed
Joint Opposition members yesterday, warned of a recurrence of the 1988-89 riots in the country if the Government continued to suppress the student community by using force.
Joint Opposition members who took part in the Adjournment Debate in Parliament yesterday on the SAITM issue, expressed their displeasure over the Government’s reaction to the students’ protests last Wednesday and the subsequent strike by the doctors.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena moving the Adjournment Motion urged the Government to engage with the doctors and students without suppressing them by force.
“As a result of the clash between the Police and the students, over 88 students were injured. The Medical Faculties are not functioning for over 6 months as over 8,000 medical students have been boycotting classes. The quality of medical education is important than the business of one or two individuals. You cannot allow SAITM to produce half-baked doctors. I ask the Government to be fair,” he said.
He also shirked the responsibility for the Gazette he presented to Parliament as the Chief Government Whip of the previous Government to confer the degree awarding status to the SAITM.
“The Gazette was signed by then Higher Education Minister S B Dissanayake. As the Chief Government Whip, I presented many documents to the House. It was Minister Dissanayake who messed up all these,” he said.
MP Gunawardena also stressed that the Neville Fernando hospital had not been recognized or registered as a teaching hospital, adding that a medical college could not operate without a teaching hospital.
The MP also brought the attention of the House to a letter sent by Higher Education Ministry Secretary to SAITM Chairman last month over an appeal submitted by the Parents' Association of the fourth batch of SAITM students regarding an attempt of conducting an invalid MBBS examination by SAITM for the fourth batch.
JO MPs Dr Ramesh Pathirana and Jayantha Samaraweera taking part in the debate warned of an impending dark era similar to that of 1988-89 due to creating students unrest in the country.
