Lowest financing rates from Pan Asia Bank Leasing

Pan Asia Bank which has earned a strong reputation for its novel leasing solutions has introduced Budget+ Lease a tailor made leasing option that addresses requirements of salaried employees.
Budget + Lease is a five year lease product with a residual value which enables individuals to purchase their dream vehicle despite their budget limitations. The product also comes with a special interest rate, giving an added incentive for clients to purchase higher value vehicle.
A Budget + lease facility can be availed to purchase both hybrid and regular vehicles, be it brand new, reconditioned or registered.
‘The main feature of a budget lease is the increase in the buying power of an individual, where we will give our clients the opportunity to purchase a higher valued vehicle at his budget’, stated Shiyan Perera, Assistant General Manager Branch Credit and Deposit Mobilization.
‘Quality of the service provided by Pan Asia Bank differentiates us from other financial institutions. We are faster and much friendlier. We offer doorstep service at the customer’s convenience and take only 24 hours to process the lease. All our 85 island wide branches do meet this benchmark. While “Budget+” solution is not limited to hybrid vehicles, from a sustainability point of view it is encouraging to see the increasing demand for hybrid vehicles in Sri Lanka as it helps the country to move towards a greener environment. Further, with Budget+ customers can enjoy flexible repayment patterns to suit their planned cash flows, special insurance packages, attractive discounts on early settlements and many other benefits’, Perera further added.
