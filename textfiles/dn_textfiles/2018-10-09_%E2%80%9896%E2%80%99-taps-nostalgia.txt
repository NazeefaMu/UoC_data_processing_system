‘96’ taps into nostalgia

There is a lot to fall in love with 96, a wistful romantic film about a past romance, like Autograph and Premam. But what sets Prem Kumar’s film apart from the others is that it gives equal importance to the romance of its female lead. It does begin as the story of its male lead, Ram (Vijay Sethupathi), a travel photographer. A chance visit to his native, Tanjore, triggers a flood of memories for him… the places that have defined his childhood, like the bus stand where his parents landed at after their marriage, the hospital where he was born, the place that was the first major shopping centre in his town, and most importantly, the school where he met the love of his life, Janaki Devi (Trisha). That is the only place that he chooses to drop by, and this leads to him connecting with his old classmates, and they all decide to have a reunion. And that is where he meets Janaki, his Janu, once again, after a gap of 22 years.
The Tamil film ‘96’ is screening at Capitol, MC Jaffna, MC Colombo, Cine City and other film halls
