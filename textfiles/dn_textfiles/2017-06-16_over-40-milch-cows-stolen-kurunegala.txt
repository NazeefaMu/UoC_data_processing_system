Over 40 milch cows stolen in Kurunegala

About 48 milch cows and 12 calves have been stolen from several areas in the Kurunegala District during past three weeks.
Six dairy farmers at Meegalewa have complained that six milch cows have been stolen during past two days. Police believed that stolen cattle are transported to distant areas to be slaughtered.
