Nishikori replaces Nadal in top five

Paris: Japan's Kei Nishikori climbed two places to fifth in the latest ATP rankings released on Monday at the expense of Rafael Nadal, who slips to seventh. Britain's Andy Murray continues to lead the top 10 which is unchanged aside from Nishikori's upward move, which could have a bearing on his and Nadal's seeding for the upcoming Barcelona ATP tournament.
The pair met in the final last year, with Nadal prevailing.
Nishikori has opted to skip this week's Monte Carlo Masters where Nadal goes for an unprecedented 10th title. AFP
