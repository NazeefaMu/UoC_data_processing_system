Request  for streamlined standard ID for Mahasangha

The Mahanayake Theras of the Three Nikayas in a memorandum addressed to President Maithripala Sirisena have requested him to ensure that a streamlined standard identity card is issued to all members of the Mahasangha to prevent people on court warrants masquerading as Buddhist monks, acting in a manner causing disgrace to the true Buddhaputras.
They have pointed our that Sri Lanka is a repository of Theravada Buddhism in its pristine pure form and all sections including the Government should take appropriate steps to safeguard the prestige we had won on this count.
As such, the time had come to issue a standard and streamlined identity card to members of the Sangha to expel rouques masquerading as Buddhist monks from the Bhikkhu Sasana. The signatures to the memorandum are the most Ven. Tibbatuware Sri Siddharta Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter, the Most Ven Warakagoda Sri Gnanaratana Mahanayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter, Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Supreme Mahanayake Thera of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya and Most Ven. Napana Sri Pemasiri Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya. Media reports about misdeamonours caused by people masquerading as Buddhist monks had caused consternation among not only Buddhists but also non Buddhists in the country.
They have stated that details including the name of the Samanera Bhikku, Headquarters of the Chapter under which he obtained priesthood, INC number during the lay status and date, the date on which priesthood was obtained and the temple of permanent residence should be included in the identity card.
In the case of Bhikkhus who have received higher ordination, their name, the Chapter under which he obtained priesthood and its headquarters, the names and addresses of Bhikkhus who offered tutelage and preceptorships, date of registration of higher ordination, number and date of issue of an NIC issued during his lay status if any, date of birth, date of obtaining priesthood and Temple of residence should be clearly stated.
