MR thanks MS for appointing Presidential Committee

Former President and Kurunegala District Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for having appointed a Presidential Committee to investigate into the controversial Treasury Bond scam.
Addressing a meeting at Diyatalawa, Rajapaksa said, “Ranil keeps talking of the debt we left to the current government and that he is buried by it. But the papers now say that they tried to get the gazette to say that it was during my time that the Central Bank needed to borrow so much.” “I was gone by January 8, 2015, the gazette notification was printed a year later. It was lucky that the President appointed this committee. If not they would try to blame me for this as well,” the former President said.
The Presidential Committee to investigate the bond scam is currently looking into the various procedures which led to the issuance of the bonds.
They are to visit the Central Bank today to observe the manner in which the Treasury bonds were issued.
