A NOVEL way to be happy

I once knew a young man who had the habit of dropping in at our place every weekend, to see my mother because his aunt had once worked with my mother, because he liked to listen to my father's views on politics, discuss the stock market with my brother and play with our dog, the late Rambo D. On one visit he sauntered to the bookshelf in our living room, read the titles with deep interest, and upon being invited to choose any book he liked, to read and return, turned to me and asked which of the books would make him fall asleep faster?
I was miffed by his question. It seemed incredible that anyone would want to use a book as a passport to enter the land of slumber. But last Friday, totally stressed out after a week of juggling my writing projects with my daughter's school and extra curricular events, lost library cards, an eight-hour power cut, a grumpy cat and a scorched garden and wanting to find a way to relax, when I searched Google for help I came across 8,880,000 articles that said he was right after all. "Reading is a great way to calm your mind and cue your body up for shut-eye" say the experts.
Beating stress
Provided, of course that the book is not a page-turner that will keep you up all night. (Try Brothers Karamazov and Ulysses for best effects). Using them as a nightcap apart, curling up with a good book anytime of the day, preferably with a hot cup of tea and a purr-bundle of fur on your lap could be one of the greatest ways to beat stress. And this works better and faster, so say the research reports, than other methods to calm frazzled nerves such as listening to music, going for a walk or settling down with a cup of coffee. Psychologists believe this is because the human mind has to concentrate on reading and the distraction of being taken into a literary world eases the tensions in muscles and the heart. According to cognitive neuropsychiatric Dr David Lewis, a study carried out on a group of volunteers by the University of Sussex revealed reading worked as the best method for relaxing, reducing stress levels by 68 per cent. "It really doesn't matter what book you read, by losing yourself in a thoroughly engrossing book you can escape from the worries and stresses of the everyday world and spend a while exploring the domain of the author's imagination," says Dr. Lewis and further adds, "This is more than merely a distraction but an active engaging of the imagination as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness."
Unlimited happiness
So, there is nothing like the fragrance of a printed book (specially because, you will never run low on battery)when it is perfectly clear that diving into a sea of white paper can offer us unlimited happiness.
As Dr. Seuss once wrote, "The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." Splashing into a good book opens up a whole world of knowledge starting from a very young age. Children's books expose kids to 50 percent more words than prime time TV, according to a paper from the University of California, Berkeley. Exposure to that new vocabulary not only leads to higher scores on reading tests, but also higher scores on general tests of intelligence. Plus, stronger early reading skills may mean higher intelligence later in life.
(A quick tip: If you're looking for a power read, opt for a traditional book. Research suggests that reading on a screen can slow you down by as much as 20 to 30 percent.)
Plus, not only does regular reading help make you smarter, but it can actually increase your brain power. Just like going for jogging to exercise your cardiovascular system, reading regularly improves memory function by giving your brain a good work out. According to research published in 'Neurology', with age comes a decline in memory and brain function, but regular reading may help slow the process, keeping minds sharper longer. Frequent brain exercise can lower mental decline by 32 percent, reports The Huffington Post.
Other people's emotions
Reading can also make you more empathetic. Getting lost in a good read can make it easier for you to relate to others. This could be why George Eliot, who is rumored to have overcome her grief at losing her life partner through a program of guided reading with a young man who went on to become her husband, believed that "art is the nearest thing to life; it is a mode of amplifying experience and extending our contact with our fellow-men beyond the bounds of our personal lot." Literary fiction, specifically, has the power to help its readers understand what others are thinking by reading other people's emotions, says a research report published in the Science magazine.
The impact is much more significant on those who read literary fiction as opposed to those who read nonfiction."Understanding others' mental states is a crucial skill that enables the complex social relationships that characterize human societies," David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano explain in their article on the subject.
This could mean that reading may help fight Alzheimer's disease. After all, reading puts your brain to work, and that's a very good thing. Those who engage their brains through activities such as reading, chess, or puzzles could be 2.5 times less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who spend their down time on less stimulating activities. Experts suggest that exercising the brain through reading may help a lot as inactivity increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's.
These facts are only a few that I found on the tip of one huge iceberg made up of studies conducted on the health and psychological benefits of reading books. If you spend the time going through the long lists of research reports on Google, you might just walk away thinking that reading is some sort of super activity, a wonder drug that makes us smarter and healthier. And guess what? You are right.
A final warning before I go: reading enables lifelong learning and an insatiable thirst for knowledge. Books are a window to the world -- a glimpse into to cultures past, present, and future, as interpreted by their authors and filtered through our own imaginations. You can discover an amazing amount of information about where we have been, where we are going, and how things work. The more you know, the more you will be able to share. You will be a better conversationalist, a quicker thinker, a better problem solver. In any sort of creative field, these are skills that come in pretty handy.
Plain fun
In his 1905 essay "On Reading," Marcel Proust puts it nicely: "With books there is no forced sociability. If we pass the evening with those friends-books-it's because we really want to. When we leave them, we do so with regret and, when we have left them, there are none of those thoughts that spoil friendship: 'What did they think of us?'-'Did we make a mistake and say something tactless?'-'Did they like us?'-nor is there the anxiety of being forgotten because of displacement by someone else."
Try it out. It's plain fun. 30 minutes a day, turn off everything but your brain and see how much better you feel.
As for those of you who are wondering what became of the young man in our living room, he is currently reading Herman Wouk's 'Inside, Outside' and, would you believe it, dear reader, I married him.
Here's why you should go read a book right now
1. Stress Reduction
No matter how much stress you have at work, in your personal relationships, or countless other issues faced in daily life, it all just slips away when you lose yourself in a great story.
2. Knowledge
Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come in handy. The more knowledge you have, the better-equipped you are to tackle any challenge you'll ever face.
3. Stronger Analytical Thinking Skills
Have you ever read an amazing mystery novel, and solved the mystery yourself before finishing the book? If so, you were able to put critical and analytical thinking to work by taking note of all the details provided and sorting them out to determine "whodunnit".
4. Better Writing Skills
This goes hand-in-hand with the expansion of your vocabulary: exposure to published, well-written work has a noted effect on one's own writing, as observing the cadence, fluidity, and writing styles of other authors will invariably influence your own work.
5. Tranquility
In addition to the relaxation that accompanies reading a good book, it's possible that the subject you read about can bring about immense inner peace and tranquility.
6. Free Entertainment
There's a reading genre for every literate person on the planet, and whether your tastes lie in classical literature, poetry, fashion magazines, biographies, religious texts, young adult books, self-help guides, street lit, or romance novels, there's something out there to capture your curiosity and imagination. Step away from your computer for a little while, crack open a book, and replenish your soul for a little while.
