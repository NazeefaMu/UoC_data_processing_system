OPPO F9 with waterdrop screen

OPPO, the Selfie Expert, will be launching a new addition to the popular F Series OPPO F9.
It will be Industry’s First handset to sport a unique Waterdrop Screen design, a front with a top notch that hosts the receiver, camera and light sensor for more condensed space and more compact layout, thereby bringing the handset a symmetrical beauty and allowing users to view more content.
The 19.5:9 waterdrop screen with a ratio of 90.8% offers an enhanced and beautiful front. The camera and the flash light come together to add more life to the concept of waterdrop design, coming across as two drops of water attracted to each other. OPPO has also introduced a new channel sound conduction to ensure a compact spatial structure while keeping the sound normal.
Making the waterdrop screen design come alive are the enhanced rounded corners on the screen. This makes the OPPO F9 more comfortable to hold and more graceful in its appearance. The camera which is integrated with the screen has been painted black with a front coating film to highlight the integrity of the front of the handset. With 46 patents, including the industry pioneering flip-LED technology, Receiver TOP Steering Sound Conduction, Light Sensation Horn-shaped Light Conduction, Gap Approaching Design, and more, OPPO F9 has been designed to bring an immersive and amazing visual experience.
