CP Governor calls for separate investigation

The Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake has called for a separate probe on the deployment of 250 schoolchildren to hold the saree fall extending up to 3.2 km of a bride who was vying to set a Guinness record in Kandy recently.
This is in addition to an investigation launched by the National Child Protection Authority on the same incident.
The Governor has summoned the Secretary to the Provincial Education Ministry, Director General of the provicial education, the Director in Charge of the Katugastota Zonal Educational Division and the Principal of the School in Katugastota where the children were studying.
They have been requested to be present at the Governor’s office today.
The bride married at a hotel in kandy on September 22 was vying to set up a Guinness World Record by wearing a Kandyan style saree (Osariya) with the longest fall extending up to 3.2 km.
The observation for the record was made by spreading the saree fall from the Peradeniya Junction up to the Eriyagama Junction along the Gannoruwa road to announce the record at Gannoruwa. Reportedly, 250 children of the Sarath Ekanayake Primary school, Alawathuwala were asked to come to school by 6 a.m. Later, the children in school uniforms were asked to stand in line for four hours along the main road from Getambe to the Eeriyagama Junction in the scorching sun.
The Education Ministry through a circular to schools and provincial educational authorities has prevented authorities from using children for outside activities without proper authorisation.
