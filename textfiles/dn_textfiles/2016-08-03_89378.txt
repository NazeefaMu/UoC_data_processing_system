Time to clean SLFP: UPFA, SLFP General Secretaries

UPFA and SLFP General Secretaries Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake said the time has come to clean the SLFP to achieve glory again and create a united party.
They were addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
UPFA General Secretary Mahinbda Amaraweera said the leaders who organised the Paada Yatra could not bring as many people as they pledged and boasted.
“They gave thousands of speeches earlier. But it ended with a few people. There were 10 to 15 thousand people instead of one million people,” he said.
He said the Paada Yatra was an utter failure and criticised those who hooted at the SLFP headquarters while marching in the Paada Yatra.
“This is something similar to one insulting one’s own mother. This sort of behaviour can never be accepted. It was observed that drunk people were seen marching in the Paada Yatra uttering obscene language,” he said.
Amaraweera said those who acted in an unruly manner at the Paada Yatra were SLFP parliament members linked to the Joint Opposition.
They said that the Paada Yatra was against the UNP, but it was revealed that the ulterior motive of it was to split the SLFP, he said.
He said moves are under way to strengthen the party. New organisers are appointed. Women are encouraged to join the SLFP.
Party General Secretary Dumina Dissnayake said the Joint Opposition (JO) is pushing the country to extremism and communalism by levelling baseless allegations.
He said Parliament cannot be dissolved until it completes over four years. It is useless to have this kind of protests against the government.
All 225 Parliamentarians have agreed with the process of formulating a new Constitution when the proposal was presented in Parliament, eventhough certain JO members claim that the new Constitution is a death trap.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said the utmost priority is given to strengthen the party.
He said even though those who organised the Paada Yatra said that they take the governing, there is no provision in the Constitution to take power when there is a government.
A committee has been appointed to organise the SLFP’s 65th convention, which will be held on September, Perera said.
