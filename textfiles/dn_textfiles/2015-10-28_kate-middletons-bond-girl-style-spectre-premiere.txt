Kate Middleton's Bond Girl Style for Spectre Premiere

Consider us shaken and stirred - in the best way! Kate Middleton waltzed onto the scene at the world premiere and Royal Film Performance of the latest James Bond film, Spectre, on Monday, October 26, wearing an especially sizzling ensemble, complete with a sheer back.
Stepping onto the red carpet at London's Royal Albert Hall, the Duchess of Cambridge, 33, stunned in a see-through, gray blue confection by one of her favorite designers, Jenny Packham. Middleton accessorized with the label's crystal-embellished belt and bedazzled "Casa" clutch, aquamarine Robinson Pelham chandelier earrings (on loan from her mom, Carole Middleton), and her tried-and-true Jimmy Choo platform sandals.
While the mother of two - Prince George, 2, and Princess Charlotte, 5 months - regularly turns heads in her ensembles, this one was especially a standout, as at its base, it is a halter dress enveloped in a sheer overlay, putting her toned back and arms on display.
As she had been for a charitable BAFTA event earlier that day, the duchess was accompanied to the premiere by her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Prince Harry, both of whom looked quite dapper in their tuxedos.
Once inside, the royal trio met with members of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), which helps to support those who work behind the scenes in British motion pictures, as well as representatives from two more charities, Save the Children and Shelterbox.
After that, the royals greeted the A-list cast of Spectre, including Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Naomie Harris (in Stella McCartney), Lea Seydoux (in Prada), Monica Bellucci (in Ralph & Russo), Stephanie Sigman (in Marchesa), and Ben Whishaw.
Spectre is third James Bond film chosen for a Royal Film Performance, which highlights iconic movies (with members of the royal family in attendance!) since it began in 1946. Each Royal Film Performance screening helps to aid the CTBF.
Titanic (1997), Star Wars: Episode 1 (1999), and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) have all been Royal Film Performances. Most recently, 2015's The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was given the honor and attended by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Yahoo
