Purchase of condos by expats sees exponential growth - Blue Ocean

The construction and real estate industry has been a major contributor to Sri Lanka’s rapid economic development over the past few years, says Blue Ocean Chairman S. Thumilan.
Blue Ocean Group of Companies has become the market leader in the construction of condominiums developing over 1,100 units spanning 10 cities in Colombo and the suburbs, he said.
The country has rushed to make up for its more than two-and-a-half decades of intermittent building activity across most segments, from high-end residential housing to commercial and office space to a variety of key infrastructure segments.
The world has now shown a keen interest in Sri Lanka, thanks to its ongoing socioeconomic stability and rapid economic growth.
Global investors see afresh the opportunities that they can have by investing in Sri Lanka, which lies very close to one of the most sought after international sea trade routes.
Thumilan said his firm was aware that many without knowledge or previous exposure in the industry have predicted a drop in demand, by claiming that the market has reached a point of saturation. This could not be further from the actual situation, as they were quite confident about the behavioural aspects of the luxury housing market.
“Many Sri Lankan nationals who left the country previously during the civil war and lived overseas until now in Europe, Australia, Canada and USA have begun returning to their country of birth seeking an abode for retirement which also will provide them with a sense of belonging and the opportunity to be amongst family and friends,” he said.
“Further, Sri Lanka’s conducive climate in comparison to the countries mentioned above and the religious cultural traditions make them eager to return.”
As a result, vast numbers of expats are looking to buy apartments for both investment and accommodation purposes. Since of late, purchase of condominiums in Sri Lanka by high net-worth expats has seen an exponential growth, Thumilan says.
Earlier this year, a research conducted amongst the high net-worth families in China found out that more than 60% of the rich families have already immigrated to another country or were considering the prospects of immigrating. This has also become a growing trend in the oil-rich Middle East and North African (MENA) economies.
Accurate research by those who intend to purchase property here would indicate that the prices of apartment buildings in our country continue to be attractive in comparison to other property prices in Europe, Hong Kong or even China.
“The government’s commendable decision to grant a temporary residence visa for a period of two years (extendable on expiry), under the ‘Dream Home’ policy has encouraged many retired expatriates who are looking to migrate to warmer countries, to consider investing towards purchasing property in our country. Similar visa facilities and schemes have helped countries such as Malaysia and Dubai to successfully attract pensioners and retirees,” Thumilan said.
“Blue Ocean Group also possesses the experience, technical expertise, manpower and financial strength to carry out any type of small, large or massive construction projects that the government and private sector envisage in their journey towards the development of Sri Lanka,” Thumilan said.
“To ensure the sustainability of the social and environmental aspects associated with our business, we continue to embrace best practices for social and environmental management,” he said.
"From a social perspective, our infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and has improved the standard of living of our stakeholders."
“Our work to empower these communities has made Blue Ocean Group a brand name and an exemplary corporate citizen of Sri Lanka,” Thumilan said.
