Carcasses of two leopards suspected to have been poisoned found

The carcasses of two leopards endemic to Sri Lanka and also listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, were found yesterday at Bowella, Nilgala in the Galoya National Wildlife Park in Bibila yesterday (31).
The two leopards (Panthera Parduskotiya) in the age group of around two years, were found by the Police and Wildlife officers on a tip off received by the Karandugala Police.
The bodies of the leopards were lying on the ground within a distance of five metres and a carcass of a calf suspected to be poisoned lying nearby.
Veterinary Surgeon W M Darmakeerthi of the Uva Central Range, who accompanied the group, said the death of the leopards could be by poison. He added that the remains of the leopards would be analysed at the Eth Athurusevana at Udawalawa, to ascertain the cause of death.
Residents of the area said that the two leopards had been roaming in the area preying on animals such as cattle in the area.
A group of Karandugala Police led by OIC IP H M Udayapala and officers of the Galoya National Wildlife Park led by Pradeep N Munasinghe found the leopard.
