Four times Asian rugby championship captain Priyantha Ekanayake with his tremendous experience as a player and administrator is making a return to the rugby scrum, not to actively participate but to help in the promotion of the game as the CEO of the SLRFU. He will return to the administrative from November 1.
The former St. Anthony’s College, Kandy SC, CH & FC, CR & FC, Colombo Clubs, Upcountry and Sri Lanka forward who also played for the Asian Barbarians and led all the teams he played except CH and FC.
Priyantha was one time Kandy SC committee member and Vice President. He comes in with a wealth of experience. He can be rated as the best ruggerite produced by St. Anthony’s College, and is the first Antonian to lead Sri Lanka at rugby. He has the unique achievement of being the only ruggerite to lead the country at four ‘Asian rugby championships.
Though he ended up at St. Anthony’s College, he first went to Rikilagaskanda Central, in the shadows of Dumbara Valley.
He was an outstanding third row forward during his days. He had an excellent record in school with his natural talent. Towering over six feet, Priyantha played rugger, cricket, and basketball and also took part in athletics for the Antonians from 1973 to 1985.
His pet sport was basketball at school, and he represented the country at the 7th Asian Basketball Championship in Seoul, Korea where he also obtained a Korean Diploma in Basketball Coaching.
Later he represented the country at several tournaments. At cricket he was a fine all-rounder,where he shaped up as a good pace bowler but rugby robbed him from cricket. He started his rugby career under the guidance of the famous Antonian coach late Kalu Perera, who coached him till he left school. While still at school he played for Kandy SC.
There was no stopping Priyantha who represented the Sri Lanka Under 25 team and toured Taipei in 1985. From about this time he was an automatic choice for the national team. After seeing his talent, in the very same year CH & FC’s kingpin at the time, Kishin Butani invited him to play for the Maitland Crescent Club and he played in the R. Premadasa Trophy Championship which CH & FC went on to
win. After a short stint at CH & FC he crossed over to CR & FC in 1987 on the invitation of Malik Samarawickrema and played for them till 1991 captaining the side in 1990.
In 1992 Priyantha and a set of players from CR & FC, most of them products of Kandy schools, came over to Kandy, and helped the club to win their first ever trophy in rugby after 42 years.
It was Priyantha, who motivated the Nittawela boys to do great things. From the year 1985 to 1997 Priyantha was a regular member of the Sri Lanka team and had the privilege of leading the country at four Asiads, a record.
Priyantha also had a stint in New Zealand where he played for Ravense Bourne Sports Club in the Premier League. He also played in Wales for Ebbebale Province.
In 1997 he made Kandy and the country proud by leading the Asian Barbarians invitation team. The Barbarians comprised players from Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The other players who were selected were Thushara Jayalath of Havelocks SC and Asoka Jayasena of Kandy SC, but Asoka skipped the game due to the Kandy SC Cup final. In the main game, they met the Hong Kong Dragons where again the Barbarians won by 26 points to nil.
Priyantha coached the Kandy SC when Haris Omar led the team, and helped the club to win the inter club sevens for the first time in 1999. In the last couple of years he was involved with St. Anthony’s College rugby. So, with his experience, he is sure to excel in administration as well.
