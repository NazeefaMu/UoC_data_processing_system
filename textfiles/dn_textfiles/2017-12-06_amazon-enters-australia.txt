Amazon enters Australia

Amazon has made its long-awaited entry into Australia, in a move that could have ramifications for the country's A$300bn (£171bn) retail sector.
Online shopping makes up a relatively small - but growing - proportion of retail sales in Australia.
Geography, poor infrastructure and firms slow to adapt to e-commerce have held the sector back. Australia's retail industry association said Amazon would help local firms by providing a new sales platform.
Australian consumers could previously buy through Amazon's US site.
From Tuesday they can buy locally, as the American retail giant has established a huge distribution warehouse on the outskirts of Melbourne on the country's east coast, home to most of the population.
