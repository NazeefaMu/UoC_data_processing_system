Writ petition against J’pura MC fixed for support on April 2

A writ petition filed by Sri Lanka Freedom Party Chief Organiser for Sri Jayewardenepura Janaka Ranawaka, seeking an interim order preventing the commencement of the inaugural meeting of the Sri Jayewardnepura Municipal Council and the election of its new Mayor and Deputy Mayor, was fixed for support on April 2 by Supreme Court, yesterday.
Ranawaka stated that there is a disproportionate distribution of members among the political parties thus distorting the will of the voters of the Sri Jayawardanepura Kotte Municipal Council area.
He further sought an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari, quashing the relevant Gazette Notification published by the Election Commission, determining the total number of members to be returned to the Sri Jayawardanepura, Kotte, Municipal Council and determining the allocation of members to recognised political parties.
Filing this writ petition through Counsel Manjula Balasuriya, the petitioner cited 50 persons including Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and the members of the National Election Commission as respondents.
