Country should join digital revolution: PM

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the country’s economy can not be strengthened without joining the digital revolution.
“Sri Lanka should go for digitalization as the world is at the threshold of digital economy,”the Prime Minister added. He said that the demand for internet facilities is very high as mobile phone connections in Sri Lanka have exceeded the population.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of Road Side Wifi Panel at Galle Face Green yesterday evening.
The Prime Minister added that the internet plays pivotal role in economic development and the government is planning to provide internet facilities to all.
He added that the government reduced tax on internet services too and every Advanced Level student will be given a tab from April next year. “We hope to introduce over 200 such wifi panels around the city,” he said. The Prime Minister said every person should get together irrespective of petty differences to build this country. “The main two parties have joined hands to govern the country under the able leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The country can witness unprecented development in all sectors in the future,”he said.
