Clampdown on marine resources destruction

The Marine Environment Protection Authority has designed a legal framework to punish those who cause destruction to marine resources.
A fine of not less than Rs. 2,000, will be imposed on placing, depositing, dumping or releasing harmful substance to waters under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act.
A fine between Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 25,000 or a fine between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 100,000 and an imprisonment, will be imposed on any development activity within the coastal zone without a permit or dumping of waste or releasing oil into the coastal zone under the conservation act, Marine Environment Protection Authority sources said.
