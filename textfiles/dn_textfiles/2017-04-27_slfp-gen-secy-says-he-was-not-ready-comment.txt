SLFP Gen. Secy. says he was not ready to comment

Removal from post of Dambulla organizer:
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake noted that he was not ready to comment on Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, since he was behind the January 8 revolution which resulted in bringing President Maithripala Sirisena to office. He said so when the media asked him for his views concerning the removal of Tennakoon from the Dambulla Electoral Organiser post.
However, the General Secretary noted that the people behind the January 8 revolution had discussed many matters with Tennakoon and also with his son Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon at the verge of the January 8 topsy-turvy.
“They were with the revolution and also during the process of creating the present Unity Government. As a result, I’m not going to comment about the Tennakoons,” he said. When asked whether Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon’s decision to resign from his Central Provincial Council Ministerial portfolio, could be acceptable, he said that Pramitha might think that this could be the best action that a son could take for his father. He added that he did not find anything wrong with his resigning as a son.
