Destructive jumbo caught

An elephant that has been disrupting lives of the people in the Matale and Naula Divisional Secretariat areas for several months was captured on Saturday by Wildlife Officers in the Dibulgamuwa area.
It had killed two men at Lihinipitiya in the recent past and had been in a herd of nine elephants roaming in the villages destroying properties.
Lunugamwehera Veterinary Surgeon D.M. Dharmakeerthi and Wildlife Range Assistant Ranjith Vijitha had led the operation and caught the animal after four days of hard work. The elephant will be released to a wildlife zone, the officers said.
