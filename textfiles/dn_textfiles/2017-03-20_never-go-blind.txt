Never go blind

Glaucoma is an eye disease affecting the optic nerve which is usually associated with increased eye pressure and progressive visual field defects.
It is the second commonest cause of blindness in the world being second only to cataract. Currently about 60 million people suffer from this disease. It is a progressive disease and if not treated properly it can lead to blindness.
Symptoms
With the most common type of glaucoma, the open angle glaucoma, no symptoms occur usually. With the progression of the disease, visual field defects start in the peripheral field. However this may not be noticed by the patient as the central vision will remain good. Few patients may also experience slight headache, tearing or difficulty in looking at light.
With the other type of glaucoma, the angle closure glaucoma the presentation is dramatic. Sudden onset redness and severe pain in the eye with headache and vomiting could occur. Visual blurring may also occur with extreme difficulty in looking at light. This is an ophthalmological emergency where the eye will become blind permanently in a short time if not treated.
Who can get glaucoma?
Anybody can get glaucoma. Anybody from a newborn to a senior citizen can get glaucoma. Babies can be born with glaucoma but the risk increases with old age. People with refractive errors (who need glasses to correct vision) and those with a family history (relations with glaucoma) are more at risk.
Angle closure type occurs more in elderly females and usually the sudden onset attacks occur during evenings.
Treatment
As there is no cure for glaucoma early detection and treatment is the only way out to avoid blindness from glaucoma.
After diagnosing the condition glaucoma can be treated with the objective of minimizing further damage. With the advancement of medicine and medical technology the recent advances in treatment has shown promising results in treatment and monitoring of glaucoma.
With a mere drop of medication in to the eye once a day, the eye pressure is controlled in many patients. Reducing the production of fluid inside the eye, increasing the drainage of the fluid in the eye and protecting the nerve from pressure damage are some mechanisms of actions of the medicines used. However the patient may not feel any change to know whether the drug is working. Therefore this needs to be checked periodically with checking of eye pressure, monitoring of visual fields and optic nerve imaging.
If the progression of damage is continuing, the option of surgical intervention to create an additional pathway to drain the fluid in the eye may be considered. Another option is laser treatment to the eye.
World Glaucoma week -March 12- 18
* Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease affecting the optic nerve usually associated with increased pressure in the eye and deterioration of visual fields.
* As there are no definite symptoms checking the eyes, is the only way to detect glaucoma.
* Proper treatment and monitoring can control the disease to prevent the occurrence of blindness due to glaucoma.
