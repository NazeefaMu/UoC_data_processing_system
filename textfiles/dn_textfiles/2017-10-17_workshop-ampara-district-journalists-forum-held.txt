Workshop for Ampara District Journalists Forum held

A workshop was hosted for the members of Ampara District Journalists Forum to spread awareness on the Interim Report of Steering Committee on New Constitution Reforms, on Sunday (15). It was held at the Eliant food court conference hall in Nintavur under the patronage of the President of Ampara District Journalists Forum M. A. Phakurdeen.
Y. L. S. Hameed, political reviewer and analyst was the guest speaker at the workshop.
The minority communities, especially Muslims, play a vital role in the new constitutional reforms for their rights. If the North and East are merged, the people in the East will suffer a lot, Hameed said. “The recent Amendment made on the Act of Provincial Council Elections will mostly affect the Muslims in the East and other provinces. The delimitation for electorates has to ensure the minority representatives in the councils,” he added.
