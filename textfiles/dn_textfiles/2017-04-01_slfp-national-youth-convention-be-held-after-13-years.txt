SLFP National Youth Convention to be held after 13 years

The National Youth Convention of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) will be held on April 2 after a lapse of 13 years at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said.
He said over 12,500 youth from all corners of the country will participate at the National Youth Convention which will be held under theme: “Strength for the solution”.
“We will show the entire country that it is the SLFP which has the strongest youth movement,” Bandara said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that one of the biggest and burning problems faced by the youth will be highlighted at the convention.
A number of other problems affecting the youth will also be addressed at the event.
“We conducted an island-wide research and identified the main problems faced by the youth in Sri Lanka over last two years and we hope to find solutions to many of these issues at the concention.
The SLFP Youth Front has been at the forefront in providing guidance to the youth and resolving their problems,” Bandara said. “We do not need youth insurgences. Many young lives were destroyed in the 77, 88 and 89 insurgencies and also in the Northern war. Who is responsible for those deaths? Has the country benefited from them and the destruction caused?," he queried.
“All this time politicians used the youth to meet their own needs,but,we will use this occasion to solve their problems. We have held village and provincial level youth meetings and leadership training camps before holding this national level event,”the SLFP Youth Front Chairman said.
