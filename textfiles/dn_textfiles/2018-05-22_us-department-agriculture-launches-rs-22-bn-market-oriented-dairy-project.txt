U.S. Department of Agriculture launches Rs. 2.2 bn Market-Oriented Dairy Project

The Rs. 2.2 billion program ($14.1 million) Market-Oriented Dairy project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was launched by the U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka and Maldives Ambassador Atul Keshap last week.
The Market-Oriented Dairy project will benefit more than 15,000 Sri Lankan farmers and will focus on the commercial sustainability of the dairy sector and the quality and safety of dairy products.
“Activities funded through this Food for Progress Program will help small scale farmers strengthen livestock management capacity and adherence to quality and hygiene best practices, while expanding access to veterinary services,” said Ambassador Keshap.
The project will enhance the capabilities of Sri Lanka’s dairy farmers and partners and is intended to lead to an average annual growth of 18% in milk production by 2022. During the course of the four-year project, milk production is expected to grow by 94% overall. Strengthening the dairy sector will also contribute significantly towards the national initiative of reaching self-sufficiency in dairy production.
Approximately 80% of the beneficiary farmers will receive a quality-based price premium for their milk. Additionally, participants will receive training to help them create sustainable and profitable businesses. The project will also facilitate financing and investment opportunities and provide support to the newly created All Island Dairy Association under the aegis of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
Since 1956, the United States has been privileged to be a partner in helping develop Sri Lanka and over the past 60 years.
The launch is a 14 million dollar commitment (Rs.2.2 bn) builds on the significant investment that the United States has already made and that complements the efforts by Sri Lanka’s government and the private sector to help increase dairy production and modernize processing.
The United States Department of Agriculture will fund project work in the Northern, Northwestern, North Central, Eastern, Central, and Uva Provinces to directly benefit more than 15,000 small-scale and medium-scale Sri Lankan farmers.
“This project is a sign of the strong bilateral partnership and deepening American engagement in Sri Lanka.”
