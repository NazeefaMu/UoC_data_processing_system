Navin orders quick credit to flood-affected tea small holders

Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake has taken a decision to offer instant low interest credit of Rs. 150, 000 and also free tea plants to tea small holders whose estates were destroyed by the recent floods.
The Minister has also instructed the Secretary of the Ministry J.A. Ranjith to explore the possibility of offering a ‘substantial allowance’ for fully affected tea estate owners for a longer period.
The meeting in this regard was held last week at the Ministry with Chairman, Tea Small Holders Authority, Wijeratne Devagedara and Chairman, All Ceylon Tea Small Holders Association, Neville Ratnayake, in attendance.
It was pointed out that several tea smaller holders in four districts were affected due to the recent floods.
Tea Small Holdings Development Authority (TSHDA), an industry association consisting of small-scale tea cultivators, predicted a considerable fall in tea production in the upcoming months as some of the main tea cultivating districts were severely hit by the recent floods.
The deluge is estimated to have destroyed around 10,000 acres of small holder tea plantations, particularly in the Ratnapura, Kalutara, Matara and Gale Districts.
