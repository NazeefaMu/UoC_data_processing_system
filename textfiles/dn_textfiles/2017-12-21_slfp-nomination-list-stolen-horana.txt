SLFP nomination list stolen in Horana

Horana police are conducting a comprehensive investigation to arrest an ex-UPLF Councillor of the Horana Pradeshiya Sabha and two others, who allegedly robbed the nomination list of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and other documents on 17th December.
Earney Kithulgoda, the former private secretary of former Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake, complained to the police on 17th December that Priyantha Jayalath, the ex-UPLF Councillor of the Horana Pradeshiya Sabha, came with two others in a motor car. Kithulgoda alleges that the men rushed to his office and questioned him as to why the name of Preyantha Jayalath had not been entered into the nomination list.
Kithulgoda alleges that Jayalath dashed two chairs and assaulted him, before robbing the nomination list and other documents with his mobile telephone.
Subsequently, Kithulgoda complained to the Horana Police.
Horana Assistant Superintendent of Police W. J. Nandena, along with crime branch officials, is conducting an investigation.
