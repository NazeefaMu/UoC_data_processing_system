Suspects remanded until July 31

Five charged for throwing petrol bombs:
The lawyer appearing for five persons including a bhikkhu and ex-police constable for allegedly throwing petrol bombs at two locations to cause communal disturbance, stated before Court that no such thing occurred in the first place.
The suspects were produced before Panadura Chief Magistrate Chaminda Liyanage by prison officials with regard to the incident alleged to have occurred in May 2017.
The lawyer appearing on behalf of the accused appealed to the Panadura Chief Magistrate to conduct a comprehensive investigation against the police officers who 'misled Court by submitting baseless investigation reports'.
“No such incidents took place in Panadura which is a peaceful town. There is no evidence found by the police in this regard,” the lawyers told Court.
They added that the police had violated the Fundamental Rights of the five accused by keeping them in remand custody without evidence and appealed to Court to grant them bail.
The Colombo Crime Division OIC submitting a further report informed Court that the three petrol bottles were produced before the Government Analyst and that the investigations report had been submitted to the Attorney General to obtain instructions.
He assured to produce both reports from the Attorney General and the Government Analyst before Court.
The Chief Magistrate remanded the five suspects until July 31.
