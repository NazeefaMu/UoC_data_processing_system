Never to be forgotten

PRINCE WILLIAM and Prince Harry each selected a very personal item to remember their mother, Princess Diana, following her tragic death in 1997, it has been revealed.
After Princess Diana was killed in a shocking 1997 car crash both of her sons chose a keepsake from amongst her personal belongings to remember her by.
They were taken to Kensington Palace to make the selection according to a source close to the Royals.
Prince William chose a gorgeous Cartier watch whilst Harry selected her stunning diamond and sapphire engagement ring.
A source told the Daily Star: “William picked his mum’s Cartier watch, and Harry picked her sapphire and diamond engagement ring.”
In an extraordinary sign of brotherly love, Harry later gave the ring to William, who used it to propose to the Duchess of Cambridge, during a romantic Kenyan holiday in 2010.
William said using the ring was his way of ensuring his beloved mother had a presence at his wedding.
In addition to personal possessions, Princess Diana left a small fortune, which was given to her boys as they grew up.
She left £13million which came from her divorce settlement from Prince Charles as well as shares, cash and personal items. However this figure fell to £8million after death duties.
The money was shared equally between William and Harry.
The two princes each got some of the money when they reached 25, but had to wait until the age of 30 for the full amount.
Management by royal advisors meant the inheritance had increased to £20million by the time it was given to William and Harry.
A Royal insider told The Mirror: “There is no way Harry would dodge tax. “There are few similarities between the average person and Harry and William but when it comes to tax, they also have to pay their way. "William got hit with a hefty bill when he turned 30.
“His aides have to work out the most tax-efficient way for him to handle the money."
When Harry turned 30 the boys also inherited many of Diana’s personal items, including her stunning David and Elizabeth Emanuel wedding dress.
