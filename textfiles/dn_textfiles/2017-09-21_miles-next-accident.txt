Miles before the next accident

Some tips for the new generation of female drivers:
Let any of us stand near the main junction in a major city of our country today, and observe the vehicles - especially cars, jeeps and wagons - moving around. We may observe that at least two out five vehicles passing by are being driven by females of different ages. So do the experts say.
Corresponding to the increase in the volume of vehicles on the road, the number of female drivers has also increased. Even though in the insurance industry, women drivers are supposed to be “safer”, and less likely to be involved in a road accident. With apologies to them, it has to be stated, however, that the general impression among the male drivers and the road-users by walk is that they themselves are not safe enough with most female drivers at their wheels. One of the main reasons attributed is that most female drivers do not follow even the basic road rules.
Another is that they tend to assume, rather than making judgments and decisions while driving. No doubt, all motorists need to be alert and cautious on the roads, but often female drivers need to be more attentive due to such dilemmas.
Need to be vigilant
A study by the California Department of Motor Vehicles revealed sometime back, that the safest American driver is the married woman over 25 years. Some of the primary reasons given were that her driving is short-haul, low-speed, even if she meets with an accident, it is of a side-scrape or fender-bender kind not serious enough even to report. The report also stated that women tend to think of the automobile they use as just another household appliance. “It is a deadly device” the report states, “if not properly handled, can kill anyone on the road and disable many more. While all drivers need to be vigilant, they cannot relax on the wheel, but drive all the time in anticipation of an impending risk, and this is a golden rule especially for female drivers.”
Good drivers are both common and uncommon. It is possible one might encounter rash teenagers to truck drivers to overly-cautious senior citizens: yet all contribute to how we can learn to be better drivers.
More often, it is not that a driver is not aware of the road rules or best practices in driving, but the unfortunate thing is that he or she ignores or deliberately violates them.
They forget that something as quick and simple as putting on the seat belt or getting the windshield cleaned can mean the difference between life and death. Being aware of the specialties of a female driver among other drivers, and practicing good road etiquette is equally important. Below are some tips to keep a female driver mindful and safe. Although they are in good stead for any driver, they are sure to help the new generation of female drivers around.
“Hands-free” kit
Put your cell-phone into your handbag so that it is out of sight and you are not getting distracted by messages. If you have to use your mobile to make or accept a call, rather install a “hands-free” kit. Never text and drive, as this could slow down your brake-reaction speed by 18% meaning that by the time you have realised you need to break – it is likely too late. Also, try to keep the volume of your radio sound system at a reasonable level, so that you are aware of your surroundings.
l Don’t drive as if you own the road. Drive like you own the car. Don’t make assumptions about what other drivers are going to do. The only thing you can assume about another driver, with a turn signal on, is that they are going to turn. They might not be turning at all, and just forgot to turn it off. But you have to be careful and make your judgment for your own safety.
l Watch out for aggressive drivers, and try to stay out of their way. They are the cause of a lot of accidents. Never pull out in front of anyone or swerve into someone else’s lane. If you wish to change lane, always indicate it with signals of the car, much ahead of you change lane.
l When approaching any colour light signal, be it red, green or amber, do not rush but anticipate that the colour might change any moment, even though the counters linked to the signal lights give you the time indication. Now on most main roads, almost all colour lights are linked to the yellow/white strip pedestrian crossing; so be sharp there. When the light turns green, make sure intersection clears before you go.
• Obey the speed limits. Going too fast gives you less time to stop or react. Excess speed is one of the main causes of accidents. Even if the road is clear of traffic and you are permitted to drive at high speed, drive only at the speed you can control your vehicle. If not, you and your car will be the first victims.
l When stopped in traffic, leave enough space to pull out from behind the car you are following. Habitually, the driver in the vehicle behind you will come so close, even to a kissing distance, to your car, because he/she does not care to leave enough space between the two vehicles, which means they are inviting trouble.
l Make sure your car always has gas in it – don’t ride around with the gauge on empty. Do you know why certain cars have the petrol/diesel meter on the left side of the steering wheel and certain others have it on the right side? A car with a meter on the left has the petrol intake on the left side of the car, while the one with meter on the right has the intake on the right side of the car.
l Experts now recommend that you hold the steering wheel at either 3 and 9 o’clock on the wheel, or even lower at 4 and 8 o’clock. If you are in an accident and the airbags go off, you’ll be safer with your hands not flying into your face from the impact of the airbags.
l If you are taking a child to school or collecting a child from school, try to get to school five to ten minutes early, and leave five minutes late to avoid the mad dash into and out of the parking lot. Always watch for kids getting on and off school vans and buses. Give priority to those vehicles. Children are in a hurry to get to their classes or to go home, when the school is over, for which they are either getting on or off their transport or maybe even crossing the road. Their safety depends on how much you follow this best practice.
