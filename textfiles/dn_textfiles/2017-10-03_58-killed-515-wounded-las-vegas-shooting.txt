58 killed, 515 wounded in Las Vegas shooting

Fifty-eight people are now known to have been killed in a mass shooting at an open air concert in Las Vegas while another 515 were wounded, police said Monday.
“The number of people who have died associated with this event has increased. Right now we’re using the number of 58,” Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters.
“The number of injured -- we are using the number of 515. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel toward an open-air music festival.
Police said a suspect identified as a local resident was shot and killed by officers. They said they were looking for a companion travelling with the suspect as a “person of interest”. See pages 12 and 17
Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police believed the shooting was a “lone wolf” style attack, but confirmed they were trying to locate an Asian female named as Marilou Danely.
Sheriff Lombardo said he was unable to accurately say the number of dead and injured, but confirmed two off-duty officers were among those killed.
A local hospital spokesperson said earlier that at least 14 of the injured were in a critical condition.
There had been reports of other incidents at different locations along the Las Vegas strip, but police said those reports were false. Witnesses reported that hundreds of shots were fired. Hundreds of people fled the scene and the sound of what appeared to be prolonged automatic gunfire could be heard on videos posted on social media. Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene remain on police lockdown as they search for two vehicles in relation to the attack. Witnesses reported that hundreds of shots were fired. A witness told the BBC that he saw people running in total panic.
“One man had blood all over him and that’s when I knew something was seriously wrong. “People were running and there was chaos.” Some flights were diverted after news of the incident emerged. - BBC NEWS
