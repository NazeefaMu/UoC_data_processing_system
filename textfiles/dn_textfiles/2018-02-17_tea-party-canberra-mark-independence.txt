Tea party in Canberra to mark Independence

The Sri Lankan High Commission in Australia hosted a tea party to diplomatic envoys in Canberra and Australian government officials to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of Sri Lanka’s Independence, recently.
The envoys were served a refreshing glass of iced tea on arrival. They were then invited to view the photo exhibition depicting significant moments of Sri Lanka-Australia relations spanning over 70 years. Following the formal proceedings, High Commissioner S. Skandakumar and the Chief of Protocol Lyndall Sachs cut the special cake to mark the occasion.
The High Commissioner, in his remarks, spoke of economic reforms, reconciliation and the ongoing development work in Sri Lanka, as well as high level visits.
The envoys were also invited to explore the aroma and taste of Ceylon Tea from the seven tea growing regions in Sri Lanka that were on display.
