Court recalls warrant against former JMO

The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday ordered to recall a warrant issued against Prof. Ananda Samarasekara, the former Chief Colombo Judicial Medical Officer for his alleged failure to produce a post mortem report into an unidentified body recovered in the Kelani river in 2011.
Counsel who appeared on behalf of Prof. Samarasekara filed a motion informing Court that his client had given the relevant report to a junior officer prior to his retirement from the JMO post. Having heard the submissions made by counsel, Additional Magistrate Buddhika Sri Ragala decided to recall the warrant issued against Prof. Samarasekara and ordered him to present relevant facts on next hearing date. He was further ordered to appear in court on next hearing date as well.
