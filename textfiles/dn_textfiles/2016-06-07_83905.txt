Ammo dump sited in densely populated area: JVP

 
The setting up of an ammunition dump in a densely populated area is highly questionable and a wrong move, JVP parliamentarian Vijitha
Herath said. Addressing the media at the JVP party office, Battaramulla yesterday, Herath said the Army Camp was established in Kosgama in 1994 despite protests against the decision taken by the then government.
“This area was not suitable for an Army camp since it is a congested civilian area.
We also submitted petitions against this decision to a minister of the then government Indika Gunawardane. Without considering the protests, the then government had taken measures to establish an armoury.
It was also reported that all weapons stored at the Panagoda Army Camp were also shifted to the Kosgama armoury,” the MP said. Herath said the Naigala Physically Handicapped War Heroes Village and Salawa Hospital are also situated in this highly populated area. The Kosgama Salawa Army Camp is situated close to the Colombo - Avissawella High Level Road, he said. The MP added that the government should take a decision over the continuation of this armoury in this area after considering the gravity of the damage and the risk of maintaining such an armoury.
He emphasised the need to conduct an immediate investigation into this incident and provide compensation to the affected families.
