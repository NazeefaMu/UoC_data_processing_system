Fiji sack Aussie Farina after Rio flop

Suva, Tuesday: Fiji have sacked former Socceroos boss Frank Farina as their football coach following the island nation's poor showing at the Rio Olympics, reports said on Tuesday.
Fiji conceded 23 goals in three games at the tournament in Brazil, including a 10-0 thrashing by eventual silver-medallists Germany, and managed to score only once.
The Fiji Broadcasting Corporation said Australia's Farina had not turned up for work since the Olympics and had not submitted a post-Games report. The Fiji Sun said his two-year contract, signed in October last year, had been terminated. No one from the Fiji Football Association was immediately available to comment. FP
