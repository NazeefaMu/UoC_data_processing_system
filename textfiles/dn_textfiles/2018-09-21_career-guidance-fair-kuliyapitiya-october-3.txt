Career guidance fair in Kuliyapitiya on October. 3

The Education Ministry will conduct a career guidance programme with the aim of creating awareness of the value of tertiary education, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
A five-day career guidance fair and exhibition will be held at Kuliyapitiya Central College from October 3 to October 7, from 9 am to 10 pm each day.
The Minister said that this is the first-ever career guidance programme conducted by the Education Ministry, as the need for increasing human capital of the country has been identified.
A large number of students are in a dilemma about what to do, especially after their Advanced Levels or after dropping out of school. Even school dropouts don’t have a clear idea about what to do once they finish their general education, the Minister said.
“Lack of knowledge and the scarcity of proper career guidance programmes are the main causes for this situation,” he said.
The Education Ministry will hold the proposed career guidance programme countrywide in due course.
The next exhibitions will be held in Kandy, Galle and Matara. Both government and private sector institutions will take part. Students who obtained patents for their innovations will also be given opportunity to display their creations at the fairs.
A career guidance booklet is being prepared for the exhibitions, the Minister said.
The fairs will include book exhibitions, entrepreneurial guidance workshops, job fairs, and entertainment programmes.
