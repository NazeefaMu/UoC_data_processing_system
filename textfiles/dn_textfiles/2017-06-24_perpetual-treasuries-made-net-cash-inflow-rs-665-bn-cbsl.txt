Perpetual Treasuries made net cash inflow of Rs. 6.65 bn - CBSL

Perpetual Treasuries Limited has made net cash inflow of Rs. 6.65 billion by selling the questioned Treasury bonds to the statutory bodies including the Employee’s Provident Fund and Sri Lanka Insurance Cooperation, it was revealed yesterday.
It came to light when Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake led evidence yesterday through the Central Bank's IT Department Head, Wasantha Alwis.
Several documents derived from the Lanka Settle System, including bond transaction information of the PTL, were produced through Alwis.
Legal Counsel for the Perpetual Treasuries Limited, Nihal Fernando PC said the information contained in these documents is wrongly presented.
He further said that he will produce the same information through his client, including a correct representation of all the questioned transactions. The Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue will be sitting again next Tuesday (27)
