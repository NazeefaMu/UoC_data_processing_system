Gammanpila requests President to hold economic summit

Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila yesterday called for President Maithripala Sirisena to hold an economic summit with the objective of seeking permanent solutions to the country’s economic woes.
He added that this forum should comprise intellectuals and businessmen and other stakeholders representing all parties in the country. Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, Gammanpila said his party is prepared to extend its support to such an all party economic forum to address the economic issues of the country.
“We hope to create a dialogue within the Joint Opposition for such a forum,”he said. He said that a President is unable to reshuffle the Cabinet on his own discretion under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.
Gammanpila added that there should be an agreement between the President and the Prime Minister for a Cabinet reshuffle under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
“Changing Ministers will not provide solutions to the issues faced by the country,” he said.
