Nurses warn of trade union action if demands not met

The Government Nursing Officers Union (GNOU) yesterday warned the government of trade union action if their demands are not met by August 20.
According to chairman of the Union Ven Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, his union is committed to safeguard the professional rights and privileges of the nursing community. “We will launch a trade union action if the government fails to grant the nursing staff the revised allowances by August 20,” the Thera said.
Addressing a press conference at the Heda Medura in Narahenpita yesterday, Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera said the Health Ministry should implement the circular issued by the Treasury Secretary in December 2014 in respect of the allowances of nursing staff.
“The Health Minister is attempting to implement a circular in respect of the allowances of nursing staff after having secret discussions with Saman Rathnapriya. We do not want that to be implemented,” he said. The Thera said his organisation held a number of discussions with the Ministry Secretary and higher officials of the Ministry to get the Treasury Secretary’s circular implemented.
“The Good Governance Government has failed in granting the benefits ensured by the circular,” he said
