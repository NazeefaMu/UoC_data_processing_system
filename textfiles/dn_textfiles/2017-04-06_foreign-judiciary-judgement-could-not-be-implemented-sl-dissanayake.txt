Foreign judiciary judgement could not be implemented in SL: Dissanayake

No judgement given by a foreign judiciary can be implemented in Sri Lanka. So far, three such judgements had been given by Foreign judiciaries, but none of them were implemented here in Sri Lanka, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake said. Addressing a press conference held at his Ministry Office at Sethsiripaya, Battaramulla yesterday he said, one such judgement was given to him while he was imprisoned for two years. "When I was put under a two year rigorous imprisonment, I complained to the International Court. Thirteen foreign judges freed me from the case and asked the Sri Lankan Government to pay me compensation. They asked for a change in the laws in Sri Lanka which imprisoned me. But nothing happened," he said.
According to Minister Dissanayake,
President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe have already decided not to entertain foreign judges. There may be different opinions and ideas among political parties and ministers in the Government, but the final decision had been made in connection with the issue.
Minister Dissanayake said, "The current Constitution of Sri Lanka does not permit foreign judges or a foreign judiciary, and the current Constitution would not be changed to allow them. Since Sri Lankan judges work in foreign countries, the local judiciary is strong to tackle the issue, according to the President. There is nothing mentioned about a referendum in President Sirisena's printed Election Manifesto. So we will not have one."
