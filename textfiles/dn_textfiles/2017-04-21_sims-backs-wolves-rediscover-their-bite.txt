Sims backs Wolves to rediscover their bite

LONDON: Warrington may have suffered a woeful start to the Super League season but Ashton Sims sees no reason why they can’t make up for lost time.
Former Fiji international Sims felt he was playing some of his best rugby during Warrington’s early-season woes, which saw the 2016 Super League Grand Finalists lose their first six league games.
Remarkably, the Wolves’ only win before April was against Brisbane Broncos in the World Club Series, but they have since turned things around - with three successive victories catapulting them to within two points of the top eight ahead of Saturday’s clash with Wakefield.
Forward Sims believes their struggles were blown out of proportion before they finally got off the mark with a 22-22 draw against Hull FC, and is confident normal service will be resumed as they continue to repair the damage caused by their slow start.
“My form felt quite good earlier this season but it was hard to say you are playing well when you are losing games,” said Sims.
“But I’ve been really enjoying my time here so it’s good to be back to winning ways and we can push on now.
“We had a good second half against Hull which was important for us to build on.
“It had been a frustrating season for us because in those first few weeks the only game we won wasn’t in the Super League, it was against the Broncos.
“We showed some good signs of how we should be playing but it was just unfortunate that it wasn’t in Super League.”
This weekend’s Super League action kicks off on Friday as struggling Widnes host St Helens, while there are two matches on Sunday as Hull FC host Castleford and Wigan face Catalans Dragons.
Hull returned to form at just the right time with a 24-10 win against Leigh last week - with Tonga centre Mahe Fonua back to his destructive best after a pair of high-profile errors this month.
The 24-year-old has been targeted after spilling the ball out of the backfield, but head coach Lee Radford warned Castleford he is back to his best.
“Mahe’s issues over the last month have been well-documented,” said Radford. “Rightly, opposing sides are now making an extra little play at the ball every time he carries it.
“So for him to respond from that initial error against Leigh was big.” This weekend also sees Super League sides enter the Challenge Cup for the first time this season, with Salford, Leeds, Leigh and Huddersfield all in action.
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone is desperate to see their eight-match winless streak disappear against Swinton Lions - and he believes a bit of luck would make all the difference. - AFP
