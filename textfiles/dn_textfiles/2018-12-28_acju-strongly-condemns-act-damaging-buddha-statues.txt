ACJU strongly condemns the act of damaging Buddha statues

 
The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama (ACJU) strongly condemns the act of religious blasphemy that occurred recently in the Mawanella Area.
The ACJU considers this act of damaging of the Buddha statue, which is worshipped by the majority Buddhists living in this country, as a deed of damaging the mutual understanding and reconciliation among the communities. The ACJU hereby reiterates that humiliating other religions by damaging the religious icons of worship is against the teachings of Islam.
These types of misdeeds may result in creating unnecessary commotions in the country, where the Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Muslims are living together in unity and reconciliation.
Therefore, the ACJU requests the authorities to take legal action against the offenders whoever they are and implement justice, and the ACJU also requests His Excellency the President, Hon. Prime Minister and Inspector General of Police to take the necessary measures to maintain law and order at this situation, not allowing any evil opportunists taking law into their hands.
