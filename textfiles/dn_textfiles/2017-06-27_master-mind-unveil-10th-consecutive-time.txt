Master Mind to unveil for the 10th consecutive time

Master Mind, the annual interschool Quiz Competition organised by the General Knowledge Club of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, will be held for the 10th consecutive time on July 3 at the school Aeolian Hall from 2 pm.
A group of dedicated seniors and past pupils, the General Knowledge Club of Lyceum has made strides in the local quizzing arena in recent years under the guidance of Dimuthu Amarasiri. These strides have made Master Mind a look-forward-to tournament in the Quizzing Calendar in Sri Lanka.
