Twenty nine Indians violating visa netted in Jaffna

Twenty nine Indian nationals were arrested in Jaffna for violating visas yesterday. They were arrested in an immigration raid carried out by officers of Immigration and Emigration Department’s Monitoring Intelligence and Investigation Unit.
The unit's chief investigator Amith Perera said the raid was carried out from Saturday on Immigration and Emigration Controller General Nihal Ranasinghe's instructions.
“The operation coordinated by W. M. M. B Weerasekera arrested twenty nine persons. Of them four had come to the country as online business promotion officers, but were running textile shops in the Jaffna town,” he said.
“Five women are among the arrested,” he said,” There are twenty in custody who had arrived on visa and overstayed engaging in a variety of soothsayer-fortune teller jobs. Some of them were selling bangles, bracelets, necklaces and toys.
