Oyster shell transporting lorries seized

Two drivers transporting 600 bags of oyster shells worth millions of rupees in two lorries in the guise of transporting rice by displaying essential service tags on the windscreens to hoodwink law enforcement authorities, were nabbed by Mihintale Police at Sippikulam on the Trincomalee-Puttalam road on Tuesday. Police said when they halted the vehicles and questioned the drivers, they had said they were transporting a consignment of rice. But on inspection of the stock, they found crushed oyster shells to be used as poultry feed. The oyster shells had been collected from the Trincomalee beach.
The two drivers arrested were due to be produced in court along with the two lorry loads. Further investigations are continuing.
