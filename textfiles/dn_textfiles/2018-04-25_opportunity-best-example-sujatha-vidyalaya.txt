Opportunity, the best example Sujatha Vidyalaya

Head Girl of Sujatha Vidyalaya Matara Sewminie Wijesinghe has worked hard at developing her interpersonal skills. She is a woman of the 21st century and she has correctly understood that the ability to work alongside others is the key to success in any organization. Perfect Prefects features Wijesinghe a model citizen.
Wijesinghe has many targets in her life and certainly has the ability to achieve all of them due to her self- confidence and ability to focus on what is important.
“I have many targets in life but I have one special target which is to be a lecturer in a University. I am doing my A/Ls in the Math stream doing Math, Physics and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). I would like to give to others what I have received in life mainly when it comes to education. I have received a very holistic education from my school, and I would like to help in making educational opportunities available to other children,” said Wijesinghe.
Living harmoniously
One message she wants to give out is the need to work with others putting differences aside. She has not developed her interpersonal skills out of vanity. She has developed her interpersonal skills because she feels that there is a real need to be able to live harmoniously with others and work for the common good.
“I would like to tell young people that they need to work with each other in unity. You need to understand how to work with each other. You have to comprehend the importance of working with each other. If we in Sri Lanka can work together the world will look on us favourably. We can take Sri Lanka to the world if we can work together. This will make us an example to other countries. Just think of what we can do if we can work together in harmony? We can achieve our goals. We can develop this country. We can improve the quality of our life. We can achieve true peace. We can develop each and every facet of our lives. We can only develop our country if we are properly united. We need to work together at all levels in this country. Most importantly we need to cooperate in our workplaces,” explained Wijesinghe.
Sujatha Vidyalaya Matara has provided her with the environment to develop qualities such as self- confidence and patience. Her training at this institute has given her the right motivation and encouragement so that when she steps out into the world outside, she will be able to hold her own and stand her ground. She will be able to say to herself that she gave it her 100 percent. In that sense, her growth at her Alma Mater has been carefully supervised and they have produced the ideal Head Girl who will always have a cool head.
“When facing a difficult situation or problem in life what we need is Self-Confidence and Patience. Those qualities are important for a leader. We can face any challenge if we have self- confidence and through this, we can deal with whatever comes our way. If you take my school I have received so many opportunities and a platform for self- advancement. I have been in school from Grade 1. I am who I am because of my school. I have so many friends here and my teachers and principal have been a real inspiration. With all my extra-curricular activities they have helped me a lot,” said Wijesinghe.
Indifferent high-ups
Wijesinghe said that poverty and hunger are also due to people not thinking of each other. People are poor because those in higher places are indifferent. But if we really want to eradicate poverty, we can do it. If we really want to.
Wijesinghe has taken part in activities at school and has developed an all-round personality. Because of this she actually can give back to society. One activity she has benefited from is guiding.
“We can learn so much from guiding. We learn to be independent because we are away from our parents and we are not in our comfort zone. We have to work with girls who we may not know very well. We have to take part in so many activities so we are forced to interact with each other. This is hugely beneficial. It builds character. It helps you develop interpersonal skills,” pointed out Wijesinghe.
Wijesinghe in addition to having interpersonal skills is indignant when it comes to the suffering of other living beings.
Understanding living beings
Very often these days on social media we come across many stories of barbarism towards humans and animals. Some people are unable to understand that the living being they are torturing is experiencing pain.

“If you take society there seems to be a lack of compassion. I cannot agree with or condone what is happening in society. People only think about themselves. If we care about others that would make a big difference in life,” said Wijesinghe.
Wijesinghe does not admire one particular leader. She believes in learning a lesson from all of them. Gandhi and Mother Teresa did so much good in their own different ways.
“It is this combination of qualities that I take as an example. In this world, we all face so many difficulties. What matters here is the thinking power. You need a positive mindset and a positive attitude. You can overcome your struggles if you have courage,” stated Wijesinghe.
Wijesinghe stated the information technology field is the future of any country. Information technology is something you cannot do without.
Technology-savvy
“I am interested in this field and I try to learn something new in this field every day. The entire world depends on information technology. Society is moving with it as we speak. People now rely completely on information technology,” said Wijesinghe.
