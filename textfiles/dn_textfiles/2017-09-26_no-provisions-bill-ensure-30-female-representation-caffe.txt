No provisions in bill to ensure 30% female representation: CaFFE

Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) issuing a press release states that the government has deceived women’s rights organisations, civil society organisations and all interested parties by indicating that the recently passed Amendments to the Provincial Council Election laws ensure higher female representation at Provincial Councils.
The stated objective of the amendment is to ensure that 30 percent of the list of candidates of a political party consist of women. However, there are no provisions in the bill to make any list of candidates invalid, of it does not consist of 30 percent of women. Thus, the selection officer has no power to reject such a list. It is unfortunate that women’s rights organisations and civil society organisations, who are silent on the undemocratic nature in which this bill was passed last week, have not hitherto realised that the bill does not ensure higher female representation in Provincial Councils.
The other slogan used by those who supported the bill is that this bill will ensure that the elections for all nine provinces will be held on one day. Once again there are no provisions on this bill to ensure that. Not only that, a close reading of the bill shows that the elections will have to be held on a staggered basis (at least in two separate occasions).
The bill has also ensured that the parliament will have to debate and come up with provisions to resolve over a dozen technical issues and confusions that have arisen. The government will surely bring in new proposals to ‘rectify’ issues that arise from issues such as appointing a new delimitation commission outside the existing one. Given what transpired regarding the amendments to the laws governing Local Government elections, it is difficult to estimate how long it will take for parliament to resolve these issues. This can easily lead to a delay in holding elections,
