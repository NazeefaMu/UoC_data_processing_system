Construction sector gets S$4 mn to boost digitalization

The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) on Wednesday (Nov 14) launched the Integrated Digital Delivery (IDD) implementation plan to encourage companies in the built environment sectors to go digital.
The IDD implementation plan is one of the thrusts of the Construction Industry Transformation Map announced in October last year.
To help more companies adopt the plan, BCA and the Infocomm Media Development Authority launched a S$4 million joint call to develop digital platforms for the building sector.
“This will enable firms across the construction project-cycle to communicate and exchange information with various partners and innovate by pioneering new ways to work,” BCA said.
This announcement came after Second Minister for National Development Desmond Lee visited the construction site of the upcoming JTC Logistics Hub at Gul Circle to find out how JTC and its contractor Kimly Construction has benefited from the implementation of IDD.When completed in mid-2020, the hub will be Singapore’s first high-rise multi-tenant facility that incorporates storage of containers, warehouses and a heavy vehicle park.
IDD refers to the use of digital technologies to integrate information and work processes among all stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of a building – from the design of the building to its construction, and facilities management once it is completed.
