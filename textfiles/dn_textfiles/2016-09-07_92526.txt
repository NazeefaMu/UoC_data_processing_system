Unitary status dropped from Constitution: MR

Kurunegala District Parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday alleged that the unitary clause found in the Constitution had been dropped from the first resolution at the SLFP’s 65th Convention held in Kurunegala on September 4. Furthermore the clause non-alignment also seemed to have been dropped at first glance from resolution adopted, he said.
The former President who returned to Colombo after his trip to Malaysia on September 5 around noon was speaking to the media from a friend’s residence in Anuradhapura after paying homage at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi and the Ruwanweliseya.
The former President said the Joint Opposition SLFP group had decided toboycott the Party’s 65th Convention and he kept away as he had to abide by that decision. Their action was also in keeping with the decision taken by the Party’s electoral Bala Mandalaya to boycott the Convention.
Asked about the assault on the Sri Lanka Ambassador in Malaysia, Rajapaksa said it was a most saddening event.
It was done by a group of about 20 youth wearing T-shirts bearing the picture of Prabhakaran and the LTTE label, he said.
These people satged protests at every temple he visited. “They even manhandled a bhikkhu.” He could not visit only one sheduled temple because he did not want to cause inconvenience to the Bhikkhu who who had been roughed up. However, from the day they defeated LTTE terrorism they expected such threats against them.
Referring to the claims of massive crowds attending the SLFP Convention at Kurunegala, he said he knew how a government had the means to gather crowds Rajapaksa who said he is a die hard SLFPer than many others who staked the claim added that the name of his father late D. A. Rajapaksa who crossed over to the opposition from UNP government following Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike to form the SLFP had been conveniently dropped and forgotten by most people holding the Party reins. Asked about the rumours about the formation of a new party, Rajapaksa said they should have a place to go when they are offered a step motherly treatment.
Parliamentarian S. M. Chandrasena and Shehan Semasinghe, Provincial Minister H. B. Semasinghe and former Anuradhapura Mayor H. P. Somadasa were also associated with the former President.
