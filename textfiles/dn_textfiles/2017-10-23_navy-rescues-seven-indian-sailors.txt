Navy rescues seven Indian sailors

The Navy rescued seven Indian sailors from an Indian merchant vessel sinking in Sri Lankan seas about 68 nautical miles south of the Galle Light House and brought them to the Galle Harbour on Saturday morning.
The Maldives bound medium-scale merchant vessel “Maria Murudaya” was sinking in sea south of Sri Lanka a few days back and the Maldivian Government informed the incident to the Sri Lanka Navy.
The Sri Lanka Navy Head Quarters alerted all international merchant vessels sailing in that region including navy ships and craft patrolling in Southern seas to assist in rescue operation.
On Friday (20) evening, the Navy received information about a drifting life-craft with sailors on board from a multi-day fishing trawler, “Sahana Putha” and dispatched their Fast Attack Craft P 490 to the location. The Indian crew was rescued and brought safely to the Galle Harbour. They were in good health and handed over to the Indian High Commission through the Hambantota Indian Consulate for repatriation.
