A - As a small boy I started playing with the tennis ball at the age of 11 years. I attended under 12 cricket practices at school and I was selected. My first coach was Sarath Fernando. Then I played for the under 14, 17 and for the first eleven teams. My first captain was Chandana Mahesh in the under 12 and 14 teams and Saman Grero led the under 19 team. My first eleven captain was Chandranath de Alwin in 1983/84. I played under Chandana Mahesh in 1984/85 and Saman Grero captained in the third term of 1985. I continued from 1986 January and in 1986 and ’87 I captained the team. I got the opportunity to captain in two big matches. Altogether I played in four Big Matches. During this period there was no one-day games at our school.

Q - How did you fare in club cricket?
A - I was employed at Airport and Aviation Services at Katunayake and most of the time was involved in shift work and it was difficult to get leave. Any how I played in the under 25 cricket tournament for Saracens Sports Club and Kalutara Town Club and for the Aviation “B” team led by Old Zahirian M. Mohamed. I performed well.
Q - After that what happened?
A - In the meantime I got an appointment in Korea and I was there for five years. I came back in 1998. After returning I went to my school to donate some cricket gear and the Principal was Mr. Mervyn Ruberu. During this period there was no permanent cricket coach at school and Mr. Ruberu requested from me to take over the coaching stint.
I obliged to his request. I never had an idea of becoming a cricket coach. In 2006 I got through the Level One Coaching Exam and I continued upto 2014 .
From 1998 to 2002 I coached my alma-mater free of charge. In 2014 one of my friends requested me to join Mahanama College, Colombo as the head coach. So I took over and served up to June 2016. On a request made by several Old Vidyalians I assumed the coaching stint at my alma-mater again.
Q - Were you involved in commencing Old Moratu Vidyalians Sports Club?
A - It was Brigadier Asoka Perera, Athula Wickramathilake, Chandana Mahesh, Ranjith Ferdinando, Lakshman Fernando, Ajith Fernando, Chandral Perera with a few others who started the club. They appointed me as the coach and to-date I am involved in coaching.
They commenced this club to help school cricket and the past cricketers to enable to engage in club cricket.
Q - Did you perform well?
Y - Yes. OMVSC clinched the Division three two championships and they became under 23 champions too.
Q - What are your performances at school level?
A - In year 1998 we won the under 15 Division Two championship and in year 2000 we won the under 13 Division Two championship. We won the under 19 division two championship under Lasitha Mendis and year 2011 under Sanka Ramesh.
We won the Big Match against our arch rivals Sri Sumangala College, Panadura in 2010 under Anuruddha Kalhara after 39 years.
Q - Who is the best all rounder produced from Moratu Vidyalaya?
A - There were several all rounders produced from time to time during the past. But in my opinion Sarath Fernando comes to my mind. He played in the Big Match at the age of 14 years and joined Prince of Wales’ College. It was Cambrians gain and Vidyalians loss. He went onto represent Air Force, Moratuwa Sports Club and later Sri Lanka. Next comes Sanka Ramesh who is a very fine all rounder produced by our school during my time. He scored 1000 runs twice and at the same time claimed 100 wickets twice.
Q - How about Ajantha Mendis?
A - He joined our school from St. Anthony’s School Kadalana, Moratuwa and played for the under 15, 17 and 19 teams and captained the under 17 team.
He also played for Old Moratu Vidyalians Sports Club. I was his coach throughout his cricket careeer prior to joining Sri Lanka Army.
Q - Did you manage the school cricket team on overseas tours?
A - Yes. It was the history of Moratu Vidyalaya that I took the under 19, 17 and 15 teams to Hyderabad and Bangalore in India. It was the first time that a team from our school took wings to a foreign soil and it was fine exposure for our young cricketers.
Q - How did your cricketers perform after leaving school?
A - Most of them played in club cricket, Mercantile, Services and some are playing overseas and some have taken up to coaching.
Q - What is the happiest moment in your coaching career?
A - When one of my cricketers Ajantha Mendis played for Sri Lanka and later he went onto represent the country in ODIs and T20s. Also special mention should be made of Sanka Ramesh for his performances In 2008/09.
Moratu Vidyalaya recorded 13 victories out of 14 matches excluding the Big Match with our rivals Sri Sumangala under Lasitha Mendis which is a school record. Also we became under 13 Division Two champions and Division Two Under 15 champions. In 2011 we won the Under 19 Division two and in 2009 again we won the Division two Championship 2012. Both these seasons we won the Division Two Best Team Awards.
Q - Who were the people who were behind these achievements?
A - The Principals. I have worked under five Principals, Masters in Charge and Members of the Staff and the Old Boys and Old Girls. The present Principal H. Athauda, the Prefect of Games, Najith Jayaweera and Master in Charge Rashika Chaminda are helping me. I should be failing in my duty if I do not mention about Lakshman Fernando for his unstinted support at all times. Our former MP and Minister Jeevan Kumaranatunga gave us a turf wicket and the present Colombo District MP and former Minister Gamini Lokuge built a boundary wall. Recently on a request made by me the District Coach Chaminda Jayasinghe gave us a boundary rope and a turf cover. We urgently require two sight screens and we are working on that project too.
Q - Are your children taking part in sports?
A - No. I have two sons both are attending Moratu Vidyalaya. My wife Sujeewa Lakma is a house wife.
Q - Finally what is the advice you can give to the young cricketers?
A - Firstly you must be religious and well disciplined. Then comes the studies and you must be able to take victory and defeat alike. Then comes the physical fitness and attending practices regularly. There is a saying, “Practice makes Perfect”.
