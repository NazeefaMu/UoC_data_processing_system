NEC to accelerate economic reforms

The National Economic Council (NEC) will introduce an accelerated programme to strengthen the national economy by introducing the necessary reforms in economic management in the country next week.
This decision was reached when the National Economic Council met at the Presidential Secretariat under President Maithripala Sirisena’s patronage yesterday.
The NEC members had discussed at length the immediate reforms needed in the economic management in the country and steps that should be taken on a short, medium and long term basis, according to a statement issued by the President’s media unit.
President Sirisena established the National Economic Council (NEC) last year with the aim of strengthening the national economy.
The main responsibility of the NEC is to take decisions on the national economy with prominence given to local agriculture and industries.
Advising and issuing guidelines on strategically important policies, agreements, and projects that are directly relevant to the country’s economic development also come under the Council’s purview.
