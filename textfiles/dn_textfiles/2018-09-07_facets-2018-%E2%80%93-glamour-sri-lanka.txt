FACETS 2018 – the glamour of Sri Lanka

The FACETS Gem and Jewellery Exhibition 2018 brought together the best gem and jewellery manufacturers of the island under one roof. The 28th chapter of the exhibition was held for four days giving access to the general public to see, study and purchase gem and jewellery within a range of products from precious to semi-precious stones, and gold, silver to costume jewellery.
FACETS is organized by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association with the support of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority and Export Development Board. Throughout the years the exhibition has become a platform for small and medium gem and jewellery manufacturers and traders to showcase their ware to a mass of local and international audience. The presence of foreign delegates has added value to FACETS, making it a truly international exposure for Sri Lanka.
The opening ceremony was attended by Minister of Science, Technology, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Dr. Sarath Amunugama. The highlight of the ceremony was the launch of the coffee table book Sri Lanka Gems by Vladyslav Yavorskyy, an internationally renowned gemologist and author of Terra Spinel: Terra Firma, Terra Garnet and Terra Connoisseur.
The exhibition showcased many of Sri Lanka’s gem and jewellery manufacturers as well as several international stalls. The gems varied from precious to semi-precious to coloured stones, attracting buyers from all levels. Purchasing a gem is an investment which has a very low risk in depreciation. The varied value levels of the stones enable the buyer to make an investment within one’s budget. FACETS was a platform to compare, evaluate and purchase gems, as well as a great opportunity to learn about mining, cutting, polishing and value adding of gems. The complete process from mine to market was displayed for those interested in learning about the industry.
The jewellery zone ranged from high value gold to silver to creative costume pieces, once again catering to all levels of jewellery lovers. The small and medium manufacturers under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority as well as the Export Development Board received significant exposure in bringing out their products to the market. Visitors were also able to make use of the opportunity to evaluate the jewellery they bout or already owned at the valuation counters.
