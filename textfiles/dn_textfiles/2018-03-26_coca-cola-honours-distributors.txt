Coca-Cola honours distributors

Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka recently hosted its annual Distributor Partner Convention, recognizing its longstanding distributors and rewarding top performances at a gala event of fellowship. The event took place at the Waters Edge, Battaramulla and was attended by over 100 distributors and Coca-Cola associates. Apart from giving out awards for outstanding contributions, the event provided a fitting platform to congregate with CCBSL distributors and to hear their amazing success stories.
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka, Managing Director, Mayank Arora said “It gives me great pleasure to congratulate our valued distributors for their ongoing commitment and tireless efforts to ensure our success in Sri Lanka.
Each one of our distributors has played a key role in driving our business growth in the market. We are proud of our distributors’ contribution and look forward to working together and serve all consumers in Sri Lanka with great tasting and refreshing beverages.”
