Dentsu Grant awarded Rs 219 mn global tea marketing contract

The Sri Lanka Tea Board yesterday awarded a Rs 219 million media contract to Dentsu Grant to commence a global marketing campaign for Ceylon Tea.
The campaign aims to re-establish the premium position of Ceylon Tea in 12 priority markets and reinforce its association with the Lion Logo, the symbol of premium quality. “The challenge before the media agency Dentsu Grant is to plan and implement a very well-thought-out strategic media campaign that will reach the diverse but carefully targeted audiences within the 12 countries,” Rohan Pethiyagoda, the outgoing Tea Board Chairman said.
