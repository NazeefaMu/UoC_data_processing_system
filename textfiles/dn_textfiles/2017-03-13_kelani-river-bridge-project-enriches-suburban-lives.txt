Kelani River Bridge Project enriches suburban lives

The new bridge construction project over the Kelani river financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided an opportunity for the Sedawatta and Wadullawatta communities to build their lives.
The new bridge runs parallel to the existing bridge, and bridge piers will be located at Sedawatta and Wadullawatta. The communities have to relocate if the bridge is to be constructed. The relocation is carried out in accordance with the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and JICA’s guidelines for social and environmental considerations. The affected communities are compensated based on the principles of replacement cost to enable them to have an equivalent or better living standards.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) - the implementing agency for the bridge construction project - with close cooperation from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) secured apartments for over 400 households in the UDA’s “Laksanda Sevana” housing complex in Salamulla. The 2nd apartment block in the complex was ceremonially opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on March 2.The complex is located just a few kilometers away from the bridge, so the changes to their traveling times and surroundings are minimised. Almost the entire community opted to live in the complex, so the community ties can continue in the new site.
The project affected families receive ownership of their individual apartments on vacation of their existing premises. The apartments are larger than the houses they currently occupy and equipped with amenities including electricity and water connections. The Project Management Unit (PMU) provided them with guidance and assistance on furnishing and maintaining their apartments.An income restoration programme is currently in progress. Through this, the householders received training, equipment and micro-finance facilities to start or expand home based industries such as shoe-making, incense sticks, and dress-making among others. The PMU continues the support them to expand sales, diversify and improve quality of products and be self-sustainable.
A Montessori and day-care centre are being set up and selected residents are being trained to operate both. The PMU assisted the families to move their children to the closest school to the housing complex. During the floods in 2016 when this community was inundated, the PMU staff provided food for them by contributing portion of their salary. At Laksanda Sevana, the PMU staff set up a library for the children, again using their own personal resources. The community members feel they have gained not only new homes, but also a new family in the PMU staff.
Thirty families have already moved and settled in the first building of Laksanda Sevana. They have used the trainings they received to furnish and equip the apartments in creative and innovative ways. Their ownership and pride are evident from the efforts they have put in to convert the houses into homes. The other families are moving to the 2nd building after the ceremonial opening on March 2. “The new bridge over the Kelani river will bring substantial economic benefits to Sri Lanka.
But the direct benefits to the project affected communities through conducting the resettlement according to the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and JICA’s Guidelines are of equal or higher value. Through this the lives of over 2,000 residents of Colombo has been uplifted, and definitely their contribution to the economy will rise. We hope this will be taken as an example and the same policies followed in all other public infrastructure projects,” the JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Kiyoshi Amada said.
