Governor highlights technology training to avoid service delays

A computer lab and online training management system was opened at the Management Development Training Unit (MDTU) in Trincomalee by Eastern Province Governor Rohitha Bogollagama.
The Governor highlighted the need for technological advancement in the public service to avoid delays in service delivery. He further suggested upgrading the MDTU as a training campus for Eastern provincial public officials providing the required amenities. He said he advised the MDTU Director to conduct similar programmes in Batticaloa and Ampara districts as well.
MDTU Director M. M. Halida emphasised the demand for ICT-related training and explained how the MDTU is moving towards an environment-friendly service by adopting new technologies.
The newly furnished computer lab can accommodate 50 participants at a time. The online training management system is aimed at introducing a paperless office concept for communication with Eastern Provincial Council institutions in a convenient way.
Secretaries, Deputy Chief Secretaries, Heads of Departments and officials were present.
