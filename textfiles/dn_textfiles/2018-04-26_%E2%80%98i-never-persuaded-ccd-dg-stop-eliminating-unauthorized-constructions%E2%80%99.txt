‘I never persuaded CCD DG to stop eliminating unauthorized constructions’

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha yesterday, denied any attempt to persuade the Coast Conservation Department (CCD) Director General from eliminating the unauthorized constructions at Mirissa coastal area. Musthapha said that he had “never tried to influence any government official” during his political career. “It was only making a request I made via a telephone call, appealing him to consider the humane aspect of the matter before demolishing these unauthorized constructions,” Minister Musthapha said. Mustapha urged the CCD to temporarily suspend any immediate action to take down the unauthorized constructions and to opt for discussions to find out a solution benefitting both parties.
Musthapha was speaking at a press brief held at the Provincial Council and Local Government Ministry yesterday evening.
Musthapha said that he respected CCD Director General for his unwavering commitment to implement laws as a government official. “According to the law, this decision is lawful. However, as a politician who is committed to the welfare of the common majority, I plea the CCD to rethink its decision, as it would be a blow to these persons’ livelihood. This is our call as politicians. We should strike a balance. It is their livelihood we are talking about. These vendors have earned a living from these businesses for more than seven years or so. We should give these people an option without simply abandoning them.” Minister Musthapha said.
Minister Musthapha also said that some groups are trying to portray him as the “villain” who is against demolishing these unauthorized constructions. However, “When I said that I will step into ensure that the poor people of Mirissa are not suddenly left without their livelihood, that is not to say that I will in any way subvert the Constitution and laws of this country, but I will do my best to ensure that the laws are applied in a decent, reasonable and sensitive way by balancing the contextual realities of the poor people who are affected by those laws,” Minister Musthapha stated.
He also pointed out that Hikkaduwa, Unawatuna and Mount Lavinia coastal areas too have similar illegal constructions in abundance.
It was reported that Minister Musthapha contacted CCD Director General Prabhath Chandrakeerti and urged him not to go ahead with the decision to remove the illegal business constructions at Mirissa the coast.
