Joseph real star in a star spangled world

Joseph was called to play sheet anchor in someone else’s star role – how would you react to that? Both Baby Jesus and Mary received more attention from Heaven and others, than Joseph did. Christmas is when God sets you up for His best – don’t try to compete with your agenda.
Saviour was insulted as Carpenter’s Son – why? - Bethlehem had the most delicate and skilled carpenters to make and maintain their linen weaving timber machines (handloom). Bethlehem was famous for well bred sheep, quality wheat, flax and linen industry. When Bethlehem fell on rough times, these carpenters scattered all over the country and some from Joseph’s ancestry ended in Nazareth of Galilee – quite the antithesis of Bethlehem, the City of King David and the city beautified by Solomon, the wisest. Joseph pined for Bethlehem where carpenters were honoured. In Nazareth they were among the poorest and also had to learn masonry with limestone. There was no artistry in doing the timber work for rough shod fishermen like Simon Peter and their hands were calloused with hard labour while their back broke for their meagre pittance.
Agreeing to be God’s best
Mary heard heaven and Joseph had to agree. How do you respond to people who say, “I have a vision from God; will you partner with me?” Having understood Mary’s re-telling of Gabriel’s vision, Joseph came on board on the Project Immanuel.
Having come on board on Mary’s word, Joseph seems to have had misgivings when Mary’s heavenly vision had visible girth consequences that were embarrassing. Obviously people began to drop their voice when Joseph came around. He may have heard, “poor fellow”. Have you felt like pulling out having begun in good faith? If Joseph pulled out he would have missed God and his own destiny. Joseph is the one who has understood that his destiny is to serve another who has a great call from God. Not that Joseph’s call was less but different and supplementary. All cannot be in the lead role.
Joseph became the team member who got the most difficult parts of Project Immanuel. His call was, “Do whatever needed to be done for the King to be born”. Shift the straw. Clean up the dung. Wash the food trough. Find the bandages. There went Joseph’s best robe. Be midwife for one night with no training. One moment great elation that three kings came to worship the babe and in the next, great danger that Herod will kill – fleeing in the night.
Most menial work to make others shine
Joseph understands that his toil is another’s gift. In the fellow-ship of HMS Apeksha, Joseph is on lower deck pulling the oars (work of Galley slaves). Singers are high on the sails for all to see. Others reach down and save the sinking taking them into life boats. Someothers man the guns to keep the enemy at bay. Some read maps and keep the ship on course. In fact the whole profession is called sailors though Joy-serfs are indispensable. Joseph is the Joy-serf who toils for others to shine.
Their joy is another’s trophy. Trainers, coaches, teachers all have the ministry of Joseph. Joseph demonstrates the ministry of the shepherd. Shepherd has to lead and follow and be on a side when there is danger that sheep may fall of the ledge. Shepherd leads until he gets them to new pasture. He follows them when sheep have to move thru known territory. It is a difficult balance. If you do not lead, sheep stagnate or go astray. If you do not allow sheep to take initiative, they do not grow.
Others first – Joseph’s motto
When all goes well Joseph gives the credit to the protégé. When all does not go well he takes the rap. Joseph’s task is not to do it himself but to get others to do what he knows to do so well, to see those whom he trained do it better than he does. Joseph works to get himself out of the job. “Do you not know I have business in my Father’s house?” - twelve year old Jesus asked Joseph. Jesus was even then surpassing Joseph’s mentoring capacity.
1.Joseph lends his light for others to shine even if it outshines him.
2.Joseph cannot feel let down when trainees do not perform. Joseph cannot steel the credit when trainees perform well.
3.Joseph cannot get disappointed that trainees do not perform to his expectation. He would get disappointed only if he assesses his worth according to the trainees’ performance. Joseph sticks through bad seasons, even when his team comes last in the tournament, knowing that he did his best as their coach.
4.Joseph must not become Saul when he recognizes that one protégé is going to do better than him.
5.Joseph was wise to tackle jealousy and made Jesus brilliant.
6.Joseph evaluates and appreciates another’s son in the same way he does for his son.
7.Joseph cannot allow bad ways or brilliance of one to dominate the others. Joseph like David has to lead the slower sheep also to full potential. Joseph makes the playing field even. The brilliant one gets the hardest task. The handicapped gets the easy tasks. All play the game. All are rewarded.
8.Joseph learnt the ministry of a shepherd – not to accuse or blame but bear the sin. Be the solution. Joseph has understood his foibles and failures and is graced by God to help others in their failures. Those who look for perfect workmates assume they too are perfect. Joseph through trouble was comforted that he might comfort others. 2 Cor 1:3.
