Youth in action

Whyteleafe Performing Arts Academy recently held its annual New Year celebrations ‘Dangayange Avurudda’ at Ratmalana. This event was especially organised for children and consisted of many traditional Avurudu games, singing and dancing performances. It was held with the attendance of several distinguished artists Sanath Gunathilake, Umayangana Wickramasinhe, Ashika Mathasinghe, Vinu Udani, popular TV presenters Lanka Perera and Arundathi Koliyabandara.
The events included the Whyteleafe Avurudu Kumara and Kumariya, Fancy Dress Parade, Pillow Fight (Kotta Pora), Blind Pot Break (Kana Mutti Bideema), Mark Elephant’s Eye (Aliyata Aha Thabeema) and many others. The students of the Academy skillfully drew upon their talents and eagerly participated in the events. Given the acting talents of the students at the Academy, the Fancy Dress competition became a very lively event of the day.
Students from both the Nugegoda and Kalutara branches of the Whyteleafe Academy participated in the celebrations along with their parents.
