Abigail Schaffter  presents first solo-art exhibition, “Reflections”

 
 
 
Reflecting on the complexities and simplicities of life at the same time, Abigail Schaffter will stage her first solo art exhibition on October 27 and 28 at the Lionel Wendt Art Gallery. Titled “Reflections”, the art exhibition will feature the best of Abigail’s paintings accumulated since she began painting last year.
Serving at People’s Church, Narahenpita as a full-time Pastor, Abigail is also the wife of prominent business personality Ramesh Schaffter and a mother of four.
“Reflections” she says, was born from a place of desolation and struggle. “Feeling overwhelmed by my many responsibilities and stretched thin between home, college and work, I experienced a ‘burnout’ last year. Through this experience, I found resilience from within and my unwavering belief in God kept me anchored throughout the long, difficult months. Over the period that followed, art was a lifeline. I lost myself in painting for hours, and discovered a blissful therapy in art. Late last year, whilst at a Christian retreat, I experienced supernatural healing from the Lord Jesus Christ. The burden of my burnout was lifted” she stated.
Using oil, acrylic, watercolours, soft pastels and inks, the paintings trace Abigail’s journey and the lessons she has learnt. “Reflections” explore the reflections of matter on water, but also the soul’s reflection on what really matters. Threading through moments of stillness and quiet contemplation, the exhibition weaves together a celebration of beauty and the joy of living.
Abigail’s artistic talents were honed by another gifted artist and art teacher Rhuani Rambukwelle who is instrumental in making this exhibition possible.
“Rhuani has been more than a teacher. She has spent hours guiding and supporting me every step of the way” says Abigail.
