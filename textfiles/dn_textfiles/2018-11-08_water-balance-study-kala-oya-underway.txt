Water balance study of Kala Oya underway

The Irrigation Ministry will conduct a complete water balance study regarding the Kala Oya river basin.
The irrigation Department has entrusted the project to Actkins Engineering Agency to carry out the water balance study.
The program coordinator of the Irrigation Department’s Water Management and Training unit Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said the Kala Oya basin is the third longest river in Sri Lanka.
It is about 145 km in length. Kala Oya joins the sea at Gangewadiya in Wilpattu National Sanctuary. It covers about 2,870 square kilometres. The area falls within two agro - ecological regions that receive a relatively low rainfall with high seasonal and spatial variations.
The lowest occurrence of rainfall has been from June to August while the highest rainfall was received during the Maha season from October to December.
In the dry zone, over two- thirds of the annual rainfall received from October to December, the mean annual rainfall, varies from 1,700 mm at the high elevation in southeastern end of the basin and gradually drops to 1,200 mm towards the northwestern part of the basin.
With the increase in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the area, the government has given priority to cover the entire basin with pipe-borne water supply schemes.
The upper part of Kala Oya basin falls within the Matale district and the middle reach falls within the Anuradhapura and Kurunegala districts while the lower reach is located in the Puttalam district.
Anuradhapura and Puttalam being the districts in the dry zone which faces a huge water scarcity most of the time during a year, finding suitable water sources for various needs has become a major challenge.
Kala Oya, being one of the longest rivers, which flows through the two districts, is the only possible water source to be used in multifaceted requirements of the people.
The priority of water allocation in a basin is first to meet the drinking water requirement followed by ecological, irrigation and other demands.
Palugaswewa said the overall objective of the proposed water balance study is to review the present state of water availability in the Kala Oya river basin and thereby to decide the possibility of extracting 69,300 cubic meters per day in total to fulfill the water supply demand of Eppawala, Rajanganaya, Nochchiyagama, Giribawa and Thambuttegama water supply schemes without compromising the water requirement of other water users in the region.
Specifically, this is to be achieved by conducting a detailed water balance study in the Kala Oya basin giving significant consideration to the present and future demand of all water users in the Kala Oya river basin including ecological demands, the Director (Water Management and Training) said.
