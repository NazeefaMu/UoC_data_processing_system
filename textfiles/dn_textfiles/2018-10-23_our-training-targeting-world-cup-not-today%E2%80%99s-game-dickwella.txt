Fifth and final ODI v England
Our training is targeting the World Cup not today’s game - Dickwella

With another ODI series loss this time to England who hold onto an unassailable 3-0 lead, Sri Lanka are concentrating their energies on making an impact in the next World Cup more than today’s fifth and final ODI which takes place under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium.
All four ODIs have been affected by bad weather and today’s game will be no different with the rains still continuing to torment the Englishmen who have not had a full 100-over match in the series although they have already sealed it and made this contest a dead rubber.
“As a team we train hard. Our preparation has been good. We are looking at the World Cup. We have about ten games before the World Cup. We have improved no doubt. We just need to win one game,” said Sri Lanka’s wicket-keeper batsman Niroshan Dickwella at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
“We won two games against South Africa but that wasn’t good enough to win the series. We are trying to make an impact in the World Cup and our training is targetting that more than tomorrow’s game.”
Batting has been a big concern for Sri Lanka in the series but in the fourth ODI at Pallekele on Saturday they clicked for the first time running up an impressive 273-7 only to see the game being decided on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule.
“It was a good effort scoring 273. It was a slow wicket and turning as well. As I said at the last media briefing, the top order and middle order has to click to help us to get to a big total. As a batting unit, we did well. We didn’t lose by a big margin. Satisfied with the effort. The no-ball and rain and then Duckworth/Lewis came into play that is why we lost,” said Dickwella.
The match would have been a closer contest than it turned out to be had Sri Lanka not made the costly mistake of having an extra fielder outside the 30-yard circle. That lapse on their part deprived them of Joe Root’s wicket as the ball was declared a no-ball.
Root and skipper Eoin Morgan carried England to a comprehensive series clinching eight-wicket win.
“This is a game of awareness. That can happen. We are human. But we cannot afford that to happen. Those are silly mistakes. We need to avoid them when we are trying to win tight games. When we commit mistakes like that it is tough to win,” said Dickwella.
