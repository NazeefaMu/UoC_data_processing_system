Told much, shown less

In this land full of natural wonders and riches, what else is there to aspire to? Yet an unsettled feeling hangs in the troubled air. The tourists pour in to bask in the natural glory, whereas a major portion of citizens deserts the land for greener pastures. Why? And that question has survived decades without a sane answer.
Like any other author, Shyam Selvadurai likens Sri Lanka to a paradise when he titles his anthology of Sri Lankan English literature as ‘Many Roads Through Paradise’.
“As far as I know this is the first serious attempt ever made to present an anthology of modern writing in all of them. Since few people can read with equal facility in English, Sinhala and Tamil, the anthologist has fixed on one language for his book and presented his chosen examples from the other two in translation,” Richard Simon offers his standpoint on the anthology.
Notable works

However, Simon admits that he did not actually read the whole anthology. Some of the literary excerpts have disheartened him. He could not bear to go on.
If you are into fiction but not much into coffee-table books and business-related text, chances are more that you haven’t heard of Richard Simon that much. Richard Simon calls himself a hack, not much into fiction. But he has been quoted as one of the finest writers of English in various instances.
The introduction to Richard Simon is quite poles apart from most writers that we have featured in this column. Simon is a professional writer and editor of books, magazines and corporate publications. Formerly into advertising and copywriter, Simon is a published author of several notable works.
‘Ceylon Tea: The Trade That Made A Nation’ and ‘Sri Lanka: The Island from Above’ stand out above the rest owing to its rich information and the extravagant price beyond common man’s reach. Ceylon Tea was published to coincide with the sesquicentennial moment of Sri Lankan tea industry, while The Island from Above is a collection of photographs taken of Sri Lankan landscape from the helicopter that follows Simon’s introduction.
The depressive literary excerpts are not Selvadurai’s fault, Simon continues.
“An anthologist must work with what is available. The sad truth is that, despite its balmy climate, heart-lifting beauty and cultural diversity, modern Sri Lanka is anything but a paradise. Things have got better since the war ended and the man who won it and then lost himself the peace was voted out of office, but for two whole generations this was, to be frank, a bloody miserable country to be a native of, and dangerous to boot.”
Such is the fate, Simon adds, of so many of the world’s loveliest places.
Things unsaid
For Simon, Martin Wickramasinghe’s Gamperaliya (translated into English as Uprooted by Lakshmi de Silva) is a seminal literary work, but it plods.
“The ‘action’ consists mainly of a series of conversations between people who can’t really express themselves to one another due to social taboos and their own confusion. Their oblique, laconic exchanges are filled with things unsaid – which, outside the quotation marks, the author tells us about in far too much detail,” Simon notes.
According to most Western notions, Simon goes on to add, it is bad writing: showing too little, telling too much. It miniaturizes the work, turning it into a puppet-theatre overshadowed by the looming shape of the string-pulling author.
“I suppose the model here was Dostoevsky, and particularly The Brothers Karamazov, but the result reads more like some Soviet propaganda-novel in which Revolutionary ideals and Party policies are turned into simplistic, allegorical tales suitable for semiliterate readers.”
But then again, Simon maintains that it is unfair to apply the same criteria one would use to judge a literary novel published in Japanese, French, Russian or English to a novel like Gamperaliya.
Basic techniques
“Wickramasinghe was the first really successful Sinhala novelist, the first to produce a solid body of work and the first, perhaps, whose works aspired to the condition of literature. But to compare him with Dostoevsky is unkind; and to judge him in relation to some of his literary contemporaries, such as Joyce or Nabokov, would be downright cruel. This pioneer of the Sinhala novel was still working through the basic techniques of fiction-writing at the time Gamperaliya was published. He had no local models to help him.”
Simon then moves on to the celebrated Sri Lankan English writers. Michael Ondaatje is world-famous. Michelle de Kretser’s The Hamilton Case is a neat, well-researched assemblage of conventional tropes. But they cannot be considered Sri Lankan English writers.
“They are established international authors with Sri Lankan connexions, who made their reputations abroad before they were ever heard of by the reading public here.”
David Blacker’s action novel, A Cause Untrue, is another Sri Lankan English fiction that Simon applauds.
“Blacker may not pretend to high art, but the way he builds and paces the tension in this scene could teach many more self-consciously literary writers a thing or two about technique.”
Three tips
Writing is mostly done out of envy, Simon elaborates. You should never be a writer if you want to become famous. Be a movie star, he offers a solution. Simon joined the industry because he had a flair for writing. And he took the challenge of surviving in the industry as a freelancer after leaving all the permanent jobs he had in the corporate communications industry.
He offers three tips to would be writers. He begins with the second tip: write, and write. And then he moves on to the first tip: read, and do it profusely.
“For instance certain books, I find it difficult to read. What I do is I have some time and finish off reading it because I need to do it.”
Then the third tip is not to be jealous. Most of the writing emerges out of either envy or jealousy for fellow human beings. A writer should be clever to steer ahead of it. Richard Simon quotes Shakespeare for being generous sympathetic towards fellow human beings in his works.
