MoU signed with Shanthi Foundation to build Kidney Hospital in NCP

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed at the Health Ministry recently, between the Health Ministry and the Shanthi Foundation of Australia to establish a Kidney (Palliative Care) Hospital in the Anuradhapura District for the benefit of critically ill kidney patients from the North Central Province, according to a Health Ministry spokesman.
According to the spokesman, the Shanthi Foundation would provide Rs. 120 million to establish the hospital and run it. The Foundation would provide financial assistance to run the hospital for the next 100 years. This would be the first ever Palliative Care Centre to be set up in Sri Lanka.
The Shanthi Foundation, a charity registered in Australia, has been helping Sri Lanka to develop palliative care and combat Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) over the last two years, he said. Meanwhile Shanthi Foundation sources point out that presently an estimated 400,000 people in the North Central, Northern Eastern and Uva Provinces of Sri Lanka, have been affected and 25,000 have already died from CKDU. Since the first reported case was detected in 1992 in the Siripura village in Padaviya, the prevalence of CKDU has doubled every eight years and is estimated to affect nearly 40 percent of the population in Sri Lanka by year 2032, the sources pointed out.
