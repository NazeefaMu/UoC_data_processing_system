'Huge potential for SL to become IT leader in South East Asia'

There is very good potential for Sri Lanka to become a leader in South East Asia in IT adoption, said Assistant General Counsel and Regional Director, Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), Microsoft Asia, Keshav Dhakad, at a press briefing in Singapore recently.
“The initiative that we have seen in the private sector, banking industry and the government of Sri Lanka is that there is a huge potential not only to grow the market in terms of bringing new technology as an enabler to connect citizens but also how to grow Sri Lankan businesses to become regional businesses and how to become a regional player and not just focus on the country itself,” he said. “We have invested in Sri Lanka in terms of technology adoption, innovation, empowerment and invested in working on philanthropy, building education and technology, bringing technology for social upliftment by connectivity and accessibility to technology. Asia will be the next powerhouse for managing the growth of the world economy and Asia will be the key for future global economy,” he said.
“We have already seen some very good signs in terms of how Sri Lankan companies are adopting cloud. They are becoming more open about cloud because they want to expand and they want to use technology which is fast, reliable and cheaper to manage. But they are looking at security very seriously,” he said.
“We have met entrepreneurs, customers and government officials in Sri Lanka and we can see very clearly that there is an open-minded society in Sri Lanka. We can see the technology is empowering.
This cannot only empower enterprises and businesses but also it can make government more transparent, more accessible and it can be more accountable to people,” he said.
“Overall we can see that majority of Sri Lankan youth using mobile phones and internet and this can be the game changer.
The younger population, the more they get trained in IT, the more they understand IT and appreciate how IT can be transformative to their personal lives, for their interest and good jobs they are seeking.
There is a big potential for the work population to become more employable, to find more opportunities by adopting good IT practices,” he said. “Sri Lanka has to be more careful when it comes to cybersecurity and Sri Lanka is also targeted like other countries because it is a growing market. There is a huge potential, we see a lot of awareness is going on and adoption of disruptive technologies. Even the government is looking at regulations which can help companies to expand businesses using cloud technologies,” he said.
“We would like to see how this can support to develop local talent which can then become entrepreneurs, so that they can become leaders, as they stay in Sri Lanka or they go out of the country,” he added.
