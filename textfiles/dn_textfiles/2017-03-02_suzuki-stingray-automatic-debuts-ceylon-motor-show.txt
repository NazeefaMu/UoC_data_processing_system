Suzuki Stingray Automatic  debuts at Ceylon Motor Show

The evergreen Suzuki Wagon R which was recently reincarnated as the Stingray is a popular mode of transport among individuals who are hooked on the spaciousness and the tallboy silhouette offered by this sporty vehicle.
Associated Motorways (Private) Limited (AMW) being the sole agent and the authorized distributor in Sri Lanka for brand new Suzuki motor vehicles introduced the Suzuki Wagon R for the first time to the local market during 2002 and has since made this carand it's younger sibling, the Stingray, the first choice of many a family in the market for a brand new all-rounder vehicle.
AMW chose Sri Lanka's premier motor show, the Ceylon Motor Show, staged at the Bandaranaike Memorial International ConferenceHall (BMICH) recently as the venue for the launch of the Suzuki Stingray2017 with automatic transmission. Samantha Rajapaksa, AMW's Group Managing Director and Yohann de Zoysa,Director-Passenger Vehicles unveiled the 2017 Suzuki Stingray automatic to a packed audience at the Ceylon Motor Show.
The 2017 Stingray automatic promises a hassle-free drive during rush hour transits with it's 5 speed Auto Gear Shift(AGS) which also offers a manual shift mode for sportier moods. The Suzuki ‘K-Next’ series 1000cc engine married to this outstanding transmission system produces phenomenal levels of performance and fuel efficiency. Comparatively, these achievements far exceed the figures offered by the reconditioned Stingray vehicles found in the open market. The ground clearance of 165mm in the brand new 2017 Suzuki Stingray AGS dwarfs the 155mm found in it's reconditioned counterpart.
In light of passenger safety, the 2017 Stingray AGS is loaded with many safety features which include driver and front passengerairbags complemented by the anti-lock braking system, all of which come as standard equipment. Many niceties are also found in abundance in the 2017 Suzuki Stingray AGS. Among these, the factory installed premium sound systemwith steering wheel mounted controls, factory fitted original Suzuki alloy wheels, rear wiper/washer and de-fogger, leather wrapped and tilt adjustable steering wheel along with the projector headlamps and the distinctive front reflector grill, take center stage.
The manufacturer's warranty of 2 years or 50,000Kms (whichever occurs first) offered in the 2017 Suzuki Stingray AGS is able to extend up to 4 years or 80,000Kms (whichever occurs first) with a nominal additional payment, at the time of vehicle purchase.
Being the pioneer and the market leader in the local automotive sector, AMW offers many an after-sales facility to their loyal customers via the network of modern service facilities spanning throughout the island. The trade-in concept, an industry first by AMW, makes it a breeze of upgrading from the current vehicle to a brand new Suzuki.
