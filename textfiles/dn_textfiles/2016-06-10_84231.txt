RTC lives up to its  promise of drug free  racing in Nuwara Eliya

 
During the recently concluded April Racing festival in Nuwara Eliya, the Royal Turf Club with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Anti Doping Agency conducted race horse drug testing for the first time in Sri Lanka.
The chestnut mare Supreme trained by S P A Raju goes down in history as the first horse to be drug tested in Sri Lanka, when she won The Mayors Class 3 Stakes over 1400M on 20th March.
There were 14 random samples taken from the 35 races run during the April racing season which ended on 30th April , with all samples having been returned negative by an overseas accredited laboratory , namely the National Dope Testing Laboratory [ NDTL ] , which also conducts testing for some internationally recognized race clubs. “We received the final report on Friday 3rd June and are delighted by the verdict”, said Mr Wood
Not all samples collected from the racehorses were taken from the winners; some were taken from placed horses randomly selected by Wayne Wood, the RTC Chairman of Stipendiary Stewards to doubly ensure clean racing.
The club will kick off the next racing season on the 6th August with a Bollywood Theme and both race enthusiasts as well as those looking for a fun filled weekend should make their reservations without delay .
