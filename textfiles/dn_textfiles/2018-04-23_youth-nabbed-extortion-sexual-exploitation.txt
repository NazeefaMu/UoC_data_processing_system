Youth nabbed for extortion, sexual exploitation

A youth who had allegedly uploaded nude photographs of his girlfriend to the internet, was arrested by Wennappuwa Police last Saturday (21).
According to police sources, the said youth, who had been carrying on an affair with a girl in Wennappuwa for a long time, had taken nude photographs and videos of the girl with his smart phone. However, on her parents' command, when the said girl had attempted to terminate the relationship, the youth had extorted her, threatening to release the nudes unless she provided him with cash.
The girl had complied and provided him with her ATM card, with which the individual had withdrawn a sum of Rs. 1.1 million. However, the youth had then followed to release the said explicit content.
The girl had then lodged a complaint against the suspect and he was subsequently arrested. He was to be produced at the Wennappuwa Magistrate's Courts.
Police are investigating.
