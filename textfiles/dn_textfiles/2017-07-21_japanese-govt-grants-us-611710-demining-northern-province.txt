Japanese Govt. grants US$ 611,710 for demining Northern Province

The Japanese Government has decided to provide a grant of US$ 611,710 to Mines Advisory Group (MAG) for humanitarian demining in Northern Sri Lanka, Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma said.
The grant contract was signed between Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganum and MAG Technical Operations Manager Rownan Fernandes at the Embassy of Japan in Colombo yesterday.
Suganuma said that that the project is aimed at clearing of mines to help support the livelihood development in the Northern Province of the country to enable the displaced people to return and resume their livelihoods.
He also said that development projects would be conducted in the Northern, Eastern, Uva and North Central Provinces to rehabilitate the irrigation system and water supply with the aid of the Japanese Government.
The Japanese Ambassador further said that the Japanese Government had provided a sum of approximately US$ 30.1 Million for demining activities in the North and East under its Grant Assistance for Grassroots Human Security Project (GGP).
MAG Technical Operations Manager Rownan Fernandes said that MAG Sri Lanka and the Japanese Government had enabled the removal and destruction of over 10,000 landmines during the past three years. The removal of these potentially lethal items have helped tens of thousands of people to resettle and rebuild their lives in the Mannar District by providing safe lands for agriculture, housing, schools and other community infrastructure, he added.
Fernandes further said, “Early this year, MAG successfully completed a systematic survey, which commenced in 2015, in six mine contaminated districts in Northern and Eastern provinces. The Japanese Government’s of support was inevitable to achieve this milestone, while continuing the clearance operations in the Mannar District, MAG is also looking forward to commence clearance activities in Mullaitivu District in partnership with the Japanese Government, under this new project.”
Japanese Embassy Second Secretary Kayo Imamura, Second Secretary Takefumi Sato, Development Cooperation Senior Assistant Sunila De Alwis, GGP Consultant Misako Takayama, GGP Consultant Nirosha Welgama, Media Relations Specialist Tharanga Herath, MAG Finance Manager Caroline Lurthanayaham and MAG Programme Officer Janani Thambiah also participated.
