Sri Lanka to release 42 boats, but warns of action if Indian fishermen enter its waters

Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera confirmed the release of 42 Indian boats, and warned that Sri Lanka wouldn't stop taking boats that crossed the maritime boundary into custody.
After a long wait, it's time to rejoice for fishermen in Tamil Nadu's Rameshwaram. Minister Amaraweera has confirmed the release of 42 boats - out of a total of 143 - that are in Sri Lanka's custody.
However, Amaraweera added that this doesn't mean Sri Lanka will stop taking boats that enter Sri Lankan waters into custody.When Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka in May, it was confirmed that the Sri Lankan government would consider releasing Indian boats in its custody. While Indian fishermen are happy about the announcement, they've said that they need protection in the Indian Ocean region.
"Every time we go to sea there is a threat to our life and property. We want the government to ensure our protection," said Emerat, fishermen leader. "Now we want our government to ensure that the (released) boats reach us at the earliest, and also ensure that the rest of the 101 boats also be released," said Jesuraj, another fishermen leader.Sri Lanka's Fisheries Ministry has said Indian fishermen should remember to not enter Sri Lankan waters, and that they must refrain from using nets or trawlers - which are banned in Sri Lanka.
