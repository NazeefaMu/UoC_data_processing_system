Debate Competition for School Children held

The Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka has identified the significance of enhancing legal knowledge among schoolchildren. As an initiative, the Legal Aid Commission Head Office, together with the Legal Aid Kaduwela Centre, organized a debate competition among schoolchildren of Kothalawala Maha Vidyalaya, Kaduwela. This competition was held on October 31 at the main hall of the Kothalawala Maha Vidyalaya.
A debate competition was conducted on the topic of 'Who should be responsible for garbage crises, is it the government or the general public?' This was an appropriate topic and a timely issue of society. Students participated for this competition with enthusiasm. With heated arguments and giving persuasive speeches, the opposition team won the competition, proving that the responsibility lies with the general public for the garbage crises.
To provide vital knowledge for schoolchildren on garbage issues, waste-management and who are the responsible authorities for the crises, the Legal Aid Commission has decided to organize inter-school debate competitions island-wide, through its 82 Centers. This was a concept of Legal Aid Commission Chairman and President’s Counsel Rohan Sahabandu.
Legal Aid Commission Director General Justice Hector S. Yapa, Retired Supreme Court Judge Vijitha Mayadunna, Kaduwela Municipal Council Officer Nishanthi Delpat, Kaduwela Additional District Secretary H. L. Gnanarathne, Sri Jayawardenapura Education Zonal Director Vishaka Weerasinghe, Principal of Kothalawala Maha Vidyalaya Damayanthi Dissanayake, Legal Aid Commission Chief Legal Officer Harshani Balaharuwa, LAC Head Office Legal Officers, Legal Aid Commission staff and Interns from the Colombo Law Faculty, participated in this programme.
This Competition was jointly coordinated by Legal Aid Commission Head Office Legal Officer Uthpala Adikari and Kaduwela Legal Aid Commission Legal Officer Shiromi Perera.
