Solar energy drive adds 118 mw to national grid

The Soorya Bala Sangramaya, which started nine months ago, is in full swing now adding 118 megawatts to the national grid. Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera said the Soorya Bala Sangramaya (Battle for Solar Energy), which assists to strengthen the country’s economy, is among the key projects of the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry.
“It is significant that this 118 megawatt electricity generation is equal to that of the Uma Oya project. Without allocating funds from the government, we were able to add 118 megawatts to the national grid,” the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister made these remarks after opening a newly established solar energy system at Royal College, recently.
He said the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry launched this community based power generation project titled 'Soorya Bala Sangramaya' in collaboration with Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA), Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) aiming to promote the setting up of small solar power plants on the rooftops of households, religious places, hotels, commercial establishments and industries.
It is expected to add 200 megawatts of solar electricity to the national grid by 2020 and 1,000 megawatts by 2025 through this intervention. Perera projected that the entire electricity network of the country will be based on renewable energy by 2050. The entire energy demand will be met by renewable energy by then. It will be a huge advantage for the environment
Under the Soorya Bala Sangramaya programme, consumers will have options to generate and use electricity in their premises. In the case of electricity in excess of their requirements, they can sell the excess to the national grid or bank it for later use. According to the electricity usage, the customer can select a preferred option from the three schemes as Net Metering, Net Accounting and Micro Solar Power Producer.
Customers can obtain soft loan facilities from state banks for purchasing solar energy systems, the minister said.
