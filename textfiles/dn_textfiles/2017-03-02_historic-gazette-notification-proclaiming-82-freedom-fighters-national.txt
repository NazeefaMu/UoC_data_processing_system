Historic Gazette Notification proclaiming 82 freedom fighters as national heroes: They will be remembered forever with honour and respect: President

President Maithripala Sirisena said that yesterday was a historic day since a historic error was corrected by rewriting the names of 82 national heroes, who participated in the country’s first ever liberation struggle 199 years ago, on the name list of national heroes.
The President was speaking after the signing the of the historic Gazette Notification at the Magul Maduwa of the Sri Dalada Maligawa premises proclaiming 82 freedom fighters as national heroes.
These 82 national heroes who participated in the country’s first ever liberation struggle had been declared as traitors by the British. The event was held under the theme “Uththamabiwandana”.
President Sirisena addressing the huge gathering including hundreds of memebers of the Maha Sangha opposite the Sri Dalada Maligawa said that these national heroes, who bravely stood against foreign invaders and made the ultimate sacrifice were will be always remembered with honour and respect by the masses of the country.
“Eventhough, the Colonial rulers branded these national heroes as traitors and even after several decades after the country gaining independence, no measures were taken to rectify this historic error,” the President said.
Realizing this long felt need, President Sirisena revoked the 190-year-old British colonial order, clearing the names of the national heroes issuing a fresh gazette notification after cancelling a colonial rulers’ old gazette notification through which the 82 heroes were branded as traitors.
The order had been issued by then-British Governor Robert Brownrigg in January 1818 listing the names of these patriots, including Monarawila Keppetipola Disawe, who was a high-ranking official of the country’s last kingdom before it was defeated by the British.
President Sirisena said that we Sri Lankan are inherited for a proud history. It has been revealed that steel had been used 5,000 years ago.
He added that thousands of valiant patriotic heroes sacrificed their lives for the freedom struggles from 1505 until 1948.
Besides, a significant number of heroes sacrificed their lives for protecting the territorial integrity of the country during the three decade LTTE terrorist war.
The President while responding to the Maha Sangha said that measures will be taken to re-implement the Upcountry Rural Rehabilitation Commission (Udarata Gami Punaruththapana Commission) again aiming to streamline the development of the activities of upcountry.
The President added that the Cabinet approval has been granted for the implementation of the commission again.
When the members of the Maha Sangha brought to the President’s attention that there are certain issues relating to lands belonging to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, President Sirisena promised to take immediate measures to rectify those issues.
The President further said that he will give necessary instructions to the relevant authorities to protect the historic value and architecture of the former Bogambara Prison when carrying out renovation and development activities.
The 82 national heroes being elevated to the status of patriotic heroes by President Sirisena include Keppetipola Disawe, Godagedara Rate Adikaram, Ketakala Mohottaale, Kataragama Maha, Bethma Raterala, Kataragama Kuda Bethma Raterala, Polgolla Mohottaale, Watte Kale Mohottaale, Polgahagedara Rehenaraale, Posrewatta Vidane, Kiwlegedara Mohottale, Kalugamuwe Mohottaale, Udumadure Mohottaale, Kohukumbure Rateraale, Kohukumbure Walawwe Rateraale, Butuwe Rateraale, Baginigahawela Rateraala, Mahabadulle Gammane Rateraale, Bulupitiye Mohottaale and Palle Melheyaye Gamethiraale and a few more.
