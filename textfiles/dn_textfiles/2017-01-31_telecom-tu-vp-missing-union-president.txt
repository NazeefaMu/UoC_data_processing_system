Telecom TU VP missing: Union President

All Island Telecom Employees Union Vice President has been reported missing since January 28, Union President Nimantha Wijesuriya said.
Speaking at a press conference yesterday, Wijesuriya said Sri Lanka Telecom man power employees are continuing their protest, demanding that the government absorb them into the permanent cadre.
He said the Minister-in-charge of Telecommunication has recommended that they be absorbed into the permanent cadre of Sri Lanka Telecom though the Sri Lanka Telecom management was showing reluctance to execute the minister’s recommendations.
The Union charged that the official has been abducted with the intention of crippling their trade union action. The Union Vice President had gone missing while returning home at Pannipitiya in a motorcycle. “We have already apprised this incident to President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Inspector General of Police,” he said.
