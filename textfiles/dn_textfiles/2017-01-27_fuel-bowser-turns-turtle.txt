Fuel bowser turns turtle

 A bowser transporting 33,000 litres of diesel from Muthurajawela to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Stores Complex in Kotagala ran off the Colombo-Hatton road at Malliappu and toppled causing an oil leak into the Mahaweli Ganga around 12.30 p.m. yesterday. People in the neighbourhood rushed to the scene with tins and cans to collect the diesel gushing from the bowser.
