Crafting  leafy sculptures

The art of making figures and shapes by carving stone, wood or metal was a popular hobby of many people who lived during the ancient era. History reveals that kings and queens loved carved sculptures. They were under the impression that some sculptures of gods and religious leaders brought the beauty and also peace and prosperity to their palaces.
However in present society people make sculptures for commercial purposes, as a hobby or for exhibitions.
Seventy five year old Consy Goonetilleke whom I met at an exhibition in Peradeniya, Kandy has established herself as a sculptor. She displayed various sculptures at the exhibition.
After viewing the sculptures and her paintings anybody could guess that she was a versatile sculptor as well as a painter.
Educated at Holy Cross College, Gampaha and married to Lional Goonetilleke, Consy Goonetilleke who lives in Andiambalama, Negombo creates sculptures and engages in scenery paintings, mural and pottery paintings.
Among them mostly she has the inborn talents of making leafy sculptures. Leafy sculptures are made out of dried teak leaves (Thekka) without using any other outside material.
Goonetilleke plans to display various leafy sculptures at her next exhibition scheduled to be held next month in Colombo.
She wishes to display many items including a Japanese lady, my fair lady, the Holy Spirit, a village damsel, dolls, an infant, a lady picking flowers, a wedding couple, a Kandyan dancer, drummer, animals such as elephants and lions, a woman selling fish.
A pupil of the College of Fine Arts (former Haywood) Goonetilleke is a retired teacher. She proudly said thousands of children studied the art of making sculptures and painting during her teaching career at Presbyterian College, Dehiwala, St. Paul’s Girls School, Bambalapitiya, Veyangoda Maha Vidyalaya and Vijaya College, Matale.
In addition to exhibitions in leading hotels in Sri Lanka including at the Hotel Intercontinental, Galadari, Oberoi, Hilton and in Kandy Queen’s Hotel, Goonetilleke had held exhibitions in foreign countries including in Japan , Korea, Singapore, India and England.
