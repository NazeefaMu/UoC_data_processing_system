The book describes the historical significance of the 67-feet tall Samadhi Buddha statue on the 72-feet rock of the Moneragala Vidya Sagara Buddha Vihara at Rambodagalla near Kurunegala. This is the first time a granite Buddha sculpture was created out of a granite rock, after 850 years of the era of granite sculptures of the country.
South Indian sculptor of world fame Shri Muthutiah from Chennai, undertook the colossal project of carving the statue out of a granite rock along with 28 other sculptors in 2002.
This masterpiece of art, the Samadhi Buddha statue was unveiled by President Maithripala Sirisena in June, 2015 amidst a large gathering of devotees.
The book Compassionate Buddha of the Rock is a living testimony to the religious and ethnic harmony among the people of different faiths in Sri Lanka.
The book describes the incredible story of how the amazing 67.5 Samadhi Buddha statue was carved in Rambadagala, Kurunegala, a small village in Sri Lanka.
It is a story of inspiration and faith.
The carving of the Buddha Statue in the rock was a gigantic work undertaken by Ven. Egodamulle Amaramouli Thera of the Moneragala Temple, Rambodagalla, Rideegama, Kurunegala. This was in response to several youth who wanted to revolt against the Muslims and attack mosques when the youth came to know that the ancient Bamiyan Buddha Statues were bombed by the Taliban in Afghanistan.
The Thera admonished the youth, citing the Buddha as a living example who never took revenge. The Thera told the youth to show compassion and commence carving the Buddha statue in the Rambadagalla rock, close to the temple where the Monk resided.
Thereafter, the youth collected Rs. 200,000 and returned to the Thera and requested him to commence the work of carving the statue of the Buddha in the rock. The Thera accepted the challenge.
Eassuwaren, a businessman and philanthropist, the owner of Eswaran brothers in Colombo, then the President of the Chinmaya Mission in Sri Lanka, who constructed the Hanuman temple, came forward to support the Thera in carving the statue.
The author recalls how former Minister Jeyaraj Fernandopulle and former Colombo Deputy Mayor Edward Edirisuriya came to his assistance when he was in dire need of help.
Book was first written in Tamil and was translated into Sinhala and English. – WIRUMA
