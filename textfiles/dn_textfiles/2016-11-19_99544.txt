West Indies Cricket Board ‘can’t buy respect’-Darren Sammy

Former captain Darren Sammy has become embroiled in a row between Darren Bravo and the West Indies Cricket Board after the batsman was sent home from their tour of Zimbabwe.
The 32-year-old St Lucia all-rounder has not played for the West Indies since captaining the team to victory in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata in April but reacted on social media after news broke of Bravo’s punishment..

Sammy has his own issues with the WICB after his dismissal in the summer and wasted no time wading on Bravo’s behalf.
The Dhaka Dynamite star tweeted: ‘So apparently @dmbravo46 is being sent home for this tweet. All I’m going to say is you can’t buy respect from a mall.. Respect is earned. And Some ppl just don’t deserve the respect of others.
Bravo was replaced with Jason Mohammed after the former reacted on Twitter to an interview given by WICB chairman Dave Cameron.
Cameron said Bravo was downgraded to a Grade C contract due to his falling batting average, although the player refutes that he was ever on a top tier deal.
‘It is explicit that if your averages are not above a certain level it tells you what contracts you get. It is very, very explicit,’ Cameron told Caribbean television network SportsMax TV.
‘His averages in the last two years have been declining, so what do you do? Reward poor performance or do you encourage him to get better?’
Bravo responded with a tweet saying he had never been offered a Grade-A contract. ‘You hav been failing 4 d last 4yrs. Y don’t u resign and FYI I’ve neva been given an A contract. Big idiot @davec51,’ he tweeted.
Adding later on Instagram: ‘Say what you want I have nothing to prove. So go ahead and judge me,just make sure you are perfect for the rest of your life.’
A WICB release said Bravo had been ‘replaced due to inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour, which is contrary to his contractual obligations to the WICB’.
A clause in Bravo’s match/tour contract, the release said, ‘clearly states not to make any statement in or to any form of media (which shall include, without limitation, print media, television, radio, internet or any social networking media), or any other public statement, which would bring yourself, WICB or any official or authorised representative of WICB or the game of cricket into disrepute, and your agreement to use all such media in a responsible manner.’
