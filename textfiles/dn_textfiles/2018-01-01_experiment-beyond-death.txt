Experiment beyond death

As humans, curiosity is a part of our being. Throughout our lives, every one of us will find an urge to know what cannot be known, to discover what others have not yet found, and to realise the most impossible things before anyone else… One of the questions that we will often find at the back of our minds, without a solution, is ‘What happens after death?’
Today’s world, as with all other seemingly unresolvable problems, has come up with various theories to this question. Many believe that there is a next life and that there is a soul that passes on from this life to another, either to ‘heaven’ or ‘hell’.
And some believe that there is no life after death and that after death you simply cease to exist. Buddhism, however, has a completely different outlook on beings after death. As Buddhists we believe that there is an endless journey of birth and death known as ‘Sansara’.
We leave one life, and move on to the next depending on our ‘Kamma’- meaning the merits and demerits collected from either doing wholesome or unwholesome deeds.
The suttas in ‘What happens after death?’ clearly specify wise reasons as to why beings are born as they are and what happens as a result of previous acts. Let us take the very first sutta as an example- Balapanditasutta (The fool and the wise). In this sutta, we see how to characterise a fool and a wise person.
We see the severe consequences that a fool who has committed unwholesome deeds will suffer in hell, as well as the suffering he would face if he/she was born in the animal world, and how rare it would be for them to return to the human world.The book, ‘What happens after death?’ which is based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, provides much needed insight to a question that has befuddled us for many years, With the help of the Dhamma, may you all be able to realise the Four Noble Truths, and may this book- translated by Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera- help us right our wrongs and lead a virtuous life that brings happiness in this life and the life-after.
