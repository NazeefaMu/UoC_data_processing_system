Special worm species found inside body

A special worm species had been found inside the body of several residents in and around Dambulla. About 20 of them have so far undergone surgery to get them removed, doctors at the Dambulla Base Hospital said.
Two children had worms removed from their bodies on September 26, said Consultant Surgeon Dr. Ajith Arthanayake. He said the worms, which have a white hue, are about 3 to 5 inches long.
Most of the affected are children. Domestic pets maybe the source of these worms entering the human body. Mosquito bites too may introduce eggs into the human body which later develop into worms after gestation. He said sample worms had been sent to the Peradeniya University Research Library for examination and report.
