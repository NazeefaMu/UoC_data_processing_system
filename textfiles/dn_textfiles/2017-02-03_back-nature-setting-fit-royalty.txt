Back to nature  in a setting fit for royalty

Juliet Coombe discovers why Jetwing Kaduruketha Hotel is unique amongst the Jetwing Hotels chain as there are no TVs in the rooms and you are truly able to immerse yourself in a luxurious agro haven that is both naturally and historically fascinating.
At Kaduruketha you can immerse yourself in the experience without the distractions of the modern world and learn a great deal about living with nature and the local village peoples traditions.

You are also assigned a butler who is from the area and takes care of all your needs during your visit. In this way you can really build a rapport with them and get increasingly deeper insights into whatever your interests might be. I was fortunate enough to have Eranda as my butler, who spoke excellent English, knew a great deal about the hotel and the surrounding area, and was also a great singer, to boot, who treated me to a few impromptu numbers while he gave me the Agro-tour.
Well the Agro-tour is a must. It is nothing to do with getting pent up energy out of your system, though it might well help, rather it is about being at one with nature, through developing wisdom and understanding of the trees, the fauna, the plants and the people. There are 55 to 60 different trees growing in the hotel grounds of which 40 to 50 can be used for food and/or medicine while 5 to 10 for doing away with yourself or your deadliest enemy!
Eranda first takes me round the back of the hotel to see some of the most common vegetables grown for the daily restaurant menu in the garden nearest the kitchen. I’m treated to neat rows of capsicums, chilis, ladies fingers, brinjal (a purple courgette type vegetable sliced into many dishes), beans, drumsticks (no, not chicken legs but long beanlike brown pods), carrots, green beans, gotacola, lettuce, tampala (ornamental and spinach like vegetable for salads), and nivithi (spinach for dhal curry). As we then move onto the trees else where we pass a shiny black Asian forest scorpion trying to pass us unnoticed.
Less symmetrical beds
We move on back to the front of the hotel with its wonderful mountainous backdrop and I am shown less symmetrical beds of chillis, capsicums and drumsticks, all very enticing, the last of which are cooked with gravy and are good for joints and bone marrow. I glance over to a mango tree overlooking the field, currently being ploughed up by an old tractor for the next rice crop. I ask about the wooden makeshift ladder tied to a high branch, thinking it might be an aid for picking mangoes not in accordance with health and safety guidelines. “When the elephants come the farmers climb up the tree to launch firecrackers at them to keep them away,” Eranda tells me with a broad grin. I imagine how much fun that would be for a youngster but also wonder that it might not necessarily be so respectful of the sacred elephants! I remembered at Jetwing Vil Uyana they allowed the elephants to completely ransack the vegetable garden without so much as a whimper of regret for all those hours of grafting, only to have to reap croquet sized elephant dung balls in place of yams.
Nostalgic feelings
Looking across the field we see the tractor and plough being followed by about twenty worm-seeking Cattle Egrets, which make me nostalgic for my farming days, where normally it was seagulls but once I had 17 buzzards following my plough. Eranda brought me back from my reverie, to wax lyrical about the Tamarind tree, a very large specimen that yields toffee, fruit and vegetables for fish curry, chutney, and chicken between February and April. It seems that a lot of the fruits go through a stage when they can be picked as vegetables when green, with a very different taste, and then fruit if allowed to fully mature, such as with Jak and Papaya. In this tropical paradise there is always plenty on the menu when you have so many to choose from with differing harvest periods and cycles. The climate lends itself to harvesting all year round.
We also spot some Muniya birds perching in this tree, which look very pretty to me with their yellow breasts, black heads and tuneful songs but Eranda is quick to point out that they are a pest owing to eating the rice in large numbers. My innocent half smile turns into a fitting half grimace as I get one step closer to being a natural initiate of this prolific oasis. Eranda then points out the Forget-me-nots and tells me, with a glint in his eye, that the first tours were named after these pretty little blue flower clusters.
As we pass two superbly placed accommodation huts with views of the fields and hills behind, Eranda’s face lights up as we reach a 15 year old laden palm tree that stops us in our tracks. “Toddy!” he tells me. “And Jaggery!” I respond, remembering the delicious sweet treat that this unrefined sugar is, like a full dessert in itself. He then picks up a small branch and fashions it into a whip and explains, “We use it for hitting the wood to scare off snakes, like cobras, that might be sleeping here during the day; they are most dangerous when surprised i.e. woken suddenly from sleep.” We have come to a couple more wooden chalets with views to die for where Eranda whacks away at the timber with his new whip. Even when no one is in there, it is a good idea to keep the snakes away! Without warning, and probably after thinking about toddy and its ability to erase memories, Eranda waxes lyrical about his lost love and breaks into song. He tells me he is the singer for the local band then sings, with a beautiful sad and unselfconscious voice, a whole verse of the locally famous Thanivela (Only me), lamenting his lost greatest all time love. I tell him she can’t be worth it if she has ditched him as I have spent enough time with him as both a guide and child-minder to know he is a prize catch for some lucky lady.
Green unripe peppercorns
We then walk on to the ubiquitous black pepper groves, which consist of albicia trees with pepper vines growing profusely up their trunks. Eranda picks of a strip of green unripe peppercorns, passes me a few then munches on the rest. I try them too out of curiosity and am amazed at how strongly they taste and keep chomping to see if the heat dissipates with time; it gets worse of course but I persist as I remember how good pepper is at clearing out the system when you have a cold, in combination with lime juice, salt, honey and boiling water. Eranda, having got his woes off his chest with his first sad song, then breaks into a happier song for dancing called ‘Rajamalige’, and a song for mothers ‘Ameria’. This is just one of the added bonuses of having Eranda for a guide though I must confess I did not ask him to sing any special requests so leave that to his next lucky client.
I am treated to a host of other visual and learning delights including the Pawatta, used for reducing fevers and general strengthening of the body; Amarello for vegetable and fruit juices, and cooking in curry; Kohomba for face washes, soap and shampoo which we have a go at making; Nelli trees for fruit and medicine; a one hundred year old cashew tree, cinnamon and guavas.
So, whether you want to learn more about all the flora and fauna in Sri Lanka’s natural gardens of eden, want to know how to keep well or live fast and die young, like walking around the grounds of the most beautiful agro hotel in Sri Lanka or are happy to listen to a knowledgeable guide speak and sing local songs, the Agrotour is an absolute must with Eranda when visiting Jetwing Kaduruketha Hotel. Of course, there are many other great adventures to be had here, too and the reason so many people want to stay longer and return sooner.
