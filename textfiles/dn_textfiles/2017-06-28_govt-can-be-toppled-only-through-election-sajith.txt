Govt. can be toppled only through election: Sajith

Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said only 'hooniyama' that can topple a government is an election.
He was addressing a meeting after distributing dry rations to the flood affected at Walasmulla. He said state officials, private sector organisations, media channels, and philanthropists got together and reached out to the drought-stricken peole and provided them with relief, while those in the opposition went to Horowpathana to perform a 'hooniyama' to President Maithripala Surisena. The minister said dashing coconuts at devalayas by the opposition in the past brought landslides and floods and the people were the victims.
Minister Premadasa said the opposition politicians have to wait patiently about a couple of years if they are keen on toppling the government and form a new regime.
"The President and the Prime Minister are following far-sighted policies to develop the country, while the opposition engages in performing hooniyams," he said.
