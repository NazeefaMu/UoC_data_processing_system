Controversial voice clip
Govt. Analyst to submit report in three weeks

The Government Analyst’s Department said that it will release the report regarding the controversial voice clip believed to be of former TID Chief DIG Nalaka Silva and Anti-Corruption Movement Operations Director Namal Kumara, in three weeks.
The CID has obtained statements from DIG Ranmal Kodithuwakku, DIG Nilantha Jayawardena of the State Intelligence Service, and ASP Prasanna Alwis of the Divisional Crime Investigation Unit, Colombo, who are said to have been mentioned in the voice clip.
The voice clip allegedly contains details of a conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
DIG Nalaka Silva’s office was sealed by police officers of the CID on Sunday. According to senior officers at the Police headquarters, the CID seized two laptops from the former TID Chief's office.
The TID Chief was sent on compulsory leave pending the inquiry into the alleged assassination conspiracy.
The CID had already started an investigation into the mobile phone which it received from Namal Kumara, allegedly containing the controversial conversation.
However, court ordered the Government Analyst to investigate the voice clip recorded in the mobile phone.
According to the CID, DIG Nalaka Silva will be summoned to the CID to give a statement on the alleged assassination plot.
