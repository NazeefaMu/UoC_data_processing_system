Saudi extends visa overstay amnesty for Lankan migrant workers

The Saudi Government has issued travel documents to 4,500 Sri Lankan migrant workers overstaying visas in Saudi Arabia to return to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment yesterday said. The Saudi Government has extended its visa overstay amnesty programme for Sri Lankan workers until July 23, the Sri Lankan embassy in Riyadh said.
“We expect all Sri Lankan workers who overstay their visas, to take advantage of the amnesty offered by the Saudi Government, and return to Sri Lanka without facing legal consequences,” a Foreign Employment Ministry official said.
The amnesty was announced by the Saudi Government for overstaying migrant workers from March 21 to June 25. They have offered an extension until July 23.
“Those who take the advantage of the amnesty will get the chance come to Saudi Arabia with relevant documents,” Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Asmi Thasim said.
“ Those who do not take the offer and continue to stay in Saudi in violation of visas, will have to face legal action,” he said.
