Wave of the waters

In Indian classical music, numerous varieties of musical instruments are in use. Most of the musical instruments are made out of wood, metal, leather strings and bamboo. Different variety of strings and different thickness of strings are used for different string instruments. Among all the instruments Jalatharang is an exceptional and unique Indian musical instrument. Like Jaltharang, Kasht-tarang and Kanch Tarang are almost similar to Jaltharang. All these instruments are made out of glass or porcelain. This particular Jaltharang instrument is called by different names in different Indian regions. In North India, in the Hindi language, this particular instrument is called as Jaltarang, and in Urdu it is called Jal-tharang.
In South India, especially in Tamil Nadu, this instrument is called Jaltharangam.In Tamil “Jala” means water. The instrument which uses water as the main source, due to that it has got the name as Jaltharangam in Tamil. It brings out the sound of water waves.
Wave sound
Originally this instrument was practised and played in South East Asian region. Especially this was practised in Bali, Java and Myanmar. It originated from Gamelan orchestra in South East Asia. The Gamelan orchestra was an old traditional music of Balinese music. Gong of Gamelan was used with metal made tools, in different shapes for music. To bring out the sound, two thin bamboo sticks were used.
The instrument Jaltharang literally means water waves. This instrument is always used as the main instrument with two or three accompaniments. It is not used as an accompanying instrument like other wind, leather and string instruments. Normally it consists about eighteen different size porcelain bowls in the same shape but in different sizes. All the bowls are arranged in such a semi-circle manner in front of the Jaltharang player. The bowls are arranged in a half circle manner. Different size porcelain containers are arranged in a systematic manner (especially from big to small).In the left side of the Jaltharang player, bigger size bowls are kept and smaller size bowls are kept on the right side.
All the eighteen china bowls are filled with water in different levels. Earlier the total number of china bowls used for this instrumental music was more than the present era. Today the even total number of bowls used by the artists varies from one another. But today the maximum amount or the total number of bowls used for Jaltharang is not more than eighteen.
Some of these porcelain bowls are filled with water at rim level. The filled water porcelain bowls are played by the artist by holding two slender sticks with both hands. When the bowls are filled with more water, the pitch or the tone level would be low.
According to the pitch level, the water level of the bowls should be adjusted by the players (artistes). Many of times to adjust the pitch level of the Jaltharang, the player does numerous adjustments with the water level of the porcelain bowls. Excellent melodious tunes could be brought out or obtained when the bowls are stuck with sticks.
Slender sticks
Jaltharang is popularly used in Indian music, but practising this musical instrument is quite rare as compared to other musical instruments. This instrument is often used in South India with Mirdangam. In North Indian music even the gats of Sitar also could be beautifully played in this Jaltharang musical instrument. Many of times in North Indian music Jaltharang is accompanied with Tabla.
Many of times Jaltharang is used with some other string and air instruments when it is used with numerous other instruments ultimately the gentle melody of the Jaltharang is strongly affected.
Normally medium and fast tempos are well maintained by this instrument. In South Indian music the most outstanding artistes in Jalatharangam were Subbiar and Harihara Bhagavathar. Still, many more young artistes are learning and playing this instrument with great enthusiasm. All the excellent nuances of music are invariably brought out in this water based bowl instrument.
Outstanding artistes
Indian classical music both Carnatic and Hindustani are quite popular in Sri Lanka, but unfortunately, no Jaltharang musical instrumental artiste has entered yet in the Sri Lankan musical field.
Due to the penetration of western instrument key board, many of the traditional oriental instruments are slowly and slowly vanishing from the scene.
