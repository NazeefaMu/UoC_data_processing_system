Protecting Sri Lanka’s wetland ecosystems

A recent news story revealed that Colombo is literally drying up. Since the 1980s, the city has lost almost 60 percent of its wetland area. The news item would make anybody sad because Colombo was known in colonial times as the Garden City.
According to the authorities, for example, there are currently no wetlands left in Colombo from the extent between Beira Lake to the BMICH complex. Not long ago, there were enough of them! But they’ve been replaced with multi-storied homes and high rises, office complexes and shopping centres, roads and landfills.
This situation is not confined to Colombo city alone. The majority of the wetlands in Sri Lanka are facing the same threats that are posed by harmful human activities.Unplanned reclamation, clearing of vegetation, organic pollution or chemical effluents, sewage disposal, garbage disposal, poaching (for consumption), ornamental fish or plant trade are the major threats.
These threats endanger species living in wetlands. Without healthy wetlands, this species can be lost to us forever.
These species are not the only ones that need healthy wetlands. We as citizens also rely on wetlands to naturally improve our water’s quality and to store floodwater. The plants and natural bacteria found in a wetland can break up chemicals and make them less harmful to man and the environment. It then slowly releases the water back into the ground, allowing the water to replenish nearby aquifers and provide storage for floodwater.
Benefits
Wetlands, therefore, are incredibly valuable and productive ecosystems. Their functions benefit society in a number of ways. Flood control is one important function. Without a healthy wetland, flood water may not have a place to go, and could be forced to rush the excess water into nearby lakes and rivers.
Fish and wildlife habitat and shoreline erosion protection are two other functions.
In addition to these functions, wetlands, and the ecological diversity they provide, add beauty to any landscape and ideal for casual walks and relaxation Many individuals and organisations are also interested in wetland recreation activities such as wildlife watching.
Categories
Three general categories of wetlands are recognized in Sri Lanka: inland natural fresh water wetlands, salt water wetlands and man-made wetlands. Our fresh water wetlands include 103 river systems (covering more than 4500 km), the numerous lakes, marshes etc.
The salt water wetlands are located along the coastal belt with the exception of Wilpattu. The man-made water bodies referred to as “wewas” and it is said that Sri Lanka probably has the highest number of man-made water bodies in the world with an estimated total of more than 10,000 wewas countrywide. Both natural and man-made wetlands comprise about 15 per cent of the land area.
Wetland losses
Wetlands in Sri Lanka, as elsewhere are increasingly facing several anthropogenic pressures. The rapidly expanding urban population, large scale changes in land use/landcover, burgeoning development projects and improper use of watersheds have all caused a substantial decline of wetland resources of the country. Significant losses have resulted due to the threats from industrial, agricultural and various urban developments. These have led to hydrological disturbances, pollution and their effects.
The wetland loss can be divided into two broad groups namely acute and chronic losses. The filling up of wet areas with soil constitutes acute loss whereas the gradual elimination of forest cover with subsequent erosion and sedimentation of the wetlands over many decades is termed as chronic loss. Both types of losses are evident in Sri Lanka.
Since 77 percent of Sri Lanka’s population is rural and most of these people are resource dependent, these continuing losses can lead to predictable serious consequences in rural lifestyles.Healthy wetlands are essential in rural Sri Lanka for sustainable food production and potable water availability for people and livestock.
On the other hand, they are also necessary for the continued existence of our diverse populations of wildlife and plant species. We should remember that a large number of endemic species are wetland dependent.
Wetland loss is a long one-way street. Restoration of the converted wetlands is very difficult once these sites are occupied for non-wetland uses. Hence, the demand for wetland products (e.g., water, fish, wood, fibre, medicinal plants etc.) will increase with increase in population.
Coastal wetlands
When we study our coastal wetlands, it becomes clear that human activities have significantly altered coastal and marine habitat over the past few decades. This degradation and loss of habitat has significant economic and social consequences. For example, habitat degradation and loss has reduced the size and diversity of fish populations, which in turn has decreased opportunities for commercial and recreational fisheries. Human population who illegally live near the coasts, increase the pressures on coastal and marine habitat.
Many coastal wetlands have been identified as “Essential Fish Habitat,” indicating an increased urgency and value in protecting these areas. Using extensive scientific and management expertise, the Government authorities should take steps to avoid, minimize, and compensate for the adverse effects of dredging, fill, and other actions that threaten healthy coastal wetlands.
National wetland policy
In 2004, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources prepared the National Wetland Policy identifying six objectives: to protect and conserve wetland ecosystems, to prevent illegal utilization of wetlands, to restore and maintain the biological diversity and productivity of wetlands, to enhance ecosystem services from wetlands habitats, to assure sustainable use of wetlands and traditional practices by local communities; and to meet national commitments as a signatory to the Ramsar Convention.
It is time for the authorities to sit back and review the performance during the past 14 years – what went wrong and what was done successfully. They should decide whether tougher regulations and better enforcement will be needed to protect the wetlands in the face of increasing threats like infilling and pollution.
The authorities should also analyse the effectiveness of local government authorities’ management in wetlands and whether policy plan tools proved effective.
Different approach
The global experiences tell us that the transition to the ecosystem management approach needs a well-defined integrated decision-making approach. In this process, engagement with local people is critical.
The authorities should also consider the development of new higher supra-local government joint-management organisms such as Regional Action Plans, Special Plans of Conservation, and Public Consultation Forum etc.
Such organisms will be able to coordinate the responsible state and local authorities, develop an integral management of the wetland areas and involve stakeholders in the active management of these areas.
The participation of local people, both in the Public Consultation Forum and in joint management organisms, is a key factor to get them involved in management decisions. In addition, media-assisted knowledge dissemination activities can help people understand the values and benefits they obtain from water and wetlands.
On the brighter side, several government and non-profit agencies are working together presently to protect our wetlands from further destruction. Together, these organizations and the concerned citizens can make a difference in the future of our wetlands. As wetlands contribute to citizens’ health, economy, quality of life and the well-being of the natural environment, all of us as citizens should play our part in protecting them.
