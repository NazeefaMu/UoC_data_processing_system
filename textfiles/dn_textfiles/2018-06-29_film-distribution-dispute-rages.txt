Film distribution dispute rages on

National Film Corporation Chairman Sithendra Senaratne said recently that the distribution of films, which was handled by four private companies, would come under the purview of the National Film Corporation. This rule is for both local as well as foreign films.
"President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a committee to look into the problems of the cinema sector and to identify issues and to recommend suitable remedies. 45 experts who are involved in the field worked on the report. It was submitted to the President recently," Senaratne noted on how the decision has come about.
He noted that a series of meetings with all the stakeholders of the cinema industry, the new line Ministry, the Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Ministries have resulted in the decision that remedies need to be found for the identified issues.
“We also held meetings with film directors, producers, cinema owners and the associations of exhibitors. The decision is a result of certain distribution companies which were not doing their job properly," Senaratne stressed adding that this will result on a fair system which will safeguard the interest of the producers, directors and the cinema halls.
Letters informing about the decision had been sent immediately to the private distribution companies. As a result of this the EAP, MPI, LFD and CEL film distribution circuits held a press conference to express their views regarding the matter. “The NFC should at least have the courtesy to give us sufficient notice about their decision. Throughout these years they have not expressed any satisfaction towards how the circuits have been functioning. Such actions will result in the death knell in the Sinhala cinema industry,” Sunil Siriwardhana said.
He also added that the private circuits have been contributing immensely to enhance the local film scene. They had funded films, built cinemas and renovated film halls. They have also managed to bring globally acclaimed films from Hollywood, Bollywood and Tollywood to local cinemas.
EAP Executive Director Kasun Jayawardhane added that NFC has overlooked several recommendations given by the committee to enhance its own role. Instead they had taken on the task of acquiring distribution rights which have not been mentioned in the report.
MPI Managing Director Sunil T Fernando stated that this move had been made to screen 80 low quality films that have been rejected by the circuits. MPI Joint Managing Director Arjun Kamalanath also added his bit by noting that government bodies never interfere in distributing films but only act as supervisors in countries abroad.
He also voiced his doubts whether NFC will be able to carry on this task properly considering its level of inefficiency.
It was anonymously decided to form a new industry association compromising key people from three sectors - private film distributors, film exhibitors and film producers - to address the key issues of the film industry as a joint forum.
Accordingly, a new forum namely 'Lanka United Film Producers, Distributers and Exhibitors Association (LUFPD&EA)' was formed. The office bearers are the following prominent figures from the local film industry:
Senior Advisor - Sunil Siriwardhana (LFD Film Circuit and Film Exhibitor)
Joint Presidents - Sunil T. Fernando (MPI Film Circuit, Film Producer and Film Exhibitor) and Kasun Jayawardhane (EAP Film Circuit)
Convener - Arjun Kamalanath (MPI Film Circuit, Film Producer and Film Exhibitor)
Secretary - K. Wimaladasa (MPI Film Circuit)
Deputy Secretary - Dr. Arosha Fernando (MPI Film Circuit, Film Producer and Exhibitor)
Treasurer - G. R. Pathmaraj (CEL Film Circuit and Film Exhibitor)
The following 12 key stakeholders of the industry has been selected and appointed as the committee who represents the private film distributors, film exhibitors and film producers - Imitiaz Cader, Devapriya Abeysinghe, H. M. Hair Haren, Ananda Peiris, Gamini Ehaliyagoda, Rohan Pinnaduwa, R Sadesh Kumar, Aravinda Weerakoon, Sunil Premaratne, L Sankunaraja, Sunil Dharmasiri and Keerthi Weerasinghe.
The newly formed association is expecting to meet up with President Maithripala Sirisena, subject Minister Wijedasa Rajapakse (Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs) and the Chairman of the National Film Corporation (NFC) to discuss the way forward and key issues highlighted in the meeting.
A letter has also been signed by all the participants to be handed over to the President and the Minister highlighting consequences to the film industry due to the recent decision made by the National Film Corporation without consulting any film industry experts.
