Standard Chartered launches My Dream Account for kids

Standard Chartered revolutionised the children’s savings account market launching their latest proposition for kids less than 18 years under the title “My Dream Account”.
The fresh proposition was announced amidst a gathering of key priority clients where the focus was on the kids. A total of ten skills booths were set up to encourage children to interact and learn about these talents, which could lead to later professions someday.
With the My Dream Account, children are offered higher interest rates for each saving bracket.
In order to encourage the habit of saving, each My Dream Account holder will be offered cash gifts vouchers from key merchants according to their age and account balance.
To make things even more interesting, each child who opens an account will be the proud recipient of a gift pack containing, a bag, water bottle, ball and key tag from the co-branded Liverpool FC merchandise. This will be offered while stocks last.
This card gives them selected benefits from key outlets such as Kiddies and Toys International (Farlin Store, Cool Kidz, Farlin Store Ninewells andIconic Baby), Nastars, Lumala, KidzHub, VijithaYapa, Calorie Counter and Kids Art Club.
“We want kids to know they can achieve their dreams and believe that they have the ability to be anything they wish, be it a film director, a sports figure, a chef or even a photographer. We are confident the first step towards that is a healthy habit of saving. It is with this in mind that we have introduced innovative saving interests and saving brackets along with excellent rewards based on their account balance.”
Said Bingumal Thewarathanthri, Country Head of Retail Banking, Standard Chartered Sri Lanka.
