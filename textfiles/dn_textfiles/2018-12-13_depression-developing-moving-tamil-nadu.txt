Depression developing, moving to Tamil Nadu

The low pressure area in the South Bay of Bengal to the southeast of Sri Lanka is likely to develop into a depression during the next 24 hours and to move north–northwestwards, towards the Tamil-Nadu coast on Saturday (15).
The Naval and fishing communities are cautioned to be vigilant in this regard.
Mainly fair weather can be expected over the most parts of the island.
However, showers or thundershowers can be expected in several places in the Eastern Province in the evening or night.
Fairly strong gusty winds at times up to 40 kmph and fairly cold weather can be expected over the island.
There is high possibility of heavy rainfall and rough seas associated with the sudden increase of wind speed (up to 70-80 kmph) off the coast from Hambantota to Kankasanturai via Pottuvil, Batticaloa and Trincomalee.
Fishermen are advised not to venture into the deep sea areas off the coastline in these areas until December 15.
Showers or thundershowers will occur at several places in the sea area extending from Hambantota to Trincomalee via Pottuvil in the next 24 hours.
Heavy showers can be expected at some places in the deep sea areas. Winds will be northeasterly in the sea areas around the island and wind speed will be 30–40 kmph.
The sea areas to the east of the island can be rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 50–60 kmph and the sea areas to the west of the island can be fairly rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 50 kmph.
Temporary strong gusty winds and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.
