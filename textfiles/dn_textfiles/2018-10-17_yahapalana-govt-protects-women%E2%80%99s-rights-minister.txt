Yahapalana govt protects women’s rights - Minister

One of the main aims of the yahapalana government is to protect the women’s rights and give them a place in society, Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorale said.
No other government has done so much for women in the country. We have increased women’s representation in the political sphere and made 25 percent representation mandatory in local polls, the Minister said.
She was speaking at a ceremony to appoint 75 women from across the country as Justices of the Peace (JPs) organised by the Eksath Lak Vanitha Peramuna (women’s wing of the UNP).
Empowering women is very important in the country’s forward march. Women who take the lead in household matters are well positioned to take leadership at village and national level, the Minister said.
“I have been appointed as the first female member of the Constitutional Council and it was a great victory for the entire community of women in the country,” she said.
The post of Justice of the Peace is an honorary title and these appointees should function in the interest of the public. The Justice Ministry can abolish these posts if they misuse the post and if they have behaved unethically, she said.
Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe always says it is important to empower women to get their maximum contribution to boost the economy. It has been proved that women’s contribution in decision-making bodies at all levels, especially at the community level, is more efficient and effective. “We need to empower women and a special programme has already been initiated to uplift the living standards of women,” he said.
Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said the role of women has evolved over time moving from the primary role of a woman as a wife, a mother and a keeper of the household to a more challenging and demanding role, which involves active engagement and contribution towards her family’s financial and social wellbeing. Given this background, empowering women and uplifting their living standards are key areas of concern for the government.
Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister Dr. Anoma Gamage said it has been proved that corruption and misappropriation have gone down and the efficiency has increased in places governed by women.
