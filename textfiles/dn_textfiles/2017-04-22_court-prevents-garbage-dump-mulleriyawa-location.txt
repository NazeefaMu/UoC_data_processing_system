Court prevents garbage dump at Mulleriyawa location

Colombo Additional Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday issued an injunction order preventing the Kotikawatta Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha from dumping garbage on a land beside Somadevi Balika Vidyalaya in Kotikawatta.
The Court made this order pursuant to a complaint lodged by several area residents alleging that the disposal of garbage by Kotikawatta Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha at the location, caused severe inconveniences to both schoolchildren and area residents.
They further complained that the Kotikawatta Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha had dumped garbage on the land without following any legal procedure.
