Postal employees asked to report to nearest PS office

The Post Master General yesterday requested employees of the Postal Department on strike to report to the nearest office of Postal Superintendent (PS) if they are unable to report to their designated office, Post Master General D.P.R. Abeyratne said in a press release yesterday.
He said the Deputy Post Master Generals and the Divisional Superintendents of Posts have been directed to provide all facilities to such employees of the department. The Department has arrived at this decision after taking into consideration a number of reports of harassment to postal employees who continue to report for duty from various parts of the country.
The statement said a public service has been disrupted with the ongoing strike, and the leave of all postal employees have been cancelled to provide continued service to the public.
