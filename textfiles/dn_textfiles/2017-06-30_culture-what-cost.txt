Culture, at what cost?

A former senior Central Bank official has made an interesting observation that should engage the attention of not just our politicians but also those clinging to hidebound tradition and nationalist sentiment. Addressing an event the other day the ex-official said Sri Lanka has to wriggle itself out of its present fixation on culture and nationalist obsession if it is to forge ahead on the development front and integrate with the modern world. “A deeper evaluation of the current situation revealed that the biggest reason why Sri Lanka is lagging behind is a need to change our cultural mindset to be more modern and hardworking, to think how education is delivered and to leapfrog four cycles of the industrial revolution in order to become relevant”, the former Central Bank official stressed. He highlighted the example of Singapore’s forward-thinking mindset that allowed a small state to become a global economic powerhouse.
Like the former CB official noted, our national culture, sometime, have proved to be the bane of progressive thinking and sometimes THE single factor that has placed obstacles in the path to development. A country like Sri Lanka cannot afford the luxury of living on past laurels if we are to forge ahead in this modern era. Today, culture and politics have proved to be a heady mix for those bent on obstructing development plans that are beneficial to the country. For example, all protests and agitations we see today, and even in the past, more often than not, have had their genesis in culture or national pride. It is on this basis that we hear some politicians and Bikkhus shouting hoarse against the government with the allegation that it is disposing of national assets. These elements well know that the majority Sri Lankans have long been conditioned to give pride of place to culture and take pride in their nationalism. Hence they (the majority community) are ripe to be exploited, given this mindset, for cheap political gain and to the great detriment of the country in the current context. The recent protests seen in Hambantota against the port project and others of its kind are no doubt driven by this obsession with culture and the preservation of the status quo.
Sri Lankans are due for an awakening. While our national culture and identity no doubt should be preserved and protected, this alone should not be our obsession. Sri Lanka cannot survive on its own. We don't have oil, gold mines and the type of natural resources that would make us self sustainable. The country needs to engage with the outside world and, what is more, we need foreign assistance if we are to move forward with the rest of the world. Sri Lanka cannot live a frog in the well existence merely because we need to protect our culture and national values. One recalls how a band of Buddhist monks stormed a cricket ground in Colombo where an international tournament was to be held demanding that the “dancing girls” we are accustomed to seeing in other countries at cricket matches, be dispensed with, since this impinged on our cultural values .The organisers had no option but to substitute the glamour girls with our own Kandyan dancers. Needless to say, this took away the gloss off the tournament which invariable died a natural death.
This incident, no doubt, mirrors what is today taking place in the country in the name of culture and national pride where all that is alien to us is shunned, bringing with it dire economic consequences. It is also in this light that the present public/private partnership agreements that are to be entered into by the government to defray debt repayment are being viewed by the public, influenced by bankrupt political elements.
Now that a much respect professional banker has hit the nail on the head, so to speak, as to what is holding back the country from forging ahead, it is incumbent on all politicians to act with circumspection for the progress of the country. The country should move away from the past and accept the hard realities. It is this very obsession with culture and nationalist mindset that made the country stagnant even after seven decades of independence while India which too boasts of a rich civilisation has forged ahead unfettered by cultural restrictions.
The Yahapalanaya government, should, therefore, while dedicating itself to preserve and protect Sri Lanka's culture and national outlook should divest itself of all hangovers when it comes to making Sri Lanka a modern state ala a Singapore. It is the SLFP element in the Yahapalanaya government which had all along accorded pride of place to national culture and represented the voice of the majority in this regard. It is hoped that its alliance with the more business oriented UNP would lead to a change in mindset to jointly take the country on the path of development and progress and the creation of a modern Sri Lanka.
