Govt. must release imprisoned Army intelligence officials - Ven.Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera

Bodu Bala Sena Organization's General Secretary Ven.Galagodaththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday said that the government should take prompt action to release the Army intelligence officials who have been imprisoned.
"These Army intelligence officials who have been imprisoned should be released forthwith as the government has taken measures to release those who were allegedly involved in terrorist atrocities," the Thera said.
"It is the duty of the government to release Army intelligence officials who rendered an invaluable service to the country in ending the 30 year terrorist conflict,"the Thera said.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera warned the government that Sri Lanka will have to face an ISIS attack as the incumbent government has paid less attention on intelligence service.
As predicted by us earlier, a Sri Lankan Muslim from Galewela was killed while allegedly fighting for the ISIS in Syria recently," the Thera said.
"The previous government was more concerned about national security than the present rulers," the Thera stressed.
