Kohli back to lead India for South Africa ODI series

MUMBAI, Saturday - Virat Kohli returns to the limited-overs side to lead India while pacers Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami were included in the 17-man one-day international squad for the six-game series against South Africa in February.
Kohli was rested for the three-match Twenty20 series against Sri Lanka, which India lead 2-0 with Rohit Sharma in charge. Middle-order batsman Kedar Jadhav was also included in the team after recovering from a hamstring injury.
India play three test matches in January before the ODI series begins and will end their tour of South Africa with three T20 internationals.
