‘Three-wheeler drivers influence society considerably’

Today, the three-wheeler drivers’ profession is one that can make a considerable influence on society. At present there are about 1.5 million people engaged in this profession. If you take this as an industry, there are around 4 million people who are direct contributors to it, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He made these observations at the All-Island Federation of Professional Three-wheeler Service Providers held at the Colombo Public Library auditorium. Here, attention was drawn in regulating three-wheeler drivers by issuing identity cards and registering three-wheeler drivers in relevant districts.
"We should protect this mode of transport which is closed to the hearts of the middle-class community. Because of the faults of few, the entire field is being ostracized. However, that is far from the truth. As a government, it is our duty to safe guard this industry. These three-wheelers provide a huge service in the rural areas," he added.
"Today, in all parts of the country, including the poorer districts, there are a large number of three-wheelers. They not only transport passengers, they also transport goods. Because of this, we have to protect this industry which is wide spread all over Sri Lanka. We have to take into consideration, the safety of the clients who use the services of these three-wheelers. As a government, we have to ensure the safety of both parties," the minister said.
Minister Musthapha said, "It is wrong to think that the children of three-wheeler drivers should continue their fathers' footsteps. All fields of employments in this society are open to their children. Similarly, I would like to request something form you all. That is to follow the rules of the road. I am requesting you all to establish a disciplined industry."
