CB Governor requests IGP to probe criminal liability of Treasury Bonds auction

Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy has made a complaint to the IGP asking to probe the criminal liability of the Treasury Bonds auction on February 27, 2015, Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva said.
Speaking at the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday on the COPE report on CB Treasury Bonds investigation, the Deputy Minister said the Attorney General has already instructed the CID to expedite the probe into this complaint.
He further said the AG has had a discussion with the CB Governor on the COPE report.
“MP Namal Rajapaksa challenged the Government to arrest Arjun Aloysius in connection to this issue. The Governor in fact made the Police complaint asking to arrest whoever responsible if there had been a crime. The CB has also sought the AG’s advice over the possibility of filing a civil case to recover certain amount of money. The monetary board led by the CB Governor has taken steps to take the profits of Perpetual Treasuries back to the State if proven guilty at a civil case” the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister also pointed out that it was him who was first vocal about the misuse of EPF money and the conduct of Perpetual Treasuries when he was an Opposition MP. “However nobody took notice then. No action was taken. It was under this good governance rule a fair inquiry was possible and this was our achievement” he said.
Referring to a World Bank letter sent as a reply to an inquiry by the Sri Lankan Government on the bond auction, the Deputy ,inister pointed out the WB had stated the potential loss could not be accurately calculated in the case of the past bond auction. “In our view, that counterfactual cannot be accurately calculated on an ex post basis as it depends on the market conditions on the auction date” the Deputy Minister quoted the WB letter.
