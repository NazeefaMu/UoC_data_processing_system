Celebrating your Intimate Self

Barnard in Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' was lucky. The password he had to remember was so simple. All he had to say was "Long Live the King", and he was through. So, too, Ali Baba of the 'Arabian Nights'. The password he overheard, and uses to open the cave of treasure, (later used in Popeye, and Bugs Bunny as well) had only two words: Open Sesame.
Things are not that easy anymore. If you are like most of us living on planet earth today, you would have been annoyed by passwords at some point in your digital existence. Especially if you have got dozens to remember - some of them unbelievably complex - and on any given day, as you read e-mails, write on your Facebook wall, and check your bank balance online, you are bound to forget one, or at least mistype it. You may even be one of those unfortunate people whose accounts have been hacked, all because the strength of your password was too weak.
Yet, until as recent as the last century most of us had zero passwords, and those of us who did have one were either spies, or simply Enid Blyton's Secret Seven fans, who pretended to imitate their adventures and was in awe of gang leader Peter, the creator and keeper of the passwords that would help us gain entrance to the secret meetings in the shed at the bottom of the garden.
We have outgrown those childish games today, and alas, we don't have guys like Peter in our adult lives who would help us create the perfect string of characters that would keep all our secrets as safe as though they were in a secret vault in a Swiss Bank.
When I said this to Joel Stein, journalist at Time magazine, USA, he said, "I figured out how to beat the password system of memorizing impossible letter, number and capital letter combinations: Every time I go to a website I type in, "I forgot my password."
This may work for Stein, but not for some of us who simply haven't got the time to answer the numerous questions that follow this confession. (What is your grandmother's name? Who was your best friend at school? What is your favorite food, etc).Why all this hype about strong passwords, though? Won't any password do? Apparently not. When I wrote to Larry Magid, technology journalist and Co-Director of ConnectSafely.org, asking him this question he said, it is important that we create strong passwords because, "A strong password is your first line of defense against intruders and impostors." The best way to do this, he advised, is "to Make the password at least 8 characters long. The longer the better. Longer passwords are harder for thieves to crack."
He also warned against sharing your passwords. "You should never give your password to another. Not even to your friends, even if they are really good friends. A friend can - maybe even accidentally - pass your password along to others or even become an ex-friend and abuse it."
The final word, when it came to making strong passwords, according to Magid, is that, "it is best to create passwords that are easy to remember but hard for others to guess. "
Now comes the surprise. Strange though this may seem, our passwords once created, can be the window to our soul. Sure, they are universally despised. They annoy us no end with the strain they make on our memory, with the endless demand to update them, and with their sheer number. But cheer up! There is more to passwords than their annoyance.
According to Rumsey Taylor and Josh Williams in their article "The Secret Life of Passwords" in the New York Times, when we create a password knowing that, we and, only we will remember it, we give our password a secret life of its own.
"Many of our passwords are suffused with pathos, mischief, sometimes even poetry. Often they have rich back stories. A motivational mantra, a swipe at the boss, a hidden shrine to a lost love, an inside joke with ourselves, a defining emotional scar..," says Taylor. "They derive from anything: Scripture, horoscopes, nicknames, lyrics, book passages. Like a tattoo on a private part of the body, they tend to be intimate, compact and expressive."
And playful, too. During his research, Taylor found that there were some people who used "incorrect" in their passwords, so that when they forgot it, the software automatically prompted them with the right one ("your password is incorrect").
Others were more serious. Like Mauricio Estrella who says he used passwords to overcome difficult situations in his life (in his article, "How a Password Changed my Life," ). To help get over his anger at his ex-wife soon after their divorce, he reset his password to "[email protected]" "It worked," he says, and soon after, because his office computer demanded that he change his password every 30 days, he moved on to other goals: "[email protected]" (successful, he wrote); "[email protected]" (successful); "[email protected]" ("it never worked, I'm still fat"); "[email protected]" ("it worked," he said, "I've started talking with my mom every week now").
Yet, in computer scientist Joseph Bonneau's view what is important is not the meaning or personal ambitions or values of passwords but their security. Worried about the fate of privacy as so much of life moves on line, he said to Taylor, "humans really are the weak link when it comes to data security."
But, luckily, precisely what made passwords so flawed is also what Bonneau said he found uplifting. "People take a nonnatural requirement imposed on them, like memorizing a password," he said, "and make it a meaningful human experience." Meaningful as well as affectionate, no doubt, for some of us. I know a friend who uses her late father's initials in her password because each time she types the letters she feels close to him, and I confess for three months after I lost my aunt I used her name as one of my passwords.
It was Andy Miah, a professor of science communication and digital media at the University of Salford in England, however, who said it best. Personalized passwords, he suggested, ritualize a daily encounter with personal memories that often have no place else to be recalled. We engage with them more frequently and more actively than we do, say, with the framed photo on our desk. "You lose that ritual," Miah said, "you lose an intimacy with yourself."
So, hold on to those secret strings of characters,that form an integral part of your existence these days. They will not only save your life but change it too.
Let me end with, "14344password!" Count the letters in each word to get what I mean. Got it? Yes, I meant, "I Love You Very Much Password."
