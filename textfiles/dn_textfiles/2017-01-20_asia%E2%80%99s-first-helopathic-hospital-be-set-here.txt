Asia’s first Helopathic Hospital to be set up here

Rs 200 mn hospital to treat spinal disorders
 Asia’s first Helopathic Hospital will be set up in Sri Lanka by Prof. Sagara Karunathilaka in association with part funding from the United Kingdom.
Helopathic treatment is a new form of medical science founded by Prof.Steve Russel, (grandchild of scientist Bertrand Russel) to treat spinal disorders without surgery.
Prof Karunathilaka who already operates Natural Back Ache Treatment Centre to treat spinal disorders in Malambe said that they will invest around Rs.200 million for this hospital. “It will have 40 beds and initially six doctors from the United Kingdom will be stationed on a
fulltime basis.”
“These doctors will also train local doctors in this new area of medical science before they phase out back to London.”
Prof Karunathilaka who was based in London for over 15 years studying and treating patients at the Natural Health Practice and Teaching Clinic in England, (their sister company) said that they will also set up a doctor cum nurse training school at the same proposed premises. “Our target is to train around 200 doctors (as Dr of Helopathy) and nurses each year. The Britannia University in London is ready to offer the examination and international certification for all passing out doctors where they could practice anywhere in the world.”
He said that his aim is to attract foreign medical students and youth to study in this institution and bring in foreign exchange. “I am also planning to set up a 20 room hotel and six mini dormitories to provide accommodation for foreign students as well as families of parties who would use the hospital.”
Prof Karunathilaka said that a unique feature of Helopathic treatment is that a patient is healed without surgery, injections or even drugs. “We study the X-ray and MRI reports of patients with spinal disorders and other ailments and treat them with form of massage and innovative methods with no side effects.”
However he lamented that he presented this project proposal to top brass of the government seeking a suitable 25 acre land on a long term lease in Western Province one year ago but still there is no positive response. “If I don’t get the land by mid this year, I will take this operation to either Singapore or Dubai”. 
He said that soon after the war he came back to Sri Lanka and set up Osteo Clinic in Malambe investing around Rs. 100 million. “Soon the number of patients increased and he also expanded.”
I then rebranded my hospital as Natural Back Ache Treatment Centre in 2015 and increase the bed capacity as well and recruited more staff. “Using non-surgical techniques applied over a short period of time, we cure patients who have suffered for years from back problems and related ailments.”
“I offer to improve patients’ general mobility and health by treating changes to the vertebrae, backache, muscular pains, aching hips and sciatica, along with other aches and pains. These health treatments apply to the whole body and to the functioning of the internal organs by affecting the spine and its natural outflow.”
“My expertise in the treatment of back problems comes from many years’ experience, with thousands of patients from all over the world successfully treated in Colombo South Government Hospital (Acupuncture foundation), and both my Natural (Nila) Therapy Hospital in Panadura and Natural Therapy Centre in Galle in Sri Lanka. Patients have been very willing to give testimonials of successful recoveries.”
The hospital was successfully able to treat lot of patients suffering from spine related prolong disorders and to cure them with short time during the recent past with use of Osteopathy and Healingpathy treatments which has no side effects at all and thereby able to relief the patients and their siblings from prolong suffering in their lives.
Prof Karunathilaka is a practitioner and the founder of Osteo-Healingpathy, the world class natural medical treatment.
He has been awarded the prestigious award, The Knight Commander of the Commonwealth, nominated by the Weston Reserve University, for founding “Osteo-Healingpathy Healing Science”, for his unique treatment methods serving mankind.
Healingpathy has also been nominated for a Queen’s Award for voluntary service 2006.
He has been awarded a Citation in Natural Health and Spiritual Science by the Weston Reserve University – 2007.
The specialty in this unique healing method is no side effects; no oral medicine is given and need no operational approaches, but only an external correction.
