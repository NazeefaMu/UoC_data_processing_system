Disney is recruiting new princes and princesses!

If you love your Disney prince and princesses, then this news is just for you!
Disney have just announced they’re recruiting for the roles of Princes and Princesses. According to their advertisement, they are looking for “enthusiastic and energetic people to animate the famous Disney characters.”
For those out there who have grown up dreaming to be Prince Charming from Snow White or Beauty and the Beast’s Belle, this is the chance to realise your dreams.
However, there are a few things one needs to know, before you slam that resignation on your bosses desk, this job involves packing up and moving to Disneyland Paris in France, according to Glasgow Live.
The job ad, which has been published in a French newspaper, reads, “We are looking for enthusiastic and energetic people to animate the famous Disney characters. If you have a good level of dance, you can participate in our parade and our cavalcades!”
It goes on to add, “We are also looking for people who look like our famous Princesses and Princes to meet our visitors on a daily basis. A good level of dance and distinctive criteria of resemblance are required.”
And, much like every theme park out there, you need to be a certain height to be considered - between 137 cm and 193 cm tall (that’s 4 foot 5 and 6 foot 3). Daily Mail
