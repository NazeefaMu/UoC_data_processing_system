The renovated science laboratory of the Lelwala Kanishta Vidyalaya in the Beddegama education zone was opened, recently.
The laboratory was renovated by the first-year undergraduates of the Management and Finance Faculty of the Colombo University under their community development project, ‘Denumen Piripun Deyak Thanannata’ at a cost of Rs. 250,000. In addition to the donations received, they sold stickers and pens while conducting food stalls at the university premises to raise funds for the project. P.K Disna Darshani led the project with the support of schoolchildren and their parents. About 145 students study under 27 teachers at the school.
Lecturers Rajistha De Alwis, Chandana Wijekoon, Cheethani Deegodaarchchi, Principal K. G Priyantha, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation Executive Officer Sudarshi Madanayaka and Science Teacher Ramya Rathnayake were present at the event.
