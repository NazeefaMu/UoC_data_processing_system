Six students hospitalised after having Castor seeds

Six students attached to the Grade 2 class in a school in Mailewa Galgamuwa, were admitted to Galgamuwa hospital and transferred to Kurunegala hospital with vomiting after mistakenly eating Castor seeds.
Investigations revealed the class teacher had instructed students to bring some sort of seeds to learn counting during the arithmetic class. One of the students had responded by bringing some Castor seeds. The students had eaten the seeds due to curiosity and fallen ill. Hospital sources said the student were out of danger.
