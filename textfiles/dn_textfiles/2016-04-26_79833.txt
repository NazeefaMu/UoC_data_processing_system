Younis Khan escapes ban

Karachi,Monday: Senior Pakistan batsman and former national captain Younis Khan on Monday escaped a three-match ban after apologising for a row with umpires in a domestic one-day tournament.
Younis, 38, was fined 50 percent of his match fee and faced a ban for not attending the disciplinary hearing and withdrawing from the tournament. He apologised for his behaviour in a call with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan. A PCB news release confirmed the phone call and apology.
Younis was angry at several umpiring decisions in his team's two matches, but denied misbehaving towards the umpires. AFP
