When Rights do us wrong Pratap Bhanu Mehta

The inclusion of socio-economic rights in the Constitution does not directly lead to improved living conditions for the poor and better overall governance. Furthermore, guaranteeing these rights would transfer powers from the legislature to the judiciary, bypassing the democratic process, said Chief Executive of New Delhi’s Centre for Policy Research and expert in Constitutional Law Professor Pratap Bhanu Mehta.
Speaking at a public forum organized by the Advocata Institute last week, Mehta argued that the drive to Constitutionalise socio-economic rights would not solve governance problems that many nations face as Constitutionalisation has not proved more effective than the traditional process of representative politics.
This comes as Sri Lankan legislators mull drafts of the new Constitution at a time when there is significant international momentum to include socio-economic rights in constitutions, as evidenced by Brazil and South Africa’s extensive protection of these rights.
But according to Mehta, the drive to constitutionalise socio-economic rights is both desperate and misguided. He mentioned that many of the countries that had guaranteed these rights had a history of political failure and that by guaranteeing socio-economic rights, they seek to correct these breakdowns in government.
“We have a fascination for constitutionalizsng socio-economic rights because we think in the absence of making them justiciable constitutional rights, our legislators, ministers and members of parliament will not actually create conditions for their realization,” Mehta said.
Distrust of the political process, for Mehta, is a driving force for increasing the scope of rights protections in Constitutions throughout the international political landscape. People believe that judges would give decisions that would improve their quality of life more than legislators.
But this idea is erroneous since most governments lack institutional know how to deliver these rights.
“The paradox is that if you were in a country where the legislators did not give you these things as part of the normal give and take of representative politics, it is highly unlikely that even if you constitutionalise them and make them justiciable, you would actually have effective institutions that could deliver these rights,” he said.
Even if you constitutionalise socio economic rights, while judges make rulings in favour of the people, it is still up to the government to carry out these rulings. Mehta pointed to a case in India where the government was ignoring the ruling and despite a contempt of court case that is the works, the government had not budged from their stance but continues not to honour the verdict.
Moreover, the idea that socio-economic rights guarantees could act as replacements for broad reforms of the political processes was fundamentally flawed, he argued.
“If you think that constitutionalising rights was going to be a substitute for solving governance problems, then I am sure that you are in for a rude shock, while this is largely what the comparative evidence was telling us.”
Mehta pointing to Scandinavian countries as examples of those who had achieved many of these rights protections by using the legislative and democratic processes in favour of actually constitutionalising them.
“The idea that constitutionalising a right is a necessary condition for achieving a particular goal, is simply a false idea,” he said.
Furthermore, the very conception that judges are more beholden to the people than politicians and capable of delivering rights is also misguided.
“We have an idea that judges as a class and as an institution, would be insulated from politics, because they are insulated from politics and they would do those things you want.”
“If a society reaches a point where it feels it needs to repose more trust in judges than it does in politicians, then you probably have a deeper corrosion of democracy. You are in much bigger trouble,” he said.
Mehta indeed, repeatedly circled back to his belief that representative politics and neither the authors of the constitution nor members of the judiciary, should be responsible for guaranteeing various rights.
After having defined constitutions as social contracts that citizens who will be governed by these documents must find legitimate, Mehta argued that constitutionalising socio-economic rights closes the space for political, economic and social debate.
“We could all agree that having more healthcare is a good idea, that having more education is a good idea, that having better workers’ welfare is a good idea. But we might disagree on the institutional architecture that’s going to produce that outcome,” he said.
Instead of silencing those who disagree with constitutional methods of solving these issues, Mehta once again pointed to his preference for democratic politics to determine how to solve these issues.
Yet another issue the Indian scholar cited was the necessity of having solutions to socio-economic problems open to iterative re-examination as global, national and regional circumstances change.
For example, people could disagree as to how to best protect workers’ rights. And, as the economy changes, a certain course of action might present itself as the best option. It is easier to adjust to this change through legislative processes than to literally re-write the Constitution.
“The challenges, the danger of constitutionalising is that you may be constitutionalising on premises that shift very fast due to economies change and so forth,” he said.
Better for Poor?
While many proponents of guaranteeing socio economic rights in the new Constitution point to the supposed benefits for the poor and dispossessed, Mehta vehemently argued that at least in India, rights protections have not sufficiently aided the underprivileged.
While explaining that during the 1990s, the Indian Supreme Court promulgated all sorts of universal rights, such as the rights to shelter, health and education, Mehta argued that these protections had not caused governance or quality of life to improve.
With respect to the right to education, Mehta argued that the quality of schooling had actually declined since the right was passed.
“The court pronounced the right to education and we now have a right to education bill as a result. But this right to education bill was passed the day India’s enrolment in primary education had already reached 100%. So the right came after the fact. But more importantly, the right focuses largely on the input side of education.”
“So you must have a school of so many square feet with other requirements which have absolutely no bearing on learning outcomes. In fact, India’s learning outcomes had worsened after that right was pronounced,” he said.
He also pointed to the failings of India’s right to a clean environment as evidenced by the fact that the country had some of the world’s most polluted air and water.
Though Mehta did admit the guaranteeing socio-economic rights did not pressurise the executive for administrative problems, he argued that a central issue in guaranteeing these rights is that the courts still relied on state political mechanisms to enact their rulings.
“Beyond a point, the courts did not have the power to actually have these rights enforced.You can promulgate these rights, but the courts do not beyond a point, have the power to design appropriate remedies,” he said.
The final case he examined was Brazil’s right to health, which he claimed had worked to empower the rich instead of the poor.
There are over ten thousand right to health cases per year in Brazil and according to Mehta, the rich are using their money and power to win better treatment which the state must pay for.
The fact that Brazilians have an unspecified right to health, allows people to demand expensive treatment, like dialysis machines, that the court could grant. But the cost is borne by the Brazilian taxpayer, so this right to health permits those with access to good lawyers and disposable income to drain the healthcare budget, thereby leaving out the poor.
It is for reasons such as these that Mehta argued that if Sri Lanka chooses to include socio-economic rights protection in its constitution, which he said he believes would happen, the country should clearly specify what these national laws and practices are.
“My only recommendation for consideration is that if any constitution does end up with socio-economic rights, it should at the same time provide a clear legislative framework to put underneath those rights,” he said.
Most of Mehta’s talk focused on the downsides of including these rights in the constitution, but he did that guaranteeing these rights has expressive value and could allow courts to hold the executive to account on some procedural issues.
That being said, he warned that constitutionalising the rights without proper legislative frameworks could end up being disastrous to the country.
“You risk having the worst of nightmares, which is an economy governed by courts, power taken out away from legislature and democratic processes and a perverse outcome where the rights can be used more to buttress the rights of the privileged than to protect the weak and the vulnerable, which is what the rights are meant for,” he said.
