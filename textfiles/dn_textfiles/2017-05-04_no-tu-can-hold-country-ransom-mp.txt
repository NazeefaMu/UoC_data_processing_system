No TU can hold the country to ransom: MP

UNP Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said that no one or no trade union can be allowed to destabilise the country by various unethical and unjustifiable trade union actions.
He said that the government is duty bond to protect the citizens from these unjustifiable trade union actions and to ensure the smooth functions of the country.
“The forward march of the country should not be obstructed. The country should move forward. But, certain persons are trying to create an anarchic situation through trade union actions,” he noted.
He said that the China Bay oil tanks were in a state of decay for over five decades. But, no trade union uttered a single word about this resource until this government took measures to utilize it.
'Similarly, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) wants to crfeate anarchy in the country," Bandara said.
He alleged that the GMOA works to the hidden political agenda of Dr.Padeniya, who intended to contest at the 2015 General Election with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from the Kurunegala district.
“The GMOA is dancing to the tune of Padeniya under the guise of the SAITM agitation,” Bandara added.
