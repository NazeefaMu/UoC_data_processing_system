Nearly 70% of Colombo City Centre Residences sold out

“Nearly 70% of all residential units at the Colombo City Centre have already been sold,” said Devadharshan Jayadeva, CFO of Colombo City Centre.
“In addition to the growing high and middle income urban Sri Lankan residents, a number of professional Sri Lankans living abroad have also invested in our residences. We also recently returned from the UK where an international sales campaign generated a significant amount of interest among potential buyers.”
With several high-rise developments taking shape, the capital appreciation rate of luxury apartments in Colombo is estimated to have exceeded 10% in recent years, emphasising the preference of Sri Lankans to invest in real estate over other assets. Likewise, The Residences at Colombo City Centre are a prime example of a modern investment opportunity and has already earned a reputation as an attractive asset to own in the future.
2-bedroom apartments, 3-bedroom townhouse style residences, and 4 or 5-room penthouses begin from the 18th floor.
A 7% rental guarantee for 2 years adds a promising dimension to these investments, while the project is also able to offer a higher internal rate of return (IRR) due to its integrated offering, which includes the establishment of Sri Lanka’s first international shopping mall.
A highly anticipated addition to the capital’s fast-developing skyline, Colombo City Centre is Sri Lanka’s first BOI-approved mixed development project, slated for completion in early 2019. The USD 180 Million joint venture between local retail giant, Abans, and Singapore-based Next Story Group is one of Sri Lanka’s largest foreign direct investments in recent times, and rises 47-storeys above the heart of the city.
Honored as the ‘Most Promising Mixed Use Development’ by CMO Asia, ‘Asia’s Greatest Brand’ by AsiaOne Magazine and ‘Upcoming Mall of the Year’ among several other accolades by the Golden Globe Tigers, Colombo City Centre is a multi award-winning skyscraper dedicated towards transforming Sri Lanka’s capital into a global metropolis with the first integrated lifestyle complex of its kind. This includes Sri Lanka’s first international mall with high-end brands, a 700-seat food court and 6-screen multiplex cinema, the upscale NEXT Hotel with 164 keys, and 192 luxurious residential units.
