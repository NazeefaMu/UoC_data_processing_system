J.K. Rowling  isn’t done with ‘Fantastic Beasts’

The author’s Pottermore website announced last Thursday that a new edition of the Harry Potter spin-off ‘‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’’ will come out in March. The book, which arrives four months after the hit film adaptation, will include a foreword by Rowling writing as Magizoologist Newt Scamander, new artwork and a batch of new beasts. Proceeds will be donated to Comic Relief and Lumos, Rowling’s charity for children placed in institutions.
The original book came out in 2001.
