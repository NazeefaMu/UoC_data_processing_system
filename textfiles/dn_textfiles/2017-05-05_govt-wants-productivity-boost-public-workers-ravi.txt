Govt wants productivity boost from public workers: Ravi

Promise fulfilled within 28 days:
Public servants had been given an election pledge within 11 years to increase their salaries, but the good governance administration fulfilled it within 28 days.
The government expects further productivity from public workers, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister was speaking at the opening of a new office for the Management Service Department of the Finance Ministry on Wednesday.
The minister said the aim of the government is to set up a better environment for public workers to achieve 100 percent productivity in the service.
Minister Karunanayake said 1.4 million workers are employed in the public service. Rs. 600 billion is required to pay their salaries. Another Rs.182 billion is required to pay pension.
The money is paid by the public. Public servants should commit themselves to provide a better service to the people in return, he said.
The minister said: "We can remember how the previous regime pledged the public workers during their 11 year tenure that they would increase public sector salary. However, we granted a historic salary increment for the public servants, 28 days after our government assumed power. We expect the public sector to mete out justice in return."
