National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week from Sept 15 to 22

The national event on the National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week and Coastal Cleanup Programme, organised by the Marine Environment Protection Authority and the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management, is held at Crow Island Beach Park, Mattakkuliya from September 15 to 22 with the participation of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Marine Environment Protection Authority Chairman Rear Admiral (Rtd) Rohana Perera said the risk of pollution of the ocean around Sri Lanka is on the rise daily due to the impact of heavily used pollutants emanating from various development activities and increasing population.
The threat of pollution pressure is alarming with around 65 percent urban population pressure and about 70 percent organized industries concentrated in the Sri Lankan coastal zone. Large quantities of non-degradable waste generated from the land wind up in the coastal and marine zones directly or through the waterways. This is bound to adversely affect industries such as fisheries and tourism that are closely linked to the sensitive marine environment system as well as to the ocean, Perera said.
By considering all these facts, President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Mahaweli Development and Environment Minister, made a proposal to declare National Marine Resources Conservation Week in September.
The Cabinet has approved the proposal and the National Marine Resources Conservation Week will be held in September each year to coincide with International Coastal Cleanup Day that falls on the third Saturday of September each year.
Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department Director General B. K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi said Sri Lanka has a coastline of about 1,700 km polluted immensely due to various activities. Arrangements have been made to protect the marine environmental system including the coastal belt and nearly 82 lagoons during the National Marine Resources Conservation Week.
Under this programme, coastal cleanup programmes will be held at 75 locations in 14 districts. Programmes will also be launched to cleanup coral reefs and mangroves with the participation of schoolchildren and teachers, government officials, officers in Divisional Secretariat offices, Provincial Environment Ministries and representatives of environmental organizations.
During this project, all non-degradable and degradable waste will be collected and they will be properly disposed or directed to recycling projects.
Marine Environment Protection Authority General Manager Dr. Terney Pradeep Kumara said that Sri Lanka is ranked number five in the Global Pollution Rankings Index. The problem in terms of marine pollution in Sri Lanka is due to plastics, polythene and solid waste products arising from tourism, fisheries and other sectors.
Therefore, Sri Lankans should act responsibly to reduce this.
