Hold PC polls soon – Deshapriya

Administering the Provincial Councils (PCs) under governors or public officials is similar to autocratic rule, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya said.
The term of office of three PCs ended last year, and the term of office of three more ended this month, he said, speaking at a recent book launch.
Deshapriya requested all political parties represented in Parliament to create the required legal atmosphere to hold the PC elections as soon as possible.
