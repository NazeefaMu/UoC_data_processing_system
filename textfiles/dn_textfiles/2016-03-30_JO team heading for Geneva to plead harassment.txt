JO team heading for Geneva to plead harassment

The Joint Opposition will submit a complaint to the Geneva based Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) about alleged harassment, intimidation
and injustices they face both within Parliament and outside.
A Joint Opposition team comprising members Dullas Alahapperuma, Udaya Gammanpila and Bandula Gunewardena left for Geneva yesterday to meet the IPU hierarchy.
Speaking to the media on the eve of his departure, Alahapperuma said the Joint Opposition members will meet the IPU Secretary General in Geneva on Thursday.
Alahapperuma said the delegation had decided to visit Geneva after the IPU positively responded to a letter from the Joint Opposition for a meeting.
The Matara district parliamentarian said that the team will complain to the IPU regarding privilege issues faced by the Joint Opposition within Parliament and also about harassment outside.
Alahapperuma said the Joint Opposition will explain in detail about harassment faced by them which were the result of a political witch-hunt.
He said the team will make the IPU aware about issues such as the Joint Opposition not being given adequate time at Parliament sessions, not being given parliamentary responsibilities and attempts at intimidation and harassment using law enforcement authorities.
