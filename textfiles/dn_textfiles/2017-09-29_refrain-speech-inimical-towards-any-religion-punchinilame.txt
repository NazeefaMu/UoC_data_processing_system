Refrain from speech inimical towards any religion: Punchinilame

Public Administration and Management Deputy Minister Susantha Punchinilame in a memorandum to President Maithripala Sirisena has proposed that the SLFP should include a special clause in its Constitution prohibiting its parliamentarians and membership from engaging in any action including speech inimical towards any religion including Buddhism and other clergy.
He said this clause should be included in keeping with powers vested in the Party Advisory Committee in terms of section 16 sub-section 6 of the SLFP Constitution.
Punchinilame had said while he appreciated the self censorship policy adopted by media institutions in reporting religious tensions and clashes, he would suggest that these institutions should not give any publicity to actions or statements against Buddhism or the Buddha Sasana by any politician irrespective of his or her status.
