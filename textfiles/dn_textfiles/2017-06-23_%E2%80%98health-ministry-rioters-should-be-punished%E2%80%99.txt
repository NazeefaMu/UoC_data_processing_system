‘Health Ministry rioters should be punished’

Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said legal action should be taken against undergraduates who destroyed public resources of the Health Ministry after entering it forcefully and illegally.
The State Minister was addressing media yesterday at the SLFP headquarters.
He added that anyone has a right to protest but no one has the right to destroy public resources. Legal action should be taken against the undergraduates responsible for causing damages, after analysing the CCTV footage,he said.
The State Minister said that he is against SAITM but the behaviour of the undergraduates and Government Medical Officer’s Association in connection with SAITM cannot be accepted.
“SAITM came from the back door. It should have come from the front door Therefore, I oppose it. However, the way the GMOA behaves cannot be accepted.The respect for the profession is destroyed by the way the GMOA behaves,” he added.
“I am for private universities including private medical faculties. But they should be created the proper way” he added.
