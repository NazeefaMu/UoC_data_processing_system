SLMC to take decision on medical graduate registration

The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) will take a decision on registering the SAITM medical graduate after receiving verifications from the judiciary and after receiving the completed application from the student, SLMC sources said.
According to sources, the SLMC will seek verification whether to obey the KDU Act or the Supreme Court judgement.
The SLMC will inform SAITM student (in writing) to forward a completed application requesting registration.
A cheque of Rs.100,000 will be sent to the student in keeping with the judgement.
Around 83 medical students from SAITM visited the SLMC and made a request to register them in the SLMC as MBBS doctors after receiving the Supreme Court judgement on September 21.
The Supreme Court upheld the Appeals Court decision calling upon the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register SAITM medical graduates.The Appellate Court had also directed the SLMC to give provisional registration to medical students passing out from SAITM.
