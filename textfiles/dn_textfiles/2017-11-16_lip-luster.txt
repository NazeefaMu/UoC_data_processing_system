Lip luster

Red lips have always been seen as the quintessence of female beauty. There are millions of different shades of lipsticks so it is difficult to pick and choose just a few. When it comes to picking the right shade of lipstick, the most important thing to keep in mind is your skin tone. Following these few simple rules will ensure that you will find yourself reaching for the right tube of lipstick every time.
Locating a suitable lip liner
Lip liner got a bad rap during the 90s. People started wearing these dark shades of liner around bizarre frosty, pale lipsticks. It was truly a horrible look and had no place on anyone’s mouth.
Those days are behind us. Lip liner can be incredibly flattering when applied properly. Not only does it define your mouth, it makes a MAJOR difference in your lipstick’s staying power.
If you’re totally new to lip liner, the best thing that you can do is go out and find three or four very versatile shades of lip liner. The colours that you chose will totally depend on your style and lipstick preferences, but there are a few nearly universal shades that are handy for everybody to have around.
When you are first building your lip liner collection, look for a red, a wine and a nude. The red will work with vibrant berry shades as well as orange-based colours. The wine lip liner is critical anytime that you want a bold wine, plum or raspberry look. The nude shade is perfect for all of your lighter pink tones.
Dry and wrinkly matt lipsticks
To fix the dry and wrinkly look that matt lipsticks set off:
l Exfoliate: Even if your lips seem smooth, there’s bound to be some dead skin hanging around. Before applying a matte lipstick, exfoliating is a must. Grab your favorite lip scrub and get scrubbing. If you don’t, the matte formula will be sure to cling to any cracks and accentuate them, which is definitely a no-go.
l Hydrate: While you’re probably thinking that matte and moisture don’t go hand-in-hand, the truth is that for best results, they should. After exfoliating, it’s extremely important to apply a lip-balm to add some hydration back to your lips. Allow the balm to sink it before applying your lipstick. This way there won’t be any shine ruining your matte look, and your lips will remain looking smooth all day long, too.
l Prime: Typically, bleeding colour occurs with creamy or glossy formulas, but when it does happen with a matte lipstick, it’s even more annoying to fix. To play it on the safe side, apply a lip primer directly on your lips before applying colour to make sure it stays put.
l Conceal: To make your matte lipstick really pop, dab a little bit of concealer on your lips to cancel out your natural lip colour. This way, when you do apply your lipstick, it will show up bold and as true-to-colour as can be.
l Line: To keep things nice and neat, apply some lip liner along your lip line. Whether you use a shade that matches your lipstick or one that’s natural-hued - either will do. The lip liner will help further create a smooth base for your matte lipstick to lay on top of and keep it in place throughout the day.
When to discard a lipstick
Lipstick and gloss: two years.
Lip liner: two years or more.
Lip stick also dries out with age. They no longer look creamy on the lips. Long-wearing formulas may have an even shorter life span since they often contain ingredients that evapourate more quickly than creamier formulas. Pencil lipliners may last a little longer since putting them through a sharpener removes the old surface.
Another way to find out if your lipstick should be discarded is to sniff it to verify whether it smells like wax or petroleum jelly. If the answer is ‘yes’, then you should discontinue usage as it is a clear indicator that the lipstick has crossed its expiration date.
Toss out lipstick after having a cold?
It is okay if you do not toss your lipstick if you have just suffered a cold because the chances that you will get infected by cold germs are low. That is because the virus dies quickly and they cannot infect you again because your body builds antibodies against the virus. However, the respiratory virus can survive on a surface for varying amounts of time depending on the environmental conditions and the type of virus. If you have suffered anything more than a cold like a strep throat, flu, mono or a cold sore it will be wise to throw away your lipstick as the bacteria may be able to survive longer and you may thus risk infection again.
Lipstick colours that are in this season
Some people have their signature colour that they swipe on day after day, while others keep a bevy of shades on heavy rotation. From pink pigments to glossy textures, these colours are quite popular these days.
Pointers to keep in mind while selecting and applying lipstick
There are no strict rules that bound you to apply lipstick in the correct manner. It is the technique that matters the most.If you have more yellow undertones in the skin, you’re warm and should select lip colours with an orange base such as brick reds, burgundy, deep red, maroon, orange, corals, peach nudes, caramels, warm browns, and bronze. If you have more pinky undertones in your skin, you’re cool and should select lip colours with a blue base such as cherry reds, deep plum, wines, pinks, pinky nudes, and pinky browns. Everyone can wear lip colours that have a mix of cool and warm tones such as plums, peach, brownish pinks, poppy red, nudes, and neutral browns.I think every girl should own gorgeous nude, a summer bright (like a hot or fuchsia pink), a beautiful deep or rich berry, and a couple of great reds.

Home remedies to lighten dark underarms
Lemon juice
Before taking a bath rub lemon slices on your armpits and follow with moisturizer to soften the skin and skip the deodorant for a few days.Lemon is a natural bleaching agent and will slowly lighten the area.
You have to take fresh lemon juice squeezed in a container and dip a cotton ball over it. Slowly apply the lemon juice over the skin layer of your arm pit where you can see the dark skin. You can also slice a lemon and rub the juicy portion over the under arm. Since lemon has the natural beaching effect, it will make your skin lighter and attractive.
Milk and saffron
Take a pinch of saffron in two spoonfuls of milk or cream and apply to the underarms before bed. Leave this for the whole night, and wash it off the next morning. This lightens the underarms and also kills all germs and bacteria causing underarm odor.
Saffron is one of the expensive spice that is mixed with milk and fed to a pregnant lady so that she gives birth to a fair little boy or a girl. Now, to get a beauty effect for yourself, you need to dip few strands of saffron in the milk for 6 hours. Once the time is over you can see saffron has changed its color and made the milk yellow in color. This solution must be applied over the under arm and kept for 15 minutes till it becomes dry. Remove it with cold water.
Cucumber and potato
Take either Potato/ Cucumber slices and rub it on the underarms OR you can grate them and apply the juice on the affected area. leave it for 15 minutes and wash. we can see the Underarm skin color lighten very soon. Both potato and cucumber are natural bleaching agents.
Potato and cucumber are separately a good solution for lightening the skin tone. Now, if you can combine both the natural ingredients, getting double effect will be natural. You can take 1/4th of a potato peeled and same quantity of cucumber. Slice then and get them inside the grater so that it becomes pulp. Now add a spoon of besan to make the pulp tight and apply it over the under arm portion. Remove it with lukewarm water after 15 minutes.
Rose water and sandalwood
To treat dark underarms naturally make a paste of sandalwood with rose water. Apply and leave the paste for a few minutes and wash it off . Rose water will cool down the skin and make it soft whereas the sandalwood lightens the colour .we can use this on a daily basis to see a difference.
You can get sandalwood stick in the market which can be rubbed against a stone and get sandal wood in paste form. Instead of using water while rubbing the stone with sandalwood stick use rose water. You will get the watery paste which needs to be applied under arms. Alternatively you can also mix sandalwood powder and rose water. Keep it over your underarms for 10 minutes and remove it with water.
