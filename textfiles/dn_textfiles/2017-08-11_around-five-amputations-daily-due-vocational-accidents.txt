Around five amputations daily due to vocational accidents

Daily around five amputations of limbs are being carried out in Sri Lanka but only two of such persons have the ability to obtain artificial limbs. Annually, 1,700 to 2,000 vocational accidents are reported in Sri Lanka, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, eight million people are in the labour force in Sri Lanka and the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry takes care of their welfare. Last year only six artificial legs were provided to six workers who lost their legs while working in factories and similar places. The artificial legs are being provided through the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that this year, artificial legs were provided for 20 persons who lost their legs while working in factories etc. The artificial legs are provided by Aruna Samarawickrama, and the legs are of high quality. One artificial leg costs Rs. 140,000.
Labour and Trade Union Relations State Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said that more people should be educated on the programme implemented by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) which offers artificial legs in order to enable them to lead a normal life after amputation.
