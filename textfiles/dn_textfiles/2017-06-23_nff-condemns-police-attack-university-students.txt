NFF condemns police attack on university students

The National Freedom Front (NFF) yesterday condemned the police attack on the university students who were protesting against the SAITM private medical college on Wednesday.
Addressing the media at the NFF office yesterday, National Freedom Front Organiser MP Jayantha Samaraweera said the Wednesday’s attack on university students was the worst attack in history.
“Around 96 students, including females injured in the police attack on the protest campaign held at the Health Ministry, demanding the government to abolish SAITM, Malabe, are receiving treatment at the National Hospital, Colombo,” he said.
Samaraweera said the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister who failed to solve the matter through discussions put the students’ lives in danger.
He alleged the ministers who have accepted the bribes of the owner of SAITM are attempting to legalise it. President Mithripala Sirisena should take the responsibility of solving the issue accepting the recommendations of the Medical Council, Samaraweera said.
