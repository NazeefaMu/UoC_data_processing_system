CBK asks black flags callers : Tie a rock on leg and jump into Indian Ocean

Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairman former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge yesterday said she would have said to those who called the public to hoist black flags during the Vesak festival that it would have been better for them to jump into the Indian ocean with a rock tied to their legs than to make such utterances.
She said so at a press conference at the ONUR office in the SEMA building Colombo. The calls to hoist black flags instead of the Buddhist flag during the Vesak had come from Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa. Weerawansa said at the Joint Opposition’s May Day rally at Gall Face that the visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Vesak festival would not be in favour of the country. The people should hoist black flags during Vesak, he said.
