May Day celebrations moved to May 7

 
The May Day celebrations will be moved from May 1 to May 7, said the Prime Minister today.
The Prime Minister made this statement at a meeting held with the Government agents at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA).
“This decision was made to avoid the celebrations coinciding with the Vesak full moon Poya day which falls on April 29 upon the request of the Mahanayake Theros,” said the Prime Minister.
The holiday too will be postponed to May 7.
