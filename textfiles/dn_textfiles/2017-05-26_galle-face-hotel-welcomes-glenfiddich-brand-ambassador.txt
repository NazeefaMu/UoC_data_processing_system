Galle Face Hotel welcomes Glenfiddich Brand Ambassador

The Galle Face hotel has a long-standing history of hosting prominent guests, counting among them Sir Arthur C. Clarke, John D. Rockefeller, Carrie Fisher and Indira Gandhi to name a few. The hotel welcomed another famous guest, Struan Grant Ralph, who is the brand ambassador for Glenfiddich, the world's best-selling single-malt whisky.
Ralph has acted as Glenfiddich’s brand ambassador in both the US and Asia Pacific for the past five years. Ralph previously worked at Knockdhu Distillery before achieving a master’s degree in chemistry and a distinction from the Wine and Spirit Education Trust (WSET). He has also worked as a bartender and ambassador in locations including Osaka, Manilla, Melbourne and Kuala Lumpur.
