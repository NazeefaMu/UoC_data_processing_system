Book review: Vignettes of  village life

Title: Grass for my feet
Author: J Vijayatunga
‘Grass for my feet’ by J Vijayatungabrings a good array of several vignettes of village life in Si Lanka written in great lucidity for anyone to breathe the authenticity of village life prior to independence and before sophistication due to modernization. Any Sri Lankan could feel proud as most of the critics have leveled J.Vitayatungawith great many writers.
On the whole, almost all the villages in the world look the same in constitution.
There are very distinguished people, in other words squires, rich and poor people, the village merchants, the temple priests, highwaymen or burglars and even murderers. To cap them all, the cattle and the poultry farm are common sights. In Dickencianstyle village characters give immense life to his fictions, in the same way the real rustic characters coming in this great fiction keep the reader under the grip of the writer. It is the beauty of his narration.
Bathing together in the village brook is fun and healthy because the cool water under the kumbuk trees with the rustling of the bamboo trees in tranquility lull the bathing party to the rhythm of the village.
Thus evening bathing of men and the morning washing and bathing of the village damsels drive away weariness and lethargy. How the village undergoes a rapid change is written well-wordily to take the reader on a smooth glide. Evening in the village is not ascene tobe read in a book, it is tobe felt by the soul. Yet, the writer makes it happen. Story time is not alien not only to the English reader but also to the Sri Lankan rural child, but the village story teller mingles our culture with folk lore into this traditional impart of versatile knowledge. Pundits in conclave are the decision makers in the contemporary society. Village fishing by angling and blocking a water course are always enticing. Pure nutrition and its thrill are immense to the villager. The story does not end there. The women in villages are born experts in this aspect of culinary art. The writerreminisces his early childhood. Fresh water fish experience in thevillage is something to cherish in life. The appearance of white men in the village is significant. Law and order is regulated by their service. The village lads have picnics into the jungle to eat wild dates, black berry, wild guava called ‘cheena pera’ or another local variety called ‘himbutu’. The early childhood development in the village spontaneously teaches caring and sharing and also collective responsibly in the thicket as it is a highly serpent infested place. Another aspect of this escapade is the caning from their parents. The conversation across the stream is real bucolic romance that you have to read and feel. The lad’s approach and the village lass’s gradual response speak volumes for the writer’s aptitude of writing that our country could be proud of rain, harvesting, cattle and the jungle expeditions as aforementioned are some of the excellent chapters of indescribable beauty. The young and old both could spend an enjoyable time by reading `Grass for my feet’.
The demise of the village millionaire, a village wedding are depicted in real graphics, how a house is built with the village collective labour would take you back to the village gumption. Superstitious beliefs such as evil eye, evil tongue, devil dancing and also how an alms giving is conducted with real piety in a village house are of paramount importance because they are going to be things of the past.
The village temple and the community are inseparable. The urban environment is almost either cemented or macadamized. The village child still could walk on some grass. The gravity of the situation is that when the feet do not touch the mother earth, people get disjoined from nature. Violence and intolerance play havoc in later life. In this light, the writer opine that the schoolgoers could revert to some reading about grass, village life and cascading waterfalls to be away from the dull and monotonous ambience of the concrete jungles.
