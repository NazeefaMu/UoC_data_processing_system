LB and Kanrich in MCA B Finals whilst Kapu makes strong case for his second coming in MCA big league

22 year Kasun Vidura scored back to back tons and an unbeaten 108 in the crucial semifinals against MAS Silueta helping Karich secure a spot in the MCA B final. In the other semifinal concluded LB Finance advanced to the finals at the expense of Hayleys despite a valiant effort by Maduranga Soyza of Hayleys who made a fighting 82. LB Finance and Kanrich will meet in the all-important final next week at the MCA turf.
Meanwhile in the MCA big league (MCA Div A) Unichela maintained their unbeaten streak beating Commercial credit and Textured Jersey during the week. Commercial Credit posted the highest score of 328 in this year’s tournament as Chamara Kapugedara made a strong case for his second coming with a brutal career best 170 against HNB. In addition, Sri Lanka’s test opener Kaushal Silva made a fluent 147 against MAS Active whilst Danushka Gunathilake impressed with the bat for MAS Unichela.
