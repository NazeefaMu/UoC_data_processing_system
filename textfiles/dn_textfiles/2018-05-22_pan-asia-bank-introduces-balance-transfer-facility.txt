Pan Asia Bank introduces Balance Transfer facility

Credit Cards can be a vital tool in managing one’s personal financials and its popularity has grown tremendously in recent times aided by attractive seasonal promotions offered by most credit card issuers.
As a practical and viable solution to ease the credit card burden, Pan Asia Bank has introduced Balance Transfer facility which allows cardholders to pay off their accumulated Credit Card debt in full over a specific period of time under an interest rate that could be up to 40% lower than their current interest rate.
Pan Asia Bank’s Balance Transfer facility enables cardholders to transfer their existing Credit Card balances to a Pan Asia Bank Credit Card and pay it off in instalments. They also have the option to opt for an open ended balance transfer under a low interest rate without committing to an instalment payment plan. Either way, this facility offers them an opportunity to consolidate their credit card debt under a low interest rate and pay it off according to a plan that fits their cash flows.
In order to apply for this facility cardholders can simply submit a completed Balance Transfer application and a Pan Asia Bank Credit Card application along with required support documentation including latest statement of his/her existing Credit Cards.
Pan Asia Bank currently offers three different Credit Cards catering to three distinctive segments namely Pan Asia World MasterCard, Pan Asia Black MasterCard® and Pan Asia Gold MasterCard.
