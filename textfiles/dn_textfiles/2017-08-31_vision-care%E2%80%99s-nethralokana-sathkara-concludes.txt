Vision Care’s Nethralokana Sathkara concludes

Nethralokana Sathkara, the project conducted as part of commemorating 25 years of Vision Care, a leading eye care services provider, concluded in Colombo recently.
The project reached the goal of distributing 25,000 spectacles free of charge among deserving Sri Lankans, in all corners of the country, through 6 mega events and 40 branches of the organization.
As the first step of this initiative, applications were called for, where beneficiaries made submissions at the company’s branches, on a first-come-first-serve basis. This was followed by testing events which were predetermined appointments for a comprehensive eye test.
Based on these tests, the orders were processed through a dedicated channel of glass-making created to cater for this project, ensuring speedy delivery and were distributed among the applicants at scheduled.
“The optometrist in me was very happy to see a larger number of people getting tested for the first time. Seeing them realize the importance of an eye check up, educating themselves of their impairment and taking corrective steps was a very satisfying aspect of the project.”, said Dasantha Fonseka, CEO of Vision Care.
The objective of taking the project to a wide audience, led to six mega testing events and awarding events that were held in Galle, Kandy, Kurunegala, Jaffna, Anuradhapura and Colombo.
To strengthen the reach of the programme, the company also used its network of 40 branches which conducted their own distribution of spectacles.
Chairperson Chamila Welikala, of Nethralokana Sathkara project said, “On one occasion we encountered a 40 year old woman who was partially blind and had never tested her eyes before” These stories, and thousands more, each with its own poignant ending, has made this project a humbling experiencing for all employees at Vision Care. Vision care has spent 2808 hours for planning, 8372 hours for testing, 6279 hours for awarding spectacles and 7744 hours for making glasses. Total number of 26589 applications was accepted throughout the registration period of Vision Care’s Nethralokana Sathkara initiative.
