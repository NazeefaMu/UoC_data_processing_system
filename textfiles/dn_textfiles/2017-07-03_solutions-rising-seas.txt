Solutions to rising seas

Like cheese in France or cars in Germany, climate change is a business in the Netherlands. Delegations from as far away as Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, New York and New Orleans come to the port city of Rotterdam.
No place in Europe is under greater threat than this waterlogged country on the edge of the Continent. Much of the nation sits below sea level and is gradually sinking. Now climate change brings the prospect of rising tides and fiercer storms. The Dutch devise lakes, garages, parks and plazas useful to daily life but also double as enormous reservoirs for when the seas and rivers spill over.
The new rowing course just outside Rotterdam, where the World Rowing Championships were staged last summer forms part of an area called the Eendragtspolder, a 22-acre patchwork of reclaimed fields and canals — a prime example of a site built as a public amenity that collects floodwater in emergencies. It is near the lowest point in the Netherlands, about 20 feet below sea level. With its bike paths and water sports, the Eendragtspolder has become a popular retreat. Now it also serves as a reservoir for the Rotte River Basin when the nearby Rhine overflows, which, because of climate change, it’s expected to do every decade.
The project is among dozens in a nationwide programme, called Room for the River. The Netherlands effectively occupies the gutter of Europe, lowlands bounded on one end by the North Sea, into which immense rivers like the Rhine and the Meuse flow from Germany, Belgium and France. Dutch thinking changed after floods forced hundreds of thousands to evacuate during the 1990s.
Harold van Waveren, a senior government adviser, recently explained. “We can’t just keep building higher levees because we will end up living behind 10-meter walls,” he said. “We need to give the rivers more places to flow. Protection against climate change is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain, and the chain in our case includes not just the big gates and dams at the sea but a whole philosophy of spatial planning, crisis management, children’s education, online apps and public spaces.”
Reshaping Neighbourhoods in Rotterdam
Dakpark, a dike in a poor, largely immigrant neighbourhood bordering industrial waterfront has a shopping centre, which the neighbourhood needed, and a park on the roof. Shops face the waterfront and help pay to keep up the park. The park slopes from the roof down to streets and housing blocks, creating a grassy hill that links park and neighbourhood. Formal gardens open onto acres of well-kept lawns. The park is a kilometre long. Its success — not only as a barrier but also as a boon to business and the area — has persuaded officials to consult neighbourhoods and set aside money for community-initiated projects.
A start-up in a converted industrial waterfront building is developing solar-powered sailing drones for collecting plastic trash from the sea, and, back in the middle of the city, a warehouse with a mix of artisanal food stalls, a circus academy and a pinball museum has rejuvenated a formerly dingy pier.
Rotterdam is trying to cast itself as a model of inventive urbanism. A local businessman, Peter van Wingerden, envisions floating dairy farms along the waterfront. One in every three trucks coming into the city carries food, he said. Floating farms would reduce truck traffic and carbon emissions, supplying the city with its own milk. With the city’s encouragement, he is constructing a $2.2 million prototype, for 40 cows, producing half-million liters (about 130,000 gallons) of milk a year. Molenaar, Rotterdam’s climate chief, summed up the Dutch view: “We have been able to put climate change adaptation high on the public agenda without suffering a disaster in many years because we have shown the benefits of improving public space — the added economic value of investing in resilience.
“It’s in our genes,” he said. “Water managers were the first rulers of the land. Designing the city to deal with water was the first task of survival here and it remains our defining job. It’s a process, a movement.
“It is not just a bunch of dikes and dams, but a way of life.”
Message for Sri Lanka
We have felt the impact of deluges in two successive years. Sufficient reason to wake us up. We are blessed with so much water with more on the way. Unlike the Netherlands or Maldives, we are not below sea level yet. The country already has the man and natural waterways with new streams opening due to development, illegal construction, silt and runs off of massive sudden quanta due to rain. Urban development and demand for housing are increasingly restricting natural seepage of water into the water table below reducing ground water recharging.
Is it not the time to harvest water differently? At a time when our springs are drying up, hills and slopes are generating landslides traditional water sources may become scarce. We should plan for contingencies and use it as an opportunity.
We spend a considerable amount of time battling the impact of floods. Can we not turn it into a positive agenda? It’s time we looked at floodwater harvesting as an asset to use. Climate change may well trigger new ways of looking at our surrounding environment.
