ICRA reaffirms Vallibel Finance long term ratings

ICRA Lanka, a group company of Moody’s Investors has reaffirmed the issuer rating of [SL]BBB- with stable outlook for Vallibel Finance.
ICRA Lanka also has reaffirmed the [SL]BB+ rating with stable outlook for the Rs 500 million unsecured subordinated redeemable debentures programme and the [SL]AA-(SO) rating with stable outlook for the Rs 1,000 million guaranteed subordinated redeemable debentures programme of the company. SO suffixed to a rating symbol stands for Structured Obligation. An SO rating is specific to the rated issue, its terms and its structure.The SO ratings do not represent ICRA Lanka’s opinion on the general credit quality of the issuers concerned.
The rating for the guaranteed subordinated redeemable debentures is based on the strength of the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee from Hatton National Bank covering the principal and two interest instalments (semi-annual) and, the undertaking from the Trustee to declare the entire guaranteed amount as payable in the event the issuer does not meet the scheduled interest payment on any due date or in the event the issuer does not redeem the debenture in full on any redemption date. The guarantor undertakes the obligation to pay, on demand from the Trustee, Rs 1,102.5 million, being the total principal sum and two half-yearly interest instalments of the proposed Guaranteed Subordinated Redeemable Debentures.
The rating also assumes that the guarantee will be duly invoked by the Trustee, as per the terms of the underlying Trust deed, Trustee’ undertaking and guarantee agreements, in case there is a default in payment by VFP (Issuer).
The issuer rating takes note of the expected financial and managerial support from the Vallibel group of companies, its experienced senior management team, adequate internal controls and systems, comfortable asset quality profile (gross NPA at 3.15% as in Dec-16) and good profitability indicators (RoA1 at 2.58% and RoNW2 at 31.66%in 9MFY2016). The rating
however takes note of the expected increase in competitive pressures in VFP’s target product segment (used motor vehicles), exposure to customers with a moderate credit profile and its high gearing level (11.4 times in Dec-16).
