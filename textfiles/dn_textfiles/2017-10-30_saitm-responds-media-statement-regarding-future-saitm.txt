SAITM responds to media statement regarding future of SAITM

 
In an official statement, SAITM said it wished to inform the general public of the ‘legitimacy of SAITM following the media statements which are currently circulated through the Government Information Department (GID).’
It was also stated that the proposals concerning graduates, students, parents and the staff of SAITM needs to be discussed at length with the stakeholders in order to ensure that justice is met to all the concerned parties.
The statement also said that SAITM founder Dr. Neville Fernando would continue to produce quality non-state doctors despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests.
The full statement is reproduced below:
‘The Management of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) would like to inform the general public of Sri Lanka and reiterate their legitimacy following the media statements that are currently circulated through the Department of Government Information.
SAITM was established as a Degree Awarding Institute in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978 and is recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE).
SAITM was established with the aim of providing quality private medical education in the country to augment the requirement of quality doctors to serve the people of the nation.
Among the matters of concern arising from the said proposals are issues concerning graduates, students, parents and the staff of SAITM. Therefore, these proposals need to be discussed at length with all stakeholders to ensure that justice to concerned parties are met.
Going forward, we hope that SAITM graduates will be given provisional registration, subject to court proceedings and the current students’ education will continue without any disruption to their studies.
We also note positively, the vision of SAITM's founder Dr. Neville Fernando's to produce quality non-state doctors will continue despite enormous opposition from various political and other parties with vested interests.
