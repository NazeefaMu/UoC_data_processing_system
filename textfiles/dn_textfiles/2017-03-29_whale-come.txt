Whale Come!

Spotting the world’s largest animal can be a thrilling experience indeed. It is one of the most sought after experiences among the tourists who visit Sri Lanka. There are several spots around the island where you can do this, depending on the season. Mirissa, which is on the southern tip, is considered one of the best sites in the world to spot Blue, Sperm and Killer whales.
What is unique about the Blue whales around Sri Lanka are that some colonies remain in the same area throughout the year while most whales worldwide travel thousands of kilometers each year in search of food sources. Therefore whales can be seen throughout year in Sri Lanka but there are peaks months where the migrant whales join the feast.
The Blue Whales are seen in three locations off the coast of Sri Lanka: Mirissa, Kalpitiya and Trincomalee. Mirissa is the prime spot out of the three. The Mirissa sea is unique in many ways, being up to 300 meters deep within close vicinity to the shore. This specialty is what makes these waters well-suited for marine mammal watching. The success rate of spotting Blue whales is almost 100 percent. The peak seasons for whale watching is from November to April.
Now you can celebrate the festive season ahead with a ride on one of the yachts offered by, Sail Lanka, the pioneer in Sri Lanka yachting and coastal cruises.
