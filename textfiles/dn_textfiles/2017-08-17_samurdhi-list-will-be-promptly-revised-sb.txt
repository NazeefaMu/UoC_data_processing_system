Samurdhi list will be promptly revised: SB

Certain names deleted accidentally:
On the advice of President Sirisena and in accordance with the Cabinet Sub Committee directives, the Samurdhi recipients’ list would be revised promptly as certain names had been accidentally removed due to a technical error of the computer programme and several technical defects, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B. Dissanayake said.
Therefore a fresh list of Samurdhi recipients would be prepared, as the existing list had been cancelled with effect from yesterday (16).
The Minister made these remarks while addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
The Cabinet Sub Committee was appointed by the President to look into the grievances of people, whose names had been erased from the Samudhi recipients list.
Meanwhile the President has advised the minister to look into the issue and re-enter the names of these persons who were affected due to the technical error.
“While investigating into the issue, it has been revealed that names of around 200 persons had been erased from the Samurdhi recipients list due to a technical error,” he added.
However, it had been necessary to revise the Samudhi recipients list as certain persons were receiving Samurdhi benefits, while certain people who were eligible to receive the Samurdhi were left behind, he added. Minister Dissanayake said the process of revising the name list would be completed within the next two months.
