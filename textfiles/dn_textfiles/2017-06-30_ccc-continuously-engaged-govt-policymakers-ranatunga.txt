CCC continuously engaged with Govt policymakers - Ranatunga

 Using the Chamber principles as a basis of engagement, the Chamber through its secretariat, the trade associations as well as the business councils, have continuously engaged with the Government policymakers and the multilateral agencies, to influence and fashion out positions which could be beneficial to its membership, said Samantha Ranatunga, Outgoing Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce addressing the 178th AGM yesterday.
“We had many engagements with the policymakers during the last 2 years where we articulated the Chamber position. We won some but we lost more. However, in true Chamber spirit, we always put the Country first more than narrow industry specific initiatives. This is clear from the positions we have taken on taxation and trade agreements. We have taken on true Country priorities and tried to bring them to the National or International platform. Two of our ground breaking activities were the Investor Forum as well as the Innovation Strategy event which was held during March 2017. These were in addition to the other main prestigious events, the Economic Summit and the Best Corporate Citizen Awards,” he said. To promote investments, the 2 investor forums showcased the potential of Sri Lanka, where both events attracted nearly  150 participants from over 40 countries. At these events, CCC about the practical issues faced by investors in Sri Lanka and how to find solutions for it. The Innovation Summit was for future entrepreneurs of this country, where some of the best innovators in the world and in Sri Lanka spoke about the technological opportunities which exists and how the country could benefit. This was a launching pad for the knowledge economy a key competitive area of opportunity for Sri Lanka. The Chamber has always actively promoted what it felt right for Sri Lanka and best for its success, he said.
“What we seek from the Government is a true partnership. The private sector always strives to build a bridge of trust with the Government leaving room for dialog and healthy debate. Let us use this as a connection for a brighter future, where we continue to build mutual confidence. Our Chief Guest Dr. Binod Chaudhry has the business confidence as he has been investing in Sri Lanka from the 2,000, even while the war was at its peak, “he added. See also page iii
