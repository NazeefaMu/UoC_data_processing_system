Cargo aircraft landing at Mattala brings income

The Mattala International Airport (MIA) has earned over Rs. 14 million revenue for two days from the landing of the largest cargo aircraft of the world belonging to Russia at the airport, MIA Manager Upul Kalansuriya said.
The aircraft arrived at the MIA from Malaysia on April 18 at 6.35 a.m. and departed at 4.45 a.m. yesterday to the Karachchi International Airport.
Kalansuriya said arrivals of such aircraft in Sri Lanka could bring in a good income to the country. The aircraft landed in Mattala to refuel and have a rest for its crew. The 24-member crew was welcomed at the airport with a tea party that Kalansuriya arranged.
Chief pilot of the Antano 225 aircraft Antanov Dmytro said they decided to land in Mattala since the aircraft required a massive space.
The MIA boasts of required facilities and space for landing large aircraft.
Kalansuriya said the chief pilot told him that the aircraft will land at the MIA in future as well.
