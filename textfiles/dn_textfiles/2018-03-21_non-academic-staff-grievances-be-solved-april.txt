Non-academic staff grievances to be solved before April

 
State Minster of Higher Education Mohan Lal Grero said today that the government is putting its best effort to resolve the grievances of university non-academic staff before April.
He said this in Parliament, today.
Grero further said that the issue was discussed again today at a meeting held with the General Treasury in order to bring about a swift solution.  
Pointing out that the non-academic staff has not received their salaries for this month and they will also not receive their bonus payments for the New Year eve, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa warned that if the government fails to provide a viable solution soon they will continue to strike.
Pathirana questioned as to why the agreement on monthly salary allowances between the non-academic staff, the University Grant Commission and the Higher Education Ministry is not implemented.
Grero in response said, “We came upon this agreement in 2016. The agreement only indicated that the government will try its best to solve this issue. It said that we will attempt to pay 75percent of the monthly salary within a period of five years to solve the monthly salary issue they are facing. Even though all the above mentioned institutes have agreed to this solution, the General Treasury is still is not in favor of this agreement.”
