Striking solution

In the days leading up to May Day, an announcement by Cabinet Spokesman and Minister of Health Rajitha Senaratne was to rock the political establishment- and generate much discussion about the fall and rise of former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka.
It all began at last Wednesday’s post- Cabinet media briefing. Minister Rajitha Senaratne was to declare that Fonseka, who is now Minister of Regional Development in the National Unity government, would be offered a ‘special post’ to deal with the current wave of strikes, work stoppages and protest campaigns that are disrupting public life.
It was the specific details that Minister Senaratne mentioned that gave credence to the issue. The Minister said that the post will be that of an ‘Overall Commander’. He said Minister Fonseka would have to quit his Cabinet portfolio to take up the position. He also said it would be for a period of two years. Minister Senaratne also elaborated on Minister Fonseka’s response to the request. He reported that Fonseka had said he was prepared to undertake any responsibilities entrusted to him.
Naturally, the news made national headlines the next day. There was speculation that Fonseka would be resigning his ministerial position to take up this newly assigned responsibility. Fonseka himself was asked about the report.
To his credit, Fonseka offered a more plausible insight into what had transpired. He stated that the President inquired whether he would be in a position to instruct the Army- or the Armed Forces- in a situation which required their intervention. Fonseka said he had declined commanding the forces but had agreed to evaluate mechanisms which could be used to maintain public life, law and order.
Commendable proposal
While there was no other official reaction to the issue, the only other response came from Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) ministers in the Cabinet- who largely downplayed and dismissed the idea.
Minister S. B. Dissanayake- also known for being outspoken- said that he believed that the offer was made to Fonseka only as a ‘joke’. “I don't think the President was serious. The President asked Sarath Fonseka if he could be the Army Commander again. No one took it seriously,” Dissanayake said.
However, Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa, who attended the same press briefing after Dissanayake said the President's offer to Fonseka was noteworthy. He also said it was a commendable proposal as trade unions could not be allowed to disrupt public life in the country. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who is also the General Secretary of the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) however dismissed the idea. Minister Amaraweera told a news conference that the President only asked whether Fonseka could help implement a mechanism to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential services for which Fonseka agreed.
“It was discussed during the Cabinet meeting that people had to face inconveniences due to strikes launched by trade unions without prior notice. It was said that the situation had arisen due to the overuse of freedom given by the government. The President said a special mechanism should be set up to provide essential services without any disruption. There were such mechanisms even during the war” Amaraweera explained.
Minister John Seneviratne was to also endorse the view that what was discussed was not ‘serious’. “When speaking about the non-ending strikes, the President has jokingly asked whether Minister Fonseka could control such situations,” he said.
Military’s defeat of the LTTE
Minister Rajitha Senaratne, who triggered this reaction has meanwhile stuck to his guns. He maintains that his initial announcement was accurate. He said it was he who was responsible for reporting what transpired at Cabinet meetings to the media as the Cabinet Spokesman.
“I state everything that happens there as the Cabinet Spokesman; because of that, the government will not fall into an abyss” Senaratne declared, launching a thinly veiled attack on “SLFP members who have their legs on both sides of the divide including those who are trying to join hands with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa”.
Whatever transpired at the Cabinet meeting, former Army Commander and now Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka has emerged with a higher profile after all the publicity he generated. It is indeed a remarkable comeback for the decorated soldier now holding the rank of Field Marshal.
Even Fonseka’s critics readily acknowledge that he was one of the major architects of the military’s defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009. Having taken up duties as Army Commander at the height of the war with the LTTE in 2005, he was the target of a suicide bomb attack in April 2006. Fonseka survived and the trauma he endured reportedly strengthened his resolve to end the Eelam war.
Fonseka provided the military leadership for the LTTE’s defeat in May 2009 and the then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was to publicly say that he was the ‘best Army Commander in the world’. However, soon after relations between Fonseka and the Rajapaksas were to sour, leading to Fonseka’s decision to contest the 2010 presidential elections.
Leader of the Democratic National Alliance
Fonseka secured only 40% of the vote against Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 58% but it was what happened thereafter that, in hindsight, ensured his popularity and a further foray into politics. Less than two weeks after the election, Fonseka was taken into military custody. The military announced he would be court-martialed for “committing military offences” during his time as Chief of Defence Staff. However, in April 2010, Fonseka contested the general elections and entered Parliament for the first time as the leader of the Democratic National Alliance. In August 2010, by proclamation from President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, Fonseka was cashiered from the army, having been stripped of his rank, medals and decorations. His military pension was forfeited. In November 2011 he was sentenced to three years in jail.
Amidst local and international pressure President Mahinda Rajapaksa signed the order for Fonseka’s release in May 2012. Subsequently, at the 2015 presidential election campaign, Fonseka extended his support to candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
Following his victory, President Sirisena gave Fonseka a complete presidential pardon and acquitted him of all charges on January 22, 2015, restoring his civic rights. The pardon restored his military rank and decorations as well as his pension. In March 2015, Fonseka was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal by President Sirisena.
In February 2016, he took oaths as a Member of Parliament for the seat vacated by the death of M. K. A. D. S. Gunawardana and two weeks later was appointed as Cabinet Minister of Regional Development by President Sirisena. In June 2016, Fonseka formally joined the United National Party.
‘Special appointment’ for Fonseka
Fonseka’s rise from prison jumper to the Filed Marshal’s uniform is as spectacular as his fall from grace from Army Commander. The latest fuss about a ‘special post’ can only enhance his reputation further.
Known as a ruthless disciplinarian, when there was speculation about a ‘special appointment’ for Fonseka, the trade unions - mostly supported by opposition parties - were up in arms, claiming that their democratic rights were being curtailed. There were even pointed references to the previous regime and a return to the type of governance undertaken by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
Whether Field Marshal Fonseka is given special powers or not, the government does have a challenging task ahead, dealing with the continuous spate of strikes that are affecting public life, the latest being yet another protest planned by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) tomorrow.
Desperate situations, they say, call for desperate measures. In such circumstances, what matters is not whether Fonseka is given a special title or not- but whether his experience and expertise can be utilised to maintain law and order and ensure the uninterrupted provision of essential services to the public.
That is certainly not a joke- and it could well be a task tailor made for Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
