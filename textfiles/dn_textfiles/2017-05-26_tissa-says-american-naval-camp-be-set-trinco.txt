Tissa says American Naval camp to be set up in Trinco

Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Witharana yesterday said that an American Naval camp is to be set up in Trincomalee, with the Trincomalee harbor as the focal point.
According to him, a bilateral agreement in this regard has already been signed between Sri Lanka and America. He said so at a press conference at the party headquarters in Colombo yesterday. Addressing media Prof. Witharana said that the agreement has been signed secretly to establish an American naval camp. Quoting a article that appeared in newspapers, he said that America has agreed to set up the Naval camp in Trincomalee in the future. However, the media pointed out to him that the particular media reports have been issued in relation to a meeting of security forces personnel of both countries aiming to conduct a joint naval exercise in future but not relating to establishing an American naval camp.
He further said that there is another bilateral agreement between India and America. Under this agreement America will issue high-grade uranium to India to be used for India’s nuclear activities.
Meanwhile Sri Lanka is going to purchase American fighter jets at a cost of US $ 400 million and military equipment amounting US $ 300 million., Witarana revealed
“What is the use of purchasing fighter jets at this juncture since the country’s security is not under threat.
Why spend such a huge amount of public funds” He asked.
He said that religious harmony in the country was at a risk considering the incidents that had been taking place in the recent past including attacks on religious places . But the government has failed to take action against those responsible behind these incidents.
