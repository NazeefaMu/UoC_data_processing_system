In a stock market filing it has been stated that Vandell Financial Services has confirmed their willingness to offer a Bank Guarantee against a loan from the Central Bank and have requested the name of the beneficiary in whose name the Bank guarantee should be issued. “We understand that the Central Bank has sought approval to accept a Bank guarantee instead of obtaining real estate as specified in the relevant legislation,” the stock market filing said.Vandell has indicated that their delegation will visit Sri Lanka again once the confirmation of the loan is received.
Meanwhile, the Central Bank has referred another interested foreign Investor representative to CIFL who was provided with the basic information required for their due diligence after signing a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
“We are awaiting the outcome from them as an alternative solution in case Vandell backs out.”
