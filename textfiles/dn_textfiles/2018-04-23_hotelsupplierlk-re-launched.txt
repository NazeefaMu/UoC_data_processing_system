Hotelsupplier.lk re launched

Sri Lanka’s first B2B e-commerce platform for the Hospitality Industry was re launched by Minister of Tourism John Amaratunga recently.
Hotelsupplier.lk came into existence in 2008 just as an online directory and is now a very well established, successful part of the Hospitality industry in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
“With an annual publication of a colour magazine and directory it features the hotel supplier store and quotation pool it’s beyond being just E-commerce site,” said its founder, M. Pubudu.
“Suppliers post their wares on the Hotelsupplier.lk website and users (hoteliers, restaurateurs, investors etc.,) place their inquiries or quotation requests directly with the supplier on the same platform/site.”
Many international chains and new hotels opening in Sri Lanka and Maldives use our website.”
