Allegations against Panadura Pradeseeya Sabaha Sec.: Minister raises concerns

Vocational Training Minister and Sri Lanka Freedom Party Panadura Electorate Chief Organiser Mahinda Samarasinghe raised concerns over the allegations levelled against the Panadura Pradeseeya Sabha Secretary that she has not carried out her duties regarding the development projects in the Panadura Pradeseeya Sabha area properly.
The minister was addressing the Panadura Electorate Co-coordinating Committee meeting at the Panadura Divisional Secretariat Auditorium on February 20.
The Secretary was not present at the meeting and a council clerk was present on her behalf.
Panadura Urban Council Former Chairman and Panadura Electorate Co-coordinating Committee Joint President Nandena Gunatilleke said the Secretary had issued letters to the traders at the Panadura public market building to vacate their stalls because it was decided to construct a new two-storey building at the location. The traders would not leave the building as they were not provided with alternative facilities by the Council, he said. He said hawkers have now invaded the pavements. The pedestrians have to use the roads instead of the pavements, he said.
The Secretary is not co-operating with the police to remove hawkers and prevent illegal sea sand mining under the pretext of mining sand from the Panadura river, he said. Coastal land had been forcibly taken over by hotel owners for their business purposes.
They have prepared forged deeds for these lands.
The coastal Conservation Department is silent in this regard, he added.
Panadura Urban Council Former Councillor Dulshan Fernando informed the Minister Samarasinghe that one and half acres of land in the Panadura Town opposite the private bus stand was acquired by the Urban Development Authority 30 years ago but it was not developed. Instead the UDA had produced false reports to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, he said.
None of the government departments in Panadura were present at the meeting.
They were represented by subject clerks.
