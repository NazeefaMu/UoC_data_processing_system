Online live auction portal launched

It has certainly been an exciting 125 year journey for Sri Lanka’s pioneering Chartered Auctioneers Schokman & Samerawickreme, a saga that began when a planter in Hatton met Shirley Samerawickreme, the Sales Manager at Tuckers/Millers at the horse races in Nuwara Eliya, fuelling a common fascination for auctioneering.
Celebrating the milestone, the third generation of the Samerawickremes, grandsons of Edwin De Alwis Samerawickreme and Shirley Samerawickreme’s sons, Navinda and Anuja have taken the business into 21st century realms by unveiling the country’s first live auction site via its unique auction portal, www.shopandselllanka.lk.
