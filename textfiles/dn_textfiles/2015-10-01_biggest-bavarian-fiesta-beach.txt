Biggest Bavarian fiesta on the beach

A five-day gala celebration of all things Bavarian, Oktoberfest is back to treat Sri Lankans to an amazing extravaganza of German cuisine, music and dance. Gear up and get your beach wear ready, because it's that time of the year again to make some noise and paint the town red! The Paradise Beach of Mount Lavinia Hotel will come alive from October 7 to the 11 with a host of festivities to delight fun loving Sri Lankans.
Oktoberfest is a world-famous fun fair and festival, which traces its roots back to Munich, Germany. It celebrates the Bavarian culture, traditions, their love for merriment, and is a much-anticipated event amongst locals as well as tourists in Germany. Luckily, Sri Lankans will have the opportunity of being a part of this amazing experience as the Mount Lavian Hotel (MLH) will re-create the spirit and traditions of the original Oktoberfest with a unique celebration not to be missed.
This time, the fiesta will unfold under the starry skies, as the rolling waves kiss the beach. It will be Oktoberfest with a Sri Lankan twist with a host of fun filled activities to keep you hyped up all night. The beachfront of MLH will be decked with countless stalls, games and entertainment for the whole family. What's more, there will be menus comprising of a plethora of authentic Bavarian delights prepared by MLH's very own German Master Chef Micheal Goeggerle.
While last year's Oktoberfest was an absolute blast, this year will be even better with music by the Bavarian Power Band, a traditional German band, which will amp up the celebration with great tunes. The Bavarian Power Band is a young and energetic 6-piece band including a female singer. They will play traditional Oktoberfest sing-a-long favourites as well as popular English dance hits, creating an exciting party atmosphere. Several popular local bands will also perform to add more variety to the entertainment.
"This year's Oktoberfest is definitely a must-not-miss and we are very excited to be a part of this celebration of all things Bavarian. There will be lots of fun-filled events for everyone with traditional games, carnival rides and our beautiful Bavarian hostesses," MLH Group General Manager Bazeer Cassim said.
