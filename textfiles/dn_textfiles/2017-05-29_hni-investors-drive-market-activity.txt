Point of view
Equity markets came off its 15M high, ending an 8 week market rally this week with some profit taking by investors.
The bench mark price index that gained a cumulative ~734 points since late March lost 32 points this week to close ~2 points below 6700 to end at 6697.86 points.
Strategic transaction however in Commercial Bank & foreign buying interest in JKH – which accounted for ~47% of total turnover – boosted average turnover value to LKR 1.07Bn this week, ~15% higher than last week’s average turnover of LKR 0.93Bn and ~14% higher than the year’s average turnover levels (LKR 0.90Bn).
Apart from COMB & JKH, large deals in SAMP, LLUB too contributed to market turnover with crossings accounting for ~65% of total turnover.
Net foreign purchases increased this week amid buying interest in JKH and SAMP and continued to remain net buyers for the 17th consecutive week.
Net inflows to the Bourse subsequently increased by 15.3% W-o-W to LKR 1.39Bn bringing the total net inflows for the year to LKR18.8Bn.
In the week ahead similar market momentum is likely and could to be influenced by the rest of the Mar’17 corporate earnings.

(Approximately 40% of corporates have reported earnings thus far and ~57% of these companies have recorded a Y-o-Y growth).
NCPI declines to 8.4%
Y-o-Y in April 2017
Official inflation figures released indicated a 20 bps decline in the NCPI for April 2017.
Inflation for the month consequently amounted to 8.4% Y-o-Y (cf. +8.6% Y-o-Y in Mar’17) while on a M-o-M basis, the NCPI increased 1.3% (cf.-0.3% in Mar’17).
The Y-o-Y marginal decline was led primarily by reduced prices in the non-Food category, lowering Non- Food inflation to 5.9% in April 2017 from 6.7% in the previous month.
Despite the decline in non-food items, prices of Food items however, increased from 11.2% Y-o-Y in March 2017 to 11.8% Y-o-Y.
Key contributors to the decrease in the Non-Food group include ‘Alcoholic Beverages, Tobacco & Narcotics’ (-8.1% Y-o-Y) and ‘Clothing & Footwear’ (-0.2% Y-o-Y), while sub-categories ‘Housing, Water Electricity & Other Fuels ‘and ‘Transport’ too recorded price decreases in April 2017 (-0.1% Y-o-Y and -2.0% Y-o-Y respectively).
On the external front meanwhile, CBSL data indicated, that trade deficit between Jan-Feb’17 widened by 35.4% largely due to decline in industrial exports (-6.5% Y-o-Y) and higher expenditure on intermediate goods (crude oil and refined petroleum) (+25.3% Y-o-Y).
Conversely tourism receipts declined marginally (-0.1% Y-o-Y) and remittances increased moderately (2.6% Y-o-Y) while gross official reserves by end-Feb stood at USD 5.6 Bn cf. USD 5.5Bn in Jan.
