Hayleys Fabric heading in positive direction

Hayleys Fabric made a profit of US$ 95,854 during the second quarter ended September 30, 2017.
This is an improvement on the first quarter although the company is at a cumulative loss of US$ 66,794 for the first half ending September 30, 2017.
The main contributory factor for the loss was the unprecedented floods which hampered the production in the first quarter.
The outlook for the next quarter amidst an increase in raw material costs looks positive with an order book with better margins with production from new machinery also coming into operation.
The enhancement of the Printing facility with Reactive printing and the commencement of sublimation printing, embossing facilities would enhance the company’s product offering to attract a higher market share.
