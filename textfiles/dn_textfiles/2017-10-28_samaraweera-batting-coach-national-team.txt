Samaraweera batting coach of national team?

Former Sri Lanka batsman Thilan Samaraweera is tipped to take over as the batting coach of the Sri Lanka team for next month’s tour of India.
Another former Sri Lanka cricketer Hashan Tillakaratne is currently the batting coach on the tour to UAE and Pakistan where the Sri Lanka team has had mixed fortunes winning the Test series 2-0 but losing the ODI series 5-0 and the first T20I of a three-match series on Thursday.
Much of Sri Lanka’s defeats in the one-day format have been due to poor batting performances which has seen them suffer 14 defeats in a row in fifty-over and T20 internationals since July this year.
Samaraweera a technically sound batsman and accumulator of over 5000 Test runs at an average of 48 was the batting consultant for the Bangladesh team until the Champions trophy in England in June this year.
Sri Lanka will play a series of three Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is during their tour to India.
