Smurfs: The Lost Village: Simple story,  slapstick  humour

After two previous movies which tried to woo the audience into becoming Smurf fans and failing in their efforts, one wonders why the makers haven’t put their efforts to rest and sued their time and efforts to explore new territories. However 2017 brings the third Smurf movie to the screen in the form of 'Smurfs: The Lost Village'.
The reboot tries to salvage the dismal run of its predecessors. This time they filmmakers try to kindle some interest by introducing a new Smurf tribe. However, yet again the story fails them. The sworn enemy of the Smurfs, Gargamel, is up to his evil deeds again. He recaptures his invention, the first female Smurf named Smurfette and gets information about a secret Smurf village out of her. After breaking out of his prison Smurfette is guilt struck and together with Clumsy Smurf, Brainy Smurf and Hefty Smurf, she embarks on a journey to worn the inhabitants of the other village.
More for the kids
Based on Belgian artist, Peyo’s, 1958 creation ‘Smurfs: The Lost Village’ is directed by Raja Gosnell. The film opens with introductions to the Smurfs as they go about their business in their pretty village. There is Vanity, Jokey, Farmer, Nosey, Brainy, Clumsy, and Hefty Smurf. The wise Papa Smurf looks protectively over them. Smurfette is the exception - the only girl Smurf in the village.
As in the previous Smurf movies, 'Smurfs: The Lost Village' too is more for the kids. There is nothing unique about the Smurfs who lead the show because they and their traits have already familiarized to the audience via the previous films. The villain remains a weakling and generates no fear. He and his cat are too caricatured to make is seem realistic.
The only plus point is that the filmmakers have decided to stick with computer animation this time round. The previous movies were a mixture of live action as well as animation, making a total mess of the visuals in the projects.
Demi Lovato who voices for Smurfette stands out but the rest of the voice cast including Julia Roberts are insignificant. Ellie Kemper is an exception. She as Smurf Blossom manages well as the excitable and energetic girl Smurf who welcomes the new comers to their world.
Riotously funny moments
The film does contain some riotously funny moments, but these are sadly few and far between. A sequel, as it seems, is already underway. This is not enticing news for animation movie buffs who would like to feast their eyes on something new.
Some movies are much looked to franchises but filmmakers should know when to call it quits when productions keep on generating dismal audience reaction.
The previous Smurf movies have tanked at the box office and this one seems to be following their route. Maybe it is time that ‘The Smurfs’ calls it a day.
