Point of view
Equity markets fell to a one-year low of 6028 points this week before recovering ~19 points to close marginally stronger at 6047.8 points.
The benchmark ASPI made consecutive losses between Monday and Thursday, losing ~56 points amid weak sentiment and rate concerns to hit a low of 6028 points on Thursday.
Strong institutional and HNI interest on Friday however, helped the Index pare down some of its early losses. Friday’s crossings in Blue-Chips and mid-caps accounted for ~62% of the week’s total crossings of LKR 1.2Bn; Crossings for the week however, were notably lower than that of the last two week (44% of total market turnover cf. 52% last week and 72% the week prior) helping push the average daily turnover on the bourse ~29.4% lower to LKR 0.55Bn (cf. LKR 0.78Bn last week).
Net foreign flows to equities meanwhile continued for the 7th consecutive week, although 67% lower than last week. The net inflows were despite the US Fed’s widely anticipated decision to raise interest rates by 25 Bps (to 0.75%-1%) for the 3rd time in a decade.
Emerging market stocks reacted positively to the expected rate hike and the US Fed’s dovish outlook for the future path of US rates rising to 20-month highs1. Although average risk premiums on EM sovereign debt also tightened as markets perceived the Fed’s decision and tone positively, the normalization of US Fed rates prompted several EM central banks (China, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait & Bahrain) to also increase rates.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look to look for cue from the CBSL’s upcoming policy rate decision next week.
Q4’16 GDP rebounds but full year growth
GDP growth in Q4’16 rebounded to 5.3% Y-o-Y, up from the 2.8% Y-o-Y growth recorded in Q4’15 and 4.6% Y-o-Y recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2016. Growth over the quarter was driven by the Industry sector which grew 9.2% Y-o-Y over the quarter relative to 1.1% Y-o-Y recorded in Q4’15 with Construction sector activity continuing its recovery (15.5% Y-o-Y cf. -0.9% Y-o-Y in Q4’15) over the period.
The Services sector too grew 4.6% Y-o-Y over Q4’16 in line with performance in Q3’16 but higher than the 3.2% Y-o-Y growth recorded in the comparable period a year ago.
However, the continued impact of the drought in Q4’16 had an adverse impact on the country’s rice, vegetables and cereal production, pushing growth from the Agricultural sector sharply lower over the quarter (-8.4% Y-o-Y vs. +0.5% Y-o-Y in Q4’15).
Sri Lanka’s full year 2016 GDP growth meanwhile, fell to 4.4% Y-o-Y (cf. 4.8% Y-o-Y in 2015) in line with the CBSL, IMF and World Bank estimates of 4.5-5.0% Y-o-Y. Growth over 2016 was the country’s weakest performance since 2013 (3.4% Y-o-Y) and is primarily attributable to the impact from the combination of floods in Q2’16 and drought in the remaining quarters.
The Agricultural sector consequently recorded a slowdown of -4.2% Y-o-Y (cf. +4.8% Y-o-Y in Q4’15).
Although slower than in 2015 ((+4.2% Y-o-Y cf. +5.7% Y-o-Y in 2015), growth in Services activities remained buoyant, supported by improvements in financial services, and wholesale and retail trade activities.
Industry sector growth meanwhile, grew strongly in 2016 (+6.7% Y-o-Y cf. 2.1% Y-o-Y) with considerable contribution from the construction sector rebound and notable growth in manufacturing, and mining and quarrying activities.
