India win U19 four-day test series 2-0
Sri Lanka suffer another innings rout

Siddharth Desai who plays for Gujarat in India’s Ranji trophy first-class competition took four wickets for 40 runs with his slow left-arm orthodox spin to rout Sri Lanka for 150 in the second innings and give India a thumping win by an innings and 147 runs in the second Under 19 four-day test concluded at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Hambantota yesterday. The win gave India the two-match Under 19 series 2-0. India won the first test also by an innings at the P Sara Oval.
Sri Lanka who put up a good batting performance in the first innings totaling 316 in reply to India’s mammoth score of 613-8 declared began the fourth and final day at 47-3 collapsed in their second innings unable to make much headway against the experienced Indian bowling line up.
Apart from Nuwanidu Fernando’s score of 28 and Sandun Mendis’ contribution of 26 none of the other batsmen could put up much resistance and folded up tamely.
The two sides will meet in a five-match Under 19 one-day limited-over series starting at P Sara Oval on July 30.
