A national batting crisis looms

In their long cricketing history Sri Lanka is one country that was never fallen short of quality batsmen. When you say quality it is right from the top drawer. In the pre-Test era there was starting with FC de Saram a stream of top class batters like Sargo Jayawickrama, Mahadevan Sathasivam, Mahes Rodrigo, Ivers Gunasekera, Michael Tissera and Anura Tennekoon to name a few. They were followed in the post-Test era by names such as Sidath Wettimuny, Roy Dias, Duleep Mendis, Arjuna Ranatunga, Aravinda de Silva, Sanath Jayasuriya, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.
There was a time in the eighties after Sri Lanka had gained Test status the batting was so enriched with top quality batsmen that there was no room for any batsman playing in that era to break into the Test side. The only slot that had a weak link was for an opener to partner Sidath Wettimuny. The line up comprised Wettimuny, Ranjan Madugalle, Roy Dias, Arjuna Ranatunga, Duleep Mendis, Aravinda de Silva. Such was the talent that was available that Roshan Mahanama if he was to play for his country had to sacrifice his position as a middle order batsman which he was at school and play in the position as an opener. That Mahanama made such a wise decision saw him represent his country for 13 years and play in 52 Tests and 213 ODIs.
However the retirements of Jayawardene and Sangakkara in the past one year has suddenly exposed the paucity of quality batsmen in the national team. With the exception of captain Angelo Mathews who looks like the last of the breed, there seems to be a big void for the national selectors to fill in trying to find batsmen of class. Suddenly it seems that we have a bowling unit that can win matches for us but not a batting line up good enough to put runs on the board for the bowlers.
The problems faced by the national selectors were quite clearly defined by its chairman Kapila Wijegunawardene when he said ahead of picking the squad to New Zealand: "We had batsmen who were very good at playing fast bowling and spin bowling suddenly we are finding that most of our leading batsmen are very weak against spin. That is something for the coaches to address as a matter of priority.
"One of the reasons is perhaps the type of wickets that we've been playing and the general format of the local tournaments does not encourage batsmen to play long innings. It's a process, you need to do it and figure out how to do it on a consistent basis if our local tournaments don't encourage batsmen to occupy the crease and instill a discipline in them how to play long innings.
"In Test cricket basically its occupation of the crease and then playing the percentages, playing only the balls that you really need to play. If you occupy the crease naturally the runs are going to flow. It is a real concern which we need to address as a matter of priority."
The advent of T20 cricket has in some way affected the way build up of a cricketer to Test level. For instance whereas players like Jayawardene and Sangakkara had a solid foundation of first-class cricket before they stepped into the international fold the same cannot be said of the present generation of cricketers who sometimes make their international mark playing T20 cricket before branching into the Test arena.
Wijegunawardene agreed that a Test player has got a set of skills required to adapt to any other format but ruled out the fact that limited-over cricket had anything to do with the quality of a batsman. He said why certain modern day cricketers have started their international careers playing T20 or one-day cricket is due to the openings coming up in those formats and not for any other reason.
"In Test sides the vacancies arise infrequently compared to the other two formats. That is the reason why some of the younger players have got opportunities playing in the T20 and ODIs before they can actually be tried out in Tests," said Wijegunawardene. "Take Milinda Siriwardana he played first in ODIs not because he was not identified for Test cricket but due to the openings coming out ahead of the Tests.
"The weakness really is the tournament format that we play in our school most of the tournaments at junior level are structured on a limited-over basis that possibly limits the usage of feet and everything in a game because you are constantly looking at restricting runs and batsmen are always looking to play fancy shots and push the run rate up. That is a concern.
We need to have players learning to occupy the crease using their feet. Using the feet is one area where we really need to improve. If you are not using your feet then you are going to struggle against spin bowling that is something that we are lacking. We had batsmen in the caliber of Arjuna Ranatunga and Mahela Jayawardene who play spin with ease. We need to really work on our footwork otherwise we are going to constantly struggle against spin bowling which is not a good thing going forward because every side is now using spin against us," he said.
Wijegunawardene's observations should be taken quite seriously if Sri Lanka is to avoid a batting crisis and not fall into the pitfalls that countries like West Indies and Zimbabwe have fallen into.
