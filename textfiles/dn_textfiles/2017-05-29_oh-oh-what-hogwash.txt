Oh! Oh! What Hogwash!

We are greatly indebted to a very popular TV channel which aired a clip, describing it as a Luxury Car Show. The cars belonging to our hardly working ministers were seen driving into the Presidential Secretariat, for swearing in before the President. It is unbelievable that these are the very same characters who begged for our vote in order to see to OUR well-being, have absolutely no conscience to acquire and flaunt such fabulously expensive cars.
The make and cost of each vehicle was clearly indicated on the TV screen. These vehicles were in the range of Rs 25 - Rs 45 million. As to how they earned this kind of money within the space of two years is mind boggling indeed or in all probability these are expensive gifts to them in return for their support? It is very obvious they are very efficient in looking after themselves.
A businessman cum minister had the audacity to declare that ministers spent only Rs7.5 million to purchase a vehicle. What hogwash is this and whom is he trying to hoodwink? The Public Finance Committee should have put a stop to this unbelievable spending on luxury vehicles a long time ago. Anyway, it’s better late than never.
A so called LASER pandal (world record of course) with a seemingly ugly looking white cloth was on the Galle Face Green. There were banners with the minister’s name in bold print surrounding this monstrosity, and sacrilegiously placed beside the sacred Buddhist flag.
This was an insult to Buddhism, purely to glorify himself. We cannot forget the fiasco of the Tallest Christmas Tree in the World, a couple of months ago. These are very costly and cheap jokes, which are heaped on us the citizens, in order to glorify themselves.
We heard about the colossal amount spent by the Chief Minister Western Province on three overseas jaunts. What did the country gain by these expensive trips? Was he able to find a solution to the most pressing problem of garbage management and disposal?
Why can’t the present lot of corrupt ministers and officials at least take a leaf from President Premadasa’s book? He did make mistakes but one cannot forget his dedication and contribution towards the development and well-being of the people. He made the minimum number of foreign trips and harnessed all available assets for the well-being of Sri Lanka.
What about the Dengue epidemic that is raging? There should have been a separate ministry to tackle this deadly problem which is expected to get worse with the monsoon. But, the new ministries with new names have no significance towards OUR crying needs. The constant strikes by the doctors, who hold the poor patients to ransom, are just to satisfy their perverse mind set. They have forgotten that each and every citizen has paid for their education - and is this the manner in which they show their gratitude?
Every single person in government should remember that this seemingly comfortable BUBBLE they are in at present is temporary and will burst, as it did two years ago for THAT brazen regime. Perhaps they should all go back to school and acquire at least an O/L pass? What remedy is there for absolute power that has absolutely corrupted these puny personalities?
A suggested solution is a genuinely caring leadership creating a satisfied majority...as in Singapore? As in Brunei, where the leader has everything money can buy but his citizens are cared for, untaxed etc? And Dubai among others? Oh! Sri Lanka!
