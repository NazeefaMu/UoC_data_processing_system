Hemas Hospitals celebrates Vesak

Hemas Hospitals organized a number of activities for this year’s Vesak celebrations on a grand scale, with the lighting of colourful lanterns, dhamma sermons, a pirith ceremony and dansals.
Hemas Hospital Wattala and Thalawathugoda as well as Hemas Laboratory Services took part in Hemas Group’s annual Vesak celebrations ‘Hemas Vesak Kalapaya’, which commenced parallel to the Sri Buddha Rashmi Vesak Kalapayaby Hunupitiya Gangarama Temple.
These creations were entirely designed and crafted by staff members from each establishment. Members from the hospital chain also took part in a ‘Bhakthi Gee’ recital, which had staff members from different ethnic backgrounds and religious denominations.
Commenting about their role during the Vesak season, Dr Lakith Peiris, Managing Director of Hemas Hospitals commented, “Complete healing of a self means the perfect synergy between mind, body and soul. While it is of utmost significance as it marks three major events in the life of Lord Buddha, Vesak season brings peace and calmness to every human being—regardless of their religion or race—and translates the importance of unifying your mind, body and soul. I highly believe that the activities Hemas Hospitals organized for this year’s Vesak has helped many Sri Lankans to heal their souls significantly.”
“It is always a pleasure to be present and share the joy of this meritorious celebration, which continues to serve as a vibrant platform to showcase the outstanding creativity of our staff who have actively come together—regardless of their race or religion—in the planning and organizing of the activities, thereby creating close-knit community with passionate team spirit,” he commented further.
Hemas Southern Hospital Galle organized an all-night Pirith ceremony under the guidance of Sri Sudharmalaye Panangala Hemaloka Thera, which was held at the hospital premises, followed by an alms giving ceremony for 17 monks.
Hemas Hospitals’ chain has planned to organize a string of activities for Poson Full Moon Poya Day as well, including a ‘Poson Kalapaya’ at their Watalla hospital and a ‘Maha Bath Dansala’ in Thalawathugoda.
