Treasure hunting attempt foiled, cab seized

Wildlife officers took into custody a cab in the Lunugamvehera National park
When the officers attempted to stop the cab, its driver had sped up. The officers then opened fire at the cab but the suspects had escaped.
The cab was reportedly owned by a brother of a Wildlife officer.
They were allegedly on their way treasure hunting to a place called Akkara Panaha in the Lunugamvehera National Park, sources said. A teacher from Matara and a resident of Nedigamvila in Tissamaharama were among the suspects, the sources said.
