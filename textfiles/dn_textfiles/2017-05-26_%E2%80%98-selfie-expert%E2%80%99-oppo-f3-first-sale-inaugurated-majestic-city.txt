‘The Selfie Expert’ OPPO F3 first sale  inaugurated at Majestic City

The F3 First Sale begins from May 13 in multiple cities across Sri Lanka. It will be available at all OPPO offline stores across Sri Lanka, at a reasonable price.
Taking selfies a step further, the much awaited and upgraded Group Selfie Expert OPPO F3 was recently launched in the Sri Lankan market. Pre-orders were taken across Sri Lanka from May 5-13.
The F3 is the second in line dual front camera Selfie Expert targeted towards the Group Selfie generation after the recently launched F3 Plus. The First Sale was inaugurated in Majestic City in Colombo.
The brand also had a lucky draw through the pre-order entries and announced that lucky winners had won themselves an opportunity to get signed cricket bats by Angelo Mathew and many other gifts.
“Sri Lankans have continuously embraced every Camera phone that we have launched so far and this is true to our latest launch of OPPO F3 as well. Enthusiasm shown for OPPO F3 here in Sri Lanka is tremendous from the launch to the Pre-Order period and I am confident that OPPO F3 will take Sri Lanka by storm,” said Tom Zou, CEO, OPPO Sri Lanka.
Set to be the next ultimate ‘Selfie Expert,’ the F3 features a dual front camera - a 16-megapixel Selfie camera for individual selfies and a wide-angle lens for the group selfie.
The F3 gets a higher energy density 3200mAh battery which gives you even longer endurance. In our real use simulation test, it lasted for about 15 hours! That means, it can save you the inconvenience of bringing the heavy power-bank or look for chargers again and again on your trip.
The F3 is equipped with an octa-core processor, 4 GB RAM, and 64 GB ROM backed by the ColorOS 3.0, assuring a seamless and snappy performance. The embedded triple-slot card tray allows two nano-SIM cards and a microSD card to work simultaneously.
With a lighter and thinner 5.5-inch body, the F3 contributes to a matchlessly comfortable grip.
