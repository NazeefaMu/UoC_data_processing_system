The International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) is a global coalition of regulators, investors, companies, standard setters, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) which includes the accounting profession and NGOs.

This year CMA Excellence in Integrated Reporting Awards has the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as its Supporting Partner. With this linkage we are hopeful will have a positive impact in promoting Integrated Reporting among public quoted companies and its implementation. The International President of IFAC, Rachel Grimes in her message for the CMA Excellence in <IR> Awards 2018 has stated: “In today’s technology driven environment, the evolving demands of organizations and citizens require professional accountants to contribute to the management and reporting of value creation in a way that drives both growth and corporate responsibility.” “The future accountant needs to provide information and analysis that supports decisions about all aspects of an organisation. A professional accountant in business or the public sector needs to be able to answer the question, ‘What is driving value creation and preservation in the present and future, and how is my organization responding to opportunities and risks?’.”
