Wild elephant attacks in Ampara on the rise

Elephant rampages in the border villages of the Ampara district are on the rise and people living in those areas are at risk. The Alayadivembu DS Division in the Ampara district is one of the worst affected areas and residents of the area were in no position to celebrate the Deepavali festival in a peaceful atmosphere due to the fear of elephants.
A herd of elephants entered the village of Santhipuram in the Alayadivembu Division on Friday at midnight, attacking houses and ransacking paddy stocks, rice reserved for daily consumption and other eatables. As the villagers were vigilant at that time, they used the back gates of their houses and saved their lives by hiding in government buildings. The villagers' subsidiary food crop cultivations too were destroyed severely by the elephants.
Residents said that out of the 20 houses of their village that came under attack, six houses were severely damaged. They added that the elephant threat has been there for years and several appeals were made to the respective authorities by them to solve their outstanding problems, but no permanent solutions had yet been taken. Electric fences erected by Wildlife Officials in certain areas are of no use, they lamented.
