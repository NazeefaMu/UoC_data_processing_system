President to appoint committee on Meethotamulla

 
President Sirisena this morning said he would appoint a committee, headed by a judge, to ensure non-recurrence of incidents like Meethotamulla.
On Friday, April 14, a section of the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed on residents, killing 32, with several more still missing.
Although the problem of garbage at Meethotamulla is a long-standing issue, the present government yesterday took responsibility for the disaster, as it was under their watch that the incident took place.
