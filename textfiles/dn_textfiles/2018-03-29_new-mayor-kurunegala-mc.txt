New Mayor for Kurunegala MC

Newly elected Mayor Thusara Sanjeewa Vitharana (SLPP) became the Mayor of Kurunegala Municipal Council with a majority of two votes.
Newly appointed Thusara Sanjeewa Vitharana obtained 11 votes and the UNP candidate Waruna Premarathne obtained nine votes.
Vitharana’s name was proposed by Sumith Udawasala and seconded by Dhammika Kumari.
The UNP candidate Premarathne’s name was proposed by G. Livera and seconded by B. Ellepola.
The special meeting was held at the Kurunegala Municipal Council conference hall, presided by the NWP Local Government Commissioner.
SLPP Councillor Sumith Udawasala was selected as the Deputy Mayor of Kurunegala.
The Mayor, addressing the gathering, said that Kurunegala was regarded in the past as an unclean town, without a proper sewage system, with a stench emanating from the gutters due to the stagnant water which had become breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
He said this must change and that steps would be taken to clean up the city environs.
