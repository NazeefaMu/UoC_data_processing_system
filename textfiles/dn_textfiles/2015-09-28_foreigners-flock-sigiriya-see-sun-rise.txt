Foreigners flock to Sigiriya to see sun rise

The Central Cultural Fund allowed tourists to view the sun-rise from the top of Sigiriya rock from September 27 - 28 to celebrate the World Tourists Day.
They were allowed to climb the rock fortress at 5.00 a.m. and view the sun-rise. Many foreigners climbed the rock to get a glimpse of the spectacle while a few locals too were sighted on top of the rock waiting to see the rising sun. All facilities needed by tourists were provided by the authorities.
Meanwhile, some tourists were seen viewing the sun-rise standing on their head.
