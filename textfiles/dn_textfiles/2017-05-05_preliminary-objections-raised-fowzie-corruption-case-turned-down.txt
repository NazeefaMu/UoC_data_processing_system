Preliminary objections raised by Fowzie in corruption case turned down

 
Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara turned down the preliminary objections raised by State Minister of National Integration and Reconciliation A.H.M. Fowzie today, regarding a corruption case filed against him and fixed the case for trial to be heard on July 27.    
 The Bribery Commission filed a corruption case against the State Minister for allegedly causing a Rs.1.07 million unlawful loss to the government by misusing a vehicle belonging to the Disaster Management Centre.
 President's Counsel Shavindra Fernando with counsel E. Kandappa appearing for the State Minister had raised preliminary objections on the basis of duplicity of charges.
 The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this corruption case against the State Minister under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
 The Bribery Commission alleged that State Minister Fowzie had unlawfully utilised a Land Cruiser Jeep belonging to the Disaster Management Centre between 2010 and 2015, while he was serving as a Senior Minister during the previous regime.
The value of the vehicle was estimated to be Rs. 19.5 million.
