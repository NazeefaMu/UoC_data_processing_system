China will always stand by Sri Lanka: Chinese Minister

A group of representatives of the Chinese Communist Party said that China will stand with Sri Lanka as a true friend in the future too.
They made this remark when a group of senior members of the Chinese Communist Party including the head of the International Liaison Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Song Tao met with President Maithripala Sirisena at the President’s official residence yesterday.
During the meeting it was discussed in detail regarding enhancing the long standing relationship between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Chinese Communist Party and attention was focused on increasing the number of meetings between the two parties.
The Chinese Communist Party invited a delegation of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to participate in a Conference which is to be held next June in China.
The President pointed out that enhancing the relationship between the SLFP and the Chinese Communist Party is very important for the relationship between the two countries, and added that his aim is to take the SLFP foward as a clean political party and a better political movement. President Sirisena recalled with gratitude the assistance given by the Chinese Government for development projects in Sri Lanka and said that those mega development projects will contribute towards the building of the country’s economy.
The President also said that the Government’s aim is to strengthen China-Sri Lanka relations in every sphere.
President Sirisena further said that the construction work of the fully-fledged Kidney Hospital, to which the Government of China has agreed to provide funding at his request, will begin later this year. Chinese Communist Party representatives appreciated the initiatives taken by the President to develop the country while building harmony among the communities as well. They thanked the President for carrying out the development projects in Sri Lanka supported by the Chinese Government in a transparent and successful manner.
