Why comics?

Marvel Studios is currently filming two Avengers sequels in one more or less unbroken block – well over a year of shooting at the cost of more than a billion dollars. Star salaries are a big part of the price; Robert Downey Jr will reportedly make over $100 million, with more than twenty other A-list actors in the mix. Downey starred in Iron Man (2008), which Kevin Feige, Marvel Studio’s president, described as “the beginning of our MCU” (“Marvel Cinematic Universe”, for those not in the superhero know).
The sixteen MCU movies to date have racked up over $12 billion in worldwide box office takings. It isn’t clear what that means in profits to Marvel and its partners, given production, marketing and distribution costs, along with backend payments to actors and others, but the willingness to chuck another billion into two movies indicates Marvel has done very well by adapting comic books. On June 29, Box Office Mojo listed twenty-nine comic book adaptations to be released over the next few years. Sony, Warner Brothers and Fox join Disney, Marvel’s chief partner, with multiple entries.
Inevitable impace
The turn to comic book movies seems born of marketing necessity. Box-office stagnation in North America, a much-noted phenomenon, is driving Hollywood’s push into foreign markets. This has an inevitable impact on the type of movie produced, as Derek Thompson observed in the Atlantic. “The necessity to create a single product for a global crowd encourages studios to produce the artistic equivalent of Rosetta Stones, interpretable for many tongues.
There is no language in the world more universal than heroes destroying bad guys with explosions.” Steven Soderbergh, in his keynote address to the 2013 San Francisco International Film Festival, stressed the artistic downside: “Obviously the bigger the budget, the more people this thing is going to have to appeal to, the more homogenized it’s got to be, the more simplified it’s got to be. So things like cultural specificity and narrative complexity, and, God forbid, ambiguity, those become real obstacles to the success of the film here and abroad”.
Complexity and ambiguity were standard components of the fondly remembered films of the 1970s. Film financiers had reason not to mind. Taxi Driver (1976) was made for a little over a million dollars and brought in more than twenty times as much at the box office. The Godfather (1972), wildly over budget at $6 million, brought in $138 million in its initial release. France may support its movies with a billion dollars a year in funding, and quotas on foreign films, but the six major Hollywood studios and the couple dozen smaller American movie-makers are fuelled by profits.
Dollop of censorship
The average cost for a major motion picture is now about $60 million before marketing costs, and it seems like comic book movies can’t be made for less than $100 million.
China will have 80,000 movie theatres by 2021, twice the North American count. If simplification and, in the case of places like China, a dollop of censorship are the price, Hollywood is in. We will look the other way if the occasional Nobel Peace Prize winner suffers long imprisonment, death in captivity and a closed-door funeral. Umberto Eco would have expected no less. Writing in The Myth of Superman (1962) about the politics of the comic books on which these movies are based, Eco rhetorically asked why Superman didn’t use his powers to find “the solution of hunger problems” or “to liberate six hundred million Chinese from the yoke of Mao?”
He concluded that Superman was reactive instead of proactive as a way of maintaining the (capitalist) status quo. “He is busy by preference, not against blackmarket drugs, nor, obviously, against corrupt administrators and politicians, but against bank and mail-truck robbers. In other words, the only visible form that evil assumes is an attempt on private property”.
This was good for the serial return of comic book heroes – there is an endless supply of common criminals to be pursued and captured – but led to narrative stasis. By simply battling bad guy after bad guy rather than tilling “uninhabited regions” or destroying “inhuman systems”, Eco argues, comic books are “deprived of narrative development” and the superhero, “by definition the hero whom nothing can impede, finds himself in the worrisome narrative situation of being a hero without an adversary and therefore without the possibility of any development”.
Superhero Movies
Critics have been making the same points ever since. “The Superhero Franchise: Where traditional movie stardom goes to die” (New York Times, 2016) and “The Reason Why Hollywood Makes So Many Boring Superhero Movies” (the Atlantic, 2014) are just a couple of typical mainstream press headlines. A recent headline in the Guardian compared the rise of Donald Trump to “America’s need for superheroes”. And Keith A. Spencer points out on Salon that:
with few exceptions, superhero blockbusters read as if they were underwritten by the American Enterprise Institute. That’s because nearly all superhero movies glorify wealth (and the freedom it provides), aristocracy and/or monarchy, militarism, unilateralism, and right-wing fantasies about criminality.
The billion dollar Avengers movies were filming in Atlanta this spring, where I was line producing a comparatively moderately budgeted Christmas comedy. Atlanta is a good place to make movies, providing a decent crew base, lots of stage space, plenty of hotels and short-term housing, good restaurants and a variety of location looks. Most crucially, though, the city is located in Georgia, a state with a film tax credit that allows Hollywood studios to get back close to 30 per cent of what they spend in the state, including payments to actors and other above-the-line types, such as producers and directors.
A number of other states offer film tax credits but none currently includes above the line spending, has no caps on actor salaries, and gives a 30 per cent credit. In Georgia, after a movie is finished and an audit is performed, the production company is issued a tax certificate, which can be used against the company’s own tax bill or can be sold at a discount to a tax-paying entity. For budgeting purposes, we assume the credit will be sold and we’ll get 90 cents or so on the dollar, or about 27 per cent of the production spend. That’s an enormous and rare benefit. It will save my Christmas movie millions of dollars – it will save the Avengers films vastly more.
