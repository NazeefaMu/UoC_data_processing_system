How to look     good  wwithout  make-up

We can’t get enough of looking good with make-up every time we step out. Be it a bright lipstick colour or a swipe of concealer to hide your acne, don’t we woman rely on make-up every day?
And that’s when we start believing that we hardly look good without those layers of foundations and the coats of mascara. And let’s face it, your face needs a make-up detox so that your skin can breathe. We’ve rounded up some beauty tips you can try on your detox to look good without make-up:
<U+200B>Sunscreen is a must
While you’re on this detox, don’t forget your basic skincare rituals. Make sure you always apply sunscreen 15 minutes before stepping out.
<U+200B>Try a tinted moisturizer
If you think your face looks too dull, you can rely on a tinted moisturiser for medium coverage. Keep those high coverage foundations only for the big occasions.
Hot lemon water
Drink a hot cup of water with fresh lemon in the morning. This morning ritual will flush out the toxins and purify your body and give you a glowing skin.
Stay hydrated
For healthy and glowing skin, make sure you stay hydrated. Drink lots of water during the day. TNN
