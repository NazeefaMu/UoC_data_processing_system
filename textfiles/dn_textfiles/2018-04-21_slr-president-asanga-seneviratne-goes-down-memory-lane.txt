The Bradby Shield :
SLR president Asanga Seneviratne goes down memory lane

My first experience of the Bradby Shield was when I ventured over to Longdon Place, the home of rugby one hot Saturday afternoon in June 1982. The ground was packed to capacity. It was an extremely close match. Both defences were outstanding. The scores stood at 9-6 in favour of Trinity.
In the last minute of extra time, Sriyan Cooray the Royal scrum half made a break and was clear and seemed certain to score with no defence in sight.
As he dived for the line the Trinity full back Dushanth Wijesinghe came from nowhere and made an unbelievable tackle that saved the try and the match for Trinity.
Both players were carried off to hospital and the 2nd leg at Nitawella was even closer, with Trinity managing to sneak thru 6-4 in pouring rain.
The Bradby Shield is the blue riband of Sri Lanka rugby and easily the most look forward to rugby encounter in the country.
The 73-year-old tradition will see over 20,000 spectators converge onto the Royal and Pallekele stadiums.
The players who will turnout in this monumental encounter follow a rich tradition of camaraderie, loyalty and sportsmanship and are the envy of every single school boy and fan.
There is no doubt that Royal and Trinity have produced the finest rugby union players this country has seen.
I love the passion in which Trinity play their rugby and they always make the game look so easy. Some of the finest ball players have been produced by them and rugby is second nature to them. Royal has always been excellent at whatever sport they competed in and will never give away an encounter. They are always the side to beat and have handled the pressure over the years with true Royal grit!
The 80’s was filled with Royalists and Trinitians dominating rugby in Sri Lanka as they had done since the 50’s.
Whilst it is unfair to single out a few I have to mention some of the gentlemen who have played an influential role in any life and helped so many, and contributed immensely to the development of rugby in our country.
My first coaches at CR & FC were all Royalists, Lionel Almeida who was probably one of the finest three quarters, the “fastest man in Asia” and perennial coach Summa Navaratne doing the fitness and Malik Samarawickrama planning and taking sessions and getting the side together. Ajit Abeyratne (Trinity) was my first national coach and pastor. CPP Abeygunawardena (Royal) my first captain at CR and Rohantha Peiris (Royal), DiIlip Ardihetty (Trinity) are legends I played under. My teammates included Hiran Muttiah, Sriyan Cooray, Kapila Ariyaratne, Janaka Lenaduwa, Ajit Weeratunge, Ajit Gunasekera, Wimal Epparachichi, Mahendra Navaratnam, Sarinda Unamboowe (all from Royal), Pradeep Adihetty, Inthi Marikar, Shah Doole and Thushara Weerasooriya (Trinity). We also had Saman Jayasinghe, Iqbal Hassen, Haron Musafer, Sujantha Sukumar, Junaideen, Srideran, Rabba Gunasekera turning out for CH & FC and Sri Lanka and I used to play touch rugby almost daily with them before cricket practices at CCC!
This rich blend of Royalists and Trinitians had some things in common which I believe are the hallmarks of both sets of old boys.
First and foremost they had character, a trait we struggle to come by in this day and age. The hallmarks of these gentlemen were loyalty, honesty, hard work, a great sense of humour and they never gave up. I am honoured to have known and associated with so many.
The Bradby is marked by festivity and traditional gatherings.
I probably am the only non old boy to have attended the Royal Bradby dinner on no less than 4 occasions! This, in my capacity as president of Sri Lanka Rugby and it has always been a night to remember! Stanley Unamboowe, who was my uncle's classmate, in one of his speeches, openly questioned my credentials to be a Thomian when my father’s entire family attended Royal!
Sri Lanka rugby was built round the Bradby Shield.
The contribution from both institutions is legendary and never be forgotten!
I wish both teams the very best and God’s Blessings.
Esto Perpetua Royal and Trinity!
