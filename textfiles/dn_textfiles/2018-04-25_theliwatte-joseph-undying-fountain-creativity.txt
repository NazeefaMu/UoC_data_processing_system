Theliwatte Joseph, undying fountain of creativity

An icon in Lankan Hill Country Tamil Literature and a resource person, in overall command of Lankan Tamil Literature, this writer of Indian origin is doing something worthwhile even in his 80s. He was born in an estate called Uva Kaddawela near Hali Ela in Badulla district on February 16, 1934. His father was Santhansamy, a teacher and taught In Tiruchirappalli in Thamilnadu. He came down to Lanka as a teacher. Joseph studied in Lanka up to grade 5 and along with his elder brother he went to Kumbakonam in Tamilnadu to study for three years and returned to Lanka to continue his studies at Badulla’s St Peter’s College
He started writing in the 1950s but he couldn’t’ establish his identity as a personality to be reckoned with. But when the Virakesari started a page called “Thota Manjari” covering the lifestyle and culture including literature and the arts, Joseph contributed a few articles. A journalist from Hatton, the late Kaarmegam compiled the popular page.
In 1963, he wrote a feature for two weeks in the Virakesari titled” Paaddi Sonna Kathai” (the Story that the grandmother told). He got the first prize in the competition held for hill country Tamil Writers. It’s more than 50 years old but the University dons recommend this story to their students.
It was only after 1966 that the Ministry of Culture and the Sahitya Mandalaya were established.
The notion that Lankan Tamil Literature is the same as Indian Tamil literature was dismissed. And the true identity of Lankan Tamil literature (and that includes the hill county Tamil literature) came to be reckoned with.
Thus, we see 84-year old writer’s contribution is great indeed and is proved by the following awards given to him.
