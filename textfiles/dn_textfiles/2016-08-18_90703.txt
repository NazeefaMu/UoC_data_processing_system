Avishka’s second century: gives Lanka clean sweep of ODI  series

 
 CANTERBURY: Another brilliant hundred from opener Avishka Fernando saw Sri Lanka pull off a 24-run win over England in the third and final Under 19 Youth ODI to make a clean 3-0 sweep of the three-match series at St Lawrence ground here on Tuesday.
Fernando slammed 15 fours and four sixes in his knock of 138 which came off 134 balls to follow his as Sri Lanka batting first hit up a challenging total of 300 in 49.1 overs. Fernando and fellow opener Dilan Jayalath (67) gave Sri Lanka a flying start by sharing an opening stand of 149 off 26 overs that laid the platform for Sri Lanka’s total.
At one time Sri Lanka were cruising at 256-1 in 42 overs before they lost their last nine wickets for 44 runs. England tried hard to chase down the runs but apart from half centuries from George Hankins and Ollie Pope no one else made any worthwhile contribution as the Lankan spinners once again took control.
Sri Lanka U19 : 300 in 49.1 overs (Dilan Jayalath 67, Avishka Fernando 138, Charith Asalanka 30, G Panayi 2/50, B Twohig 2/58, B Green 3/59)
England U19 : 276-9 in 50 overs (G Hankins 79, Z Malik 20, O Pope 87, D Bess 34 n.o., Lahiru Kumara 2/70, Hasaranga de Silva 3/39, Damitha Silva 2/47)
