Bank of Ceylon commemorates World Elders Day, Children’s Day

Commemorating the World elders and Children’s Day on October 1, 2018, the Bank of Ceylon sends a reminder about the importance of securing the financial future of both to ensure a respectable, blissful life ahead.
“With over 79 years of dedicated service to the nation Bank of Ceylon has set an unmatched record of being Sri Lanka’s No.1 Bank throughout these years and has provided a solid foundation for many generations. With the stability of a state Bank, BOC is the safest option available for anyone to invest in order to secure their future.” said Deputy General Manager Sales and Channel Management C. Amarasinghe.
Ran Kekulu is a children’s savings account from Bank of Ceylon which is focused on building a secure future for the child. It offers a wide range of financial and non-financial benefits through Ran Kekulu accounts, which can be operated without any risk.
This account provides an additional 1% interest and offers the account holder hospitalization/ medical insurance charges up to Rs. 100,000/- that covers 10 critical illnesses. Further an insurance cover is available for the depositor who opens the account up to a maximum of Rs 500,000/-.
The depositor becomes eligible for an insurance cover to a maximum of Rs. 1 million if he/she maintains multiple Ran Kekulu accounts depending on the account balance. Furthermore, 2,000 scholarships worth Rs. 15,000/- each are granted annually to Ran Kekulu account holders that emerge successful at the grade 5 scholarship examination. A minimum balance of Rs. 5,000/- maintained in a Ran Kekulu account qualifies the account holder for most of the privileges mentioned here.
Among array of banking products and services in order to cater to the different needs of children, “Power Plus” is an long-term investment plan that ensure the child a fixed amount at the age of 18, stipulated at the very opening of the account provided the account is maintained as agreed by the customer. The uniqueness in this scheme is that parents can actually aim for a specifically targeted balance rather than saving randomly not knowing, what the final balance might be.
A parent, guardian or any other individual can open the account on behalf of the child. In the case of no installment being made to the account either consecutively and/or intermittently the Bank will give a concession/grace period up to a maximum of 6 months or if it exceeds the grace period the outstanding will be transferred to a Ran Kekulu account under the name of the child.
14 Plus is another special savings account introduced for teenagers between the ages of 14-17.
The account was designed to give users the first hand experience in managing the account and to draw attention away from unwanted spending sprees that are common to this age group. A voluntary savings of pocket money is encouraged here at an early age and account holders are entitled to a BOC Debit Card to access their accounts from ATM’s island wide.
Bank of Ceylon’s Senior Citizens account can be considered the safest and the best offered account for senior citizens, which give them the deserving care to enjoy their golden age.
