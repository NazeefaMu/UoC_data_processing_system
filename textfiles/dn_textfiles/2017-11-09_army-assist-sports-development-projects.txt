Army to assist sports development projects

The Sports Ministry sought assistance from Sri Lanka Army to undertake development work and maintenance of Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex which is under renovation, aiming the 2021 South Asia Games. The agreement was announced after a discussion between Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake and Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara at the Sports Ministry recently.
The Army Commander assured Army’s full support to Sports Ministry’s future sport development projects and said that he will consider the possibility of releasing Army personnel attached to National Pools full time from duty on the request of Sports Minister, so they can commit more to their respective sport practices.
The Sports Minister said that they have taken the decision to hand over all construction projects to Army in order to complete them to the highest standard at a minimum cost. Developments of Diyagama sports complex will be done by the Army Engineers Regiment.
The North Province Sports Complex project in Kilinochchi will also be handed over to Army while the Kilinochchi Security Forces Headquarters has been assigned for immediate repairs and maintenance of the Sports Complex. Army will also help in the reconstruction project of Sri Lanka’s first Olympic medalist Duncan White’s house in Kandy.
The Army Commander pledged his willingness to provide more employment in the Army to young athletes who are selected to National Pools. He also said that he will establish a mechanism to use Army sports facilities in an effective manner to provide training for Provincial and National Pools. Army will also help to carry out sport and physical fitness programmes island-wide and assist the ‘Kreeda Shakthi’ programme.
