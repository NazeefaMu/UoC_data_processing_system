Govt urged to ban man power agencies

The Inter-Company Employees' Union yesterday urged the government to ban the recruitment of workers through man power agencies.
Addressing the media at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), Maradana, yesterday, Inter-Company Employees' Union General Secretary Janaka Adikari said the union will not hesitate to take stern trade union action and use the full power to solve the issue if the Government does not solve it soon.
He said they are ready to take measures within the democratic framework to put an end to this menace. He said the illegal man power slavery system has become a threat to the basic trade union rights of the employees.
Adikari said the rights to form and join trade unions, to collectively bargain and to strike are universal human rights.
The man power agencies violate the basic labour rights of the workers.
He said man power workers are afraid to voice their opinion as it would put their employment in danger since any protest could lead to a transfer or losing the opportunity to work.
The system has created a safe environment for the employers to get the maximum use of man power workers without protecting their basic labour rights. Man power agencies sell people to the companies and earn money, he said.
Union General Secretary Adikari said profit making is the only purpose of hiring workers from man power agencies.
The employer of the company become free from the responsibility of labour rights under the system. Workers have limited access to social protection, receive low wages and have obstacles in joining a trade union or bargaining collectively, he said.
Adikari said hiring workers from man power agencies has been common practice in the private sector.
Companies prefer hiring manpower workers since it is convenient for them as there are no responsibilities towards the workers, he said.
He said the Government is promoting this. Some state institutions such as Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), State banks, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Water Board and the Central Bank have begun recruiting manpower workers.
Adikari said though there is an Act called a Fee-Charging Employment Act, no regulations have been gazetted to make it effective.
