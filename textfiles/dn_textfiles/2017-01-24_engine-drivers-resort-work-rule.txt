Engine drivers resort to work to rule

The engine drivers of the Railway Department have initiated a trade union action of work to rule since midnight yesterday based on several demands.
Sri Lanka Locomotive Operating Engineers' Association executive committee member Indika Dodangoda said although several rounds of discussions were held with the authorities, they did not get any solution to their issues.
He said due to this reason, the "work to rule" trade union action was commenced.
They would have to take stern trade union actions if their issues were not addressed, he said.
