Turner studied about  mental health for  ‘Dark Phoenix’

Actor Sophie Turner has said that she read a lot on mental health issues to prepare for her role in ‘X-Men: Dark Phoenix’.
According to source, the ‘The Thirteenth Tale’ star, who will reprise her role of Jean Grey in the film, believes the movie is also a ‘personal story’ apart from being an ‘amazing superhero story’.
“Once I got the script through, I realised that not only were we telling this amazing superhero story, but we were also telling a very personal story as well. One which required research into mental health issues because that is a big part of what drives the story,” Turner said.
“I mainly drew inspiration from multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia, as it really is about duality, this movie. Darkness and light - that’s all within her. This sense of her being a completely other persona and struggling with that,” she added. PTI
