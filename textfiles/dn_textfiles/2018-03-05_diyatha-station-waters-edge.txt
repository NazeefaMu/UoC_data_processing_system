The Waters Edge recently opened its doors to the latest addition to its culinary prowess in a novel way. The “Diyatha Station” is Sri Lanka’s first series of restaurants based inside a train and its carriages. The concept was initiated under the patronage of Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka,Waters Edge Chairman Chamath de Silva, and Waters Edge General Manager Rohan Fernandopulle.
“A combination project of multiple restaurants, sporting facilities and an entertainment hub, the DiyathaStation will no doubt draw multitudes to Waters Edge. As a hospitality giant in the industry, our aim is to innovate and execute novel ideas for both locals and tourists to enjoy. This project is one more stepping stone to achieve this goal”, states Waters Edge Chairman Chamath de Silva.
The train running along a rail track consisting of several carriages has been converted into kitchens and passenger compartments revamped into restaurants serving up hawker-street style food. The platform beside the railway track will be used as part of the restaurants creating a typical train station atmosphere with the hustle and bustle that is commonplace of a Sri Lankan railway station. Ensuring that the restaurant is accessible to all, food will be affordably priced and made fresh daily. The seating capacity of the restaurants combined will be 200 with the option of indoor and outdoor seating.
