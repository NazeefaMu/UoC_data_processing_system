Cricket is a fiercely competitive game in which every athlete steps on the field to win it. However, there are some deeds of sportsmanship which justifies the tag of gentlemen’s game.
On several occasions, cricketers proved why the spirit of the game is beyond everything, even winning the match. Such actions full of grit and gratitude manage to steal millions of hearts and, leave behind an everlasting memory. So let’s have a look at some of the most heartwarming gestures by cricketers on the cricket field.
#5 Dhoni calls back Bell

During a match of the 1987 World Cup in Lahore, Sir Courtney Walsh chose to lose the match instead of running out a player in an unfair manner.
Pakistan required 13 runs in the last over to win the game against mighty West Indies, Walsh had already conceded 11 runs off the first five balls, now the equation was two runs off the final ball.
Courtney Walsh stopped, backed out in his delivery stride but didn’t run out the non-striker who was way ahead of the crease. Next ball, Abdul Qadir scored the desired runs to win the match for Pakistan, but the grace of Walsh remains forever.

Australian opener Adam Gilchrist walked off the field despite being given not out. It was the Semi-final of World Cup 2003, Gilchrist nicked a ball off leggie Arvind Desilva to be caught by the wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara.
