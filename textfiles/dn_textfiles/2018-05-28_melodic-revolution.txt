Melodic revolution

“The book of poetry I wrote on behalf of your love came to an end without me knowing so,” (Nodanima Awasan Wuna) sings Kasun Kalhara, a bestselling contemporary singer, to the tender and expressive melody by music composer Mahesh Vithana. Well known for his melodic revolt in the song ‘Anna Sargewuna’ Mahesh Vithana takes on a contrastingly opposite direction with the music he composes for Kasun’s single Nodanima Awasan Wuna.
Most significantly, Vithana’s excellent composition of music has elevated the lyrics by Duminda Handapangoda, turning the song into a jewel to be sung by Kasun, who is a singer credited for having a deeply expressive voice. The absence of musical clichés and the freshness of music make Vithana’s music composition stands out from the all too common music that dominates the listeners’ taste.
An award winner at State Music Awards Festival in 2015, Visharada Mahesh Vithana has produced music for popular singers in the industry including Deepika Priyadarshani, Dayan Witharana and Amal Perera. Vithana is presently employed as an officer attached to the government sector.
