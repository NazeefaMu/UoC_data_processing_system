Scientifically speaking…

An average science professor may not be understood as a person who is destined to take up religious studies as a serious detour from his mainstay. But it had happened in the case of a well-known chemistry professor from the university of Kelaniya. That was a decade ago.
He is remembered as Professor J K P Ariyaratne. Towards retirement, he took up science and Buddhism as a comparative study enhancing the output of a number of research papers as well as creative pieces. Before his demise a decade ago, when I met him on the campus he gave me a copy of his book titled as Two Buddhist Sutras viewed from Science. As a reader and teacher interested in the field of comparative studies, both literature and communication, I wanted to browse the text.
It took some time. And now I am back with the book.
The book running to 160 printed pages, consisting of five chapters each linking to the other is an analytical study of two foremost Buddhist suttas: Dhammachakkappavattana and Anattalakkhana Suttas. Both suttas were delivered to the Buddha’s first five disciples. Professor Ariyaratne tries to drive in the significance of the two suttas from a scientific point of view.
This is a collection of several essays connected to each other as a result of a uniquely personal experience that Professor Ariyaratne had during a lecture. It was on the topic of chemical bonding, delivered to new advents of the University of Kelaniya. The primary foundation lecture has gone a long way with subsequent study and concentration. The Buddha’s philosophy is based on two key factors: suffering (dukkha) and its cessation (dukkha nirodho).
Professor Ariyaratne was inspired by Professor Fritjof Capra’s ‘The Tao of Physics’. The inspiration I imbibed is indeed immense, says Professor Ariyaratne as a starting point. Then he continues: “In the early 1980s, I realised spontaneously a certain parallel between one important aspect of chemical bonding and the second Noble Truth (as taught by the Buddha). I wrote this slim volume for the purpose of relating my exceedingly exhilarating experience and the subsequent development of my thoughts concerning the interface between Buddhism and Science.”
Admittedly, the reader of the text may find an interesting brain teasing analysis basically subdivided into two categories. The first grouping is ‘The Scientific Method of that Never Ends’. The second grouping is ‘Buddhist Philosophical Procedure that Can Come to an End’. In the first group, there are four segments diagrammatically displayed.
They are in the first category written as follows:
1. Making observations and gathering data.
2. (This leads to) the analysis and synthesis of data, making deductions.
3. (Leading to) understanding through hypothesis, confirmation of our understanding through experiments.
4. Apply for our material benefit, research (using appropriate methods and techniques).
Then come the segments in the second grouping. They go as follows.
1. Observing our internal and external worlds.
2. (Leading to) analysing the observations and realising mutual relationships.
3. (Which leads to) achieving some understanding confirming by experiencing. Achieve further understanding continue to repeat the process.
4. (Leading to) practice for our supra-mundane progress. This leads to the perfecting of the technique of insight meditation. This is the knowledge of reality or perfect enlightenment.
This ultimate goal is denoted as the cessation of the arising the ‘I’ concept in the mind, (Nibbana).
In his blissful stipulation, Professor Ariyaratne denotes that when a person perfectly understands the above-laid reality of nature, he loses all attachment to all things, all persons and all conditions. The complete comprehension of the reality leads to the perfect liberation of the mind and freedom from all ills. Thus he states that the perfected mental state is indeed estimation or Nibbana which in turn is known as ‘Nibbanam Paraman Sukham’. Perhaps as a reader one may feel that this is an innovative form of thinking on religious communication, where a dialogue cum discourse could be formulated on Buddhism – Science as a subject.
The intimacy in reading the pages are built on the experimental and inspirations derived. He neither reports or summarises what others say. Instead, believes in creative thinking. Professor Ariyaratne’s ultimate analysis leads to the conclusion that physical attraction, repulsion, and stabilisation pertaining to the existence of a salt crystal. In a world full of human conflict causing agony, a blissful experience as undergone by a senior science professor may be a gift to the contemporary society. I have recently come across several creative artistes who do not believe in therapy via concentration and meditation.
For that type of personals perhaps, Professor Ariyaratne shows the way to a better frame of mind via a scientific method. For me, this work cannot be considered as either a strict religious interpretation or a strict scientific interpretation. It is more of a blend of both areas interlinked through personal experiences gained by teaching and contemplation.
Professor Ariyaratne’s main contribution though was confined to chemistry where he specialised in organic metallic chemistry, he gradually diverted his interest to social sciences, philosophy and allied fields culminating in Buddhism.
As Professor Ariyaratne points out, the Buddha’s teachings are helpful scientific means and ways of looking at sensory experiences that help us to understand them. They are not commandments. They are not dogmas that we have to accept or believe in. Instead, they are guides to point to the way things are.
They remind us scientifically to face them ourselves to be awake, alert and aware that all that arises passes away.
