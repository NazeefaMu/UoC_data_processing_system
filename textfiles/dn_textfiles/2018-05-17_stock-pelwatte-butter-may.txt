Pelwatte Dairy Industries Limited is offering its signature Pelwatte Butter tub at 10 per cent off at Cargills Outlets island-wide. The offer which began on the May 1 will be in place until the May 31.
Pelwatte Dairy is a leading home-grown dairy company that produces many different dairy products such as milk powder, yoghurt, ice-cream and both home use and bulk butter for industrial use. The brand is widely known for the natural approach taken in the production of their products.
Pelwatte butter is considered natural due to many reasons; one of them being that the butter is made from the fat in fresh milk with no added preservatives. Fresh milk contains about 4-5 per cent fat and the process of butter production tends to increase the fat percentage so in order to control the fat percentage a standardization process is used which is also another reason as to why Pelwatte Butter is considered all-natural.
Pelwatte produces both salted and unsalted butter varieties, and is sold in both home-sized and bulk packs. Pelwatte Butter is the cheapest high quality butter in the local market. The added 10 per cent discount means that households can stock up on a premium product at an attractive price.
