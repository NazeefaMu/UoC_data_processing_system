Making special moments

The first Swiss hospitality chain in the city marked the beginning of the Christmas season with their tree lighting ceremony held on Monday. This upscale, modern hospitality company that is passionate about ‘making moments’, invited over thirty children from the Sri Jinananda Children’s Development Centre for this tree lighting ceremony.
“Christmas is all about sharing and giving. With that in mind, we decided that this year, we will spend it together with the young boys of the Sri Jinananda Children’s Development Centre and we hope they enjoyed their time with us,” said General Manager of Mövenpick Hotel Colombo, George Koumendakos.
Although a very simple affair, the lobby lounge was decorated with a beautiful Christmas tree, festive decorations and both the Executive Chef and Pastry Chef have built a stunning gingerbread house, displayed at the lobby lounge.
