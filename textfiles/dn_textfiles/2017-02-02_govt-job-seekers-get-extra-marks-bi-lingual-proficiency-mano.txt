Govt. job seekers to get extra marks for bi-lingual proficiency: Mano

National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said government job applicants proficient in Sinhala And Tamil would receive four additional marks at the selection starting from 2018 and a Cabinet paper in this regard would be presented in parliament next month.
He was speaking at a function held in Matara on January 30 to present diplomas to over 1,500 students who completed a four-month Tamil proficiency course conducted by the Samadhi Foundation and the ‘Dakuna’ Educational Institute where he was the chief guest.
“Samadhi Foundation founder and parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana reduced the burden on my ministry by helping over thousand persons acquire proficiency in Tamil. This is a strong message to the Northern Province Chief Minister and its people that the south are ready to learn Tamil and understand each other better,” he said.
The minister said he is equally conversant in Sinhala, Tamil, and English and he can come to the Southern most tip of the island and explain the problems faced by the Tamil people to a Sinhala speaking audience. Samadhi Foundation founder MP Buddika Pathirana said he was honoured that Minister Ganesan postponed a overseas visit to attend the award ceremony. “Every Sri Lankan should be able to speak at least Sinhala and Tamil. I am extremely grateful to S. Paularaj for helping the Samadhi Foundation conduct this basic Tamil language course and for all the students participated in it,” he said.
