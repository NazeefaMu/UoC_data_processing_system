All parties should pay heed to SAITM verdict: Kiriella

All parties should pay heed to the SAITM verdict whether they like it or not, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. The minister stated these views attending an English Course Student Enrollment at the North Central Provincial Council Auditorium on February 3.
"Protests are being held against the SAITM, which was established during the previous regime. Students who graduated from the SAITM as doctors last year went to Court. Now the Court has given a verdict on this issue," he said. The minister said no parties or groups spoke against the SAITM when it was established during the previous regime because they were afraid of being kidnapped in white vans.
"The SAITM was not the only institution to start private medical institutes. The Kothalawala Defence University started a medical faculty. But nobody spoke against it as everyone was afraid of the then Defence Secretary. Students had to pay to study at the Medical Faculty of the Kothalawala Defence University. If private medical clinics are allowed why is private education banned? he queried. The minister said students at state universities are the best. Students at the Faculty of Arts are the best students as they enter universities according to the highest marks, the minister said.
