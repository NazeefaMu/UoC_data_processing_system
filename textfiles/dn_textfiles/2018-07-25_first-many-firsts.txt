First of many firsts

Showbiz may be good business but being there is no easy job for it is most unpredictable. Trends keep changing and something that clicked today will find no favour with the audience tomorrow. From a producer-driven industry to a star-dominated one, Cargills (Ceylon) PLC Deputy Chairman Ranjit Page has seen the evolution of Sri Lankan cinema from close quarters.
The man who has been in touch with the industry for many years via Ceylon Theaters spoke to the Daily News about the close association of the company with Sri Lankan cinema.
“Sri Lanka embodies a rich history. The entertainment sector can be instrumental in bringing our culture and values to the fore. The industry is the hub of new technologies. It is also a sector in which youth can shine as new filmmakers. We built new cinemas, digitalize the screens, and create an environ suitable for a family outing as a means of uplifting the local film industry,” he explained adding that joining hands with ANCL to rejuvenate the Sarasaviya Film Awards this year is another step towards boosting the local film industry. This is the first time that two reputed organizations have gotten together to host a film festival of this nature. The Cargills Sarasaviya Film Awards 2018 will be held on August 3 at the BMICH.
Known as one of the oldest film production companies in Sri Lanka, Ceylon Theaters was taken over by Albert A. Page with the aim of enriching the industry and helping to entertain masses. Armed with the belief that good entertainment will unite people to bridge the gap between diverse cultures and regions, the company became the first to mark several milestones in Sri Lankan cinema history. They incorporated Ceylon Studios in 1956 thereby stopping remittances to India for film production. They also established the first cinema in the country – Empire Theatre, which was built on the site that the Regal Colombo stands today. April 7, 1947, the company released its first national film ‘Asokamala.’ They followed this up with many noteworthy productions like ‘Nidhanaya’, ’Ada Rae’, ’Kusumalatha’ and ‘Akkara Paha.’ Later the company diversified its portfolio and acquired Millers Ltd. and Cargills (Ceylon) Ltd in 1981.
Adding another feather on their cap the company created the country’s first Cineplex at Majestic City. They also boast of the largest number of film screens in Sri Lanka: 15 screens in Colombo, Jaffna, Kandy, Negombo, Gampaha and Nuwara Eliya, with plans for 21 new screens across eight locations.
“We wanted to create a good environment to lure youth to film theatres to watch films. We digitalized the cinema in Nuwara Eliya which had been shut down for a couple of years. Likewise, we are on the lookout for new venues in which we can put more than one cinema screen. We believe that presenting the latest technology in a novel manner will woo the youth and bring them over to the industry. Both the public and private sectors need to do their bit to achieve this target,” Page opined.
With over 27 years of experience in the management sector Page has been instrumental in introducing the supermarketing concept to Sri Lanka.
“During my stint, I saw the suffering of the rural farmers. We gave them a chance to sell their goods on our shelves. We also changed the structure of the supermarket,” he noted adding that the audience has changed over the decades and that there is a need to cater to their demands.
“We need to change according to time. We cannot play the same tune which we did in the past and expect to draw masses. We should learn from the past and make the transition. Other countries have built malls which houses a few cinema screens. We are looking at taking this concept out of Colombo,” he explained.
Stressing on the importance of making way for new young filmmakers for the industry to move forward Page says that the country needs entrepreneurs and business leaders who can revolutionize the industry.
“Then they would realize that the country gave them this opportunity and they need to give something back to their motherland. We still make movies to please ourselves rather than aim at making productions with the goal of bringing youth into film halls. Think about your customer’s tastes too rather than your own,” he pointed out.
Though there are still a few veterans in Hollywood and Bollywood many new faces too have joined the scene each year. He says that this change of mindset needs to be brought to the Sri Lankan cinema sector too. Cultural change too can be brought via cinema.
“We have changed the face of agriculture and dairy. We have also changed the concept of entrepreneurship to a certain extent. Now it is time for cinema to make that transition. We need to do this using the latest technology. We also need to hand over the industry to the future generation,” he said.
“People see the world through entertainment. They will be able to witness things which are in the international sphere as well as those in the home front. It is a powerful medium which can drive home a message and can reach thousands of people easily,” he said adding that a policy needs to be created for the betterment of the future rather than viewing it in the past angle. He says that an equal playing field in investment is needed for an industry to thrive. Productions, imports and screen developments need to be encouraged. The answer to films queuing up for release is to increase the number of screens.
“You do not need acres to build a film hall today. You do not need to have 600 seats in a theatre. The youth are looking for something to inspire them. We need to provide them with that inspiration and create a good cinema culture for them to take this industry forward,” he concluded with a smile.
