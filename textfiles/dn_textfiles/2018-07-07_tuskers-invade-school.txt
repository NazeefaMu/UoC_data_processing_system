Tuskers invade school

Tuskers that roam in the Yala national sanctuary have invaded the Kirindagama Vidyalaya at Kirinda in Tissamaharama, posing death threats to schoolchildren.
Tuskers have broken the school fence at several places and entered the school. They have invaded the Kiridagama village and continued to terrorise villagers, destroying cultivations. Parents are fearful of sending children to school due to the situation.
