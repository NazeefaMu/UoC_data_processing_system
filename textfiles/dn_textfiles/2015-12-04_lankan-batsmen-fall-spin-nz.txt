Lankan batsmen fall to spin in NZ

QUEENSTOWN: The Sri Lankans' top order made a shaky start to their tour of New Zealand, losing five wickets for 97 on the rain-curtailed first day of their practice match against the NZC President's XI at Queenstown.
Left-arm quick Neil Wagner - who is in New Zealand's Test squad - claimed two of those wickets, after the hosts had won the toss and elected to bowl.
Canterbury off-spinner Tim Johnston made the greatest impact of the day, taking three wickets for nine from six overs, sparking a Sri Lankan collapse that cost the visitors four wickets for eight runs, towards the end of the 40-over day.
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne top-scored for the Sri Lankans, hitting 49 not out off 103 balls. He was kept company for 56 runs by Udara Jayasundera before the collapse came. Jayasundera hit 21 for 68 deliveries. Kithuruwan Vithanage (4), Dinesh Chandimal (0) and Angelo Mathews (3) were the men out in quick succession following Jayasundera's dismissal.
Milinda Siriwardana survived 10 balls alongside Karunaratne to end the day.
Sri Lankans 97-5 at close (Dimuth Karunaratne 49, Udara Jayasundara 21, Neil Wagner 2/23, Tim Johnston 3/9) v NZ Board President's XI.
