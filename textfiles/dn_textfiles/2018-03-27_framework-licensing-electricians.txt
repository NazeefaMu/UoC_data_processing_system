Framework for licensing electricians

The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka together with CEB, LECO, CIDA, IESL and VTA organized a seminar to gather public opinion on proposed framework for licensing electricians in Sri Lanka.
The event was held on March 22 at the BMICH, with the participation of intellectuals, professionals, academics, entrepreneurs, industrialists and electricians from various parts of the Country.
There were 51 presentations by the cross section of professionals in all levels of the relevant field under various topics to emphasize the necessity of the Licensing Framework.
According to the proposal there are four types of licensing, apprentice- low voltage, under supervision of a licensed electrician( LV up to 1,000 volts), residential electricians, electrical work from instilling lights to complete wiring of a house (LV up to 1000 volts- three phase 30 Amps.), commercial electricians, work on large and critical electrical projects, security, power and fire protection, utility electronics in buildings (LV three phase 60 Amps and above.) and master/ premier electricians
The master / premier electricians are the most qualified level of an electrician.
They work on both commercial and residential jobs and supervise other electricians.
At this forum it was revealed that working with electricity can be very dangerous and faulty wiring poses several hazards, especially fire and it was statistically around 90% when compared to other services like plumbing (65%) and mechanical (20%).
Emphasis was made on the necessity to prevent unqualified people practicing as electricians, and to provide practical safeguard measures to protect the public, workmen and property, and also to make the public and all interested parties aware of the individuals who are suitably qualified, competent and have the requisite expertise to perform as electricians.
