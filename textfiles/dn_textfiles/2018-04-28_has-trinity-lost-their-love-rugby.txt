KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Has Trinity lost their love for rugby?

Last Saturday night Trinity College ruggerites returned home licking their wounds inflicted on them by Royal College who played like men possessed in front of a capacity crowd in the first leg of the Bradby Shield. Taking a beating in the Bradby is anathema - for any Trinity sports fan, but the result has softened big talkers. The present Trinity rugby players are not concentrating on the game like the way they did in the past. The Trinitians have wonderfully talented and charismatic players. They were cheered when they won the first game of the season against rivals Antonians, but ignored the winning signals in the rest of the matches. Trinity lost all three games, the under 18 played for the C.E. Simithrachchi trophy (Royal won 14-8), the under 16 game (won by Royal) and eventually the Bradby first leg 39-7. In this game, most of the Trinitians thought that, their school might pull off a major upset. At play Trinity were nowhere, the Royalist used their superior speed and quickness in scoring six tries, three conversions and a penalty. The Trinitians forgot that rugby is a team game.
