Lankan cricket in shambles and the shame of the ICC

Sri Lanka cricket is certainly not going through good times especially on the cricket field and to make matters worse off it as well. It is a well known fact that if the national team does not perform well criticism will be leveled at the administration and issues which may not surface with a winning team will come to light when they are losing.
When Sri Lanka defeated Australia 3-0 in the Test series everyone thought that this rebuilding side was going to be the dream team that could go and win the World Cup in another two years. But the way things have been panning out that win now seems like a flash in the pan after what we have gone through since then.
A 2-0 Test win and emerging champions of the one-day tri-nations in Zimbabwe with a young side was overshadowed heavily when Sri Lanka were whitewashed 3-0 and 5-0 in the Test and ODI series respectively in South Africa. They managed to save some grace by winning the T20 series in South Africa and following it up with a similar victory in Australia.
But come Bangladesh the youngest Test nation to Sri Lanka and what have we? Sri Lanka won the first Test at Galle convincingly and when everyone thought that they would wrap it up at the P Sara Oval, the visitors sprung a surprise with a stunning win – their first against Sri Lanka and thereby shared the two-Test series.
We currently have the three-match one-day series going and Bangladesh notwithstanding their maiden Test triumph over Sri Lanka have carried that momentum into the shorter version and taken a 1-0 lead with a crushing 90-run win at Dambulla thereby giving themselves an outside chance of creating history for the second time by winning a ODI series against Sri Lanka for the first time.
While all this has been taking place with the country’s cricket in a dilemma, comes the damning exposure of Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala trying to sneak in through the back door to fill in the vacancy created by the resignation of ICC chairman Shahank Manohar of India.
The over ambitions of the SLC president’s hands were glaringly exposed when he put his hat in the ring a move which the rest of the ICC full members objected to strongly.
Here’s how Sumathipala’s over ambitious move was reported by ESPN Cricinfo:
“According to ICC rules, if an existing chairman quits before finishing his tenure, the board picks an interim replacement from among the directors. One man who put his hat in his ring was SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala. However, the rest of the board was firmly in opposition.
“One director was surprised by Sumathipala's move. "It would have been terribly difficult for anybody, and what we did not want was to have a whole load of toxic electioneering which Sumathipala exemplified. His conduct actually brought the board very fast together."
“A senior official from another Full Member board was concerned the board could not invest time in choosing an interim chairman when it was about to usher in such wide-ranging reforms. "This is what I was most concerned about: while we were discussing the changes, it was the wrong time to think of a new chairman because invariably that position has been fought for by people with aspirations. Then the horse-trading and everything else becomes a mess. We don't need that at this juncture. It is absolutely the wrong time.
"In the end you would get reforms with massive compromise because to get Member X's vote you need to forego this particular thing, to get Member Y you need to increase this, to get Member Z you need to do something else. Then you will get their support. That is not the way to run an organisation.”
By this egotistical act to desperately get into the portals of the ICC, the SLC president has shamed the entire country by his act and become a laughing stock in the eyes of the entire cricket world.
As if the humiliation the country is going through on the cricket field at the hands of the youngest full member of the ICC Bangladesh is not enough, here we have an uncalled for situation which is only adding more salt to an already festering wound.
It’s a case of one man’s ego to take over and run the ICC like he is doing the SLC that is destroying the very foundations of the game at home. Thankfully the ICC escaped that from happening to them because saner counsel prevailed.
