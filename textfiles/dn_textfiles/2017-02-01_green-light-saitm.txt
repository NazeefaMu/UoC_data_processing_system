Green light for SAITM

Putting an end to a long-held dispute, the Court of Appeal yesterday informed that medical degree holders of SAITM private university Malabe could register with the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Reproduced here are highlights from the landmark judgement.
Petitioner to the present application Dhilmi Kasundara Malshani Suriyarachchi a MBBS Graduate from the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (hereinafter referred to as SAITM) has filed the present application before this court making the Sri Lanka Medical Council (hereinafter referred to as SLMC) the lst Respondent and had sought the following relief as against the said lSI Respondent;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to refuse registration as a medical practitioner to the Petitioner as evidenced by letter dated 26.05.2016 marked P-27;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to register the Petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition preventing the Sri Lanka Medical Council agents and/or its employees, agents and servants from refusing to register the Petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to refuse provisional registration to the Petitioner as evidenced by letter dated 26.05.2016 marked P-27;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to register the Petitioner provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
* To issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition preventing the Sri Lanka Medical Council and/or its employees, agents and servants to refuse to register the Petitioner provisionally as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance as amended;
Apart from the preliminary objections raised, which I will discuss at a later stage of this Judgment, one main argument raised by the Learned President’s Counsel was based on the; Degree Awarding Institute Order made by the then Minister of Higher Education.
In this regard the Learned President’s Counsel argued that there was no specific date given in the said order, for the said order to come in to force and submitted that in the absence of such date, the said order has not come into force at all. However in this regard our attention was drawn to another Degree Awarding Institute Order issued by the then Minister of Higher Education under section 25A of the Universities Act (as amended) with regard to the same institution SAITM, on 26th September 2013.
As far as the case in hand is concerned, this court is therefore satisfied that SAITM has been declared as a Degree Awarding Institution and continued to be a Degree Awarding Institution at all times relevant to the present application under the provisions of the Universities Act No 16 of 1978 (as amended) Section 70A of the Universities Act explain the powers of a Degree Awarding Institute as follows;
70A A Degree Awarding Institute recognized by an order under section 25A shall, with the concurrence of the Specified Authority have the power;
* To admit students and provide the instructions in such branches of learning as are specified in the order made under section 25A in respect of such institute.
* To hold examinations for the purpose of ascertaining the persons who have acquired proficiency in the courses of study in such branches of learning
* To grant an confer degrees, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions on persons who have followed instructions in the course of study in such branches of learning and passed such examinations.
* To grant and confer degrees on persons who have conducted research under its supervision and subject to conditions specified by the Specified Authority. (emphasis added)
In the said circumstances we see no merit in the second argument placed before this court by the Learned President’s Counsel and therefore the question of deciding the “Specified Professional Body” will not arise for the purpose of this Judgment.
Apart from the applicability of the provisions in the Universities Act and the regulations made there under, the provisions of the Medical Ordinance (as amended) was also relevant to the application in hand but one of the main issue raised before us was, the extent to which the Medical Ordinance (as amended) was applicable to the case in hand.
As already submitted by the Petitioner, the Petitioner had visited the 1st Respondent’s office with a Senior Lecturer of SAITM to submit her application under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance for provisional registration as a medical practitioner.
This court will now proceed to go through the relevant provisions in the Medical Ordinance (as amended)
Apart from the several objections raised, the 1st Respondent had heavily relied on its powers under the Medical Ordinance (as amended) during the arguments before us.
In this regard the 1st Respondent had further relied on a report prepared by a panel of prominent medical consultants appointed by the SLMC, chaired by Professor M.H. Rezvi Sheriff. As observed by this court the said committee has been appointed by the SLMC to inspect and report on SAITM in terms of section 19A of the Medical Ordinance.
Apart from the provisions under which the said committee was appointed, the 1st Respondent relied on Regulation 31 of the Regulations made by the Specified
Authority under sections 137 read with section 70C and 70D of the Universities Act (as amended) with regard to the obtaining a Compliance Certificate from the Special Professional Body.
In this regard specific reference was made to Item No 5 of schedule II of the said Rule which provides that” ...... in the case of study programme in Medical Sciences, the Teaching Hospital to which the students have access and provided with clinical training must conform in to the standards stipulated by the SLMC” and argued that the 2nd Respondent must abide by the standards stipulated by the 1st Respondent and is subject to the supervision of the 1 0; Respondent.
As discussed earlier in this judgment, this court does not see any controversy over the regulations Gazetted in 1R4 but as observed earlier, the said regulations were Gazetted under section 70C and 70D of the Universities Act (as amended) with regard to the powers of the Specified Authority and if there are violations of the regulations, it is the duty of the special professional body which empowered with such supervision to bring it to the notice of the Specified Authority for the Authority to take appropriate Action. However as observed earlier, such powers of the Specified Authority can only be exercised subject to the directions and control of the Minister in Charge of Higher Education.
Therefore, with regard to any power (if any) conferred upon the SLMC under Regulations promulgated under section 70C and 70D read with 137 of the Universities Act (as amended) is subject to the powers of the Minister in Charge of Higher Education and in the absence of any action taken by the said Minister under section 27 of the Universities Act (as amended) the 1st Respondent SLMC is not entitled to relied upon such provision as a ground and/or objection to the case in hand, to refuse provisional registration under section 29 (2) of the Medical Ordinance (as amended).
This court will now proceed to consider the powers vested with the SLMC under section 19A of the Medical Ordinance (as amended). As observed by this court SLMC is empowered under section 19A (1) to appoint a committee for the purpose of examination and investigation in order to ascertain,
As observed correctly in the case of Thajudeen V. Sri Lanka Tea Board 1981 2 Sri LR 471 disputed facts will have to be considered before a trial court where witnesses are permitted to testify on the disputed issues.
In the said circumstances this court accepts the report submitted before this court marked P-19d by the Petitioner as the report submitted by the investigation team under section 19A of the Medical Ordinance 23 (as amended) but, another question arises whether the said report was available before the SLMC when it was said to have considered the said report at its 5561h meeting held on 28th August 2015, since the last signatory to the said report had dated his signature on 04.09.2015. None of the other signatories have dated their signatures.
In this regard the 15th respondent submitted an affidavit from the Chairman of the investigating team “The report prepared by the said team was presented to the Medical Council at its 556th meeting held on 28.08.2015 duly signed by all the members of the team except Dr. L.B.L. de. Alwis, Prof K. Sivapalan and the coordinator of the team Dr. H.M.S.S.D. Herath. I state that I directed the coordinator of this team Dr. H.M.S.S.D. Herath and signed and date the said report only after the above two members place their signatures.” Even if the above position is accepted as correct, it is clear that three members of the said investigation team had not signed the report, when it was considered at the 5561h meeting held on 28th August 2015.
Based on the observations made in the said report including the main areas the investigating team had identified the following as the main deficiencies at SAITM.
1. General inadequacy of clinical exposure in all areas in terms of numbers and case mix is of grave concern.
2. Lack of facilities for training in practical clinical Forensic Medicine e.g. to examine and report l on clinical medico- legal cases to the Police and Courts of law; and no provision to carry out medico-legal post-mortem examinations
3. Deficiency in exposure to preventive care services in the state sector i.e. the MOH office activities and filed services When analyzing the above deficiencies along with the observations made it is clear that the investigation team had studied the functions at the SAITM with the intention of the improving the study programme by making recommendations to expose the under graduates to the state mechanism as identify under E6 highly recommending to the Ministry of Health, the access to state JMO system and under E5 recommending suitable field practice area to develop a working relationship with existing public health service.
However, the investigating team in their conclusion had surprisingly recommended that the SLMC does not recognize graduates who have completed the study programme currently provided by the faculty of Medicine SAITM, as suitable for provisional registration. When considering the observations made by the investigators as referred to above it is clear that the above observations does not match with the final recommendation made by them.
However, submitting that the above conclusion was made in mala-fide the Petitioner submitted before this court another evaluation made by the SLMC with regard to another Degree Awarding Institute namely Kothalawala Defence University, to establish the mala-fide of the SLMC.
The report said to have prepared by the investigating team of SLMC comprising of the president SLMC and four other members including Prof. Rezvi Sheriff who headed the investigating team to SAITM and Prof. Ranjani Gamage another member of the investigating team to SAITM in a two-page report on their preliminary investigation had concluded as follows.
When considering the two reports referred to above, it appears that one report has been made after inspecting SAITM and the other after inspecting FOM-KDU, but two different standards have been used, when preparing those reports.
However as observed above in this judgment, when the SLMC submits its recommendation to the Minister under section 19C (1) of the Medical Ordinance the role played by SLMC ends at that point, as they are not empowered under the Medical Ordinance to take over the functions of the Minister and declare that the Degree Awarded by SAITM should not be recognized for the purpose of registration under the Medical Ordinance (as amended) since the legislature had thought it fit to be given not to the SLMC but to the Minister.
