Clarification: Perpetual Treasuries Lawyer not ordered

Attorney-at-Law for Perpetual Treasuries, Nihal Fernando PC was not ordered by the Commission to desist from confusing a witness, as stated in the body of our story titled ‘ Interdicted EPF Chief Dealer Faces the Heat on the Witness box” on July 13.The Commissioners instead warned Fernando PC during the morning hearings on July 12.
The paragraph is corrected as follows. Earlier in the morning Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Chairman, Justice K.T. Chithrasiri warned Counsel for Perpetual Treasuries Nihal Fernando PC to desist from confusing a witness. Pan Asia Bank DGM Richard Dias who was on the witness stand was cross examined by Counsel for Perpetual Treasuries Romali Tudawe and Nihal Fernando PC. During the evidence it was revealed that Nimal Perera the former Chairman of Pan Asia Bank had bought bonds in his personal capacity and using another company under him.
We regret the inconvenience caused.
