Students continue occupation of campus block

Contravening a court order and the University Commission, a section of the students are still in occupation of the administrative block of the Eastern University at Vantharumoolai, Chenkalady. The university's academic and non-academic unions staged a protest against this illegal occupation opposite of the university premises yesterday (22).
Though the university has benn closed since August 8, a section of the students are still occupying the University premises. The academic, non-academic and security staff are demanding that the occupying students be removed as they pose a threat to their safety.
The Eravur Magistrate had ordered the students to vacate the premises. The academic and non-academic staff complained that they are unable to freely carry out their duties and that the students are causing a hindrance to them.
