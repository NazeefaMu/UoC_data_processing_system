UPFA will not contest with communal parties: Amaraweera

UPFA General Secretary and Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday said the UPFA headed by the SLFP would no longer contest with communal or racist political parties.
Amaraweera observed that due to certain racist parties joining the UPFA in the recent past, great harm was caused to the SLFP principles and thus it was a timely opportunity to have Wimal Weerawansa leave their fold.
He said that many parties have expressed their interest in joining the UPFA and that they had held several rounds of discussions with them. They hoped to emerge with a stronger alliance in the future.
Minister Amaraweera also pointed out that the UPFA supporters would no longer vote for parties or individuals who use their vote to grab power and thereafter abandon the Alliance.
He said that the next election would be a good opportunity for those who left to test their own vote base.
