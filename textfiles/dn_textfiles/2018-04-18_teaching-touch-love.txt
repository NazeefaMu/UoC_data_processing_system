Teaching  to touch love

 Subject interest
“I want to be a teacher when I leave school because a good teacher is indispensable. It is he/she that carefully nurtures your mind and makes you delight in learning. That is something I want to do. I want to help my students in the future to love what I am teaching. To take an interest in the subject,” said Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara has a taste of what life is outside the comfort of his home. Away from the security of their home, these boy scouts have to really survive in conditions that might be harsh.
“I feel my experience in boy scouting has really enhanced my personality. Through scouting I have learnt how to be a man of the world. Through scouting I have received the skills that allow me to achieve my objectives. You learn to find solutions to the challenges that come your way. Life is an adventure. You learn how to conduct yourself in life. You learn to be tough and you get a taste of what life really is. You learn to solve problems that arise between the boys, by being away from your family in the scout camp. You are forced to survive and live in an environment away from home,” explained Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara believes that you need to have the correct attitude when evaluating a problem. Hastiness has been the ruin of many plans.
“As a Head Prefect firstly we need to know how to rally the team and unite the team. The Head Prefect is tested by this and this is really what marks him as a Leader. This is the sign of his ability to lead. With this come many responsibilities. You need to be able to inspire the team which also tests your patience and your tolerance. You lead by example. When facing a challenge or a problem as the Head Prefect, first you need to assess the problem and its many facets carefully. When looking for a proper solution you need to be mindful that you must evaluate this problem carefully.
Plan of action
You have to understand that no matter how compelling the urge is to act rashly, you need to practice patience and apply yourself to the process of carefully formulating a plan of action by identifying the pros and cons of the situation and the pluses and minuses and most importantly the right thing to do,” said Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara has the right idea because he will always consult a superior, understanding his own inexperience.
“I always obtain the counsel of someone wiser than me. When you are young you think you know everything but you don’t. So when facing a challenge in life always remember that there may be people who know better than you,” said Nanayakkara
Too often because of foolishness, we do not understand the value of education. This is beyond getting good grades. You need to have a sincere desire to learn, understanding that it will all pay off in the end.
“My school has given me so much to make my life a success as the Head Boy of Rahula College Matara. In life, you need to have the willingness to accept and receive the knowledge that you are offered. You need to be able to be in touch with reality. So I just want to give back to society what was offered to me. I was a Boy Scout in the scout troupe. I have played various sports. I have also excelled in my education. So I have been gifted with so much from my school,” pointed out Nanayakkara.
Model solution
Nanayakkara has a good role model, who is a man who can handle any difficulty with grace and dignity
“As the Head Prefect, one person who is my role model and someone I look up to is my Principal – Francis Welege. He is a person with a sound understanding and one who can beautifully solve a problem. Like I mentioned before we must never be rash when searching for a solution. He is a man who knows what to do and how to approach it. I have seen this and I feel that this is the kind of leadership that is essential. He knows how to treat people properly,” added Nanayakkara
In life, we are faced with what is right and what is wrong. Your character is moulded by being at school.
“This is like our second family, beyond mother and father. At school, children need to be taught a code of ethics. Then you learn to love being ethical. You learn to love doing the right thing. This is what I constantly tell my prefects under me. Love what is good and be disciplined. You need to have morals as well as morale. Character while having skills. Be a service to society,” pointed out Nanayakkara.
The day we run out of food or fresh water, is the day we realize that we cannot eat or drink money. A large number of species are facing extinction. The forests are being cut down. Our society is turning into an urban nightmare. Even if you take poverty, just think - there is enough food for everyone in the world. But those politicians are setting up boundaries and not allowing free access to food.
Towards disaster
“If you take environmental pollution we are killing the earth. As humans, we pollute our environment. The way we are going we are heading towards disaster. Many species are endangered. Even if you take poverty, that is also due to the actions of the leaders in our world. I am against the harming of animals. When I think of the suffering of animals I am greatly saddened. I think to myself why we are taking the lives of these animals that have done no wrong to us?” said Nanayakkara.
As mentioned before he is devoted to his school. He loves his parents. The two entities that have given him a bright future.
“I have always loved my school. I want to give back to this school. I want to do this to the best of my ability. I also want to say how much I love my parents who have done everything for me. So I want to be a good citizen of the world. My message to young people is that there are a time and a way of doing things for everything. Don’t rush this process. Do things according to the times then you will be successful,” summed up Nanayakkara.
