Perfect place to stay this holiday season

 
Situated on a soft slice of golden beach and located just 45 minutes from Colombo, Taprobana Wadduwa (a property by Asia Leisure), is the perfect choice for a getaway this Avurudu season. Whether it's to spend a few days by the beach with the whole family or maybe even to drive down with friends for the day, it's where one would want to chill-out.
Foodies will find choices galore here. The main restaurant Salt serves up everything from global cuisine with an imaginative twist to authentic native favourites and even features a specialty Japanese menu. If it's a weekend with that special someone then ignite a romantic spark while fine dining at the cosy Wine Cellar or with a soul-stirring dinner by the beach.
Discover the most colourful range of beverages at Crimson, the bar which also offers a signature mixology menu worthy of the finest cocktail cognoscenti. Raa, the beach bar is where guests would be most welcome with sand in their toes or even straight from the pool. Kick back over frozen drinks or fill up on nibbles.
If the holiday is one to stay active then make a splash at the resorts long pool that stretches out to the garden and ocean beyond or pump up at the gym. Everyone needs to be wired so there's complimentary high speed wifi from anywhere in the resort.
If one is seeking a complete retreat then make their way to the Spa. With a devotion to only the very best, the Spa presents a delicate combination of exotic healing elements at the hands of skilled therapists - one will never really want to leave.
If guests choose to stay in, each of the rooms offers a private balcony from which they can sit back and watch the ocean unfurl beyond. The Deluxe Allure Rooms are pure coastal chic whilst the Superior Iconic Rooms come with a bath tub on the balcony. The Shimmer suites let one live in an expansive space where dazzling elements take style to new heights. The super spot here is a jacuzzi for two out in the balcony with a panoramic ocean view. Each room also entails supreme comforts such as an LED screen TV, mini bar, tea-coffee making facilities and much more.
For Avurudu, Taprobana Wadduwa has planned a splendid southern style celebration with traditional customs and Avurudu kavili at their finest. Log onto www.taprobana.lk or call 0115769500 to make a reservation.
