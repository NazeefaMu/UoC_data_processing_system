‘Rejected leaders attempting to gain power by fuelling flames of racism’

The leaders who were rejected by the people are now fuelling the flames of racism and attempting to regain power somehow or other by indulging themselves in unruly acts that would not be tolerated by the people, said State Minister of Fisheries Dilip Vedaarachchi.
He was addressing a Dahamhamuwa at the Bodirukkarama Viharaya in Agunakolapelessa, recently. The foundation stone was laid for the construction of a shrine room at the temple premises. “The people now live in peace and harmony because there is no fear psychosis or the white van culture,” he said.
The minister said the Rajapaksa family earned fortunes in an unruly manner, while plundering the wealth of the less fortunate people of the country.
The opposition rejected by the people now spread false stories to mislead the people, but the people who are aware of what the Rajapaksa regime did, will not be misled or deceived by such utterances. The Minister said the locking up of the tills in temples was done from time immemorial, but the Opposition is trying to gain political mileage from this. The State Minister said Mahinda Rajapaksa is now in the custody of the Joint Opposition.
The members of the Joint Opposition are aware that they are unable to gain a place in politics without his support.
