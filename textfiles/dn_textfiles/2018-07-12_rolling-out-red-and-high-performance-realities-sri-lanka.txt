Rolling out the red and high performance realities for Sri Lanka

As the crow flies, this month of the all conquering Roman Emperor Julius Caesar...has seen its fair share of decisive victories and plenty of changes that Sri Lanka Rugby need to absorb and evolve.
Life on planet rugby and in Sri paradise is finally starting to look the part and hopefully a decent platform to leap boldly where no Sri islanders have done.
Decisive, specifics and ambition need to thrust our game forward and upwards.
We must conscientiously muscle our to better status in Asia, with our rugby hearts and sights ...on bigger, better, faster, more competitive, and more lucrative for our stakeholders.
This global hub and Olympic discipline is rocket friendly and well on its countdown to launch.
We need our most capable and astute administrators to set our sights, not just on a better footing ...but definitely on stronger results, upgrades and a leap up the rankings.
Sri rugby has to aim to be a dominant force in Asia and command more respect up at the top.
As we speak ...current rights to most rugby Asian is Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, UAE, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore etc ..
This is where we need the game to team up and upgrade.
Over the next 3years here are some likely opportunity and evolutionary factors.
Junior rugby age grade must be our major development push.
U17, U18, U19, U20...re evaluation and clarity in how we dominate all formats, both boys and girls 7s and 15s.
Not an impossible task by any stretch and practically achievable with a few basic performance upgrades.
A fresh look at results over the last 5 years in Asia, will stand up with much volume and relevance.
The president, executive committee, CEO, executive director and life members, need to get a strategic team set up for the skirmish ahead.
Priyantha Ekanayake, Rohan Gunaratne need to sit with Asanga Seneviratne, and the incoming Lasitha Gunaratne ...plus our rugby stalwarts age grade rugby and honorary life members...to get this 3-year battle launched.
Priority number 1 is that it is unanimous that we mark our ambition and set out to achieve it ....so that in 2021, Sri is the biggest contender and most consistent union at junior rugby in Asia.
For those troubled by the ambition, consider this ...Asia wide
We are top 5 in U19 15s side, Top 3 in U19 7s, Top 1 in U17 7s, and Top 8 in U 16 7s.
Seniors men & women
15s men top 7Asia, 15s women...New development, 7s men top 3 Asia and 7s women top 6.
This is our current status and no rocket science theory as to how we dominate Asia.
All juniors definitely in the bag by 2020.
All senior rugby ...with the exception of the 15s which has been significantly owned and jealously guarded by Japan, and unlikely successors from China, Korea, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka or Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore or Kazakhstan for the impressive world league anytime soon.
But for 7s ...it is definitely on the radar to embrace this title by 2020.
Women’s 7s needs a full mind and muscle skills plus pace upgrade to elevate them to top 2 and fierce contenders for sure by 2020. Just in case you are an expert and slightly perplexed...worried on 4 Jul 2018 wrote: Sri islanders rugby & the happy beyond?
Happy are those who instinctively know....
It is a brave rugby heart that would give Sri Lankan hopes that ultimate step up to world cup status and rank us among the rugby elite ...
This globally fascinating discipline has little time or quarter for amateurs and hesitant islanders, who are unable to clear their lines.
Sri Lanka Rugby ..formally the Ceylon Rugby Football Union, then the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union....history, pride, respect, courage and a potent recurring dream to be counted and considered among the greatest rugby nations.
On that perfect pass, our 7s team, led by the hardworking Muthuthanthri ...are currently in Paris for an extended experience tour. The Sri union finally able to get on board and some practical game time for the squad to absorb pressure and mature under different conditions.
Worried that we are dreaming too big ....don’t be.
Rugby is well set in Sri paradise, and has a remarkable following especially at school and national level.
Of course obvious upgrades and matter of professionals is soon to be set in stone ...the game has evolved, the players starting to see a means of a career and survival as a pro rugby player.
This is perhaps the most competitive and exciting times for the game and it’s player base in Sri Lanka....Carlton international rugby gave life to the international world format 7s that captured the imagination of the global 7s phenomenon. Now we stand on the brink of the next frontier for Sri Lanka Rugby....that frontier and pioneering skills will defiantly be for 7s and more so as an Olympic discipline., our fastest and most realistic pathway to greatness and world status.
Big big hand to St Peter’s and management for the Milo Knockouts trophy and big hand to fellow rivals St Joseph’s for grabbing more glory and the Singer 7s champions Cup with a statement win over favorites Royal in the final.
Much credit to all teams, backroom staff and the support for inspiration, motivation and volume wherever it mattered.
The players must be still tasting that fabulous joy of endorphins while they float for a while.
Grand indeed for the ok boys rugby set ups that support the game at all levels..it’s beyond fantastic how much is done to keep the ship afloat.
May it grow in stature and give these young developing minds and skills a lasting memory as they graduate to club and bigger.
Finally for all rugby hearts in paradise, I need Papare.com, Ganeesha David to specifically assign your best photographer to capture both Rev Father Rectors from Peters and Joes...smiling broadly ...and undoubtedly, the Saints marching in!
Bula bula the sheer euphoric joy of islanders rugby this month of Julius.
Cheers.
