Ex-Provincial Minister bailed out in accident case

Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage ordered a personal bail of Rs. 1 million with two sureties on Angage Jagath Thilakasiri Perera, former Health Minister of the Western Provincial Council and present councillor, when he was produced before court on August 7 by the Panadura South Police Traffic Branch over an accident.
The accident had occurred on July 31 on Horana Road, Alubomulla, where two youths were critically injured when the motorcycle they were riding collided with the car driven by Jagath Angage.
The suspect had paid Rs. 40,000 as medical assistance to the two youths, treated at the accident ward of the National Hospital Colombo since July 31.
One of the victims is unconscious and the other sustained fractures on a leg and hand, Panadura South Police Traffic officials told court.
The Chief Magistrate also ordered the Panadura Division SSP to conduct a fresh investigation into the accident and submit a report to court as he said the police had not conducted a proper investigation into the accident.
The Chief Magistrate also called for video footage of the accident from a private media channel telecast on August 1.
Premarathna Jayasinghe, Attorney-at-Law appeared for the relative of the injured youth.
He told court that the Panadura South Police Traffic Branch had not conducted a proper inquiry into the accident that occurred on the Horana Road, Alubomulla in Panadura on the night of July 31, when the suspect, Jagath Angage was driving his motorcar on the Horana Road.
The police said Jagath Angage, the driver, was also admitted to hospital. The Police had not recorded statements from the injured or witnesses. Attorney-at-Law Amila Navalage appeared for the suspect Angage, who denied allegations made by the lawyer appearing on behalf of the victim that Angage was driving his motorcar recklessly.
The case was postponed for October 9.
