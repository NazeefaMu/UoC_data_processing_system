Housemaid shot dead in Saudi Arabia
Minister assures welfare of family

Urgent steps will be taken to obtain all compensation payments for the family of the Sri Lankan housemaid employed in Saudi Arabia reportedly shot dead on March 12 by a mentally retarded person in the house where the housemaid was working, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando said.
Minister Fernando gave the assurance when he visited the late housemaid, Priyantha Jayasekara's family at their residence at Katamburawa, Wanduramba, Galle on March 17.
The Minister handed over Rs. 150,000 to the housemaid's family as an initial payment.
The Minister said the first duty of his ministry was to get down the housemaid's body to Sri Lanka and to obtain compensation payment to her family.
Apart from this, the Ministry would do its utmost to cater to the future welfare of the housemaid's children, he said.
He said the Ministry's final objective would be to prevent Sri Lankan women going for foreign employments as housemaids and promote the sending of trained workers for employments abroad instead.
Foreign Employment Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara said that while regretting this unfortunate incident, the Ministry would do its best to cater to the future welfare of the bereaved family.
