January 8 change freed politicised public service: Minister Madduma Bandara

The era that took hold of the public service as well as public servants brought to an end by the January 8 change, said Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
He said public servants were the pioneers to bring about change identifying the biggest impact on the country by the politicisation of the public service.
Minister Bandara said the main objective of the January 8 change was to establish democracy in the country.
He made these observations at the 2016 Convocation of the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
About 159 students obtained their Master of Public Management (MPM) and Postgraduate Diploma in Public Management (PGDPM). They included nine MPM graduands with merit pass and another nine PGDMP graduands.
Minister Bandara said education plays a pivotal role in developing a country. The previous government had allocated only 1.8 percent of the GDP to education while this government allocated six percent of the GDP.
“The people would be able to reap the benefits of these moves in future," Minister Bandara said.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella was also present.
