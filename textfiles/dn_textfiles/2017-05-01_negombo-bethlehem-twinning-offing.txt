Negombo-Bethlehem twinning in the offing

The Nativity Church of Bethlehem made a proposal to the Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith about a twinning agreement between Negombo and Bethlehem City. The proposal is supported by Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga.
Representative of Sri Lanka in Palestine Fawzan Anver, accompanied by Minister Amaratunga, recently handed over the request letter from the Nativity Church of Bethlehem to Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith.
The Nativity Church of Bethlehem’s Parish Priest Fr. Rami Asakrieh handed over the requested letter for the twinning agreement to Anver in Bethlehem.
In the letter, authorities of the Nativity Church state that people of Palestine and Sri Lanka are historically linked in trade and religion, with bonds of relationship stretching back to centuries in time.
The letter said, “The holy city of Bethlehem and Negombo strongly share the holiness of Christianity, and being so aware, the people Bethlehem have shown immense Interest to share links of direct connectivity with the people of Negombo to establish and promote religious, cultural, and social ties between the people of the two cities. As such, we propose to establish links of ‘Sister City’ between Bethlehem and Negombo.”
It is the first such request made by authorities at the Bethlehem church for a twinning agreement with an Asian city.
