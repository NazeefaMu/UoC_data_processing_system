Fisheries issue
Lanka won't complain to EU against India

The government has taken a policy decision not to lodge complains before the European Union against India in connection with the fisheries issue at international waters, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He made this observation in response to a query by a media personnel at yesterday's Cabinet briefing at the Information Department Ministry auditorium.
The minister said due to the bilateral agreements between the two countries and as Sri Lanka considers India a friendly neighbour, the government has taken this policy decision.
Senaratne also stated that this matter could be complained to the European Union or the Indian Ocean Commission and added that no complains would be made before any of the entities due to the policy decision.
Minister Senaratne said in response to a question raised by a media personnel that there are no political prisoners in Sri Lanka but terrorist suspects.
He said the government will take legal action against those suspects if there's evidence against them or release them if there's no evidence.
The minister in response to another media personnel stated that there was no justice in law not being implemented against KP who was arrested on suspicion of being the LTTE international leader. He said there were discussions regarding the issue. Senaratne also revealed that there are some sections attempting to protect leaders of previous regime by violating KP's freedom of speech.
He said KP had told a journalist attached to a weekend Sinhala language newspaper that he had no freedom to speak. He said that according to the journalist there had been several Army personnel there.
