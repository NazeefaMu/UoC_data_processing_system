Selecting a qualified security assessor  for banks, financial institutions

 
The recent ATM security data breach in the SAARC Region is an alarming situation where banks and financial institutions need to start thinking and focusing on safeguarding their systems to avoid similar breaches in future.
It has been said in media reports that the breach would have possibly affected 3.2 million debit cardholders.
A data breach has been linked with a serious compromise of a leading payment card processor company in India which in turn has raised a serious alarm for the entire payment card industry and leave us with a thought that we have to re-think on security and not just compliance - card processor company was said to be following the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (Version 3.2), Also known as PCI-DSS, intended to safeguard cardholder data.
However, still the majority of the companies are not in full compliance with the PCI-DSS standard. PCI standard is very effective in reducing breaches if we understand the intent behind each requirement and implement them smoothly with the support of good standing Qualified Security Assessor would help organisations to prevent themselves from such occurrence of similar breach.
“Security and not just compliance” - As an industry we should admit that we have missed behind the importance of information security and have started focusing on just compliance by compromising on security with the cost, technical expertise and lack of adaption with new technologies.
Payment card processors/ Merchants/ Banks/ Payment Gateways are usually expected to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), a code of security best practice designed to guard from external and internal attacks and thwart hackers to penetrate into the network, database, and application servers from obtaining card holder details. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard aimed at creating an additional level of protection for card issuers and acquirer's by ensuring that merchants and Third Party Payment Processors and Payment gateways meet a minimum level of security while they are storing, processing and or transmitting cardholder data.
The PCI-DSS audit should be always seen as a security consulting assessment, rather than just an audit to achieve a certificate or a piece of paper. Successful engagement starts with choosing the right Qualified Security Assessor, Organisation should select someone who influences you with their competence and have bandwidth to work well with your team.

2. Payment Security Training like CPISI should be made mandatory for all individuals inside a payments organisation including CISO's/Security Managers of the organisation.
