Losing to Morocco was a shocker – chief selector Jayasekara

Michael Jayasekara, chairman of Sri Lanka rugby selection committee said that losing to Morocco was a ‘shocker’ following Sri Lanka’s disappointing performance at the men’s Olympic sevens rugby competition of the repechage event in Monaco.

“The losing margins were huge and losing to Germany and Canada is acceptable because they are ranked in the top five but the loss against Morocco was a shocker as well as against South Korea. We have beaten the Koreans many times in the Asian Sevens circuit,” Jayasekera told the ‘Daily News’.
“I think Muthuthantri did all what he could as captain and I believe we are still not ready and up to the mark to face this kind of an opposition. Especially the European sides, which are really big in physique where we are really small.
“In the Monaco tournament the size was a huge factor. We need to wait till the team and the coaching staff returns to the island to see what really happened. We also need to check who had performed and who had not.
“When it comes to an Olympic sport event everybody wants to compete with each other to book a place to take part because it’s the most prestigious event happening in the whole world. Winning a medal at this event is the hallmark of any living sportsman’s dream,” Jayasekara said.
Meanwhile the dejected Sri Lankan side that lost all their matches on the first day dished out a much improved performance yesterday to beat Mexico 22-19 with tries coming from Kanchan Ramanayaka- two, Srinath Sooriyabandara and Jason Dissanayaka one try each with Sooriyabandara making one conversion.
In their final match against South Korea the Lankans gave a superb fight back and after scores were deadlocked at 24 all, lost in the final minute by 31-24 due to a last ditch try scored by Kim and Oh slotting down the conversion. With this win South Korea finished in 13th place.
For the Sri Lankans Jason Dissanayaka scored two breath taking tries and Danushka Ranjan and Richard Dharmapala scored a try apiece. Sooriyabandara put over two conversions. - (WAI)
