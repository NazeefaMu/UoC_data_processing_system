satellite technology for Agriculture

The use of satellite technology and drone technology for agriculture, land use and allied applications was discussed by Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development & Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage, at his Ministry office at Sethsiripaya last week.
This was with officials of the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies that comes under the purview of the ministry.
It was decided at the meeting to make use of these advanced technologies in the government’s development programmes in the relevant institutions, particularly in relation to agricultural development and irrigation, with the support and assistance of the Arthur C. Clarke Centre. It is expected that this will mark a significant breakthrough in development action.
Officials from the Department of Agriculture, the Irrigation Department, the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute, the Survey Department, the UDA, the Civil Aviation Department and the Land Use Planning Department also participated.
