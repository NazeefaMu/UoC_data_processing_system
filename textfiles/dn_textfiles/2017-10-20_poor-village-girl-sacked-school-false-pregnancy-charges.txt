Poor village girl sacked from school on false pregnancy charges

A Grade 10 school girl attached to a government school in Madatugama in Kekirawa is receiving treatment at the Dambulla hospital due to a silly draconian punishment meted out to her by her woman Principal.
The girl belongs to a family in Hewenthennegama, Madatugama languishing in abject poverty. Many a day she attends school without any food as foregoing meals is common with their family. On this particular day too she had attended school without breakfast. She had suddenly vomited in class as her stomach was totally empty. Thereafter, three other girls had informed the Principal about the incident alleging that she was pregnant. Without ascertaining true facts the Principal had summoned teachers in the disciplinary committee and after a secret discussion summoned the girl's parents to the school and issued a letter of termination saying the girl is sacked from school as she was ‘expecting'.
The poor parents who were clueless of the whole matter had obtained a loan of Rs. 500, taken the girl in a taxi and admitted her to Dambulla hospital relating the whole story to the doctors including their predicament. After a protracted medical examination the doctors had concluded that the girl was neither pregnant nor a victim of any sexual abuse.
Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. Gamini Senanayake when contacted said the hospital VOG had medically examined the girl and issued as all clear certificate. Dr. Senanayake said they had lodged a complaint with the Children's and Women's Secretariat about the entire story.
They were keeping the girl under observation at the hospital until she got over her psychological trauma caused by the false accusations leveled at her. The girl's mother D. M. Somawathie (57) said a teacher spoke to her on the telephone on October 12 and summoned her and husband to school.
When they went as requested, the teachers told them to take her away from school alleging that she was pregnant. Although the daughter vehemently denied the charge in deep mental agony, they persisted with their stand. She said her daughter was a bright student with great learning skills and a group of girls had made the false complaint through sheer jealousy. Their family could not even face the neighbours as the story had spread in the village like wild fire.
Their intention was to get their daughter back to the same school in order to prove her innocence.
School Principal S. K. Godakanda who was contacted on the phone said they had to sack the girl due to indiscipline.
