Singapore Airlines GM sees huge growth potential for Colombo services

There is a steady growth in the Colombo-Singapore sector and Colombo as a destination has shown tremendous potential to both Singapore Airlines and Silk Air, said Singapore Airlines Sri Lanka General Manager Hu Hong Yao.
Speaking to Daily NewsBIZ Aviation, he said that this is the main reason for the airline to introduce their sister airline, Silk Air, to Sri Lanka from this year.
“Currently Silk Air flies thrice to Colombo and soon this frequency would be increased gradually to make it a daily.”
In addition, Singapore Airlines operates daily flights and if Colombo maintains its growth trajectory, additional flights may be considered. Similar to the increase in passenger demand, there is also steady growth in the cargo sector as well, he said.

He however said that they would rule out operating Airbus A380 aircraft to Colombo and also operating stopover flights to Mattala airport.
He said that Changi Aarport has two peak schedules, both in themorning and at night and the Silk Air flight was introduced mainly to offer quicker connections to meet this peak.
He said that both Singapore and Sri Lanka offer visas on arrival for and this is a major plus point to increase their passenger loads.
“Since Indonesia too offers visas on arrival for Sri Lanka travellers, Singapore is a preferred transit point for Sri Lankans to fly to several points in Jakarta.”
Commenting on the Colombo airport he said that he feels that more retails stores with global brand names should come up. “The country needs to offer better shopping facilities at the Colombo airport.”
He said in contrast, the shopping experience at the Changi airport in Singapore is huge and this gives several options for the transit passenger. He also said that passengers flying beyond Singapore with over four hour transit are offered free city tours, Changi airport $20 dollar value vouchers, lounge facilities and many more.
The GM said that one of the other unique features of flying with both Singapore Airlines and Silk Air is that the passenger has the option to use either airline for their travel on one single ticket, according to their preferred flight departure time.
He said the GSA, Aitken Spence too, along with the staff in Colombo, is one of the airline's great assets and they are like a family to them.
