UPFA confident of  victory - Salley

United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Mayoral candidate for the Colombo Municipal Council, Azath Salley yesterday said he was confident of winning, being a person with a proven track record.
Salley having chosen his slogan to be ‘clean administration’ also promised a credible team to support him in the Council.
“People are confident that Azath Salley as a Mayor will definitely deliver,”he said speaking to the Daily News.
He added “As a Deputy Mayor in 2001, I worked for the people regardless of their party, race or religion, Colombo is not a new place for me,” Salley said.
Salley who entered Local Government politics in 1991, was elected to the CMC in 1997 and acted as the Deputy Mayor under the UNP in 2001.
Contesting the Colombo Central seat, he dismissed doubts over him being not able to win it through a UPFA candidature. “Though Colombo has been a traditional UNP seat, they have not delivered all these years. People want change. They are sick of seeing the same old faces. I have the blessings of the President and we are putting forward very important and credible people,” Salley added.
President Sirisena stands for clean politics and I want a clean administration. We will deliver that,” Salley said.
