Around 10,000 elders seek shelter in homes

According to the latest survey conducted by the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare, it has been revealed that about 10,000 aged persons have sought shelter in 306 elders’ homes countrywide.
These senior citizens are now housed in six government elders’ homes and 300 elders’ homes maintained by the Provincial Departments of Social Services. “Most of these aged persons have been handed over to the elders’ homes by their own children. Some are ill- treated and neglected by their own children. About 57 aged parents of these have already filed cases against their children demanding maintenance allowances. It has been estimated that 2.5 million persons who are above 60 years are included in the total population of Sri Lanka,” said W. E. Jayathilake, former Divisional Secretary for Bingiriya in Kurunegala.
He was addressing a meeting of representatives of Elders’ Associations of the Kurunegala District held in Bingiriya recently.
