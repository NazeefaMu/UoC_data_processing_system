From the skies above

Everything was arranged in the chopper to smoothen the mission. Doors removed. Seats re-arranged. And the safety ensured for the team.
In early 2013, Dominic Sansoni, Sebastian Posingis and Richard Simon launched a mission with Squadron Leader Asiri Pathirage and his four-man crew from the Sri Lanka Air Force on the SLAF SUH556. The chopper is a ‘war veteran, now decommissioned and decked out in civilian livery’ to borrow words from Richard’s account.
Both Dominic Sansoni and Sebastian Posingis flew all over the island, first tracing the coastline, then making a series of flights across the interior of the island. They gradually developed a digital repository of photographs taken at heights ranging from 1000 feet near ground level. The visual granary has accommodated towns as well as wildernesses, paddy fields as well as tea plantations, people at work as well as play, domestic animals as well as wildlife; mountains, forests, waterfalls, rivers, beaches and offshore islands; dagobas, temples, mosques and churches; in essence, the whole country in one capsule form.
“We had long wanted to photograph Sri Lanka from the air. But it is quite an expensive task. Luckily Access Engineering came our way. They wanted to celebrate their silver jubilee, and warmly welcomed this proposal of ours.”
Sebastian was to join Dominic in the photographic task with Richard Simons behind them to put in the written version. Simons’ narrative, however, is not linked to the photographs. Nay, it is not a captioned essay to support the photographs. The narrative and the photographs decorate the voluminous coffee-table book in two layers on one theme: Sri Lanka.
Simons’ text is an illustrated version of Sri Lanka taking the reader to the mystery, mythology, history and various other abodes blanketing the country. The wordsmith tenders a photographic narrative of how Ravana must have flown across the island. Long before Dominic and Sebastian have taken the picturesque landscape into custody with their Nikon DSLRs, it could have been an already-experienced spectacle to the legendary king.
“Whether I believe this mythology or not is not important. What matters is to talk about it so that people can relate their own experiences to it. My job is not to tell what to believe, but to reinterpret it to go along with the artistic content. That is where three of us merge,” Simons said.
Flying above, however, was not that much of a pleasant experience for Dominic. Maybe not necessarily acrophobia, but Dominic claims that flying above is not always a pleasant experience for him.
“There were times when I felt it is simply stupid to get into something heavier than air or water. Sometimes I thought about it and wondered why I am in this project at all. I am not fond of fights. Even if you put me up the ladder, I will easily get scared,” Dominic expressed.
But the landscape down below was too tempting. The team did not have much time to think. They had a job in their hand. They did not have much time for worry either.
“Sri Lankan Air Force was the best team to fly with. I found them fantastic. They are very knowledgeable. Well experienced,” Dominic added.
With Colombo as the starting point, the chopper took the team up to west coast as far as Talaimannar, Puttalam, Vavuniya, northeast, east coast and then to Palali.
“You can never cover Sri Lanka because there are a lot of places to capture. We had to pick the places that stand out. Not necessarily the landmark. Any interesting geographical location such as the dunes of Bundala will do. You cannot find such spots easily. If you go to Adam’s Bridge, you will find a terrain that you will not see anywhere else in the country. We thought about that. Our journey was one circle around the whole country, another circle around the hill country, and in the middle,” Simons chipped in.
The most difficult part was hiring an Air Force helicopter. It will probably cost you a fortune. That’s when Access Engineering came calling.
“I would call them amazing patrons. And the Air Force team was also amazing. They did not come behind to see what we are doing. They did not impose any restrictions on our assignment. They simply asked us to photograph anything. It was not only fantastic but also a rare opportunity,” Dominic added.
Many Sri Lankan corporate bodies invest their monies to boast about their logo or the products, Simons elaborates with experience in advertising for 35 years.
“I say they are wasting their money. In the end, only the people of the company are interested in it. But a project like this reaches out to different people, markets and age groups. There is quite a lot to gain in the long run,” Simons elaborated.
The biggest challenge for Sebastian was the necessity to a quick reaction.
“You haven’t got much time. You have to be swift. You miss one thing, and it’s gone. You have to react quickly. And you don’t know what to expect either. You don’t know how they look like in the air. I would not call them challenges, but the big surprises. We never had an idea on how to undertake this project. But in the end, we managed to focus a lot on the details,” Sebastian added.
Simons was to add other technical challenges – or rather surprises – such as sun and difficult angles.
“I thought I knew Sri Lanka because I have travelled and flown a lot. But on this journey, I came to realise how arrogant I had been. Oh my god the surprises we had! That was a fantastic experience,” Dominic said.
