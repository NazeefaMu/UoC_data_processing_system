Sweet ice cream Sweet ice cream season

This year Pelwatte Dairy Industries is adding a range of exciting ice-cream flavours. Apart from the traditional chocolate and vanilla ice-cream, the Pelwatte Dairy ice-cream range also includes fruity varieties such as banana, fruit and nut, mango and strawberry. Made from locally sourced full-cream milk, Pelwatte Dairy’s ice-cream recipe contains only 100 percent natural ingredients. It does not use artificial sweeteners or emulsifiers, making the product healthier and safe for consumption.
Speaking on the ice-cream range Pelwatte Dairy’s Director Marketing Akmal Wickramanayake notes: “For decades ice-cream has had a special place at family meals and the Christmas season just calls for indulging. Our fruity range adds a twist on the traditional and gives it a more tropical taste.
The natural banana and mango flavour appeals to local taste-buds with a hint of tanginess, while the strawberry and fruit and nut is for those who have an extra-sweet sweet tooth.”
