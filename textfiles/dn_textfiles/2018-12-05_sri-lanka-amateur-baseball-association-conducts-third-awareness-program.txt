Sri Lanka Amateur Baseball Association conducts third awareness program

Sri Lanka Amateur Baseball/ Softball Association (SLABSA) conducted their third Baseball Awareness program at Hanwella Rajasinghe Central College grounds, Hanwella recently. This program was a resounding success with over 450 boys and girls taking part in the event. Enthusiasm shown by the students were exceptional. All the students were given the opportunity to test their skill in various aspects such as pitching, batting and fielding techniques. So much so that the organizers were able to unearth a huge bounty of raw talent.
SLABSA gifted the school a starter pack so the students could initiate the training and promised a larger shipment in January.
The CEO of SLABSA, Priyantha Ekanayake thanked the principal Jagath Priyashantha, vice-principal Keerthi Karunarathna, Sri Lanka Air Force Baseball team, JICA Japanese coaches, Amila Pathiraja (Sri Lanka Coach), Air Force Coach Priyantha Peiris and main sponsors Horizon Campus and Ninewells Hospitals who helped development of the game.
SLABSA will be conducting further training workshops for players and coaches on a regular basis, the next one being targeted for January in Galle.
