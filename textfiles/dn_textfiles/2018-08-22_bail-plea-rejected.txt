Alleged bribery charges against two officials
Bail plea rejected

Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday rejected the bail plea of the President’s former Chief of Staff I. H. K. Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake who were in remand custody on bribery charges.
While rejecting the bail plea, the Magistrate stated that there was no special circumstances to grant bail for the two suspects.
The investigations began with the complaint that I.H.K. Mahanama had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs. 540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale Sugar Factory.
Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago, while he was the Land Ministry Secretary.
However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded that it be reduced.
Within several weeks, they had allegedly agreed to accept Rs.100 million. The two were arrested at a hotel car park in Colombo, on May 3, by Bribery Commission officers while accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million.
While objecting to bail, the Attorney-at-Law appearing on behalf of the Bribery Commission informed the Magistrate that there is no special circumstance to grant bail at this time.
However, the Magistrate ordered that the suspects be further remanded till September 4.
