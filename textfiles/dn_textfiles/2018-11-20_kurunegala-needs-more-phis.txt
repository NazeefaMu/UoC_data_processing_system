Kurunegala needs more PHIs

A senior official attached to the Kurunegala District PHIs’ Association said there are about 53 vacancies for PHIs in the Kurunegala District at present.
There are 28 MOH divisions in the Kurunegala District now and the lack of PHIs has led to the slow implementation of healthcare work for schoolchildren and residents of Kurunegala.
According to the WHO guidelines, a PHI has 10,000 residents to oversee, but now, in Kurunegala, a PHI has 35,000 residents. Hence, an adequate number of PHIs needs to be recruited in 2019 to serve the people properly to ensure better healthcare for people in Kurunegala, Kurunegala District senior Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake said.
