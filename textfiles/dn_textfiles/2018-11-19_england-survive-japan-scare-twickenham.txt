England survive Japan scare at Twickenham

TWICKENHAM, Saturday: England came from behind to beat Japan 35-15 at Twickenham on Saturday as they avoided a shock defeat by the 2019 World Cup hosts.
Japan led 15-10 at half-time and were threatening an upset to rival their stunning 34-32 win over South Africa at the 2015 World Cup, when they were coached by current England boss Eddie Jones.
But England scored 25 unanswered points after the break, with late tries from Test debutant Joe Cokanasiga and Dylan Hartley sealing victory. England scrum-half Danny Care scored the first try of the match in the third minute but Japan’s passing and handling was far sharper in the opening stages of a dry day well-suited to their running game.
Japan’s enterprising play was rewarded with tries by centre Ryoko Nakamura and captain Michael Leitch.
Meanwhile England again paid the price for indiscipline, with hooker Jamie George, starting in place of regular co-captain Hartley, sin-binned.
But England recovered to lead thanks to openside flanker Mark Wilson’s first Test try and the boot of George Ford, their captain for this match, before powering away.
Fly-half Ford, winning his 50th cap, led the team after being benched for a 12-11 win over South Africa and the All Blacks loss.
Japan’s ‘amateur’ players were earning £14 (2,000 Yen) per day for this game, whereas their England counterparts receive £25,000 per match. – AFP
