Ayurveda officials accepting bribe:
Health Minister calls for investigation

Health officials were instructed by Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne to investigate the incident that officials attached to the Department of Ayurveda soliciting a Rs.50,000 bribe from a producer of Ayurvedic herbals, Health Ministry Spokesman said.
The officials were nabbed by the officials of Bribery Commission recently.
Minister Senaratne had ordered Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa to conduct an investigation into the incident. Minister Senaratne is taking part in an End TB Summit in India now.
An Assistant Legal Officer at the Department of Ayurveda and a member of the Formula Committee were caught when they were accepting the bribe from a producer of Ayurvedic herbals, he said.
They had taken the money to renew the producer’s permit. He had lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against the officials a few days ago, he said.
