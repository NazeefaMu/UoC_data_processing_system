Crysbro Group provides pure drinking  water to war heroes in unique CSR

Crysbro Group the poultry producer in Sri Lanka with ISO 14001,environment safety certification, British Consortium Certification, ISO 9001, ISO 22000, HACCP, BRC and Halal certifications has intervened in an unprecedented project to provide pure drinking water to Sri Lanka war heroes at the Army Rifle Corps Camp, Atabage Kothmale.
This was to show sheer gratitude to the Army personnel's quick response and heroic maneuver to douse the hazardous fire in the jungle close to their Modern Processing Plant which was spreading dangerously towards the Plant. At this point of time the management of Crysbro Group had sent an urgent SOS request seeking help from the SL Army Rifle Corps, Atabage Camp to douse the fire. Swiftly responding to urgent request of Cryspro a team from the Atabage Camp had rushed to the vicinity of the bushfire and brought it under control in an effective and efficient manner preventing any injury of loss .
As a mark of appreciation to the heroic task of the Army personnel of the, Atabage Camp and to showcase Crysbro Groups heartiest gratitude, the Chairman / MD and Group Human Resources Manager had personally visited the camp and met the Commanding Officer (CO), Major Manoj Weerawardhana and other relevant Officers who were instrumental in the great endeavor of dousing the very perilous forest fire.
During the discussion, it was revealed that the camp which consisted over 350 personnel was suffering from an acute pure drinking water shortage problem. The camp used to source water for their needs from a water stream close to the camp. But due to the lack of resources the camp had been unable to get the water purified up to excepted hygienic standards which related to Army personnel falling ill by drinking the water. The Crysbro Management considering the poor plight of the water situation in the camp had then decided to embark on the unique task of providing the camp with a fully fledged water treatment, filter project. The Crysbro Management was even to its commitment completing the project in one month and handing over the cutting edge water treatment filtering plant to the camp's Commanding Officer Major Manoj Weerawardhana.
The handing over ceremony took place in the presence of Senior Officials from Crysbro and all Senior Officers of the camp.
Commanding Officer Major Manoj Weerawardhana expressing his sincere appreciation and gratitude on behalf of all the personnel of the Army Rifle Corps Camp, Atabage said, "Pure drinking water has been a serious problem for a long time in this camp. There were incidents where many soldiers had to be hospitalized due to contacting hepatitis after consuming water. We are very happy to have a highly technical water filtering plant for us which was donated by Crysbro."
Commanding Officer Major Manoj Weerawardhana and his team also handed over a Token of Appreciation to Crysbo representatives.
