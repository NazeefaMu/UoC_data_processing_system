Rare paddy plant that could produce more that 2 kg of paddy

A farmer from Katuwawala, Maharagama, Upali Dayananda, had cultivated a rare paddy variety in his field, which produces more than two kilograms of paddy from a single plant. He had cultivated this special type of paddy variety in his home garden.
According to him, this paddy variety does not need to be cultivated in paddy fields, as it could be cultivated as usual on any ground as ‘Goda Vee.’ Accordingly, this paddy variety could be categorised as “Eal Vee” as it does not need much water.
He said that he cultivated this paddy variety in his home garden after he received a few seeds from a friend engaged in the Archeology sector in Sigiriya, last September. He had used only organic fertiliser for this cultivation, he said. He said that a paddy plant grew up to a height of 10 feet.
