Welcome 2017!

The Kingsbury once again out did itself to give its patrons an unforgettable experience and memories for a lifetime as it became the venue for The grandest New Year’s Eve Celebrations in town.
Offering the ultimate Sri Lankan New Year’s Eve dinner dance experience, The Kingsbury Retro Fusion 2016 was a spectacular show with the ‘Marians’ and ‘Doctor’ sharing the stage. A fusion of all the classic Sinhala and English hits were enjoyed by all as the dance floor was a frenzy full of cheer and joy. The Kingsbury culinary team came together to present a gala dinner buffet fit for royalty as it was nothing short of astounding!
Ushering the New Year in sophistication and glamour Sky Lounge was the venue for the most exclusive party in town. Set against the stunning views of the brilliantly lit Galle Face green, Colombo City Harbour and the Indian Ocean the venue came alive to the sounds of DJ Wendell. The atmosphere was electric as revelers indulged in unlimited premium beverages and delicious gourmet cuisine.
At the stroke of midnight the sky lit up to a breathtaking fireworks display and the wonderful moment was shared by all as they embraced their loved ones and wished them well for the New Year.
The Kingsbury met and exceeded the expectations of all its patrons and delivered a truly sensational New Year’s Eve celebration. The hotel staff extends its warmest greetings for a luxurious 2017!
