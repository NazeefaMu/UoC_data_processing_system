RTC gallops into new year with races and aces

With 2017 into its third week the Royal Turf Club in Nuwara Eliya (RTC) is well set to put into practice all those new year resolutions that they had set for themselves.
The welfare of the horses has always been the highest priority for RTC. It is with this in mind that the ‘Wish List’ put up by the resident veterinarian Dr. Balaji was immediately granted. A portable xray machine and a scanner are the latest additions to the Veterinary Hospital. Both are state of the art and the very latest and they will be of tremendous help in diagnosing ailments and injuries. It will provide Dr. Balaji with just the sort of technical support a good doctor needs to take his practice to an even higher level. To put it in a nutshell the horses can expect the very best when it comes to medical care which is so very important for keeping horses in the best of health.
Horse and rider go hand in hand and each compliments the other. The RTC has always realised the importance of creating local riding talent and promoting the cause of local Sri Lankan jockeys. You need the right instructors and along with that you need equipment.
The RTC could not have a better man to impart the right knowledge to young aspiring champions than the Indian riding ace Sinclair Marshall . A top jockey in his own right Sinclair lives and breathes horses and still rides out every morning. The wealth of knowledge and experience that he has accumulated over the years is incomparable. He's got the patience and the inclination to teach and to assist him the RTC has brought in a riding simulator and since the arrival of the simulator the jockeys have been exercising on the simulator to improve their posture, balance, fitness in the art of riding, as well as finish off their performance in a polished and professional manner. The simulator will allow budding riders to learn and hone their skill on a machine which simulates the action of a thoroughbred racehorse at full gallop. Apprentice Jockey Training Schools the world over have the simulator as a mainstay and now the RTC joins the ranks of these elite few.
The manufacturer of the simulator Richard Perham, coach at the British Racing School, New Market UK, says "Whether it is used to teach young riders the art of riding a finish or for champions to warm up before race riding, the simulator is a must."These lads are going to be the Sri Lankan jockeys of the future. The winter chill has seen Nuwara Eliya covered with a layer of frost every morning.
It may have kept the locals indoors but it hasn't deterred the horses from being exercised on the track every day as they set about getting ready for the new year’s racing season which kicks off in February and then goes all the way till End April. The next race days are February 11 - Independent Race Day, followed by April 2,16 and 29.
