Excise Department officials have arrested an Austrian national and two Sri Lankans on Wednesday, with Black Mendi, a drug which had never been found in the country and according to sources, could turn a person insane if overdosed, in their pre-Wesak Full Moon Poya Day raids.
The Austrian national and the two Sri Lankan youth were arrested with 82 grams of Black Mendi valued at Rs 1.2 million at Rekawa, Tangalla in the Southern Province. The officials had seized 241 grams of Hashish worth Rs 250,000.
The 36-year old Austrian national was a professional of Event Organizing and Management, while the two youth in the range of 25 years, were residents of Tangalla area and engaged in employment related to the tourism industry. The two Sri Lankans allegedly had been gravely addicted to drugs.
