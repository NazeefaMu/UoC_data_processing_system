Meanwhile, President's Counsel Gamini Marapana appearing on behalf of MP Rajapaksa informed Court that his client has expressed his willingness to appear before the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) and make a statement regarding the investigations against him.
However, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam with Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appearing on behalf of the Bribery Commission informed Court they will have to seek Bribery Commission's advice regarding the new developments, and the Court would be informed accordingly.
Therefore, Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyasath Dep, and Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare fixed the matter for January 31.
At a previous occasion, the SC served a charge sheet on Hambantota District MP Namal Rajapaksa regarding the complaint.
The former CIABOC Director General had filed a complaint in the SC against MP Namal Rajapaksa for allegedly disrespecting the authority of the Bribery Commission by failing to appear before the Commission without reasonable cause and failing to produce an affidavit over an investigation on the assets of the MP.
In her complaint, former CIABOC Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickremasinghe PC requested the Supreme Court that proceedings against Namal Rajapaksa be initiated for the offence of contempt under Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
The complainant maintained that the CIABOC commenced an investigation on the assets of Rajapaksa which would be an indictable offence under Section 23 of the bribery Act if the investigation reveals evidence to substantiate an offence of bribery. The complainant stated that as part of a routine investigation step and for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of the matter being investigated, respondent Namal Rajapaksa was required by notice December 14, 2015 to produce an affidavit by January 20, 2016 under section 5(1)(g) of the CIABOC.
She said the respondent by his letter dated January 19, 2016 requested further time to submit the affidavit and was accordingly given further time until March 15, 2016 to submit an affidavit but did not submit it as directed.
The complainant further said the CIABOC on April 28, 2016 served summons on the respondent to appear before the Commission on May 26, 2016.
The complainant alleged that the respondent committed an offence of contempt against or in disrespect of the authority of the CIABOC under section 20 (3) (C ) of the Commission Act by refusing without a reasonable cause to provide an affidavit.
She further alleged that MP Rajapaksa committed an offence of contempt against or in disrespect of the authority of the CIABOC under section 20 (3)s (C ) of the Commission Act by failing without reasonable cause to appear before the Commission on May 26 in response to the summons served on April 28, 2016.
The complainant said she was filing this legal action in the matter of a rule in terms of Article 105(3) of the Constitution read with the section of the CIABOC.
