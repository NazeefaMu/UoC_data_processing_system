EDB formulates  national strategy for exports

The Export Development Board EDB has initiated action on the preparation of a National Export Strategy (NES) for the next five years. The EDB is empowered by the Sri Lanka Export development Act to prepare a national Export strategy.
The initial consultative meeting was held recently at the EDB chaired by International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe.
The NES is a collaborative effort of the state and private sectors to provide a detailed and prioritised five-year action-oriented framework for the development of trade and competitiveness particularly for the benefit of the Small and medium sector SME in Sri Lanka. The strategy will provide a clear direction for sustainable export led growth to make Sri Lanka a key trade hub in the Indian Ocean. The main objective of the initial meeting was to discuss the NES objectives and agree on the next milestones. An aggregated set of detailed strategies with realistic and measurable action plans will be prepared.
Detailed strategies for the development of product and service areas and key trade support areas such as trade promotion, trade intelligence, trade financing, quality and enterprise competency development will be prepared.
EDB Chairperson and Chief Executive Indira Malwatte, Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry Secretary Chandani Wijayawardena, Agency for International Trade Managing Director Dr.Saman Kalegama were among the thirteen members of the consultative team and the NES coordinated by the Policy and strategic planning division of the EDB. Technical assistance for the NES is provided by the International Trade Centre (ITC), based in Geneva and financially supported by the European Union.
