Point of view
Sri Lankan equity markets ended the week on a positive note, reversing 3-weeks of consecutive declines.
Despite hitting a one-month low on Monday, the bourse gained ~13 points or 0.20% over the remainder of the week as stronger-than-expected corporate earnings from Index-heavy-weights generated some market interest.
The benchmark ASPI slipped ~34 points or -0.52% (the highest daily drop since March’18) on Monday but regained ~47 points (0.73%) to close the week ~10 points shy of the key psychological mark of 6500.
Monday’s losses were reversed as index heavy-weight CTC gained ~3.31% and contributed 13.6 points to ASPI following its earnings release (CTC recorded ~17% earnings growth supported by a surprise volume growth).
Although markets moved to positive territory over the week, activity levels remained relatively dull during the week as the turnover dropped to Rs.2.6Bn from Rs.3.2Bn a week ago and average daily turnover fell to Rs.0.52Bn (cf. Rs.1.0Bn year to date).
HNI and institutional investors remained on the sidelines over the week, with crossings accounting for just ~29% (Rs.0.8Bn) of the weekly turnover (cf. ~40% last week, and ~44% year to date weekly average).
TJL (Rs.0.5Bn) accounted for ~63% of the block purchases while Distilleries accounted for ~19%.
Foreign investors meanwhile, recorded a net outflow of Rs.0.46Bn for the first time in last 5-weeks reflecting the broader global pattern of declining inflows to EM/FM markets since Feb’18.
The outflows widened the YTD net outflow position on the Bourse to Rs.0.8Bn in (including strategic sale of LOLC for Rs.12.8Bn).
Higher Rupee depreciation continues to remain a major concern for foreign investors, particularly given the LKR’s ~3.4% depreciation so far this year.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from the corporate earnings for Mar’18 quarter and further political and economic developments.
LKR depreciates for sixth consecutive week
The LKR continued its slide for the 6th consecutive week, hitting a record low of Rs.158.51 against the USD on Thursday to record an 0.1% depreciation over the week.
The LKR has lost ~3% against the USD so far this year (notably higher than the 1.8% depreciation recorded in the comparable period last year) as a strengthening USD coupled with low exporter dollar conversions, greater security market outflows and lower CBSL intervention has added pressure on the LKR.
This year’s USD strengthening in particular has impacted EM/FM currencies across the board and the LKR remains no exception.
However, recent pressure on the LKR has been notable, prompting the CBSL to assure markets about the currency’s stability.
The CBSL noted that the current pressure on the LKR is unwarranted as underlying fundamentals remain robust with gross external reserves totaling a healthy $9.1Bn and the Real effective exchange rate indices indicating a competitive currency.
The CBSL noted further that foreign inflows over the next few weeks (IMF tranche, final payment for Hambantota port & syndicated loan proceeds) are expected to further boost the country’s reserve position up to $11Bn by mid-June.
The Wall Street Journal meanwhile, noted that despite the LKR coming under pressure from an appreciating USD, the LKR still supports a sound investment in the equity market.
The Journal noted that although the LKR remains vulnerable to further dollar appreciation, Sri Lanka may suffer less than most as it tends to be among the economies least affected by changes in the USD’s value.
The Journal also quoted analyst views that despite its challenging macroeconomic and political picture, Sri Lanka has all the ingredients to be a “break-out” economy which is attractive at its current cheap valuations.
