Mahesh Abeyratne qualifies for Asian Masters Athletics

Veteran Army athlete, Colonel Mahesh Abeyratne has qualified for the forthcoming 20th Asian Masters Athletics Championship in Rugao, China to compete in two under-50 age category events, javelin throw and hammer throw. The meet will be worked off from September 24 to 28.
Mahesh excelled at the recently held qualifying event, the Sri Lanka Masters Athletics Annual (Open) Championship by creating a new record for the under-50 hammer throw event throwing a distance of 41.95 m. The previous record was 39.17 m. The qualifying event was organized by the Sri Lanka Masters Athletics Association and held at the Nuwara Eliya Municipal grounds on April 23 and 24 with Education State Minister V. Radhakrisnan participating as the chief guest.
Mahesh also performed well to reach the qualifying standard in the javelin throw with an over 41m throw and will represent the country in both events in China.
Mahesh represents SL Army Sports Club and was selected for the 2015 World Masters Championship in France and 2016 World Masters Championship in Australia, but unfortunately did not participate in both top notched international events.
Even though Mahesh was given the green light by the selectors to represent Sri Lanka at both events in China, he will be back on the field during the final selection trials to be held at the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium on May 20 and 21.
Mahesh's key event will be the hammer throw and he is eager to better his performances at the final trials. With his record breaking performance, Mahesh is in range of winning a medal for his country in China.
