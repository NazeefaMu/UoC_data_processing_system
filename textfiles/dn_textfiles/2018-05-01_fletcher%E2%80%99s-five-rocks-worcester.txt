Fletcher’s five-for rocks Worcester

LONDON, Sunday : Stuart Broad was upstaged by Luke Fletcher as Nottinghamshire exposed Worcestershire's batting problems after a belated start at New Road in the English County Championships.
After losing the first two days to bad weather, the home side were bowled out for just 110 in 26.3 overs.
Broad warmed up for England's Test series against Pakistan with 3-28, but Fletcher claimed a career-best 5-27.
Notts also found batting tough despite Ross Taylor's 50 and they were 204-6 when bad light ended play, 94 ahead.
Somerset captain Tom Abell struck 82 to ensure his side enter the final day against Yorkshire as favourites.
Having resumed on 6-0, Ben Coad (4-61) and Jack Brooks (3-44) reduced the hosts to 24-4, as they appeared to be squandering the 120-run lead they had built up from the first innings.
But Abell's 137-ball knock guided Somerset to 200 all out, setting Yorkshire a victory target of 321.
Yorkshire reached 49-1 before bad light struck, still trailing by 272 runs.
Tom Bailey led Lancashire with the bat and ball as the hosts maintained their hopes of beating Surrey.
After resuming on 352-8, Lancashire declared on 439-9 when Bailey was caught for a career-best 66 off the bowling of Amar Singh Virdi (4-80).
England opener Mark Stoneman (0) was bowled by Graham Onions, before Scott Borthwick (79) helped Surrey recover.
But Bailey struck four times as the visitors closed on 231-9, still needing 59 runs to avoid the follow-on.
A draw would be almost inevitable should Surrey somehow be able to stave off being forced to bat again, but with last man Virdi having a top score of just eight in first-class cricket, their chances are slim.
Hampshire and Essex were frustrated by the weather once again, with only 28 overs possible on day three of their County Championship game.
The hosts are yet to complete their first innings, reaching 241-4 at the Ageas Bowl before bad light ended play.
Jimmy Adams (87) and South Africa's Hashim Amla (52) took Hampshire from their overnight 154-2 to 227-2.
But both fell after an initial two-hour delay for bad light, before it closed in once again.
Only 88 overs have been bowled in the match so far after long delays for rain and poor light during all three days.
With heavy rain forecast in Southampton on Monday, England and Essex opener Alastair Cook is unlikely to get a bat in his first domestic match of the season. – AFP
