‘Maybe England lacked respect’, says Croatia coach

MOSCOW, Thursday: Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic admits his team were spurred on by what they saw as a lack of respect towards them in the English media as they won 2-1 in Wednesday’s World Cup semi-final.
“We always respect our opponents and expect them to respect us back,” Dalic told reporters in Moscow on Thursday. “Maybe England or the English media did not show enough respect to the Croatian national team, which we deserved, especially when you look at the clubs our players play for.
“This may have given us extra motivation, but this is football, you have to be dignified in victory and in defeat.” Croatia came from behind to win the game at the Luzhniki Stadium with Ivan Perisic equalising in the second half before Mario Mandzukic scored the decisive goal in extra time. Elements of the English media had talked up how tired Croatia might be coming into the game after being taken to extra time and penalties in each of the previous two rounds. Captain Luka Modric made comments similar to those of his coach following Wednesday’s game, after a match which saw the dreams of English fans doused. – AFP
