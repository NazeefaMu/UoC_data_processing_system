The long hard road to Victory....

In those immortal words not as frequently used these days...the time has come to separate boys from men ...and the writing is definitely on the wall. Much will be written and plenty will step up to be seen and heard when the champions elated captain steps up on the official podium to accept the Dialog league trophy …it will certainly be a fair reward for months of sheer hard graft and defiant toil past odds obstacles, injuries and pain …but the bitter sweet taste of the win soaked in combination of blood sweat, anticipation and adrenaline ...will speak incoherently as the team claims their prize,.... wildly cheering with all their lungs ...history is writ as the worthy claim their spoils…as did gladiators in classical times, to win their freedom and escape a life sentence.
There will be a glow in Colombo that evening ...especially around Fife Road, Park Road, bordering Dickman’s Road and Isipatana Mawatha ...parking will be impossible too. All roads from London, NY, HK and Paris will lead to Havelock Park for the floodlit final 6.30pm kick-off - my mind races back to thousands of die-hard fans converging on the old Havies premises for what was then a Clifford Cup final ...the ground was chock-a-block and we had to climb a tree to watch CR play a star studded Havelocks…it was a brutal final and pure sweat, skill, hardwork and guts on the line.
My voice was gone before half time screaming my proverbial off for JDJ, the impossible Jeff de Jong, Jeffa Yu, Frankie Hubert, Mickey Jayasekera and the hitman Angelo Wickramaratne ...what skills, what reputation, what fans, what a roar to greet their warm-up ....there was a hush for the interested designer crowd… as they stretched and flexed …it was poetry in motion and mesmerizing for the kids present ...seeking the quickest way to intense practice ...and sharper reactions from their real life heroes - household names and reputations to match the blushes all over!
Rugby union needs serious players and skills, to carry their flag and respect the code. If this happens ...all else will run smoothly.... if we are unable to do so, the magic doesn’t stand up on that day …and the full house bitterly disappointed ,... wonderful trailers…can’t hide the ...darkness and lack of form, plus two more experts?
The script for this final is a real blockbuster ...hope the management and backroom staff, live up to expectations as well.....we have two weekends to breathe and shuttle past. I hope they talk with the national channel and schedule a multi camera production for the rumble in the city by the sea - thus allowing kids, whole villages and homes throughout the island to absorb and enjoy the upcountry- low country skill and pressure final for the rugby league title 2017.
Our experts will be buzzing as per their predictions and speculations ...pulse rates and muscle twitch at its compulsive best ...Kandy the defending champions or Havelocks for the cup? Your decision a lot better than mine, so let them grab the 50-50 odds and provoke max thought and cup pondering!
Let’s not harp too much on form and efficiency in the middle this week ...as injuries on both sides don’t make comfortable reading ...if we discuss the list and names this edition ...it will only add to the heartburn and much anxiousness - lets tantalize with those morsels and facts next Thursday!
Reality is much stranger than fiction …and I am convinced that it bites a lot harder and deeper......let me try to qualify that island brashness with some calming inclinations ...and facts - injuries on both sides are quite a chunk of the experience with both squads ...wonderful matchup to see a Fazil vs the inform Dulaj (133 points) in the form of his life. Can Fazil who is 3 games shy of match fitness, push past his recovery and use his immense experience to outwit and outclass the Dulaj factor?
Havelocks function and play intense rugby with him and the likes of Niroshan, Kutty Dixon, Dabare, Hirantha, Rahul de Silva at the base needs max clean ball to put pressure and turn Kandy round. The forward power will be with Muthuthanthri and his superior level of petrol and fitness, both in the sets and lethal in the loose.
Will coach Ronnie Ibrahim trust his forward 8 ...or will he look to his back line to step it up? There are bound to be a few experts at Havies who know the form and would jump at the chance of sharing their platinum insight? Ronny might let diplomacy prevail, and his senior players dictate the path they intend to focus on Kandy’s weak areas to outplay them.
Kandy will be hoping for maximum from the vast list of Sri rep players …they certainly have experience, fitness and skill on their side...but it’s how well the mind and belief on the day...and to do all that ...they still need both Weeraratnes to be at their aggressive best, with Ratwatte, Ritchie Dharmapala and the almost untouchable finisher Danushka Ranjan (13 tries) to create opportunities from scraps and any good ball that comes their way. Coach Sean Wijeysinghe will expect his class outfit to turn on the charm, given the occasion and familiar pressure terrain of another cup final.
I am a firm believer in trusting your instincts, in relying on what has been successful under pressure and the players in my team who I trust to do their job even with injured bits taped together. I want to know that we are ready for another match and will be max oxygen on the breathing in readiness to give 180% come the time, come the kick off and 80minutes from there ...everything else is after that and as the adrenaline starts to bubble ...its sheer joy and the immense pleasure of running out for a Cup final that peppers the blood and makes the heart beat loudest ...we live in great anticipation, blessings islanders ...the wait is delicious and delightful.
Bula Bula all those rugby hearts in Kandy and all over the island ...it’s our time to cheer.
