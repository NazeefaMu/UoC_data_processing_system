Batch of 1,306 Sri Lankans granted dual citizenship

People enjoying dual citizenship have gained an opportunity to maintain private assets within this country with the advent of the present government, said Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Culture Minister S.B. Navinna.
Minister Navinna was addressing a meeting held at the ministry auditorium at Isurupaya, Battaramulla to mark the handing over of duel citizenship certificates to a batch of 1,306 Sri Lankans recently.
He said a large number of Sri Lankans abroad could not return to their mother country during the past regime due to various problems and obstructions, but once the Yaha Palanaya government assumed office President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe took steps to expedite the granting of dual citizenship rights.
Accordingly, 25,405 dual citizenship certificates have been awarded so far. This was because there was unlimited freedom and liberty in the country today.
People who gain dual citizenship now have the opportunity to come back to their motherland and open new ventures and investments and contribute towards the national development effort.
Ministry Secretary D. Swarnapala, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration M. N. Ranasinghe were also present.
