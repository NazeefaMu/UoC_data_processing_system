a growing family of doctors

For over 40 years, the St. George’s University family of doctors has been growing and spreading its wings, firmly establishing the Caribbean based institution as one of the top medical schools around the world.
The University programs are accredited and approved by many governing authorities and SGU is affiliated with educational institutions worldwide, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Ireland, while SGU graduates have gained registration with medical licensing authorities in over 50 countries around the world. St. George’s University has grown to become the fourth largest source of doctors for the entire US workforce, and is the number one provider of new primary care doctors into the US each year. With an extensive network of graduates, a strong and expanding clinical program, award-winning student support services, and a consistent record of residency placement over the last four years, their current and future family of students are in a great position for success. St. George’s University regards each of its graduates as part of an ever-expanding family, helping to spread a message of teaching excellence and first-class support to a widening truly international student body. Students from Asia typically enter St. George’s University on a 5-Year MD Program, which is designed for students with Advanced Level or International Baccalaureate equivalent (India – 10+2: minimum 80%) credentials.
Students enrolled in the medical education program spend two years studying the basic sciences followed by access to clinical training opportunities at over 70 affiliated hospitals and clinical centres in the United States, Canada, Grenada, and United Kingdom.
