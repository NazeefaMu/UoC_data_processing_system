PickMe drivers rewarded with Lakshapathi Waram

PickMe, the homegrown startup with the leading tech-based taxi-hailing app in Sri Lanka, continues its efforts to uplift the spirit of their drivers with the launch of ‘Lakshapathi Waram’, a unique initiative to honour the values of their driver partners.
The driver-rewarding scheme recently chose eight drivers and presented each of them with Rs. 100,000.
Every week, ‘Lakshapathi Waram’ picks one outstanding performer from a raffle draw and rewards them with a cash prize of Rs. 100,000.
To be eligible for the draw, a driver has to achieve a specific target set by PickeMe and maintain a ranking of 4.5 stars or above. The rewarding scheme was launched simultaneously with ‘PickMe Waasi’, a three-month loyalty programme for their patrons.
