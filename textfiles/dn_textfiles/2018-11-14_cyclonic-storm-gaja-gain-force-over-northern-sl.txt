The Meteorology Department issued a special advisory for strong wind and heavy rain in the Northern part of the country today and tomorrow.
The Department said high winds of 80 - 90kmph gusting up to 100kmph can be expected over the Jaffna peninsula due to cyclonic storm Gaja which was strengthening over the Bay of Bengal.
Gaja is expected to make the landfall on Thursday in Tamil Nadu. Very strong winds of 60-70kmph, gusting up to 80kmph can be expected over Mannar, Puttalam, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Killinochchi, Mullaitiv and Vauniya districts.
Showers and thundershowers at times with fairly heavy rainfall of about 100 mm can be expected at some places in the Northern Province today (14) and tomorrow (15), the Special Advisory said.
The sea areas to the North and East of the island will be very rough or high at times as the wind speed can increase up to 70-80kmph at times.
Sea areas off the southern coast can be rough at times as the wind speed can increase up to 50-60kmph.
Fishermen are advised not to venture into sea areas off the coast extending from Potuvil to Mannar via Trincomalee and Kankasanturai from today, the Department advised.
