Sumanthiran calls on the government to keep its initial pledge to the people

 
Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MP M.A Sumanthiran today called on the Government to keep its initial pledge to the people and complete the task of Constitutional reforms circumventing the snags it has come across.
Speaking at the debate in Parliament, the MP urged the Government to put the draft Bill on Constitution before people and seek their opinion at a referendum.
“I am confident, the majority of people, if they are well informed and advised, will endorse the legislation. The Government has to have the courage to do the right thing,” the MP stressed.
“If the religious leaders are deciding the laws of the country, why do we sit in this Parliament in the first place?” he questioned.
Sumanthiran, insisting that the country needs a new Constitution, cautioned the Government not to lose the golden opportunity before the country to bring in meaningful Constitutional reforms acceptable to all communities.
“The sub-committees sat for many months and completed their reports and the Steering Committee has already conducted over 60 meetings. We should not concede defeat at this level. People gave their mandate to this Government to bring in a new Constitution and this mandate must be respected. The very purpose of forming a ‘Unity Government’ was to bring in a new Constitution. Both the JVP and TNA, though in the Opposition, support the Government in this endeavor,” said Sumanthiran.
