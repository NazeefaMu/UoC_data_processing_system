GMOA calls off strike scheduled for October 6

 
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) called off the strike which was scheduled to be held this Friday, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He cited that the Health Ministry met its demand and cancelled the post intern appointment list which was not approved by the Transfer <U+200B>Board.
He said this while addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo, today.
<U+200B> GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that at the moment the Health Ministry is in the process of re-making the list with the approval of the Transfer board and therefore the need for a strike may not arise on Friday.  <U+200B>
Earlier the GMOA warned to launch a countrywide persisting strike on next Friday (6th) if the Health Ministry failed to rectify the inaccurate post intern appointment list which was made without the Transfer Board approval<U+200B>, Dr. Aluthge said.
He said that the GMOA requested<U+200B> the Health Ministry Secretary to withdraw the existing list and to make a proper list after calling an immediate meeting of the Transfer Board.
The Secretary responded positively for the request, he said.
Meanwhile Health Ministry Secretary issued a statement stating that he had given two days for the GMOA to present written proposals.
