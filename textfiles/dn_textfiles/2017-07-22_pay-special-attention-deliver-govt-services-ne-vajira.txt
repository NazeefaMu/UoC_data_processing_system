Pay special attention to deliver govt. services to NE: Vajira

Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said the officials should pay special attention to deliver government services to the North and East.
“If we are to rehabilitate the people in the North and East, we must guide and support them, Minister Abeywardena said.
He was addressing government officials at Temple Trees recently.
“We must remember that earlier they had a system. When they finished their O/Ls and before they go for their A/Ls, they had to undergo three-month military training. Thereafter, they became fighters and when they died, they were buried with great honour and memorials were built in their names and their families looked after,” the minister said.
“Today they have no system. If we don’t change this situation, we automatically become a government that is shown to be lax in the peoples’ welfare. To prevent this, the President and the Prime Minister has asked that we pay extra attention to them,” the Minister said.
The Ministry has launched the third phase of the ‘Nila Mehewara’ - President’s Peoples Service - National Programme in Kurunegala, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Vavuniya and Mannar.
It will take all government services to every divisional secretariat and Grama Niladhari division in the districts for a day to help the people in the area have access to the state services.
The mobile government service deals with issues of birth certificates, NICs, pension, driver’s licenses, granting of spectacles, health services, advisory services, land problems, and IDs for the elderly among others. It will provide beauty courses, loan services, employment opportunities, disaster management services, clinics, self-employment opportunities and all other government services.
The first and second phases of the programme were held in Polonnaruwa and Galle.
Reports sent to the President from the District Secretariats of Vavuniya and Kilinochchi had worried the President and he had asked all his Cabinet ministers to pay special attention to develop North and East, the Minister said.
The 30-year-long war had resulted in many people not being used to government services in a long time,
“In Kilinochchi, a 60-year-old man applied for a driver’s licence for the first time. In the Manthai Divisional Secretariat, around 80km from Mullaitivu, a family received the deed to their land after 70 years. Manthai had not had a visit from a single government agency after 2009, we took 38 agencies that day,” the Minister said.
“The Oddusudan Divisional Secretariat has 27 grama niladhari divisions, but only 12 have grama niladharis, the rest had retired. New people should be hired immediately, the Minister said.
“In the Galle district, 16,205 people were given their NICs during the programme. Around 18,282 people were finally given copies of their marriage, birth or death certificates. In Polonnaruwa, 3,005 people were granted permits or deed to their lands.
“Some may think that all these complaints would put the government servants in these areas in trouble, but that is not the case. We must understand the problem. On average it costs a person at least Rs 3,000 to get his NIC done as he goes from one place to another to get it done,” the Minister said.
In Kurunegala alone, the District Secretariat had 80,000 applications pending for NICs.
“These issues mean that many do not get to vote,” Abeywardena said.
“The Nila Mehewera thus far has received over a million complaints from people in five districts,” the Minister said.
The minister asked the relevant ministries to encourage and praise the officials who render their service to the programme. Thee mobile services are to be rolled out other districts soon.
