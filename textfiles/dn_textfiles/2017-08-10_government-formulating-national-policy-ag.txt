Government. formulating national policy: AG

Garbage disposal:
The government is in the process of formulating a national policy regarding the disposal of garbage in the country, the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court yesterday.
Additional Solicitor General Indika Dewmuni de Silva appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, made these remarks pursuant to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by an Environmental activist and an Environmental Organization, challenging the Gazette Notification issued by President Maithripala Sirisena in the capacity of Minister of Environment over garbage issues in the country.
When the petition came up before a Supreme Court three-Judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, Justice Anil Goonaratne and Justice Vijith Malalgoda, the respondents were directed to inform Court the progress of formulating a national policy on November 16.
The Minister of Environment had issued a Gazette Notification bearing No.2015/53 dated April 20, under the Public Security Ordinance declaring that “all services, work or labour or any description whatsoever necessary or required to be done in connection with any undertaking performed or maintained by any local authority or for and on behalf of any such Local Authority for the clearance, collection, transportation, temporary storage, processing, separation, treatment, disposal and sale of street refuse, house refuse or other similar matter.”
Ranjith Sisira Kumara, an environmental activist and Centre for Environmental Justice filed this petition through Counsel Ravindranath Dabare and Nilmal Wickremasinghe and Prabhani Samaraweera, naming the Central Environmental Authority, the Attorney General and several others as respondents. The petitioners sought an order declaring that the Gazette Notification bearing No.2015/53 is null and void and of no force availing in law.
They further sought an order directing the respondents to formulate a proper procedure of management of waste and to formulate a proper regulation and mechanism of monitoring such activities.
