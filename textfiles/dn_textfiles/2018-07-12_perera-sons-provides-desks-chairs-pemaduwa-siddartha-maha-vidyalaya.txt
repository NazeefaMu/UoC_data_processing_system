Perera & Sons provides desks, chairs to Pemaduwa Siddartha Maha Vidyalaya

Perera & Sons (P&S), from its beginnings have come a long way in becoming one of Sri Lanka’s most widespread F&B business chain.
P&S has generously contributed towards many CSR activities in various forms throughout the years.
In March, 2018, P&S together with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Anuradhapura District Chamber of Commerce and the Divisional Education Director, Villachchiya, planned to implement a CSR initiative fulfilling an urgent need of desks and chairs to Grade 6 students of Siddartha Maha Vidyalaya of Pemaduwa in Anuradhapura District.
Pemaduwa Siddaratha Maha Vidyalaya currently has 650 students. Majority of these students come from farming families, who have been affected due to the severe drought in the area for three consecutive seasons. One hundred desks and chairs were handed over to the school by P&S at the beginning of the second term at a small ceremony with the participation of The Anuradhapura District Chamber of Commerce, The Divisional Education Director, Villachchiya, the Principal, teachers, invitees, and the students of the schools.
