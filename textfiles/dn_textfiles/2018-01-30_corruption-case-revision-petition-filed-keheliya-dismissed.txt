Corruption case: Revision petition filed by Keheliya dismissed

A revision petition filed by former Media Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others challenging Magistrate’s Court decision to proceed with a corruption case was yesterday dismissed by the Colombo High Court.
Former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two others are accused of causing an unlawful loss to the government after purchasing 600 of GI pipes using Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation’s (SLRC) funds during the previous Presidential Election.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga dismissed the petition citing there is no legal basis to proceed with the application. On a previous occasion, the Magistrate's court decided to turn down the preliminary objections raised by the accused challenging the maintainability of the charge sheets. The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed charges against former Minister Rambukwella, former SLRC Director General Chandrapala Liyanage and former SLRC Chairman Wimal Rubasinghe under section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that three accused in the case had incurred a Rs.990,000 loss to the SLRC by unnecessarily purchasing 600 of GI pipes on or around December 2, 2014.
Senior State Counsel Asad Navavi appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the former Minister.
