Transfers in the offing for 60,000 police officers

The Police Commission has now paid attention towards granting transfers to nearly 60,000 lower rung police officers ranging from Constables to Sub Inspectors by appointing an official team to study the subject.
It had been long overdue, Police Commission Chairman P. H. Manatunge said.
Already, transfers have been granted to nearly 4,500 policemen and another batch of nearly 4,500 would be given transfers in due course, he added.
Manatunge said steps have also been taken to upgrade and systematise police welfare activities, including the rehabilitation of derelict police barracks.
The Commission received the unstinted support of IGP Pujith Jayasundera in these activities, he said.
