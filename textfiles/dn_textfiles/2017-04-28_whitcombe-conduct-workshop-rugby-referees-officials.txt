Whitcombe to conduct workshop for rugby referees, officials

One of the best rugby referees Alan Whitcombe has very kindly made time to come to Sri Lanka on an invitation from the Sri Lanka Society of Rugby Referees to address the Sri Lanka officials and referees.
Whitcombe, the Asia rugby-football referees manager arrived in Sri Lanka on Thursday and will conduct a workshop for Referees Society officials at the Mercantile Cricket Association Auditorium today from 8.30 am to 6.00 pm.
Thereafter he will conduct a two-day workshop on Saturday April 29 and on Sunday 30 for men and women referees at the National Institute for Sports Science. All referees attached to the society are expected to attend this workshop.
Sri Lanka is fortunate to have this Asian rugby referee manager for this workshop which would be of great value towards the future of the referees’ society.
As a matter of fact the referees, who have been at the receiving end in the recent past, need workshops of this caliber.
