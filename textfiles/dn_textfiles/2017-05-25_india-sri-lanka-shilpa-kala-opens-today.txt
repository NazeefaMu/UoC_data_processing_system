Yeola said they expect that Sri Lankan handicraft artisans will have a wider audience in India.
Jaity said that she is not a stranger to Sri Lanka or its handicraft culture.
“What bring us together is our shared culture,” she said,” I am so happy that the High Commission of India is hosting Shilpa Kala exhibition because usually it is the Ministry of Indian Textiles which looks after handicrafts and handlooms in India, which looks after such things.
She said that promotion of handicrafts through exhibitions such as Shilpa Kala provides an excellent platform for diplomacy at people- to- people level.She said the people in Sri Lanka who do grass- mat weaving can sit with those grass-mat weaving people in India.
“There is a language they are speaking without knowing the language of each other. There is the technique they understand each other. There are new things they can teach each other,” she said.
“In the field of handicrafts we have often found crafts people willing to share their knowledge among each other.”
“In the competitive corporate world it is not so. You do not want the others to know your design or prototype. You have your own brand,” she pointed out, “But in our field of handicrafts, Sri Lankan handicrafts are Sri Lankan brand and it is the cultural identity of Sri Lanka. The same way we feel for India.”
“Average village craftsman may not be highly educated. He may not know how to reach out.I have brought an exquisite Kashmir embroidery craftsman. The sad thing is he does not know how to read and write. Others have travelled different parts of the world. We like to give them this kid of opportunityso that they have a chance to see how other countries are.”
“This is a very good platform to develop friendship,” she added.
Buddhi Keerthisena said following the success of their first Shilpa Kala last year, the High Commission of India had decided to hold the exhibition this year.
“They are funding the projects entirely, I am thankful to them. India is supporting us in a big way to promote our handicraft industry. India has a lot of handicraft programs. We have to take them to strengthen our handicraft industry,” he said.
“The sharing of arts and handicrafts between Sri Lanka and India dates back to era of King Ashoka of India and King Devanampiyatissa of Sri Lanka,” he reflected.
“Our relations in the field of art and handicrafts have stood the test of time,” he said and added,” It continues to enhance the strong bond between our two countries,” he pointed out.
