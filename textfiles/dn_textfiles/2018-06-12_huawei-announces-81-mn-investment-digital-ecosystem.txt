Huawei announces $81 mn investment in digital ecosystem

With a view to building a digital ecosystem in the Southeast Asia region, Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has declared an $81 million investment at its fourth annual Asia-Pacific Innovation Day program.  
The announcement came at a two-day event that kicked off at Hotel Siam Kempinski in Bangkok, Thailand on Wednesday with the theme “Innovate for a Digital Asia-Pacific.” 
Over the next three years, the telecom giant will invest money in setting up open labs, enabling cloud developers, and cultivating ICT talent in the Southeast Asian countries.
Huawei’s Southeast Asia Region President James Wu unveiled its “developer enablement plan” for the region, saying that it was aimed at supporting digital economy growth and cultivating an ecosystem in the region. 
“Huawei aims to empower developers and promote young talent in Southeast Asia. We have over 30 years of experience and capabilities in the ICT sector. Through APIs and development platforms, we will open up our capabilities to our partners in the region,” Wu told the program.
“This is a huge opportunity for developers to create targeted solutions to the digitalization of industries and grow their own business. By working together, we can dream bigger and fly higher.”
Among others, Dr Suvit Maesincee, the Thai minister for science and technology; Mustafa Jabbar, the minister of posts, telecommunications and information technology of Bangladesh; Bounsaleumsay Khennavong, vice-minister of posts and telecommunications of Laos, and Dr Kan Channmeta, secretary of state at the ministry of posts and telecommunication of Cambodia, joined the event. 
Addressing the program, Mustafa said the Bangladesh government has its own plan to develop the country’s ICT sector and is now considering introducing the 5G internet network service by 2021.  “We are living in an era of information technology, and there is no option for Bangladesh to be left behind in the race. We have our plan to introduce the 5G internet service across the country in 2021, when Bangladesh will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its independence,” he said.
