The home for the disabled at Pallikkudawa in Tangalle known as Navajeewana held its 30th anniversary recently with the participation of one thousand five hundred disabled children from Matara and Hambantota districts.
The founder of the institution is Kumarini Wickramasoriya.
In her absence due to being hospitalised for a surgery, her son who is residing in America Arun Wickramasooriya and her daughter-in-law, MPs Namal Rajapaksa and D. V. Chanaka, parents of the disabled children and well wishers were present for the occasion.
A dance and a musical fiesta with the participation of the disabled children were held during the anniversary celebrations that made the event extremely colourful.
