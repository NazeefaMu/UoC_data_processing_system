Coal, not ADB’s preferred option

Senior Energy Specialists of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday underlined that coal is not the ADB’s preferred option for future energy requirements.
ADB Regional Sustainable Development Department Technical Advisor (Energy) Dr. Yongping Zhai, responding to a question on a suitable energy mix for Sri Lanka, said the ADB encourages renewable energy, potential import of LNG and regional cooperation with India to meet the energy requirements of the country.
Zhai was speaking at a press briefing at the 51st ADB Board of Governors’ Annual Meeting in Manila yesterday along with Senior Energy Specialist David Elzinga.
He said ADB is financing a wind farm and the hydro power plant in Sri Lanka to support renewable energy.
He however stressed any solution to the controversy on energy mix should come from within the country.
Zhai pointed out that debate on coal to meet future energy requirements is not only limited to Sri Lanka, but common to Asia and the rest of the world. He brought out a few points that Sri Lanka may consider when deciding whether it opts for more coal power plants.
“Sri Lanka may have to ponder whether the any additional coal would derail Sri Lanka’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. It has to take into account whether the coal would affect the air quality as many countries with coal power have polluted air. See whether people are ready to risk that kind of living condition” he said.
“At the same time, optimal operational performance matter for Sri Lanka to supply power round the clock. It needs to have some stable base load power. Depending on these, coal may be an option but we in ADB believe renewable energy should be considered first and also potential import of gas may be another option. ADB should work together with the Government authorities and CEB and see how best we can meet this requirement. All options should be open. The country has to come with a forward looking energy mix,” Zhai added.
Zhai He commended Sri Lanka’s achievements in the energy sector pointing out that it is a lot and ahead of many of its neighbouring countries in terms of access to electricity.
He also emphasised the need for a pricing system in Sri Lanka if these different types of energy to work. “For example an investor willing to put up a wind farm must get an adequate tariff to ensure that investment is profitable. Regulatory framework is also important,” he added.
He also said the ADB is willing to support Waste to Energy projects in the region, adding that the upcoming Clean Energy Forum in Manila will a good opportunity for Sri Lanka in this regard.
