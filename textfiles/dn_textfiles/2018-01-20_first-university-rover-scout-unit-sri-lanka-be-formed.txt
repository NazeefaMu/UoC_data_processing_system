First University Rover Scout Unit of Sri Lanka to be formed

While the World Rover Scouting celebrates the centenary this year, the Sri Lanka Scout Association (SLSA) together with the Student Counseling Office of the University of Colombo is promoting Rover Scouting among the undergraduates in the University of Colombo.
The SLSA announced that both parties will launch the first-ever University Rover Unit of Sri Lanka jointly at the University of Colombo Arts Faculty premises on January 24 at 12 noon.
In mid-2017, with the inception of the idea of popularizing Rover Scouting among the students of the University of Colombo, the then Chief Commissioner Prof. Nimal de Silva, the present Chief Commissioner for Rover Scouts Merrill Goonetillake, Assistant Chief Commissioner for Rover Scouts Srilath de Silva among others launched a programme for them.
Scouting is an educational and personality development, service and activity based programme engaging young people from all over the world. World Scouting today, is a confederation of 162 countries where their National Scout Organizations have over 42 million members in more than 1 million Scout and Rover Units. The Colombo Campus Rover Crew will add another unit to this movement.
Rover Scouting or Rovering is for young people, male and female, in the age group of 18 to 24. A group of Rovers is called a ‘Rover Crew’. Rovering provides support in facing future challenges and enhances leadership qualities. The youths can fulfill their future aspirations through scouting.
A Rover Crew governs itself but has a warranted leader as Rover Scout Master to guide them in their activities. A capable person of over 25 years of age could become RSM warranted by the National Scout Headquarters.
The Rover programme originated in the United Kingdom in 1918 to provide a programme for young people. It was quickly adopted by many other national scout organizations. The Founder Father of World Scouting Lord Baden Powell called a Rovering a ‘brotherhood of open air and service’ and said ‘Rover Scouting is a preparation for life and also a pursuit for life’.
Scouting for youth has been promoted by the World Organization of Scout Movement to create a platform for the young scouts to get together and meet new friends, share experiences and views on scouting and contribute new ideas to the movement on how to enrich educational programmes for youths.
The Sri Lanka Scout Association became one of the first member countries of the World Organisation of Scout Movement in 1912. In 1957, the Sri Lanka Scout Association was incorporated as a National Voluntary Organization by a Parliamentary Act. The Scout Movement was restructured recently to produce innovative youth for the 21st century.
The programme for the official formation of the University of Colombo Rover Unit will include an introduction to Rover Scouting, youth programme and a brief presentation of projects carried out by Rovers in the country.
All students of the University of Colombo are invited.
