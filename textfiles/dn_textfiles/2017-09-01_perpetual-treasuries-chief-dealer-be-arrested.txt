Perpetual Treasuries Chief Dealer to be arrested

AG's Dept informs Presidential Commission:
The Attorney General’s Department yesterday informed the Presidential Commission on Central Bank Bond Issue that chief dealer of Perpetual Treasuries Limited Nuwan Salgado would be arrested.
Senior Solicitor General Dappula De Livera told the Commission that Salgadu has committed an offence by fabricating and destroying evidence. IT officer of the company Sachitra Devathanthri giving evidence before the Commission yesterday said Salgado ordered him to delete 15 voice recordings of the telephone network.
He said he received a notice from Salgado to delete 15 voice recordings.
Devathanthri informed the Commission that he gave Salgado the copies of the recordings that were deleted from the system. Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda requested the Commission to issue an order to hand over the unaltered voice recordings to the Commission by yesterday evening. The Commission accepted the request.
