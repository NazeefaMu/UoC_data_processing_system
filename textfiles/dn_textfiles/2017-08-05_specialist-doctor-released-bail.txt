Specialist doctor released on bail

A specialist doctor attached to the Kuliyapitiya Base Hospital arrested and remanded for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs.75,000 at the hospital premises was yesterday ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo Chief Magistrate.
Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara ordered the suspect to be released on a cash bail of Rs.10,000 with a Rs.500,000 surety bail.
The Bribery Commission informed court that it has concluded investigations against the specialist doctor.
The second suspect, a private lab employee arrested in connection with incident had been ordered to be released on bail at a previous occasion.
The officials of the Bribery Commission had arrested two suspects while they allegedly were accepting a Rs.75,000 bribe on July 3 at the hospital following a complaint lodged by the owner of private laboratory in the area. The Bribery Commission alleged that the medical specialist informed the laboratory owner that he would reject the medical reports issued by the laboratory if the owner refused to make the monthly payment of Rs.25,000.
Further magisterial inquiry was fixed for November 17.
