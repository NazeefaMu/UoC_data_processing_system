Titan Edge  Date series Launched

Titan, one of the world’s leading watch brands, recently unveiled its latest time piece collection the Titan Edge Date.
Launched to immense critical acclaim, Titan Edge Date Series reflects a confluence of classic elegance and contemporary trends whilst exhibiting the highest technical mastery.
The Titan Edge Date range underscores the twin motifs of sophisticated minimalism and post-modern aesthetics by incorporating stylish steel and croco-leather straps as well as a wafer-thin dial encased in exquisite sapphire crystal glass. Each watch also features the revolutionary Titan Edge movement, which provides the slimmest quartz movement in the world and allows for exceptionally sharp time accuracy.
The lineup comprises of two subsets of watches, namely, round and square timepieces. The round watches, in particular, showcase the predominant theme of genuine croco patterned leather with Nubuck lining.
All watches featured in the Titan Edge Date collection illustrate a stunning interplay between everyday functionality and opulent refinement, while placing a pronounced emphasis on the exceptional craftsmanship and impeccable finishes that Titan has always been renowned for.
You can preview the Edge Date lineup at the Titan Flagship Store at Arcade Independence Square, the Titan Showroom at Crescat Boulevard and selected Abans Elite showrooms.
