Censoring hampers vibrant media culture - Minister Samaraweera

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the government cannot fear free media and added that censoring media with restrictions and circulars hampers fundamental rights of society and violates the basic human rights.
Participating as the chief guest at the Asia Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) annual general conference at the Galle Face Hotel yesterday he said that the traditional and formal media has a greater challenge to provide fruitful, accurate and reliable news faster while preserving media values and ethics.
"With the emergence of social media, a new generation of youth who are also called as millennials, are now very actively participating in shaping our society.They are IT literals and well connected to each other, independent and very powerful communicators. There is a huge increase in information being disseminated through social media", he said.
The Minister said that instead of compromising values for the fear of competition, all must work hard to preserve professionalism and journalism and added that he believes that journalists are duty bound to report news without fabrications despite temptations to compete with those who propagate fake news.
Stating that Sri Lanka enacted the Right to Information Act in 2016 which shows the transparency in the government while ensuring access to information, he said that he was proud to have a vibrant media culture.
Minister further added that the AIBD is mandated to achieve a vibrant and cohesive media environment in the Asia Pacific region thorough policy and resource development in order to create a well informed society while promoting regional cooperation.
