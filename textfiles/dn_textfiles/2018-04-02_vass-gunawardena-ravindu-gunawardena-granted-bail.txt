Vass Gunawardena, Ravindu Gunawardena granted bail

 
Five individuals including former DIG Vass Gunawardena and his son Ravindu Gunawardena who were alleged to have possessed firearms were ordered to be released on bail by the Colombo High Court, today.However, the bail order of this case would not be effective for the five suspects as they are already on death row for committing the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam.
