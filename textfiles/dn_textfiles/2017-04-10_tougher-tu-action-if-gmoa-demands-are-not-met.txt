Tougher TU action if GMOA demands are not met

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has rejected proposals forwarded by the government to resolve the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.According to Dr. Zoysa, the final solution for the SAITM issue should be based on the proposals handed over to the President by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers’ Associations (FMTAs). If not, tougher trade union action will be taken by the GMOA along with the coalition of trade unions, he said.
The proposals are, the Higher Education Minister to inform the Judiciary that the SAITM has not obtained the Compliance Certificate from the SLMC which is compulsory to become a degree awarding institution, stopping recruiting more students to SAITM, stopping the offering of degrees by the SAITM, gazetting the minimum standard for medical education in Sri Lanka, appointing a committee by the President to solve the issue of the SAITM students and the solution be accepted by the SLMC. The set of proposals ensure the standard of medical education and protect patients’ right to life, Dr. Zoysa said.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) sources said the Council has prepared the Minimum Standard for Medical Education of Sri Lanka that includes private medical colleges.
