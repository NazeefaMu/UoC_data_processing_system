KDU crushes RIC at Red Bull Campus Cricket

Kothalawala Defernce University (KDU) got off to a flying start with a commanding 172-run win against Royal Institute of Colombo (RIC), thanks to a thundering 38-ball 91-run knock, including six hits to the rope and seven obave it by their dynamic opener Ravindu Uyanhewa in the Red Bull Campus Cricket T20 series worked off at the Bloomfield grounds yesterday. Batting first KDU posted a mammoth 251/8. Kavindu Ashan also batted well to score a half ton (52 runs) including eight boundaries. R Rathnayake bowled best for RIC capturing 2/45. Chasing a seemingly impossible victory target, RIC were skittled out for 84 runs in 18 overs. Only two RIC batsmen were able to reach double figures. S. De Silva was the main wreacker for winners who captured 3/16. Waruna Deshapriya and Ashen Bandara took 2/9 and 2/6 respectively.
