Fruit plant distribution mooted

A programme to distribute fruit plants for home gardening will be launched to prevent the outflow of Rs 1.5 billion when importing fruits, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He made this observation after participating in a tree planting campaign organised to mark the second year anniversary of President Maithripala Sirisena after assuming office. Ranawaka said by cultivating fruit at home, the people could get fruit free of charge.
"Benefits of such a programme will be earned by the country and the people," he said.
"Although there are a variety of imported fruits in supermarkets, the quality is questionable," Minister Ranawaka said. "It is advisable to cultivate our own fruit in our land."
He said as the Environment Minister from 2007 to 2010, he took measures to distribute fruit saplings among the people.
The minister said around 100 of these people offered him a basket full of fruits when he went for election canvassing.
