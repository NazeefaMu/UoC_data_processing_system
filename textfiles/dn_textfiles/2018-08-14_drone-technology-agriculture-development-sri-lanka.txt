Drone Technology for Agriculture development in Sri Lanka

A special discussion regarding the use of drone technology in agriculture took place recently at the Natural Resources Management Centre at Kandy, under the chairmanship of Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development, and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage. In many developed countries drone technology is extensively used in agriculture and by this means much expenditure is saved. Officers of the Department of Agriculture and the National Science Foundation attended the meeting.
