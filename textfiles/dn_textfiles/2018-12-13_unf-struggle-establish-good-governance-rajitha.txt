UNF struggle to establish good governance - Rajitha

The United National Front (UNF) will initiate a crucial struggle to establish democracy and good governance in the country by December 17, said Parliamentarian Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
“We will bring the people on to the streets demanding the authorities concerned to establish democracy and good governance by adhering to the decisions of the Legislature where the people will surround government offices too,” he said. Speaking at a press conference at Temple Trees yesterday, Dr.Senaratne said that the Police should discharge their duties in accordance with the law of the country and they cannot indulge in illegal activities to pacify politicians with vested interests.
“We have established an Independent Police Commission and Police officers cannot act according to the whims and fancies of politicians,” he said
He asked the Police as to what action is going to be taken against Civil Society activist Saman Ratnapriya, citing that his recent remarks fanned the flames of hatred among the people.
