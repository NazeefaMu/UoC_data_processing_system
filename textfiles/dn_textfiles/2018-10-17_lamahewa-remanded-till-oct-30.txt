Welikada Prison riots case:
Lamahewa remanded till Oct. 30

Former Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa, who was in remand custody over the Welikada Prison riots in 2012, was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till October 30 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Priyantha Liyanage.
Filing a further report, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) informed court that investigations were still in progress.
Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa of the Police Narcotics Bureau, who was charged with the same counts, is out on bail.
On September 25, the Court of Appeal ordered to release the suspect on bail after taking a revision application filed by IP Rangajeewa into consideration.
Inspector Neomal Rangajeewa of the Police Narcotics Bureau and Prisons Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on March 28.
Twenty-seven inmates were killed and over 20 others injured in a shooting during the Welikada Prison riots on November 9, 2012, when prisoners took control of the prison in objection to an unannounced search by the Special Task Force to seize hidden weapons, drugs and mobile phones.
