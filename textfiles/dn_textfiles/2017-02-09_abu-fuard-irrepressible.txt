Abu Fuard, the irrepressible

The story of Abu Fuard is a fascinating one. Not only was he a renowned cricketer and a wonderful all-rounder, what he did behind the scenes to steer the country to Test status remain engraved in the minds of those of us who saw this man in action both on and off the field, in the corridors of power and in cricketing fields in the hinterland of our country.
He schooled at Wesley College from where he graduated and launched his career that took him to stardom. As an off spinner he was a sensation. He had flight, variation and all the tricks of the trade. He was a pioneer in bowling what is now called the ‘doosra’ made famous by Pakistan’s Saqlain Mushtaq.
The ‘doosra’ is a delivery bowled with the off break action, but which pitches and instead of turning in goes towards the slips. As a right hand batsman, he had the knack of fitting into any slot. He was primarily an opening batsman and runs flowed from his bat at school, club and country level, although at national level he did not strike it that rich with the bat. He was brilliant at slip.
He bowled magnificently against Richie Benaud’s Australians in a ‘whistle stop’ game at the Oval bagging five wickets which prompted Benaud to say he would have loved to have Fuard in his team that he was taking to England for the Ashes series.
I can vouch for his brilliance as I had the good fortune of playing with Fuard at the Colts and then later against him when he donned the Colombo Cricket Club colours; and facing his wiles, I went on to score my first Sara Trophy century. Fuard would give his 100 per cent and more on the field and any fielder dropping a catch off his bowling would get a tongue lashing and that lashing would make that fielder a better one.
That was Fuard the cricketer. Now about his Administrative and leadership qualities.
Before Gamini Dissanayake, then President of the Cricket fought the good fight breaching the defence of the lords at Lord’s and bowling them out, the game in Sri Lanka was centred and dominated by the elite schools, particularly Royal and S. Thomas’ the college known as the one by the sea.
History tells us that when Sri Lanka played what some condescendingly called ‘whistle stop’ games against the full member ICC countries such as England, Australia and West Indies, the Sri Lanka team comprised five Royalists and five Thomians and the solitary man who fitted in from another school. Yes, that was the right handed genius with the willow the Great Mahadevan Sathasivam on whom I will dwell on in the columns to follow.
But after the fantastic achievement of Dissanayake for the country, the game broke out "tsunami like” with every known school dotted on the map of Sri Lanka taking to the game with great enthusiasm, delight and joy.
Yet, the man behind the scenes who worked the trenches to make things happen was none other than that former Wesley, Moors, Colts and CCC cricketer, the all round ABU FUARD, the irrepressible. While still active in the game he decided that the best way to influence and bring about changes was to throw in his lot with the administration of the game.
He was a credible "Change Agent" as he was widely respected for his achievements as an excellent off spinner with a mythical 'doosara' action. And that's not all--he was a stylish batsman and a most reliable slip fielder. When Fuard spoke people listened because the records spoke for him and he spoke with all sincerity to bring Sri Lanka cricket to the global scene. He found a welcome place in the administration.
Once in the administration FUARD realized that the bottom line for him was getting Sri Lanka as a full member of the International Council. Fuard's task was to find a dynamic leader who had the prowess of persuasion and the political skill to bring about change.
Fortunately for FUARD living down his lane at Deal Place, Colpetty was a young, energetic and daring Minister in Gamini Dissanayake on whom President J.R. Jayewardene had shouldered the responsibility of delivering on what seemed impossible tasks such as diverting the Mahaweli in Gamini Dissanayake. Why not lure him to the Cricket Board, Abu Fuard mused.
This cannot rest as an idle dream---it had to be spun into reality. When approached, Dissanayake had his reservations as it involved taking on the Lords of Cricket who guarded their wickets jealously in an exclusive club. Dissanayake was conscious as was Fuard that this would end up as a "jihad"! “Sri Lanka in Test Cricket? Where is Sri Lanka? Do they play cricket---a cynic was heard asking over a beer?! So Fuard could not suffer insults nor suffer fools.
He worked tirelessly to convince Dissanayake that this was as important a challenge as any other and one that will put the country on the map of global sports. After many nights of deliberation and strategic thinking Dissanayake took on the challenge. And delivered he did, relying a lot on counselors foremost of whom was Fuard.
On being elevated as a full member of ICC, Dissanayake turned to Fuard and vested in him the challenge to architect the development of the game in all parts of the Island . Fuard broke the stranglehold that the elite schools held in the game by focusing the spotlight on the provincial schools where he knew there were many a gem unseen and uncut.
And today Sri Lankan cricket is dominated by talent from the provincial schools and the hinterland. If one takes a closer look at the game and the outstanding cricketers it has produced, the majority of them come from lesser known schools who before the country became a Test paying nation rarely played any competitive cricket. Fuard did everything possible to open the doors to the rural cricketers.
And yes, today the Sri Lanka team comprises many cricketers from the rural schools who have hugged the headlines here and abroad with their stupendous feats with either the willow or the ball and made the game and country proud. A fair share of that success no doubt should be credited to Fuard.
In addition, Dissanayake foisted the developing of the Trinity College grounds at Asgiriya to international standard to Fuard. Having been closely associated with Fuard I can vouch for the fact that he threw in his lot to see to the realization of the Asgiriya Stadium to international standard. Sadly the Asgriya Stadium is no more in use for Test cricket after the Pallekelle Stadium was built. Fuard travelled up and down to Asgiriya every day, supervising and instructing the engineers and the builders and seeing to its completion in record time.
A little anecdote: Once in a Sara game against Dimbulla at the Colts Ground, Fuard was bowling and I was fielding at deep mid on. Ubhaya de Silva the former Royal stalwart mistimed and hit a ball off Fuard that sailed high.
Watching the flight of the ball coming down my heart was in my mouth. I knew that if I were to drop that catch the choicest words from Fuard awaited me. I cupped my hands together, but the ball popped out. A cold shiver ran through me and I was trembling and shaking and it was that tremble that made me catch the ball again off the rebound. What a sigh of relief I heaved with Fuard staring down on me.
For what Fuard did for the game; for the players , for the administration, and for his efforts to open the doors to outstation cricketers to become national stars, he certainly deserves legendary status. Above all he was man with sincere passion for help elevate Sri Lankan cricket to the global scene.
May the turf lie lightly over him!w
