Admitting SAITM students to KDU
‘Higher Education Ministry’s guidance, a must’

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe stating the importance of implementing the decisions taken during the discussion held with President Maithripla Sirisena, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He was addressing a press conference held yesterday at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo.
The recent Supreme Court judgement stated that the solution(s) for the SAITM issue were in the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (Special Provisions) Act Number 17 of 2018, which was unanimously passed in Parliament, Dr. Aluthge added.
He said the letter highlighted that the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) should seek guidance from the Higher Education Ministry to move forward with the Act. The letter had also stated that the KDU should inform the parents of SAITM students about all future procedures, which should be completed within one month, he said.
The KDU should absorb all qualified SAITM students, including those who had completed their courses/degrees and a newspaper advertisement should be published in connection with the procedure today, Dr. Aluthge said and added that the KDU should not take responsibility for any SAITM student who would fail to be admitted to the KDU on or before the closing date.
