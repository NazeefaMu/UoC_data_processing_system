‘Let’s move forward as one nation’

It is equally important to respect other religions while protecting your own as no religion is developed in isolation, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing the gathering at the 20th commemorative lecture of M. A. Bakeer Markar at Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
The Premier said it was the division among communities that paved way for conflicts.
“We can't let go of divided identities. Irrespective of one's religion, we should move forward as one nation. That would further strengthen our development,” he said.
The commemorative lecture was delivered by former Prime Minister of Turkey Prof Ahmet Davutoglu on ‘Multiculturalism as a basis for peace’.
