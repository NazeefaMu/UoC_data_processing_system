Dialog Rugby League will kick-off tomorrow

The Dialog Rugby League comes alive on 4 November at the CH & FC grounds, as last year’s champs Kandy SC will scrum down with the team from Maitland Crescent, at 4:00 pm to battle it out for supremacy in the 2017/18 season opening game.
Sri Lanka’s top eight clubs will battle it out for a scintillating display of rugby, for the coveted championship title – the Dialog Rugby League ‘A’ Division crown and the following, prestigious Dialog Clifford Cup Knockout tournaments.
The teams that would fight for the Dialog Rugby 2017/18 League would include last year’s League and Clifford Cup champs Kandy SC, CR&FC, CH&FC, Havelock SC (Havies), Police SC, Army SC, Navy SC and Air Force FC.
The 2016/17 season saw Kandy SC put on a powerful performance to edge out a spirited display from Colombo favourites, Havies to retain championship for the 3rd consecutive year.
This is Dialog's sixth year in association with the League and Clifford Cup knockout tournaments which have a passionate following among the young and old in Sri Lanka. During the season selected matches can be watched LIVE on Dialog Now on Dialog Television, on MyTV via Mobile and Live Streaming on www.thepapare.com
