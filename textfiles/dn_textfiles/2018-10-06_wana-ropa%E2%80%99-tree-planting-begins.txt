National Environmental Conference 2018
Wana Ropa’ Tree Planting begins

President Maithripala Sirisena said that he had not taken many high positions entrenched with money and power and selected the Ministry of Environment to ensure the right to life of all creatures, including human beings.
Even though the previous Presidents had taken the Ministry of Finance under their purview as soon as they came to power, he had taken steps to shed excessive powers of the Executive Presidency and devolved them to Parliament, he pointed out.
The President made these remarks addressing the National Environmental Conference held at the Mannar Urban Council Ground, yesterday.
President Sirisena, expressing his views further, said the damage caused to the environment is a threat to survival of human beings, while it is an essential task to protect the environment for the future survival of all creatures.
