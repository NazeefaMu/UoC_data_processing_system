Hardus Viljoen takes 15 wickets in dramatic win at Hove

LONDON, Friday - Hardus Viljoen took 15 wickets in the match as Derbyshire secured a dramatic victory over Sussex at Hove, all-but ending the hosts’ promotion hopes.
He took 8-90 in the second innings as the visitors bowled out Sussex for 344 to win by 45 runs.
Sussex had looked favourites when Luke Wright (80) and Stiaan van Zyl (85) put on a century stand to reach 267-3.
But in the evening session Sussex lost seven wickets, inspired Viljoen dismissing Wright and Van Zyl.
The South African pace bowler was on course to become the first player to take all 10 wickets in an innings in county cricket for 10 years before Harry Podmore took the final two wickets of George Garton and David Wiese.
It is the first time a Derbyshire player has taken 15 wickets in a match since Cliff Gladwin in 1952.
The defeat means Sussex have 161 points, 46 points behind second-placed Nottinghamshire with 48 available, making promotion to Division One highly unlikely.
The win for Derbyshire, their second of the season, sees them climb above Durham into eighth position.
Middlesex bowled out Hampshire for 146 on day four of a draw at Uxbridge - a result which confirmed Warwickshire's relegation from Division One.
Only 59 overs were possible on the first three days at Uxbridge, ruining any chance of a win for either side.
Middlesex posted 204 in their first innings, with Fidel Edwards taking 5-79 for the visitors, who were then dismissed in 36.1 overs. Rain brought an early finish with Middlesex 14-1 in their second innings.
Warwickshire were beaten inside three days by newly-crowned champions Essex and, with Somerset beating Lancashire on Friday, Middlesex's tally of bonus points in their drawn game sent Warwicks down with two matches remaining.
Middlesex, the 2016 champions, have now slipped into the relegation zone after Yorkshire's game at Surrey ended in a draw.
James Franklin's side are level on points with sixth-placed Somerset, who are above them in the table having won one more game this season. Hampshire's eight points have taken them 18 behind second-placed Lancashire.
Yorkshire remain in relegation trouble in Division One despite escaping with a draw against Surrey at The Oval.
Shaun Marsh (125 not out) and Alex Lees (102) both hit centuries as Yorkshire reached 281-2 following on, a lead of 83, when bad light brought stumps. The pair's second-wicket stand of 215 was a county record against Surrey.
Surrey are still not out of trouble themselves - they are just 13 points ahead of Middlesex despite being third in the table.
