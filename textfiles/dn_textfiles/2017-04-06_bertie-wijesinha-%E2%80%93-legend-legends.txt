Bertie Wijesinha – legend of legends

 Bertie Wijesinha is a Legend who is loved, an Icon who is admired and a Hero who inspires. And this May 24, he is 97 years old, 3 years short of the Century that he wanted us to aspire for on the crease. I know because as he was my Coach at school, a journalist as we covered cricket, a super commentator as we tune into our radios, and a classy Gentleman in the true sense of the word.
This package is so rare to find. Bertie is an all rounder. not only in cricket but many other aspects of sports and life.
Above all he is an All-rounder-- a man of many parts. He was a cricketer, athlete, coach, teacher, journalist, commentator and mentor. Those who came under his influence, as I did, must count ourselves fortunate as he added so much value, and set standards, in our lives as sportiness. He sported the blue, black and blue colors of S.Thomas College, on the Mount in 1936 and had his education there till 1939 where in addition to his excellence in books he also shone in cricket and athletics.
It was in cricket that WIJESINHA really blossomed and excelled. He was lucky to come under the tutelage of that former Trinity cricketing great who was the STCML coach at that time who taught the basics to him when he was just 9 years old. It did not take long for John Hallangoda to spot WIJESINHA as a champion in the making and teach him how to play the game according to that treasured adage with a – straight bat- which adage WIJESINHA carried through his 97 years and imbibed this in all who were fortunate to come under his wings including this writer.
Possessed wrists of steel
WIJESINHA was strongly built and possessed wrists of steel. He was a medium pace bowler who had the ability to cut the ball both ways, hard hitting stylish right hand batsman and brilliant fielder in any position. The ‘Battle of the Blues’ the cricketing derby between S.Thomas and Royal College was the yearning of any cricketer in the two schools to play in, celebrated its 138th game a few weeks ago and WIJESINHA who was an outstanding all rounder made his dream debut for STCML playing in four of the Derbys in 1936, ’37, ’38 and ’39.
WIJESINHA immediately served notice of his brilliance when in the first Derby under the captaincy of Donald Fairweather, he came to the rescue of the Thomians with a 136 run stand for the 7th wicket with Norman Siebel when his side was on the ropes at 65 for 6. WIJESINHA made a gallant 57 and Siebel went on to make an unbeaten 137. In the following year he steered his school to victory returning figures of 3 for 33 and 5 for 67 and scoring 55. He captained the Thomian team that won the 1939 match by 5 wickets. He crowned his outstanding school career with an unbeaten double hundred- 235- and also having the distinction of bagging a hat trick against my old school St.Benedict’s College, Kotahena.
After an outstanding school cricket career he joined the Sinhalese Sports Club and gave continuity to his brilliance and saw his extraordinary prowess and stature grow with telling performances for his club which are too numerous to mention and it was not long when national honours came his way. And when it did come it would have been memorable and great joy to him. Some of his team mates at the SSC were F.C.de Saram, Sargo Jayawickrema, D.S. Jayasundera, Mahes Rodrigo, Ben Navaratne, Lucien de Zoysa, C.Ivers Gunesekera and Robert Senanayake.
National debut in 1949
WIJESINHA made his national debut in 1949 against Pakistan at the Oval and facing Fazal and Khan Mohomed he made a plucky 29. Later up against the frightening pace of Prior Jones and John Trim of the Windies he made 22. Although the scores were paltry, yet that he stood up to these four pacemen when other batsmen cringed was what was to be admired. After he called ‘finis’ to his playing career he took to coaching. First was his Alma Mater STC and three cricketers he coached who went places and represented the country were Vernon Prins, known as the Prince of captains when he captained the country, C.T.A. Schafter a medium pace bowler with an action which was poetry in motion and K.M.T. Perera. Incidentally Schafter was my captain at the Tamil Union when I was playing there as a schoolboy.
WIJESINHSA also coached the Ceylon team that took part in the first World Cup.
St. Benedict’s College struck gold when under the Directorship of that keen sports promoter Rev.Bro.Alban and P.Gnanapragasam, Prefect of Games they signed on WIJESINHA to coach its cricketers from 1959. He first coached the team under Lionel Fernando, 1960 under Elmo Rodrigopulle, ’61 under Sanath Jayawardena, ’62 under Ranjit Fernando,’63 under Quintus Perera and it was in 1964 under Sunil Fernando,'65 and '66 Felix Dias. It was under Sunil that the Bens enjoyed their best year emerging inter-school cricket champions and what made all Bens proud was that under WIJESINHA’s coaching that the Kotahena school beat arch rival St. Joseph’s College after 47 years. As a coach he would teach cricketers to adapt to situations.
Some of his products from SBC who made it big playing for the country were Ranjit Fernando who also played in the first World Cup in 1975 in England, Lionel Fernando against West Indies and Cyril Ernest against Colin Cowdrey’s Englishmen. Ernest is a leading Cardiologist in LA and also Ranjan Goonetilleke. Those who played for the Board President’s X1 were Elmo Rodrigopulle, Nihal Zoysa, Sunil Fernando, Joe Saverymuthapulle. Ranjit Fernando has served in the country’s administration in many departments for long and still does for the sake of the game.
Sangakkara his prized pupil
When WIJESINHA coached Trinity the best to emerge was Kumar Sangakkara a wicket keeper batsman who took the cricket world by storm during his reign captaining the country and among the 100s and double hundreds he made, the four centuries he made in the previous World Cup in Australia and New Zealand will not easily be equaled or surpassed. WIJESINHA also showed how to Lord Sid Wettimuny who scored a magnificent 190 at Lord’s.
WIJESINHA married DOROTHY the beautiful daughter of Everad Weerakoon who was popularly called ‘Bobby’ and who excelled as a horse racing commentator in the very early 1950s. A little anecdote. When I was a 10 year old, I used to be glued to Redifusion listening to Weerakoon describing that famous champion horse COTTON HALL ridden by TED FORDYCE who was the champion jockey at that time winning races. My mother noticing this came up and gave me a thundering slap and that ended my interest in horse racing and the Redifusion stayed silent every time or day there was horse racing. Dorothy was secretary to the chairman when I was Sports Desk at the ‘Times of Ceylon.’
WIJESINHA also teamed up with his SSC team mate Lucien de Zoysa and did a grand job as radio commentators describing vividly the happenings out in the middle. WIJESINHA was also Sports Editor of the ‘Ceylon Observer’. He captained a Press X1 that played the State Bank of India during the twilight of his career team led by Ajit Wadekar which team also had players of the caliber of Hanumant Singh who made a debut 100 against England, dashing opener Buddhi Kunderam, Vijaya Mehra, Ramesh Saxena and G. Goswami among others. The game was played at the NCC ground and the visitors made 260 for 4 dec. with Mehra making 39, Kunderam 41, Wadekar 45, Hanumant 62, Saxena 36 and Goswami 29 both unbeaten.
The Press X1 lost their first 3 wickets for no runs, the 4th at 10 and the 5th at 40. Here’s how the ‘Daily Mirror’ described the action in a headline titled ‘Press provides limb-loosener’, its writer said: A master-pupil combination of Bertie Wijesinha 60 (7 fours) and Elmo Rodrigopulle 24 (2 fours) with a stand of 58 for the 6th wicket helped the Press X1 reach a respectable score of 132. Bertie’s innings will long be remembered for the nonchalance in adversity and aggressiveness in the face of defeat.’ Wijesinha is a unique Legend and will leave behind a rich legacy of a sportsman and Gentleman par excellence.
