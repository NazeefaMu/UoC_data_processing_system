Port city construction to recommence, with slight changes to initial agreements

The waiting game is almost over for the Chinese funded Colombo Port City as the new government slowly warms up to the idea. The Chinese government is also confident that that the project has successfully navigated troubled waters.
Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry Counselor and South Asian Division Director Chen Feng speaking to a group of media personnel visiting China said the new government of Sri Lanka has communicated that the port city project would be continued.

"We welcome this decision. After the recent mutual visits by the leaders of the two countries, we felt that the new government has a very keen and positive attitude to China-Sri Lanka cooperation,"he said.
Last week Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while addressing an event held to mark the 30th anniversary of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), spoke of the "unique financial and business district" the Colombo Port City project would create. He expressed keenness for the project to recommence.
The project which begun under the last regime ran into stormy weather as the then opposition and activists questioned its viability and its possible adverse impact. After widespread opposition and pressure from activist groups in the aftermath of Presidential elections on January 8 the project was put on hold until additional assessments were conducted and the approvals given by the previous government were re-evaluated.
The Supplementary Environment Impact Assessment has now been concluded, and the report was submitted to the Coast Conservation and Coastal Resource Management Department. The report is accessible to the public in 11 different government institutions. A final decision on the environment impact will be made by the department after considering public responses.
Referring to the issues the project faced from the beginning of the year Feng said that difficulties were not unique to this project only.
"We saw that there were some difficulties in bilateral projects because of the political changes in Sri Lanka. However, most of these projects have now returned to normalcy," he said.
China's interest on the Colombo port city and Hambantota harbour is no doubt linked to its geo-political strategy in South Asia. Sri Lanka has been a strategic partner of the programme ever since the 'One Belt-One Road' concept was announced by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013.
The 'One Belt-One Road' concept is a twofold strategy that focuses on connectivity and cooperation among countries in Eurasia. It envisages developing a 'Silk Road Economic Belt' connecting cities in Europe and Asia by land and a '21st century Maritime Silk Route' connecting ports via contiguous water bodies.
This will allow China to play a bigger role in international economic affairs and realize its geo-political ambitions.

The Colombo Port city is designed to be built on an artificially created island of about 575 acres (233 hectares) on reclaimed land near to the Colombo port. This 1.4 billion USD project is undertaken by the China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), which is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (CCCC).
The port city, comprising high-rise buildings including hotels, apartment residencies and high-end shopping malls will continue with slight changes to the initial agreements signed by the previous regime in 2014.

China has been a close ally in development initiatives over the past years in Sri Lanka and has been a friend for all seasons. However, when giving the nod to go ahead with the port city, Sri Lanka may have to find its own manoeuvres to balance its relations with India and the US. It is no secret that both these countries have been sceptical over the China funded port city because of its strategic location.
Chen Feng, during his meeting with Sri Lankan media personnel in Beijing, was also cautious to give the impression that the China's growing presence in the region was to accomplish common prosperity.
"We are developing friendly relations with all the neighbouring countries including India. In the recent years China-India relations are developing very fast. China and India now have a better mutual understanding. China's developing relations with Sri Lanka is not to compete with other countries," he said."
"Our only purpose is to improve further bilateral relations. As our President proposed the idea of 'One Belt-One Road', it covers all the neighbouring countries, especially the South and Central Asia. The purpose is to realize common prosperity. Sri Lanka is one of the most important partners of China in the 21st Maritime Silk Road," he said.
Chen Feng also expressed China's willingness to help Sri Lanka to improve infrastructure and create more employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the well-being of ordinary people.
"As friendly neighbours, the two countries have very good cooperation in economic development. China is developing very fast. We also want to see that our development can benefit neighbouring countries. The new government of Sri Lanka hopes to expedite the construction of industry parks and attract more foreign investments. China has the ability and strong desire to extend cooperation in areas of infrastructure and industry. There is smooth progress in the construction of China funded kidney hospital and water treatment centres in the areas affected by chronic kidney disease.
There are more opportunities in Sri Lanka for investment and the Chinese government has encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Sri Lanka," he said.
Despite repeated assertions from the Chinese and Sri Lankan governments lately that the port city project will go ahead, certain environmental issues are still unanswered. The responsible parties are yet to announce a final decision on the supplementary environment impact assessment that was submitted last week.
