A “Global Tea Party” at GFH

The Galle Face Hotel celebrated 150 years of Ceylon Tea recently. The Colombo Tea Traders’ Association (CTTA), along with the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB) hosted a “Global Tea Party” at the Galle Face Hotel to celebrate our nation’s history as a world class provider of tea.
Beginning in Fiji, down to New Zealand and continuing in every time zone, the tea party was held in several countries at 5pm in each time zone. This made it a continuous, twenty four hour global Ceylon Tea party.
In addition, the Galle Face Hotel hosted Afternoon Tea at the Verandah as a part of this historic celebration. The hotel launched their new Afternoon Tea platter complete with custom made crockery from Dankotuwa.
Traditional English afternoon tea at The Galle Face Hotel has long been hailed as Colombo’s finest.
The elegant stand started with a section of delicate finger sandwiches, smoked salmon on rye, and savoury pastries. Dainty homemade sweet pasties followed, including Nuwara Eliya strawberry shortbread, and a passion and date cake.
The freshly baked scones were a favorite among patrons, served with homemade jams and real clotted cream, exclusively made for the hotel by Tamarind gardens farm in Digana.
