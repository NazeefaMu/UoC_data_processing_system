Kelani Cables introduces ‘Kelani  Masking Painter’s Tapes’

Kelani Cables PLC recently introduced ‘Kelani Masking Painter’s Tape’ to the local market, a product which has been needed by painters.
There are two specialties in the product. The gum in the ‘Kelani Masking Painter’s Tape’ prevents it from sticking to already painted surfaces and when removing the tape after a new job, it doesn’t harm the surface which is newly painted. Hence the product will make the job easy for house and building painters and vehicle painters and offer a chance for them to do a better job.
‘Kelani Masking Painter’s Tapes’ come in two width sizes that are one inch and two inches. The length ranges from 14 meters to 40 meters. (1x14, 1x28, 2x14, 1x40)
Channa Jayasinghe, Brand Development Manager, Kelani Cables PLC said, Kelani Cables always introduces a product to the market after a thorough study of the real needs and wants of the consumers and professionals in the country.
“The marketplace has many products. But the need to modify the existing products and come out with innovations is needed. The revamped products our company has introduced in recent times catered to the needs of the market and are superior ones. CFL and LED bulbs and Insulating tapes that we introduced recently are different to similar products in the marketplace and are best examples”, he said.
“Especially when we introduced the Insulating tape it became immensely popular among electricians because the product has many superior features. Similarly when we did a research on Masking Tapes we found the need by the market for a superior product which is hassle free for painters. Hence we designed the ‘Kelani Masking Painter’s Tape’ to cater to the needs of painters.
This product is doesn’t have any limitations that other products in the market has. Hence we recommend the ‘Kelani Masking Painter’s Tape’ to all painters in the country and request them to experience the difference by using it in their work”, he added.
