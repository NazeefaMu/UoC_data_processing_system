South Africa star Steyn signs for Glamorgan

LONDON, FRIDAY: South Africa fast bowling great Dale Steyn will join Glamorgan for the first part of the English domestic Twenty20 competition, the county side announced Friday.
Steyn will join his new team-mates at the Cardiff-based club after playing in the Indian Premier League with the Gujarat Lions. He will be available for Glamorgan’s first seven Twenty20 Blast fixtures, with Australia fast bowler Shaun Tait replacing him for the second half of the competition. Steyn’s captain at Glamorgan will be his former South Africa colleague Jacques Rudolph. “The timing of this opportunity is ideal and there is no better way to prepare than playing in the IPL,” said Steyn in a Glamorgan statement. “I know that Jacques and the rest of the team have set an initial target of qualifying for the quarter-finals and I will do all that I can to give the team the best possible start.
“It’s also a valuable opportunity to get some overs under the belt in the lead up to the South Africa Test series in a controlled T20 environment.” AFP
