Parliament

Motion does not reveal anything specific against PM - Opposition Leader
Corruption is the worst disease that has afflicted our country and it needs to be eradicated. The roots of corruption must be eradicated. Politicians probably constitute the roots of corruption and that needs to be addressed and eradicated. Any complaint of corruption should be investigated and those found guilty should be punished.
There can be no compromise whatsoever, said the Leader of the Opposition, R.Sampanthan.
He said this in parliament yesterday joining the debate on the no confidence motion brought in against the Prime Minister.
“With regard to the Central Bank bond scam, consequent to investigations two persons are in custody and a warrant is issued against a third person and investigations are proceeding.no one should be spared and the rule of law should be implemented irrespective of who they are.
The motion of no confidence seeks to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. Statements of actions of a general nature are thought to be used in an attempt to implicate the prime minister with the bond scam. The wording of the motion and the timing of the motion are indicative of a pursuit of a political agenda through the motion rather than fixing responsibility with regard to the bond scam. The question must be raised as to why the wording is so weak lacking in any specific charge against the prime minister pertaining to the band scam per say. Why should this motion be brought now?” he asked. The Opposition leader said the wording of the NCM is too loose and too general in nature. “It could be that the Prime Minister is facing this situation because of the confidence he placed in someone who betrayed him. Where is the evidence or charge against the Prime Minister of involvement in the bond scam per say? Is the wording of the NCM so loose and so general because of the lack of specific material against the Prime Minister in regard to the bond scam? If that is so, in my submission the motion lacks credibility.”
With regard to the timing of the motion, Sampanthan said that this bond scam occurred three years ago and it has been the subject of public focus for a long time and why has this NCM brought against the PM only now?
This, he said is a plan to bring down, totally and completely, the present government.
Noting that the SLPP had done better than the SLFP, UPFA, UNF or the UNP, he said it was the result of the dismal performance of the government during the first half of their term.
“However if the government performs better during the remaining 2 ½ years public opinion can change. Unfortunately, the SLPP does not want that to happen. They want to first defeat the PM and their next target will be the president and they want the government brought down. We want the government to implement the mandate given to it by the country in January and August 2015. In these circumstances, how can we support the no confidence motion?”
With regard to the bond scam, Sampanthan noted that the motion does not reveal anything specific against the prime minister. “The true intentions of the SLPP is shrouded in an environment of prejudice based upon the bond scam. We cannot fall victim to such acts and allow ourselves to be used to achieve their political objectives,” he said, adding that in the interest of this country they have to work together in a spirit of cooperation.
No confidence in the Prime Minister - Dinesh
There is no confidence in the Prime Minister. Whether the house has confidence in the Prime Minister or not is a very serious issue. Having come into power on January 8, 2015, the good governance government commenced the process of taking over the Central Bank under the purview of the Prime Minister and a Singaporean national was appointed as the Central Bank Governor.
There is only one Central Bank in the country and it is a known fact that its governor has the power to influence the country’s economy.
The Central Bank which is traditionally under the Finance Ministry was taken away from the Finance Ministry and under the Prime Minister and Mahendran was appointed as the Governor knowing that he would not comply with the country’s accepted financial norms. The Prime Minister recommended the appointment of Mahendran and took on the responsibility which he accepted in parliament, said Joint Opposition MP Dinesh Gunawardena presenting the no-confidence motion on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in parliament yesterday.
Parliamentarians representing the Joint Opposition handed over the no-confidence motion, signed by 55 MPs including 4 from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), to the Speaker on March 21, and was taken up for debate yesterday.
Gunawardena noted that by appointing Arjuna Mahendran as the Central Bank Governor, the faith in the country’s foremost financial institution has been lost.
He said it was a conflict of interest to appoint Mahendran who had close ties with Perpetual Treasuries.
“Those responsible cannot escape from their responsibility. Because of this incident, the Finance Minister had to resign from his post.
Those responsible cannot be made innocent.” Gunawardena alleged that while Mahendran is wanted by the local courts, but many of the government ministers meet him in Singapore but have not assisted in bringing him back to Sri Lanka.
NCM, a sinister plan to grab power - Navin
The no confidence motion is a sinister islandwide politically motivated plan, not aimed at just the prime minister, but the whole government, said Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake, during the debate on the no confidence motion against the prime minister.
He said a certain SLFP member from the central province had said that the plan was to remove the prime minister and bring in a puppet that they can kick out at any chosen time, to bring in a prime minister of their choice. “If there is an issue within the UNP then we should have the opportunity to resolve it ourselves and others trying to remove our party’s leader through the NCM is a totally un-democratic exercise. I look at that whole process in repugnance. It is an aberration of parliamentary democracies because the issue of the UNP leadership and this particular NCM should not be conflicted or there should be no relationship between the two issues.”
He firmly noted that the United National Front group will stand united in defeating the NCM. He said the parties that have initiated this NCM are those who have cases against them or who are facing serious charges. This is clearly evident. They have brought this NCM as a solution to their problems with the hope that by destabilising the government, they could escape from the charges they face.
Dissanayake questioned as to how anyone who supports or approves of this NCM could remain within the government with a clear conscience. “If you look at the substance of the no confidence motion, and the various allegations, it is clearly ridiculous.The allegations have not been even researched and it’s a joke. Nowhere in the bond report does it implicate the Prime Minister. They have not even read the report properly prior to bringing in the NCM. This is the most ridiculous wordings for an NCM that I have ever seen and its an insult to our intelligence. I am sure the victory of the government will be assured when the votes are counted and I am sure the future course of action that has to be rectified through the prime minister will be done.”
JO tainting the self-esteem of Muslim community -Hakeem
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem condemned Joint Opposition for politicising and taking liberties with the pain and shock experienced by the Muslim community from the Kandy incident. Such an attempt taints the self-esteem of the Muslim community, Minister Hakeem pointed out.
The JO is shamelessly trying to exploit the Kandy incident for its own political ends, Minister Hakeem also said. “They are trying to snatch Muslim MPs from our parties.
They are using it as a reason to propose a no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.They are trying to take “fun” in using our sorrows. This is outrageous.” Minister Hakeem pointed out.
Minister Hakeem also noted that the no confidence motion (NCM) strengthens the present government. He also said that the NCM is only the tip of the iceberg of a larger political conspiracy against the government.
Agreeing with Minister Kiriella, Minister Hakeem said that this NCM has lost its momentum right from the beginning.Minister Hakeem while stating that there are issues that need to be resolved, urged the government to establish the rule of law without protecting culprits.
Hakeem also noted that the NMC against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe seems an attempt to remove him from the 2020 Presidential Election race. “The SLMC stands with the Prime Minister against the motion and it considers the motion is an attack on the government. The Prime Minister is only a symbol.
They just want to damage the government,” he added.
NCM reduced to a joke - Sumanthiran
A no-confidence motion on a Prime Minister in any parliament is a very serious matter. “This is the first step in the assault against the government of national unity that has the popular people’s mandate. Perhaps the second would be aimed at the Speaker’s Chair and the third at impeaching the President himself. Now that design goes against the mandate of the people of this country from all parts and all communities granted mainly to the two main parties of this country,” said TNA – MP M.A. Sumanthiran, during the parliamentary debate on the no confidence motion against the Prime Minister yesterday.
“Nobody moves a no-confidence motion on a Prime Minister on trivial issues and therefore this debate has to be conducted in a manner that requires the seriousness. It is a matter of regret that the very members who signed the motion has now reduced it to a joke. They themselves present the motion and not even halfway through the debate we find that they have conceded that they cannot pass the motion and they are reducing the debate and the Parliament to a joke,” he noted.
Sumanthiran said that when they participate in this debate it was their intention to constructively engage with the issues that have been raised. “It is a fact that none of us want to allow corruption to continue in this country. None of us want to allow corruption to continue in this country. This Government has received a mandate in particular from the people to fight corruption. In the January 2015 Presidential election, that was one of the key issues on which people selected a common candidate to fight corruption. There were very serious issues that this country had to face and there were key issues that had to be addressed, resolved and the direction of the country needed to be changed. Persons from varied different political backgrounds joined hands in this exercise. All of us having realised that the direction that the country was taking must be changed, took that decision and a common candidate was agreed upon.”
Thereafter, he said the General elections led to the formation of the national unity government. Unfortunately, he said some who were elected from the UPFA decided to go against that mandate and left the Government of national unity that was formed by the leaders of the two parties and chose to sit in the opposition. “It was the first challenge posed to the national unity government and the direction the country had to continue in. Today that group of MPs who worked against the mandate received has preferred a no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister,” he said.
Six SLPP politicians behind Kandy incidents - Kiriella
The police was in possession of information on outsiders flocking into Kandy two days prior to Digana incident, Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday alleged. Minister Kiriella also said that he himself telephoned the police informing them about the situation and requested them to be vigilant.
Minister Kiriella also said six Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna politicians are behind the recent tense situation in Kandy. Among them, there are two SLPP parliamentarians as well, he pointed out.
“We do accept that there have been lapses from the part of police with regards to this incident. The police had already received information on outsiders coming to Kandy in groups. But the police did not act on these. Some police stations were very much dedicated in curbing the situation, whereas, some were inactive.” Minister Kiriella said. Minister Kiriella further said that three of the said “Pohottuwa supporters” have already being arrested and an investigation is in progress on the rest.
Meanwhile, Minister Kiriella speaking on MP Dinesh Gunawardena’s speech on the no confidence motion, he pointed out that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has always intended for a corruption free government.
“Both times when PM Wickremesinghe took office, he appointed an MP from the Opposition as the COPE Chairman. In 2002 it was late Jeyaraj Fernandopullei and it is Sunil Handunnetti of the JVP at present. He also established oversight committees and appointed MPs from the Opposition and the ruling party. He did all these to suggest that the government has nothing to hide.” Minister Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella pointed out that the accusation against PM Wickremesinghe on appointing Arjun Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank is groundless. Both investigations conducted on the Treasury bond issue have cleared PM Wickremesinghe upon his involvement in the matter.
The Presidential Commission investigating into the Treasury bond issue has clearly stated that the appointment of Arjun Mahendran by PM Wickremesinghe to be legal. PM Wickremesinghe volunteered to give evidence before this commission. Which Prime Minister, which minister have done this ever before?” Minister Kiriella questioned.
President, PM must establish common agreement - Ven. Rathana Thera
Independent MP Ven.Athuraliye Rathana thera yesterday urged for a one year joint agreement between the government and all the opposition parties to establish political stability in the country.
Ven.Rathana thera said he has already forwarded a list of proposals including what the government should and should not be doing during that time period. He requested all political parties to stand together to find a collective solution to the matters faced by the country.
Ven.Rathana thera also said that he cannot vote in favour of the government at the no confidence motion vote, despite having the same criticisms he once had against the supporters of the Joint Opposition.
“This situation has caused a serious political instability in the country. Not only the government but the Opposition also should take the responsibility and move towards a common agreement. We should not allow this country from going towards anarchism. I have forwarded a proposal to both President and the Prime Minister explaining how to establish a common agreement between all the political parties and work for a common goal during a time span of one year.” Rathana thero said.
According to Rathana Thero the proposals include matters with regards to the policies on selling state resources, free trade agreements, endangering Sri Lanka security forces, land related laws, executive presidency and more. Rathana thero was also critical of the government’s inefficiency in dealing with the farmers’ issues on fertilizer supply.
“Now this government is trying to turn back several good efforts made for the betterment of the public. For example, now some politicians are trying to relax the ban on Glyphosate in fear of the international mafia. We cannot allow that. We need to understand we have failed our people. So it is important that we come to this joint agreement and work for a common goal.” Ven.Rathana thera further said.
Hundreds of NCMs could have been presented against MR - Kabir
Hundreds of No Confidence Motions could have been presented against Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa considering the appointments he made while in office, Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
Minister Hashim, who rose to speak immediately after Minister Susil Premajayantha’s controversial speech, was critical of him for justifying the No Confidence Motion based on the Prime Minister’s appointment of Arjun Mahendran as the Governor of the Central Bank.
“Minister Premajayantha is saying that the NCM was brought in because the Premier appointed Arjun Mahendran. If that is the case, hundreds of NCMs could have been brought against Mahinda Rajapaksa. Who appointed Lalith Weeratunga and P.B.Jayasundara?” Minister Hashim questioned.
Minister Hashim also said that they consider the no confidence motion as a conspiracy against the government. He pointed out that the President, Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and MPs of the ruling party have a responsibility to defeat the NCM. “I wonder whether Minister Susil Premajayantha comprehended the fact that this no confidence motion is against him as well.” he said.
Minister Hashim, referring to the new government “as a newly made bed with a fresh mattress and a pillow” said that they “still could not get rid of the spiders, mosquitoes and bed bugs” associated with “this bed”. “We shall soon get rid of these bugs after bringing in the anti-corruption high court.” he added.
He also said the NCM was a result of certain persons who received ministerial posts without any contribution backed by the said “bed bugs.”
“Is there anything worth in this NCM? Is it even ethical? What is the rationale behind it?” Minister Hashim questioned.
“Let’s look at the list of people who signed this NCM. There are persons who have pick-pocketed beggars, persons who killed journalists like Lasantha and Ekneligoda in broad daylight, individuals who spoke of a bag full of gems given by Daisy Aachchi, persons who killed policemen and Buddhist monks in the Eastern Province and persons who killed Thajudeen.” Minister Hashim said.
Minister Hashim also noted that this No Confidence Motion is brought against a Prime Minister who volunteered to give evidence before the Presidential Commission of inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
“We established a new political culture. Several government ministers also went and gave evidence before the Commission. But there are people here who said they were bitten by a snake when asked to appear before the court. They had no backbone. They had things to hide. That is why they dodged the court,” Minister Hashim further said.
NCM, an attempt to destabilise Govt.- Patali
Through this No-Confidence Motion (NCM) certain parties are attempting to destabilise the government and make way for an early election and this is a political bomb, JHU General Secretary Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Joining the debate on the NCM against the Prime Minister, he said the government had taken serious measures with regard to the Central Bank Bond issue.
“We took every possible legal action and conducted an inquiry by appointing a Presidential Commission and released the report with regard to the Central Bank Bond issue. We have also taken measures to punish certain offenders through the Bribery Commission and under the misappropriation of funds. Irrespective of their positions, we will continue to enforce the law and take legal action against anyone who commits such offences,”Minister Ranawaka said.
The minister noted that still there are many perpetrators who have committed crimes similar to the Bond issue who are gone scot-free.He said in a country that imprisons people who steal 12 coconuts,we have failed to punish persons who have allegedly stolen Rs.12,000 million of EPF monies through entrust. They only had to serve a day behind bars. There are 1,700 such incidents that needs to be investigated.
He said the government has the responsibility of making laws to deal with and punish anyone who commits such embezzlements of state funds in the future, just as those who have done so in the past should also be punished.
Minister Ranawaka said that if the special Judicature Act is passed with a 2/3rd majority, the first thing that would be done is to investigate the Bond issue and punish those found guilty. No other government in the past has ever been so open and transparent.
He said that the motive in bringing in this NCM was to get the SLFP members within the government to leave the Unity Government and strengthen the SLFP.
JVP faithful to the people’s mandate - Bimal
JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake joining in the debate of No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister said they voted in favour of the motion to be faithful to the people’s mandate they received to act against all rogues irrespective whether they belong to the green camp or blue camp.
The MP was deeply critical of the President in his speech that he said the biggest betrayal of the people’s mandate was from President Sirisena. “He covered up rogues to the same extent as PM did. The President had received 34 reports of the PRECIFAC long before the Bond Commission report. Some of the PRECIFAC reports came as early as September 2015. What did the President do with them?” he questioned.
He went on to say that the President was behind the NCM against the PM. “The NCM actually has 56 signs with that of the President’s. The Bond scam occurred three years ago and it is a long time since the COPE report came out. But Mahinda camp did not bring in any NCM. The NCM came soon after the February 10 LG polls. The reason was that the President wanted to pass the responsibility of the election defeat to the UNP. He asked the PM to step down and then tried to oust him by getting the support of 113MPs even including those who are highly corrupted. When all those attempts failed, the NCM was presented with the help of some JO MPs supportive of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa,” he stated.
“Former President Rajapaksa had no real interest on the NCM. He did not even sign it. Some JO front runners were touring in Italy when the NCM had been presented. The JO’s interest to the NCM was lesser than their interest to secure the ruling power of a local council. Not a single cut-out or banner by the SLPP. The number of JO MPs who were present when the NCM was moved showed their lackluster attitude to the NCM. The biggest deal in our country today is the deal between the PM and former President Rajapaksa. The PM clearly protects the Rajapaksa family members. A lot of young UNP MPs came to Parliament with hopes of taking a hard line on corruption, Wickremesinghe even betrayed them,” he said.
Only President can remove SLFPers from Govt. - SLFP Ministers
The Prime Minister or the UNP has no authority to oust the SLFP ministers from the government despite their claims that if the SLFP ministers vote in favour of the No Confidence Motion, they would be removed from the government. This government comprises of both parties, but the President is the head of the government. The Prime Minister can remove any UNP member, but he has absolutely no authority over the SLFP ministers, said a group of SLFP ministers yesterday.
The SLFP has firmly decided to support the NCM, but some are working against it and they don’t even have the strength to come forward and openly disclose their stand, said a group of SLFP members during a special media briefing held at the parliament committee room yesterday.
Prior to the no confidence vote being taken, 14 SLFP members addressing a press briefing said that the UNP has no authority to oust them from the government as the President is the head of the government and not the Prime Minister.
“Only the President has the power to remove anyone from the government and not the prime minister,” Minister John Seneviratne said.
They said that the SLFP had unanimously made a decision to support the No Confidence Motion.
“The unanimous stance of the SLFP is that the Prime Minister should resign from his post. All 41 of the SLFP ministers decided and if anyone within the party acts outside of that decision, then they are betraying the party,” Minister Dilan Perera said.
They said that the SLFP group had met at Minister Mahinda Amaraweera’s residence last morning including the SLFP and UPFA General Secretaries and had unanimously decided to support the NCM. The two General Secretaries had notified this decision to the President. “This is not something we did secretly and we expressed our stand openly,” Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
Responding to media queries as to why Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was not present in Parliament, they said that he was expected to attend the vote, but in the event he does not attend the vote, he would make a separate statement the next day. However, this group of ministers assured that he too was supportive of the NCM.
“The UNP leader can decide on who he appoints from that party as ministers, deputy ministers or so on. But it is the country’s President who decides on the SLFP ministers or deputies and their appointment or removal. This is a presidential governing system and he is the head of the cabinet. The Prime Minister is just another member of the Cabinet. Only the President has the power to remove anyone from the Cabinet.
The UNP had only 106 seats and although 113 seats were required to establish a government, no party had that number of seats. That was why the President formed this government. It is true that they brought in the President, but after he became the party leader, he is the leader of the SLFP. However, the President decided to form this Unity Government and it is only he who has the authority to decide on our fate, and not the PM,” Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
Premajayantha for a single party Government
Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha in a tirade against the Government yesterday in Parliament threw a challenge to form a single party Government if possible following their defection.
He made this comment joining in the debate of No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, where he spoke for about half an hour receiving cheers of the Joint Opposition MPs and jeers of the UNP backbenchers.
Premajayantha was critical of the President’s act of removing him from the post of UPFA General Secretary with a few days to go for the Parliamentary Elections in 2015.
“Had the President not sacked the UPFA and SLFP General Secretaries before August 2015 elections, the results could have been different and you would not have made it to the Government. The President himself admitted so,” he told the UNP members.
“The August 2015 election result was misrepresented. The Bond issue happened as a result of that. The last Local Government polls reflected the real mandate of the people. If you apply its results to that of a General Election, the SLPP would have received 102 seats, the UNP 65 and the SLFP 30. The SLFP’s dissenting MPs will support to form a broad alliance to represent the real mandate of the people as reflected in the last Local Government polls. The people will aptly respond to you in the near future,” he added stating that he was no craving for ministerial positions.
The minister, hitting hard at the Government and the Prime Minister over the Bond issue and protecting former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, argued that the SLFP members could not take any responsibility for the Bond transaction as it happened during the period of 100-day interim Government.
“We pinpointed the faults of the Government, but our voices were subdued in the Cabinet. We can no longer continue in it if the same mistakes are repeated. I received 175,000 votes and I am bound to safe guard the mandate given to me,” he stated.
The minister also vowed to hamper the attempts to bring in a new Constitution, stating it was aimed at dividing the country. He said the UPFA election manifesto at nowhere said that it would bring in a new Constitution. “I made the final draft of the manifesto and I know its content than any of you,” he said.
Premajayantha went on to say that when the SLFP’s old hands such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Seneviratne, Anura Yapa, Dilan Perera and himself leave the Government, there would not be a Unity Government anymore, adding that the SLFP General Secretary alone cannot represent the SLFP.
The minister pointed out the officers of Taisei Company, to whom the Government had offered the contract of Phase 3 of the Central Expressway project, have been imprisoned in Japan. “This was not said by me but the President. You offered contracts for those who serve jail sentence,” he added.
Premajayantha stating that he had never robbed public money, asked to check his bank accounts if there is any doubt. “I live in my old house and I built it by obtaining a loan. I have no other properties,” he added.
No Confidence Motion a politically motivated one - Anura Kumara
Chief Opposition Whip JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said that they are in favour of the No Confidence Motion despite that it is a politically motivated one that will rejuvenate Rajapaksa camp.
Quoting the Police report on suspects involved in the recent unrest in Kandy, Dissanayake said that there are six politicians representing Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) who are directly involved with the unrest.
Dissanayake also held the government responsible for allowing racism to escalate into clashes among the community.
“One SLPP Local Government Councilor Thennegedara Gamini Rajapaksa is accused of been involved in the clashes at Kandy and for the shooting incident at the Menikhinna mosque.
Then there is another SLPP LG Councilor Kumara Mohottilage Samantha Perera who was arrested for the same reason. A. Samantha who is another SLPP supporter is being sought by the police for involving in an incident at Digana. One Deepthi, another SLPP supporter who competed in the LG election, is sought out by the police for attacking Muslim owned shops at Pallekele. Then there are two SLPP LG councillors, who are Buddhist monks who are allegedly involved in attacking a Mosque in Digana,” MP Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake also held the government responsible for forgetting its mandate and letting the public down.
Speaking further, Dissanayake said, “Our standpoint on this motion’s vote is being questioned by many. Some even and made phone calls and asked whether our vote for the motion against the Prime Minister would not make us complicit for the crime of strengthening the hands of Rajapaksa camp. Some others demanded to know from us if we would vote against the motion by backing the Prime Minister’s camp and wouldn’t it amount to approving the Bond issue.
“We took a decision to vote for the motion against the Prime Minister. We took that decision after considering the current political situation and its dynamicsM,”MP Dissanayake said.
“This motion is against corruption and racism. The JVP is always against corruption and racism. From that perspective, too the JVP has made the right decision,” he said.
