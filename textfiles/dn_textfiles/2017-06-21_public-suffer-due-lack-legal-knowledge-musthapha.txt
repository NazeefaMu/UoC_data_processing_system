The public suffer due to lack of legal knowledge: Musthapha

“Though Sri Lankans enjoy a higher literacy, they face difficulties in day today life since they lack knowledge of the law of the country,” Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
He was addressing the participants at the first meeting of a legal assistance programme launched with the active participation of the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka and the Human Rights Activity to provide legal aids, counselling and advice to less privileged community in the Colombo district recently at the Paramadharmodaya Viharala, Wellampitiya.
The programme was initiated by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government in keeping with a concept of Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
“As a politician it is more important to take all possible action to address this issue, so that the community can take required steps to solve their issues close to their daily life, beside taking necessary steps to address development issues. Each citizen has a right to know and understand his/her fundamental rights, but prevailing socio-cultural environment has effectively shut the doors for them to ensure access for them,” addressing the participants the Minister said.
People from Kolonnawa, Meethotamulla, Megoda Kolonnawa, Wellampitiya, and Sudu Nelumpura areas participated.
