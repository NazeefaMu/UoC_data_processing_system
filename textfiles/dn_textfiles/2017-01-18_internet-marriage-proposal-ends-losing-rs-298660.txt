Internet marriage proposal ends in losing Rs. 298,660

A resident in Dam Street, Colombo who had allegedly aided and abetted a person frequently visiting Malaysia to defraud a female teacher resident at Airport Road Anuradhapura for Rs. 298,660 promising marriage to her 25-year-old daughter was nabbed by the Anuradhapura police recently. This follows a complaint to police by the female teacher.
According to the complaint, the teacher had published a marriage proposal for her daughter on the internet. The other person seeing the ad had replied it pretending to be an engineer employed in Malaysia and established a friendship with the girl over the internet and mobile phone technology.
When the person proposed to the girl, she had told him to meet her on his return to the country.
The man had said he desired to send the girl a gift parcel worth over Rs. 8 million through a courier service.
The man had then informed the girl that he had already handed over the gift parcel to the courier service but could not pay the fare as it was a holiday in Malaysia.
He had asked the girl whether she could pay the fare from the Sri Lanka end until he comes down and refunded the money.
He had thereafter given a local bank account number for her to deposit the money. Without batting an eyelid, the girl had got her mother to deposit the money in the given bank account.
Afterwards, the prospective fiance had cut off all communication lines to the girl and her mother. Since this aroused suspicion, they had lodged a complaint to the Anuradhapura police giving the bank account number.
The police, after tracing the bank account number, had arrested the suspect at Dam Street who was the owner of the account.
Investigations revealed that the duo had used this same bank account number to defraud people with this same ruse for quite some time. Further investigations are continuing.
