Insurance scheme for constable drivers

The government has taken steps to introduce an insurance scheme for Police Department's constable drivers at state expense from next year.
Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said the historic step would add a new value and a sense of security to about 10,000 police drivers in the country.
They will receive the benefit without any personal expense since the state bears the insurance premium.
