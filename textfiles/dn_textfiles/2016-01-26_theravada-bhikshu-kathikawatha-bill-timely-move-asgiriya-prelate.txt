Theravada Bhikshu Kathikawatha Bill, a timely move - Asgiriya Prelate

 
Mahanayake of the Asgiriya Chapter Most. Ven Galagama Attadassi Thera yesterday said that the Theravada Bhikshu Kathikawatha Bill is a timely move and it is not aimed at imposing rules and regulations on the Maha Sangha, by the Government. The Mahanayake Thera said that the draft Bill is a result of repeated requests by the Maha Sangha led by the Mahanayake Theras of the three Chapters.
The Mahanayake Thera in a statement expressing his views with regard to the proposed Bill stressed that the government is only registering the Bhikkushu Kathikawatha compiled by respective Chapters and Parshavayas. However, The Mahanayake Thera said that a dispute has arisen over this Bill as some facts and characteristics that should be incorporated with the Bhikku Kathikawatha, have been included in the Draft Bill too. The Mahanayake Thera in his statement said that the Karaka Sangha Sabaha of the Asgiri Maha Viharaya will extensively study this proposed Bill and apprise its position to the government in the future.
