Passionto perform!

Mahamaya Girls College Kandy is a school that shows great promise. When it comes to drama, the girls are eager to get up on stage and perform to the best of their abilities. Dramatic Moves feature the thespians of Mahamaya who are determined to put up a brilliant show.
Teacher in Charge, Nishanthi De Silva felt that one reason the girls blossom is because they have a very good support system.
“Up until now under the Literary Music and Drama Society (LMDS), we have been conducting dramas for competitions. However as of this year we have decided to form a separate Drama Club. Our children at Mahamaya love to perform in dramas. We have to be thankful to our Principal I. Withanachchi for her unwavering support and also I want to thank Kumuduni Jayawardena and N. Nanayakkara as well for helping me,” said De Silva.
De Silva feels that drama helps you improve your English and the subtleties of the language. Learning Shakespearean languages has its advantages.
“They are able to develop their audibility. They develop their confidence. For a teacher, guiding and molding these students give me such satisfaction. These girls learn a lot from drama. Drama at Mahamaya has a certain structure. There are teachers in charge of Junior and Senior dramas. The teachers take the girls under their wings and stay afterschool with the girls and practices commence,” stated De Silva.
Getting on stage is the key
“Our girls are encouraged to really interact with the role they perform. We discuss the character with them on a one to one basis and they go on the internet to research. They overcome their stage fright by practice. Getting on stage is the key. Drama helps you to face the challenges of the day to day life. When we are going to do a drama we have to face a lot of challenges from the beginning to the end. They learn how to face victory and defeat. I feel that we need to be with the girls and have a friendly relationship. We need to take what is within them and get the best out of them,” explained De Silva.
Team spirit
President Shihari Herath feels that drama helps you rejoice at victory and gracefully accept defeat.
“Our school is very helpful to us when taking part in dramas, providing us the facilities. Drama has taught us many things such as how to cooperate with each other and work according to a time table. We also learn to balance our school work and extracurricular activities. Drama life at Mahamaya allows the girls to master the language, and in that sense the girls really become cultured,” said Herath.
Drama allows you to know the outside world.

“The main thing I gained from doing drama is team spirit. Preparing for a Shakespeare drama is quite a challenge and is not easy. We practice a lot which have required a lot of sacrifices. It really is very exacting. All in all it is a great opportunity to perform in a drama competition. It is not about winning. It is also about knowing how to gracefully accept defeat,” explained Herath.
Drama is fun because at the end of the day you get to know someone.
“Getting into the skin of a Shakespeare character is really difficult. In one Shakespeare drama I played a male character. Being a female and doing a male character is really difficult. So first we need to study the whole story. And on stage we have to flawlessly perform the character. In A Midsummer Night’s Dream play, I played the role of Demetrius and that character is one of my favorites,” pointed out Herath.
An all-round experience
Vice President, Hymini Wijesekara feels that apart from her branch of knowledge as a science student, drama gives her another view of the world. Another window to look at the world.
“Drama really helps us multi-task. We learn to balance our studies and other school related work. It is an all-round experience. It is also a way of reducing our stress levels. On the whole it is really fun. Drama is very helpful to me. As a science student, drama helps me to learn about other cultural aspects. What you get out of drama is so different from what you would get from another discipline. When preparing for our roles, we study the character intensively. We study about the whole drama. Then I get to know the story and then I get into my character and keep on learning. I need to get into the character. Research is of course paramount because even the minute details matter. The expressions count a lot,” said Wijesekara.
Learning from each other
Secretary Dinushi Vithanage feels that exposure brings adaptability.
“Drama develops our confidence and we learn how to work as a team. Getting up on stage gives us the exposure we need to grow in confidence. It teaches us to take the initiative such as making our own costumes. Drama teaches you how to adapt basically, cooperating with so many people in society. It is a process of learning from each other,” said Vithanage.
Not easy
“Drama really helps us develop our observational skills through the character. Shakespeare was a great poet, playwright and actor who was able to weave an intricate plot combining all aspects of society. So we gain insights into society and learn about society. So working with the girls really gives us a perspective and understanding of so many aspects of society,” said Treasurer Jashanee Fernando.
Winning a Shakespeare competition is really great. But a good performance is its own reward.
“We target a lot on Shakespeare dramas and we understand that winning a Shakespeare contest is not easy. After we perform, we understand that the experience of taking part in a Shakespeare drama is itself a reward. We are always happy to work with each other. We treat each other equally and all is fair. We get full support from our school. To win a competition you need team spirit. No matter what challenges come our way we face them together. We have all made a lot of sacrifices. Forming a drama club in school is a challenge but I feel that we can meet this challenge,” explained Fernando.
So many sacrifices
“We work together, so we learn to get along with so many personalities. We enact different types of characters. So by playing these roles we learn about the world outside. We get to learn so many things because there is so much outside that we don’t know. One challenge we face is the scarcity of time when doing a competition, so we have to do a lot of work in a very short period of time. So we have had to make so many sacrifices as well. So in addition to practicing we need to attend to the other logistics like preparing the props.
One drama we did was ‘Midsummer Night Dream’ and I feel that Shakespeare dramas are very entertaining. The learning is so much. So you have to really keep raising the standards. When enacting a play we leave no stone unturned.
We even look at other dramas performed by other schools to sponge off some tips. Then we get an overall idea and little by little adapt to the character,” pointed out Vice Secretary Nimesha Jayawardhana.
The girls all agreed that working together has never been a problem for them because they are there for each other.
