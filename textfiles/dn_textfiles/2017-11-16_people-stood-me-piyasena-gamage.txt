People stood by me:  Piyasena Gamage

The people of Hiniduma, who stood by me from the time of the 1989 Insurrection, have never isolated me up to date. It was not the people of Hiniduma who defeated me at the last General Elections, but certain other candidates who warned people not to vote for me saying that I will join hands with Maithree. However, the people who accused me have themselves joined the government and obtained Ministry Posts, said Galle District MP Piyasena Gamage.
Gamage, who was sworn in as a Parliamentarian to fill the vacancy created by the disqualification of Geetha Kumarasinghe, on charges of being a dual citizenship holder, said he had always safeguarded the honour and respect of SLFPers who voted for him.
Gamage was addressing a meeting at Neluwa held to felicitate him, recently.
Gamage said he was first appointed SLFP organiser for Hiniduma by the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Now he is a senior Vice President of the SLFP and a party senior who first entered Parliament in 1989.
Now all the people should shed petty differences and work in unison to take the country forward, he said, adding that the Hiniduma electorate with four Pradeshiya Sabha areas covering the largest land mass in the Galle district, did not have any representation in Parliament for the last two and a half years. But he represented the area during the previous 29 years and rendered a great service towards its development.
