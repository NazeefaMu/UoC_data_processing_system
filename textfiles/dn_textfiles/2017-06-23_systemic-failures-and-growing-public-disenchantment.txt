Systemic failures and growing public disenchantment

Not everything has collapsed. Most people have running water on their taps. Shops carry enough daily provisions. Electricity and telecommunication systems are functioning. Public hospitals provide basic healthcare and so on. These are specialized systems providing critical services. Yet, most slow moving systems in the country have continued to stagnate and at times, even become dysfunctional. Examples for the latter are education, disaster preparedness, urban planning, criminal justice, local and national governance, environmental protection and social welfare.
But, the present quality of life and future prospects of a population depends more on the efficacy of the slow moving systems. Faced with a myriad of fast changing social, economic and environmental problems, politicians and ordinary people remain preoccupied with urgent, day-to-day problems rather than exploring possibilities for reforming slow moving systems. They often do not see the connection between slow moving systems on one hand and the day-to-day problems they face on the other. Since ordinary people cannot wait for long term solutions to their problems, or till we remove underlying causes of their problems, it is necessary to find short term remedies to pressing issues like homelessness, poverty and displacement. Yet, we know that systemic problems also need to be addressed through long term plans and interventions. But what is obvious today is that there are serious problems with both.
Most of the social, economic, political and environmental problems we face today are the result of the failure of slow moving systems. While climate change is an underlying factor in the deteriorating environmental conditions in the country, our failure to manage environmental resources in a sustainable manner in the recent past has also contributed a great deal. Cutting down forests, irresponsible use of land for agricultural and settlement purposes, particularly in catchment areas, mismanagement of water resources, etc. are cases in point. The growing population in the country has been spread out across the land mass through sub-optimal resettlement schemes, making it virtually impossible to provide social infrastructure in an effective manner, be it protection from wild elephants or provision of transport.
Modern society
Similarly, our failure to reform the education system in line with the imperatives of a modern society has wide ranging ramifications but there are no short term remedies to problems that it has given rise to. When we face problems, we blame individuals who hold important positions, often without realizing that individuals are the products of systems.
As is well known, corruption has become endemic in this country. But there are countries that have stamped out corruption even in the Asian region. They have done so by adopting a policy of zero tolerance and establishing effective legal and administrative systems to curb it. In this country, we have failed miserably in this regard.
Taking another example, our education system has become a serious problem rather than a solution to many of the problems we face, be it preparing younger generations for enlightened social citizenship or equipping them with skills, aptitudes and world-views that are necessary to function and flourish in a changing society. While many people continue to use or even abuse the education system to achieve their personal goals, be it upward mobility or employment, the larger societal goals like innovation, creativity and national identity have fallen by the wayside. Despite the general recognition of the need for promoting multilingualism among youth through education, we have failed miserably to do so. Meanwhile, many international schools have been established across the country to promote English language education and these naturally benefit the well to do at the expense of lower income groups, contributing to widening social disparities.
National planning system
National planning system in the country has virtually collapsed by now. Those who believe in the magical powers of the market do not appreciate the critical role that the State has to play in the social regulation of the market. There is enough evidence from around the world that, left entirely to the market forces, many economic and social problems get worse, be it income distribution, wasteful and harmful private consumption, environmental damage or the lack of access to social protection. In such a scenario, people run around looking for private solutions, as is evident from hundreds of thousands of youth migrating overseas or moving into the informal sector, both of which do not pave the way for a stable or contented future.
And finally, on paper, we have a three tier governance structure but, in actual fact, the centralized, top heavy nature of the political system continues, making the lower tiers often irrelevant. Despite all the efforts in the past to revamp it, local government system is in a sorry state today. In many countries around the world, local government institutions make the living environment of citizens clean, orderly, healthy and safe. Yet, in this country, we have not empowered local councils to be effective, efficient and responsive in addressing local issues, be it environmental sanitation, building regulation or maintenance of infrastructure.
This gap became all too evident during recent environmental disasters in the country. Here, not only long term planning failed but also disaster response was ill-coordinated. Those who are affected by the floods and landslides know that long term recovery is going to be difficult, at times agonizing, at least partly due to inadequate state response. Many people come out to provide immediate relief but there is often little by way of sustained support for long term recovery. This is the experience of many people who were affected by the 2004 Tsunami.
So far, in this article, an attempt had been made to demonstrate, with a few illustrative examples, how governments often have failed to offer sustainable solutions to societal issues through long term planning. Many more examples can be looked at but the point has been made. The failure is partly due to ideological reasons and partly due to the fire fighting mode the political leaders constantly find themselves in. In the absence of any sustained improvement in the life chances of ordinary people and their children, many people remain disgruntled despite all the fire fighting that the politicians are engaged in. On the other hand, if a regime at least starts to steadily move in the direction of long term planning and sustained systemic change, many enlightened citizens and other progressive forces are more than likely to appreciate the effort, leading to a favourable public discussion on the subject. Unfortunately, this is not what we observe today.
