Errant foreign employment officers brought to book

Foreign Employment Development officers who engage in various malpractices such as formulating fraudulent family background reports about women destined for foreign employment have earned the ire of the Foreign Employment Ministry.
A group of 16 such development officers who resorted to this, have been suspended from service while six others who formulated such false reports have been interdicted by the Ministry Secretary.
This follows the setting up of a special Ministry unit by Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale to monitor the activities of Foreign Employment Development Officers. The Ministry has the mandate to formulate family background reports on women due to leave the country for employment. The family background report paid main attention towards the number of children in the family of the relevant women.
Such reports are not given to women with children below five years. Such reports are issued to women with daughters over 5 years if the father or a next of kin is prepared to take care of those girls only.
The relevant development officer is required to visit the home of the relevant woman for an investigation before preparing the family background report to satisfy himself that the particulars given by the woman in the application is true. Thereafter the report submitted by the development officer had to be counter signed by the relevant divisional secretary.
Once the report is approved by the divisional secretary he or she had to notify the Bureau of Foreign Employment through SMS. No woman is allowed to proceed abroad unless this relevant SMS is received by the Bureau.
The Ministry said employment agreements are not signed without these short messages received from the DS.
There are 1030 development officers attached to the 331 divisional secretariats throughout the country and there are 63 vacancies existing for such officers at present.
