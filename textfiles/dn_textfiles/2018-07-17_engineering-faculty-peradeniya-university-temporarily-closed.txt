The Engineering faculty of the Peradeniya University was temporarily closed due to the eruption of a tense situation this morning, Vice Chancellor Professor Upul B. Dissanayake said.
The tense situation erupted between students and university authorities due to examination entitlements.
The students have protested the suspension imposed on students who have failed to complete the required 80 percent attendance record, to sit for the examination.
The Vice Chancellor said that 3 percent of students have failed to complete the 80 percent attendance record and four other students haven’t attended classes at all.
However the University Authorities have ordered students to leave university premises by 2 p.m.
