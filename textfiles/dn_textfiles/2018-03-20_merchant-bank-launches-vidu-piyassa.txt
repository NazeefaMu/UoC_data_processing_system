Merchant Bank launches Vidu Piyassa

Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC (MBSL) has launched a new project by the name of “Vidu Piyasa” to assist rural communities, especially the young and the youth to enhance their IT literacy.
The first “Vidu Piyasa” centre was opened at Thunkama Sri Gunanandarama Viharaya, in Embilipitiya by the Chairman of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Colonel Nissanka Eriyagama, Brigade Commander of Sri Lanka Army Air Mobile Brigade. The Air mobile Brigade based in Embilipitiya partnered with MBSL to develop the Vidu Piyasa centre at Thunkama Sri Gunanandarama Viharaya at Embilipitiya.
Expressing his thoughts at the ceremony to inaugurate the ‘MBSL Vidu Piyasa’ Computer Centre at Embilipitiya, MBSL Chairman, Dr. Sujeewa Lokuhewa, said, “The country is now being guided along a path of economic development. In such a positive backdrop, children who will one day take over Sri Lanka's future should be armed with a sound knowledge of information technology. To achieve this goal, it is imperative to ensure that they have access to modern information technology facilities. That is why we took steps to build a laboratory with modern computer systems at Thunkama a backward, far-flung village off the Embilipitiya town”.
Established in 1982, the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka was quoted as a public listed company on the Colombo Stock Exchange in 1991. Since 2015, MBSL continues to function as a registered financial institution under the name “Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka and Finance PLC”, in terms of the Financial Business Act No. 42 of 2011 of the Monetary Board of Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
At present, MBSL, which functions as a highly successful leading pioneer in Sri Lanka's investment and merchant banking sector, offer customers a wide range of products such as leasing facilities, corporate and retail credit to small and medium scale industries and business enterprises, pawning services and property sales, corporate advisory and capital market, stock market brokerage, savings and children's accounts and fixed deposits.
