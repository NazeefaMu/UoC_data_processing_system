Garbage issue main focus at JDS Development Committee meeting

Attempts to dump Colombo garbage at the Ekala Othe-Onagama land, took centre stage at the Ja-ela Divisional Secretariat(JDS) Development Committee monthly meeting at the JDS Auditorium presided over by the Joint Chairmen former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera and former Minister Felix Perera.
The Divisional Secretary, Ja-Ela E.M.S.B. Jayasundara coordinated the proceedings.
Western Province Provincial Council Members Srinath Perera, Siri kamal felicial de Silva and Nirosha Athukorale also attended the Meeting.
At the meeting it was disclosed that the efforts made by the Colombo Municipal Council to dump the Meethotamulla garbage at Ekala has not been given up despite the assurance given by President Maithripala Sirisena to both His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo and to Most Ven. Kosgoda Dhammawasa Thero, the Prelate of the Amarapura Chapter, that no steps would be taken to move the Meethotamulla garbage, to Ekala.
When the issue of attempts to dump the Meethotamulla garbage at Ekala by the CMC, came up at the Ja-Ela Development Committee meeting, Gampaha district UNP MP, Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene underscored the importance of acting as one body opposing every move to dump garbage at Ekala, observing that it would cause an unprecedented health hazard.
Not only are the people living around that area, prone to suffer from floods during heavy rain, but would drastically affected the lives of the people in the whole district of Gampaha. When it was pointed out that a letter alleged to have been issued by the then Ja-Ela Pradeshiya Sabha Chairman, the current Western Province Provincial Council Member Shirantha Aramasekera, as evidence to show that one particular party concerned had received the approval to dump garbage to cover the marshy land at Ekala, Amarasekara totally denied the allegation and said that it was untrue.
He said if one analyses the letter, the party concerned had used a letter head which was not the type used when he was the Chairman. Further he said his photocopied signature was also used in the letter.
He said the Colombo Municipal Council had made a complaint to the Ja-Ela Police requesting those concerned to open the path leading to the particular land. He pointed out that there was no pathway as claimed by the party to the said land, but had created one after drawing plans to the land based on the alleged letter claimed to have his signature.
“I just went to the Ja-Ela Police Station to say what I have no hand in this matter,” he told the state officials of the Divisional Secretariat present at the meeting.
Those present at the meeting unanimously opposed any move to dump garbage in any part of the Ja-Ela Divisional Secretariat area. The views were also expressed questioning the parties concerned why they insist on filling the marshy land at Ekala, when there is a suitable land in Wattala that was willing to get the garbage to fill the land.
The Development Committee warned the participants to be extra vigilant about the danger of drugs in the area targeting schoolchildren and youth.
Former Minister Felix Perera explaining the situation in Kalpitiya with regard to the drug menace requested the state officials and police to pay greater attention to this issue that affects the lives of children. The official present also expressed their views on steps taken on povery reduction, the progress of the Divineguma project and the state of the widows and women abandoned by their husbands and facing grave difficulties.
