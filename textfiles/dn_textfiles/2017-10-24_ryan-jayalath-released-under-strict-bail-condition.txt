Ryan Jayalath released under strict bail condition

Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath arrested for damaging public property by forcibly entering the Health Ministry during an anti-SAITM protest was yesterday ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyantuduwa made the order considering a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court decision that he should not be granted bail.
The suspect was ordered to be released on a Rs. 500,000 personal bail and his parents were accepted as the signatories to the bond. Jayalath was released on bail considering his future educational activities as an exceptional circumstance.
The High Court Judge warned that the bail could be cancelled and accused would be remanded until the conclusion of the trial if he violated the bail conditions or engaged in any other offence.
The High Court Judge issued an order directing the Colombo Crimes Division Director that the activities of the suspect be monitored to ascertain whether he would comply with the court order.
“No one has power to take laws into their hands. All should respect to the country’s law. The bail can be cancelled even with a photograph to prove that he violates court order.
“This Court will monitor the suspect’s future activities,” the High Court Judge said.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the suspect is having seven pending court cases in the Magistrate’s Court. The revision application cannot be maintained due to several shortcomings because it has failed to demonstrate the facts challenging the Magistrate’s order.
Defence counsel Gamini Alwis appearing on behalf of the suspect moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over two months.
‘My client had entered the Ruhuna University in 2010 to follow a MBBS science degree. Now he is expecting to participate in internship training’. the Defence Counsel said.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General and Counsel Gamini Alwis for the suspect-petitioner.
