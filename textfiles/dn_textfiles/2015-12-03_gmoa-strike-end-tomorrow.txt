GMOA strike to end tomorrow

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) stated that the island wide strike in effect today is scheduled to be called off tomorrow morning.
 
The strike action was called off after the government announced that vehicles permits would be issued with several conditions.Holding a media briefing on November 30 GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said that they strongly oppose the withdrawal of duty free vehicle permits.
 
“This budget had not met the expectations of the public servants. Nothing had been added to their basic salary" he added. Therefore, he said that the central committee unanimously approved to launch a sudden island wide strike, on December 03.
