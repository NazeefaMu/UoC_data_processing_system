Sashya Shakthi to provide new technology to farming

A special discussion on the Sashya Shakthi project, implemented concurrently with the Shrama Shakthi programme, to minimise the use of electricity and fuel in farming, was held at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on June 11.
Under the first stage of the programme, a solar powered spray irrigation system will be introduced in 3,000 acres of agriculture land by selecting 3,000 farmer families under the Mahaweli Development Scheme - Sri Lanka's foremost multi-purpose development scheme.
New technology will be provided for big onion and chili cultivation which would contribute towards the economic development of farmers.
The prime objective of the project is to face the variable climatic conditions in Sri Lanka and minimise the use of electricity and fuel.
The Shrama Shakthi entrepreneurial promotion programme is jointly implemented by the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry, and the People's Bank.
Mahaweli Development State Minister Weerakumara Dissanayake, Additional Secretary to the President Jayantha Wijeratne, Mahaweli Authority Director General and Additional Secretary to the President Chandrasiri Vithanage, National Economic Council Secretary General Lalith Samarakoon and heads of several companies sponsoring the programme attended.
