ANANDA DABARE’S MAGIC ON STRING’S

It was awards night in shimmering splendor. And we forgot the heat and the buzz outside Bishop Collage Auditorium or the noisome birds perching around trees as the choir of Royal Collage rose harmoniously with that wonderful MESSIAH of UNTO US A CHILD Is Born, one great score by Hnadel reminding us that Christmas is around the corner. Surekha Amarasinghe who directed the massive choir gave us such a warm entry after the National Anthems of Sri Lanka and Brazil were sung.
The Associated Board of Royal School of music (Sri Lanka chapter) whose Sri Lanka Representative is Mano Chanmugam who in his short address after welcoming the Ambassador for Brazil, Her Excellency Elizabeth Sophie Mazella Di Bosco Balsa, said that music is the global language that bring people of all nations together where everyone blend into one large family of love and fellowship.
He is the untiring music genius that promote, encourage and revamp the classical music scene in Sri Lanka when more that 600,000 candidate in 93 countries take part annually. He inspires, innovate to develop all young and not so young only chase their dreams but make them a reality. He has seen generations of them not only through examinations but developing their skills and make awail opportunity to bare their talent not only in Sri Lanka but on international stage. His is the voice of music that innovate learning and helping hand to assist those who are in need by way of sponsorship and scholarships.
Pity I never had a god-father like him during our student days of music. But I am happy to be a Royal Colle brat though majority of my collegues were from Trinity college of music but as Mano said “it is the language of the world” We only had the illustrious Malini Jayasinghe Pieris in small mercy.
The Young Talent most of the students tonight opted for the violin and among them starting from little moppets, all the way their teacher was violin maestro Ananda Dabare whose magical touch inspired and elevated their feelings and emotion. From Grade 2 violin to grade 7, those who opted were Ayoush Senevirathna, Savini Perera, Anagi Gunasekara,Nashon de Alwis, Tiyani Sahabandu and Jascintha Richards among others. They all rose to the occasion and delighted their teachers apart from Ananda Dabare. Antonon Dvorak’s Humoresque had the strings of Renuka Lianapathirana steady and in tone with the score. She was confident and poised without missing a note. This young performer ruchly deserved her award. She was presented by Dilpahan Mallikarachchi. She drove me to my early days of music when Humoresque was one of my favourite pieces and still is but of course I debuted on the piano. Dvorak was one of the top most Early Romantics and HUMORESQUE in G flat No. 7 ubiquitous was scored in 1894 was so popular that it was hacked, over-played and ruined but part of its fabric remained in classical aura on the violin as played by Renuka Liyanapathirana.
The star performer was Jascinta Richards. This talented young lady was presented in two categories of Grade 7, on the violin by John Willams with REMEMBRANCES FROM THE SCHINDLERS’ LIST ; on piano by Moritz Moszkowski with THE SPANISH DANCE No. 1 and snatched Grade 8 award for vocals with SONG TO THE MOON FROM RUSSIA by Antonin Dvorak. From juvenile level, it was marvelous but possible under the training of one of Sri Lanka’s virtostic pianists and of other talents, Briget Halpe whose commitment to the music scene and dedication has seen many generations of young talent bloom to heights.
I was fascinated by the cello playing of Saranga Cooray trained and presented by Savithri Jayethilake who was awarded the sole Diploma ABRSM that he richly deserved. He elected to play Vittorio Monti’s ZARDAS....... and the applause he received from the audience, said it all.
All award wineers were excellent no one surpassing the other in their catergories. The concert ended with the delightful Thivanthi Perera making all of us tap our feet to her rendering of RAGAMUFFIN.
It was very encouraging and should be applauded when Mano announced for the first time they had established ABRSM in Jaffna that produed two award winners and in the Galle Branch established two years had two high achievers beside the bulk from Colombo and Kandy; May be you will consider Chilaw as the next ABRSM-link. We have lot of talent over here. Congratulation to ABRSM and its icon. Mano Chanmugam. Gwen Herat
