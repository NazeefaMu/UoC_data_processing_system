Another dengue prevention programme

A dengue prevention programme will be held from January 24 to 27 to assess the state and private organisations’ contribution towards the prevention of dengue, National Dengue Control Unit Director Dr. Hasitha Tissera said. He said special notices will be issued to the organisations based on their performances.
It is also mandatory for every institution to engage in dengue prevention programmes within their premises once per week continuously.
Addressing a seminar at the National Dengue Control Unit yesterday, Dr. Tissera said 91 deaths due to dengue were reported last year. “Therefore, 2016 was marked as the year with the lowest number of deaths caused by dengue so far,” he added.
Dr. Tissera said 3,500 dengue patients and 11 deaths were reported in January 2017.
He said there is a higher possibility of dengue mosquito breeding at school premises, organisational establishments, construction sites and factories, according to statistical reports.
Dr. Tissera said the condition of the households were satisfactory comparatively to the previous year.
He said measures would be taken to increase the fine from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 25,000 within the next three months to be charged from individuals and organisations that contribute to the spread of dengue.
