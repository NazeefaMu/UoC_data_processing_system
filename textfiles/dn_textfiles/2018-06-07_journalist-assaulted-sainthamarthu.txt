Following the assault, he was admitted to the Sainthamarthu hospital for treatment.
It was revealed that a group of thugs attacked him and damaged his motorcycle for a news item that was published in a newspaper. The Ampara District Journalist Forum urges the good governance government to take action against the culprits who carried out the attack, while emphasizing that the independence of Media prevails in the country. “If these type of assaults on journalists continue, the independence of the media in our motherland will be a questionable one”, they said.
