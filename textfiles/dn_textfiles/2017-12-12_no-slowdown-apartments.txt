A marginal growth was observed in greater Colombo (Colombo district other than Colombo city) area.
Significant decline can be observed in other part of the countries from last year to this year so far, which shows that developers are still focusing on Colombo and its suburbs for new developments despite some new developments being launched in Kandy, Galle, Wattala and Negombo.

The average floor area of the condominiums in greater Colombo area is in the range from 100 to 125 square meters through studied period and it looks stable than Colombo area. The average floor area of condominiums in all the other districts range from 40 to 110 square meters.
The preliminary planning clearances have been issued to more than 3000 units in Colombo and more than 2000 in greater Colombo. Annual average clearance issued for Colombo was 1600 from 2014 to 2017. The greater Colombo average was 1000 and other districts 450. But in the last two years the average of clearances issued within Colombo has risen to 2100 and greater Colombo and other districts remained at same levels.
 Hence, there are significant amounts of Condominiums that were given primary provisional clearances in Colombo City (3,094) as at 31st August 2017, whereas 2,076 units have been forward for clearance in greater Colombo and 752 units in other districts in the country.
