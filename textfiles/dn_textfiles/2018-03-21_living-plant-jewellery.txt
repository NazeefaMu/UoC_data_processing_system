Living Plant jewellery

The Living Jewellery collection lets you wear living plants as a jewellery, replacing the traditional gems by delicate succulents. Attached to necklaces, rings or bracelets, these succulents will continue to grow for three to four weeks, and it will then be possible to pot them, where they will continue to live for years. These lovely living jewellery were imagined by designer Susan McLeary, and are available on her Passionflower shop.
