Aussie businesses eyeing  e-commerce opportunities in China

Local Australian businesses are celebrating Thursday on the confirmation that Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com will open its regional headquarters in Melbourne at the end of the month.
Holding over 266 million customer accounts, the online retailer will offer a platform for homegrown Aussie businesses to connect with new customers and markets across the globe.
Victorian State Premier Daniel Andrews said the announcement will give “more Victorian businesses the opportunities to take their products to the world and is a clear indication that we're leading the nation on the digital economy.”
“We welcome JD.com with open arms and look forward to all the opportunities that this new regional HQ will bring to Victoria, including strengthening our economy and creating more local jobs,” he said.
“There is a lot of economic activity already between the two countries and having people on the ground to deepen that relationship is important,” Head of JD.com's international operations Winston Cheng told local media.
“Right now our focus is to help get Australian products and businesses into China.”
Cheng also said that as trade and shipping activities increase at the new facility, JD.com will “definitely” look to investment in more warehouse centres and Australia infrastructure. (Chinadaily)
