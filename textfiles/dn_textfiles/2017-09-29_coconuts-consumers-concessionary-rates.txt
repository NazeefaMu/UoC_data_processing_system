Coconuts for consumers at concessionary rates

The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) will launch a programme to distribute coconuts to consumers at concessionary rates from October 2, CCB Chairman Kapila Yakandawala said.
One million fresh coconuts will be sold to consumers at Rs.65 each by the mobile vans of the CCB in Colombo, Hambantota and Matara Districts.
The CCB will purchase coconuts from the Kurunegala District.
Yakandawala said about 2,000 Coconut Planters’ Societies have been set up countrywide. Coconuts will be purchased from them, he said.
