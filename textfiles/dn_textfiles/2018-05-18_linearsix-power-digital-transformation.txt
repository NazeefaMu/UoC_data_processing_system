LinearSix to power digital transformation

LinearSix was launched with a mission to power the digital transformation of the banking, finance and insurance sectors in this region.
Founder and CEO Mario Gooneratne, of LinearSix said, “The spread of simple, responsive and engaging experiences in other aspects of their lives are changing customer expectations of financial services. We all want speed, simplicity and more personalisation in our relationships and interactions with our financial services providers”.
Vice President Enterprise Architecture, LinearSix Ishan Wijetunga stated, “Tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, big data, cloud, distributed ledgers, open APIs and biometrics have the potential to radically transform this sector and help institutions build far more insightful and engaging customer experiences as well as improve cost to income ratios”. LinearSix’s offers the best in class applications and business processes directed at helping institutions achieve business outcomes such as customer delight and engagement, faster turnaround times, smarter use of data, and operational efficiency. At LinearSix, technology is not an end in itself. It is merely a means to an end. The company’s focus is on how technology can help its clients grow their top line, improve margins and reduce risk.
LinearSix helps clients maximize customer value while minimizing waste.
Gooneratne added “Although our company is relatively new, our team is not. Each of us have been in this industry for over a decade.
We are working with a fantastic set of partners and are getting great traction in the market already. We already count three licensed commercial banks, a finance company and a new entrant into this sector as clients.”
