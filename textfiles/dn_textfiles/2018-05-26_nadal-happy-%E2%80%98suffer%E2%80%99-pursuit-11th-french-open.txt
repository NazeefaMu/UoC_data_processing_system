Nadal happy to ‘suffer’ in pursuit of 11th French Open

Paris, Friday: Rafael Nadal said Friday he is happy to “suffer” as he chases an 11th French Open title.
The top seed is the overwhelming favourite to lift a 17th career major at Roland Garros after claiming his 11th titles on clay in both Monte Carlo and Barcelona this spring as well as an eighth trophy in Rome.
“In the end, sport is about trying to give the best of yourself,” said the 31-year-old.
“The sensations of matches of three or four hours, played at the limit and thinking about the next point, these are beautiful moments.
“It is to suffer but also to appreciate the moment you are living in. If you are suffering you know how to value it, how to enjoy it.”
With Roger Federer and Andy Murray not playing at the French Open, which starts on Sunday, Nadal is the short-odds favourite to win a tournament where his overall record stands at an astonishing 79 wins and just two losses.
His expected stranglehold has been further tightened by former champions Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka attempting to regroup after long-term injuries.
Djokovic, the champion in Paris in 2016, has seen his ranking slip to 22 after an elbow injury.Wawrinka, also the runner-up to Nadal last year, has only this week returned after three months on the sidelines having undergone knee surgery.
However, Nadal remains wary of the danger posed by Djokovic who he defeated in the Rome semi-finals last week.
“Novak is one of the best players in the history of this sport,” said Nadal.
“My answer is he’s not coming back -- he’s there always. AFP
