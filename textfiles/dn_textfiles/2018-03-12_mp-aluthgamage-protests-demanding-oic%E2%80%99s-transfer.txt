MP Aluthgamage protests demanding OIC’s transfer

Kandy district UNP MP Ananda Aluthgamage started a protest lying on the main road in front of the Nawalapitiya Police Station on Saturday demanding immediate transfer of the Officer in Charge (OIC) of the Police Station.
Aluthgamage arrived at Nawalapitiya early morning and began his protest and continued his protest until 2 pm.
Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara, who was in Kandy, had phoned Aluthgamage and requested him to end the protest promising to find a viable solution to the issue. However, Aluthgamage continued the protest even after the minister’s call.
Aluthgamage said he had visited the Nawalapitiya town on Saturday morning at around 5.00 a.m. and he had not seen any additional security measures in the town despite the violent incidents in nearby Kandy. Aluthgamage said the Nawalapitiya OIC has failed in his duties.
Nawalapitiya Police OIC Ananada Rajapakshe said any violent incident was not recorded in the Nawalapitiya area and he saw no reason to strengthen security.
Later Aluthgamage gave up the protest following talks with Central Provincial Councillor Muthalif Hajjiar and the the Nawalapitiya Police OIC.
