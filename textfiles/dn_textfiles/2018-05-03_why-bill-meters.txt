Why a bill for meters?

The sudden implementation of compulsory billing taxi meter system has fallen on all taxies like a severe thunderbolt. Sometimes humans can escape a natural thunderbolt by using his common sense but not a man-made thunderbolt.
What is the dire necessity for the introduction of this law? Users of taxies did not clamour for this. The general public believed that all taxies should have metres but not billing meters. As a matter fact, many did not know that there were billing taxi meters. Thus, there was no need for billing taxi meters. Rather than the introduction of billing taxi meters, they were questioning as to why the traffic police did not regularly check on whether the current taxi meters were adjusted to read higher charges. Anyway who created this need?
Is it the billing taxi meters importer, whoever it be? Did this importer misuse his muscle to prompt the Police or administrative authorities to introduce this unnecessary law for him to make money on a sharing basis?
This message should reach the information of the Parliament and the government.
