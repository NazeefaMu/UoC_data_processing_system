None can divide SLFP – Sarath Ekanayake

 
 No one will be able to splinter or divide the SLFP. All SLFPers will firmly stand behind the party leadership during the May Day Rally to be held in Galle, said Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake.
He said the SLFP May Day Rally in Galle will give due recognition to the country’s working class.
Ekanayake expressed these views at a press conference at the Central Provincial Council premises recently.
Ekanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has given due recognition to the working class by appointing a working class leader in the calibre of Leslie Devendra as the chairman of the SLFP May Day Rally organising committee.
He said the SLFP would march forward under the leadership of President by weathering all storms.
He said President Sirisena had steered the SLFP towards victory as the Party General Secretary for 17 years and had the ability to ensure the party’s victory in future too.
