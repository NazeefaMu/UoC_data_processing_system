Vehicle clearance to shift from H’tota to Colombo

Vehicle clearance which is being done in Hambantota port is likely to be shifted to the Colombo port, said Ranjan Peiris, the newly appointed President of the Vehicle Importers’ Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL).
Peiris said this was revealed on August 3 by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe at a discussion held in the Ports and Shipping Ministry which was the first meeting he had after taking over as the President of VIASL.
The VIASL President said it was a move in the right direction because the heavy transportation cost can then be reduced and that saving could be passed over to the customer. Here he said they made several proposals to the minister to have a separate huge yard with parking facilities of 2000-3,000 vehicles and security with CCTV cameras etc and separate Customs unit close to the yard in the Colombo Port similarly to the one that exits in the Hambantota Port. Peiris said the minister had also proposed to give office space and required logistics to set up this Customs unit close to the yard.
The VIASL President also requested to provide a tax reduction for hybrid vehicles below 1500 cc and to provide them with a fair valuation system for the vehicles that they import as the current structure was highly unfair on the used car importer.
“Hence we beg on behalf of the average Sri Lankan from the government and the local authorities to provide us that opportunity to serve our community. The upcoming budget will provide the perfect platform for the newly appointed Minister of Finance to make this a reality and to provide the average Sri Lankan citizen a quality vehicle that will last a generation and is equipped with suitable safety standards which will be both highly economical and environmentally friendly,” he said.
The VIASL President also said that about 90% cars sold in Sri Lanka is on leasing facilities and the restriction by the Central Bank of Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio for motor vehicle loans to 50% had further jolted the already ailing motor industry in Sri Lanka. Peiris said his personal view was that the 50% LTV ratio has become a financial burden to the consumer and has made the dream of purchasing a vehicle unattainable since their preferred ratio is 70%.
Peiris added that increasing the tax on electric cars from 5 percent to 50 percent should be reconsidered in a back drop where European countries that have less sunlight too encourage electric cars and Sri Lanka having sunlight 365 days a year doing otherwise. In a country like Sri Lanka the aim should be to provide and promote facilities to people who were using electric cars and solar power”.
