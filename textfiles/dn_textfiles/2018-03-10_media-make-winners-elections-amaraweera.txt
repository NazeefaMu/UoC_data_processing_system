Media make winners of elections: Amaraweera

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amarawera said that they have to dance to the tune of the print and electronic media to win an election.
The Minister said that the print and electronic media enjoyed the most the results of the Local Government elections.
He said that many voted the Pohottuwa party thinking that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would become the Prime Minister. It became a dream, he said.
“The present government fulfilled aspirations and expectations of the people, but they were unable to explain what they have achieved for the people at their propaganda rallies.
He said that if they are to win elections in future, they will have to open their own print and electronic media institutions or give media personnel several high ranking posts in the government.
The Minister said the social media and the print and electronic media gave wide publicity to the shortcomings of their regime and never highlighted what they did for the people during the past three years.
He said the country regained the international reputation that was lost during the previous regime.
He said the government regained the GSP plus and succeeded in removing the ban on fish exports.
