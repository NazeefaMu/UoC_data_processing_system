SLTDA to launch mobile registration service in Jaffna

 The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) will launch a mobile registration service in Jaffna at the District Secretariat auditorium on May 30 and 31.
The mobile service will ensure that all tourism-related businesses in the area such as hotels, restaurants, bungalows and travel agencies are registered with the SLTDA, the apex body of Sri Lanka Tourism.
The initiative is assisted by the Northern Province Tourism Association.
According to the Tourism Act of Sri Lanka, all tourism-related businesses and service providers must obtain registration from the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) and come under the regulatory framework of the organization.
The mobile registration, according to the SLTDA, is a significant step towards facilitating this registration process.
“Informal or unregistered tourism-related business entities provide useful visitor services and generate employment and as such, form an important segment of the industry. But we want them to come within the registration mechanism of the SLTDA now so that standards can be monitored and improved over time,” SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayaka said, commenting on the mobile registration initiative. The SLTDA said a delegation representing the institution, in collaboration with the Northern Province Tourism Association, visited Jaffna last week to inform all industry stakeholders in the area of the mobile registration programme.
A similar mobile registration programme will also take place in Weligama and Mirissa on June 3 and 4.
