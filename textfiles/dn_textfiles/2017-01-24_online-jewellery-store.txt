Online jewellery store

‘SAF’s Classique’ online jewellery store was launched by M.C. Joonoos & Co. Jewellers and Gem Merchants, the oldest jewelers in Sri Lanka. This iconic company has been in business since 1855 and over a long and rich history of 161 years, has the distinction of maintaining its long standing traditions created and handed down by their forefathers. While previously catering to an elite clientele, this continuing tradition and craftsmanship has resulted in the creation of exclusive masterpieces under the brand name of ‘SAF’s Classique’.
