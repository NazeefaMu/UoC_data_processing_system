Junior students permitted to wear longs for now

Students in junior classes will be allowed to wear long trousers instead of shorts until the dengue menace is brought under control. School girls will also be allowed to use a suitable dress together with the school uniform to cover their legs.
Students in schools situated in the areas identified as high threat zones for dengue fever can wear trousers and suitable dresses to protect themselves.
It has been revealed by a study jointly carried out by the authorities of the Health and Education sectors that most of the students who had dengue fever are boys, who wear short trousers studying in junior classes and school girls wearing frocks. Therefore the Ministry has taken this measure to prevent students from catching dengue fever while in school.The circular will be issued by the Education Ministry in due course . The Ministry has also adviced principals to pay special attention of the cleanliness of the school environment.
