Fishing Cat dies in accident

The carcass of a fishing Cat run over by a vehicle was found on the Puttalam-Colombo road close to Wanathawilluwa junction recently. Death of animals at the hands of speeding motorists is a common sight these days due to animals criss-crossing this section of the road in search of water. Picture by K. Priyankara in Wanathawilluwa.
