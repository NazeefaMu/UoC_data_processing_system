Honour among the corrupt

In Sri Lanka, we still think that the only method to deal with crime is to prosecute a suspect, spending the country’s money and resources, which may drag on for years. This is the system we have inherited from the British. However, we not only do not practise prevention methods, our legal system is totally void of any preventative measures to curb crime, prior to it occurring, and these preventions are not even taught in law colleges. This is because we practise the adversarial system. We are of the notion that if we punish perpetrators and punish them severely, then others would be careful and stay away from committing crimes. However trends are now changing and the world is now looking at measures to prevent crimes, instead of waiting until it happens.
Last year 57 convictions were done with regard to corruption cases, said the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Sarath Jayamanne PC.
In an interview with the Daily News, he said last year CIABOC had filed 73 cases, while 51 were arrested over accepting of bribes. In all 2,768 complaints had been received by CIABOC last year. So far this year CIABOC has filed around nine cases and carried out 11 successful raids, having received 605 complaints to date this year.
However, he said in most instances, these people who accept bribes are aware that the bribery commission is nabbing those involved, but still, the urge to make that extra buck, makes them do it anyways.
Meanwhile, one of the main reasons identified in punishing those who engage in bribery or corruption is the delay in prosecutions. He noted that by the time the cases are filed and cases drag on, in most instances, by the end of years of investigations and delayed legal processes, the culprits get away due to various reasons. Previously, bribery cases were only heard in the Magistrate’s Courts, which is the lowest of the courts, and due to the daunting number of cases that are filed and investigated, these cases invariably pile up. But, now measures are being taken to address these issues that hamper the delay in completing these cases by revising some of the acts to facilitate the speedy completion of these cases.
Corruption cases
“CIABOC has taken measures to resolve the piling number of cases through several amendments to the existing acts, completing the hundreds of thousands of piled up cases. Three acts are to be amended, pertaining to the judicial activities, bribery and corruption and public servants activities, replacing the old laws with revised and productive new ones. Accordingly, based on these amendments, all courts procedures from the Magistrate’s Court up will be changed,” he said.
According to Director General Sarath Jayamanne, so far all corruption cases were only taken up by the Magistrate’s Courts and due to this loophole in the legal system, during the past 23 years, while over around 100-200 cases were filed, only four persons were convicted and received punishments amounting to ten years imprisonment. However, according to the new amendments, no case will be dragged on for many years and would be heard continuously and expedited.
“Cases that are determined to be heard before the AG or Bribery Commission or a three-member judge panel will be heard without a break until a final verdict is completed, thanks to the new revisions to the act. Due to the delay in conducting these cases, in most instances, the evidence is lost, witnesses go missing or they die, suspects flee, officials change, documents get misplaced etc. and by these delays, sometimes even the severest criminals escape the grasp of the law, resulting in further injustice to the affected parties. Among the piled up cases, there are cases that have been delayed for over 20 years. Hence, even the President noted that this mechanism needs drastic changes. The proposed amendments would allow evidence gathered by a presidential commission to be valid before court reducing the repetition of the process of gathering evidence saving time and resources and expediting the judicial process,” he noted.
However, he noted that in most of these cases, around 75 percent of the complaints are without evidence and grievances rather than substantial complaints. Therefore, he appealed to the public to refrain from sending in such complaints as it is a waste of public resources as these baseless complaints too should be investigated prior to being discarded wasting valuable time and resources.
Through the amendments, most of the laws pertaining to the 1988 Bribery Act would be revised. “Through these amendments, the loopholes that thus existed would be closed leaving no room for offenders to creep through them and escape punishment. These amendments have now received Cabinet approval and currently measures are being taken by the legal draftsman to initiate necessary action,” he added.
However, he said these measures alone are insufficient to prevent corruption as it is now embedded in the genes of the people of this country. “In many instances, knowing that they are bound to get caught, state employees still take bribes. I wonder if they simply don’t care that they would be arrested. Sri Lanka is among the four most corrupt countries in the world because of this. Hence, if we are to prevent corruption in this country, we need to change the thinking of the people and we need to change the way we think at the school level. Countries such as Singapore were in a worse state than us, but today they have emerged as one of the least corrupt nations. It is one of the world’s wealthiest countries. This is mainly because their state service is the least corrupt. In fact, they take great pride that their public sector is corruption free. Despite this fact, they have also put mechanisms in place to make corruption or bribing impossible. Their procedures are all very transparent leaving no room for corruption,” he pointed out.
Government institutions
In fact, Singapore’s population density is far greater than Sri Lanka. Still, the crime rates are far lower. In Singapore, the population density per kilometre is around 6,000, Hong Kong around 4,000 but in Sri Lanka, our population density is only 325. These other countries are concrete jungles without any natural resources, but still, they have made it to the highest position. They have achieved this by just their perseverance and honesty. Their brand name is the honesty of their public servants. To date, Singapore is ranked as the highest in honest public service.
Jayamanne further noted that the main reason for corruption to take place in this country is the eye-to-eye interaction between the government official and the public. “The main reason for bribing happens when the officer is aware that the civilian coming to that department to get a job done is unaware of the system and he deliberately delays the process practically forcing the civilian to pay a bribe in order to expedite his requirement. This can be stopped by minimising the direct contact between the officials of government institutions and the general public and making the whole process transparent leaving no room for bribing. For this online methods can be initiated where the process can be streamlined and transparent.”
Responding to allegations that the Bribery Commission is only after the small fries while the big fish gets away, Jayamanne said in many of these cases where people term ‘small fish’ is where the wronged are helpless innocent people. “Hence it is not a matter of small or big fish our country should be rid of corruption of all sorts. With the new amendments to the Bribery Act, CIABOC act and the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act, we also gave a schedule that was presented to parliament by the President and approval was granted. Currently, we are in the process of going through the details together with the legal draftsman.”
Meanwhile, while a lot is being done by CIABOC under the leadership of its Director General and to expedite cases of large-scale corruption and fraud, an appeal was made to allow these cases to be taken up in the high court and the president had presented this proposal to the Cabinet and having obtained approval, it is scheduled to be presented to parliament for approval shortly. “Now there is a law that says cases cannot pile up. In terms of cases where either the Attorney General or the Bribery Commissioner has recommended be heard before a three-member judge panel, it is stipulated that these cases be heard continuously and completed in a short span without letting these cases drag on for years,” he said.
Lack of space to accommodate staff
However, the Director General of the Bribery Commission lamented that while much is being done to facilitate the quick processing of these bribery or corruption cases, one of the biggest stumbling blocks they face is the lack of space to accommodate its staff.
“We have now got approval to recruit around 50 independent investigators, but accommodating them without space is the biggest challenge. Previously too since a section of outbuilding collapsed, I had to house some of our employees at the old Registration of Persons office. But they want us to leave that building as well. Where do I now accommodate these workers? We made a request to the Urban Development Authority to grant us a land that is adjacent to this office, but despite the President and Prime Minister’s approval, they are reluctant to grant us this land for some unknown reason. Instead, they request us to move to Battaramulla. This is a counterproductive move as we deal mainly with the courts which are based in Colombo and moving to Battaramulla will waste a lot of time on the roads, whereas from this current location at Boudhaloka Mawatha it takes a mere 12-20 minutes to get to the courts,” he pointed out.
It is no secret that countries that have grown socially and economically are those that have combated corruption. They follow a method of exposing those corrupt and mainly by inculcating in the hearts and minds of the people that bribery and corruption are wrong. Only once we learn to accept this and act with the responsibility that we will be able to rid this country of corruption.
