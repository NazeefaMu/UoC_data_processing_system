Dansel organisers enforced special rules

The Buddhasasna Ministry and the Buddhist Affairs Department had jointly decided to enforce special rules on dansel organisers countrywide.
Accordingly, Buddhasana Minister and Kurunegala District United National Party Parliamentarian Gamini Jayawickrama Perera had instructed ministry officials to introduce six new guidelines.
Certain individuals posing as office-bearers of leading Buddhist organisations, had been discovered collecting funds from the public to organise dansel and other Buddhist welfare activities.
According to the new rules, all dansel organisers mus obtain the approval of the incumbent of their respective Buddhist temple and the Grama Niladhari of their respective towns.
They are also prohibited from using loud music or loudspeakers, Minister Jayawickrama Perera told the Daily News at a media conference that was held yesterday at the Bingiriya Devagiri Raja Maha Viharaya, where the state Vesak festival is to be held on April 29.
The Buddhist flag should not be used to halt passers-by and invite them to partake in dansel. Dansel organisers are to refrain from liquor consumption and smoking at all times, he added.
