The fourth edition of Spinfit Sundown organized by Spinner under the leadership and guidance of renowned Sales Coach, Marketeer and Entrepreneur, Yasas Hewage will be held on August 13, at the Kimbulawela Walking Track.
It is a fund-raiser for the cause “Re-Wheel Sri Lanka,” initiated with the simple motive of giving every Sri Lankan child the joy of riding a bicycle and the wealth of health and confidence to win.
Organized as a sports-meet style event for every member of the family, Spinfit Sundown has become one of Sri Lanka’s most popular cycling and running events aimed at promoting an active, healthy lifestyle, reinforced through friendly competition.
Through the initiative Spinner aims to inspire a wider community to get together and embrace an outdoor lifestyle while enjoying cycling and running. Please contact 0768716366 if you wish to donate or know of a disserving child.
