St.Peter's emerge all-island T20 champions

St.Peter's College, Bambalapitiya clinched the Singer U19 schools T20 Championship 2015/16 when they beat St.Aloysius College - Galle, a fast-emerging team from the down-south by 38 runs in the finals concluded at Galle International Stadium on 8th April 2016. Meanwhile, Trinity clinched the third place of this tournament when they beat Prince of Wales in the third-place play-off played on the same day at the same venue by 4 wickets.
This tournament was originally contested by the same set of 16 schools that were qualified to play in the pre-quarter final round of All-Island Limited-Over Competition. The most interesting outcomes of the pre-quarter final round were the Prince of Wales' defeating Lumbini, St.Joseph Vaz's triumph over Nalanda and Aloysius' tremendous win over hot-favourite Isipathana.
St.Aloysius took another step forward when they trounced strong St. Thomas, Mt.Laviniain quarter finals joining St.Peters, Prince of Wales and Trinity in the semifinals. In two semifinals, St.Peters became a finalist beating Prince of Wales whilst St.Aloysius knocked star-studded Trinity out of the competition to join St.Peter's in the finals.
Despite St.Aloysius lost the title after the finals becoming runners-up in this tournament of the shortest-format, their journey to finals was a tremendous one as they overcame the three major contenders for the title; Isipathana, St.Thomas-Mt.Lavinia and Trinity, Kandy before becoming one of the finalists in the end.
