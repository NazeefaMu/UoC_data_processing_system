Wickramarachchi takes hearing, vision care to Wattala

Pioneering Hearing and Vision Care Specialist J.M Wickramarachchi and Company recently opened its latest branch in Wattala. The opening took place under the patronage of Dr. Jayasinghe and Founder and Managing Director of J.M Wickramarachchi and Company Mihira Wickramarachchi.
Speaking at the opening Mihiri Wickramarachchi noted, “It is indeed an honour to open up our latest branch at such a strategic location. Dr. Jayasinghe has had his practice at this location for many years and has had the honour of being visited by the late President J.R. Jayewardene on many occasions. Dr, Jayasinghe has also been responsible for the care and cure of thousands of patients and we hope to carry on his legacy”.
Located at Negambo Road, Wattala this branch will concentrate on providing state-of-the-art optical and hearing services to the Wattala, Ja-Ela, Kandana, Katunayake, Peliyagoda, Kelaniya and even Negambo areas.
Speaking further Wickramarachchi also said, “Having pioneered quality vision and hearing care in the country, we are happy to extend our services to the people of Wattala and beyond. This highly urbanized area has been in our pipeline for many months and this location we found to be the most suitable. Our expansion plan for 2018 also includes other key locations around the country as we strive to take our products and services to every person who needs it around the country”
Apart from clinical hearing and optical services, the outlet will also stock designer sunglasses from world-renowned brands like Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Vogue, Versace, Ray Ban, DKNY, and Burberry.
