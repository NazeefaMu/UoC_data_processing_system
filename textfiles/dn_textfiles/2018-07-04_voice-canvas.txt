Voice  on the  canvas

Priyantha Abeysundara is a voice on Canvas. A voice reminding the modernized youth of Sri Lanka of their unique cultural heritage. Abeysundara calls himself ‘An Observer of Traditional Culture’. A picture is worth a thousand words and his portraits provide us with valuable insights into the beauty and simplicity of us islanders. It captures the reality of life and its details and offers us a chance to look back in time at the village and its serenity.
“The exhibition is called ‘Swabaavie 3’, which is my third exhibition. My paintings are very simple, which has an attraction to many people. This exhibition includes oil paintings, acrylic paintings and line drawings. The themes of these paintings have really nothing to do with modernity, in fact, the paintings feature that which has been lost in Sri Lankan society, specifically from village society and culture. So in doing these paintings, I want to remind and educate the youth of the coming generations of their beautiful heritage. So this is what I will be featuring in my exhibition,” said Abeysundara.
Community traits
It could be simple scenes like people farming, gathering at the marketplace or participating in festivals or rituals that we take for granted. These cultural and community traits seem to be disappearing with all these new technological innovations.
“It can be simple things like gathering at the well in the village. That has a unique culture of its own which has many facets. This is something we seem to be fast losing in these times. Now, this feature of society is quite a rarity when we look around the environment we are familiar with. This is all fast disappearing even from the villages. These are memories of my childhood that I try to bring on canvas, memories of what I have seen and done as a child. For example, the memory might be of a paddy field in the night, with the bulls working in it, illuminated by the light of the lamps. Remembering this gives me great pleasure,” explained Abeysundara.
There is much diversity in Abeysundara’s paintings. He goes further and further back in time. To a time very different from Sri Lanka today.
“Most of the themes of my paintings revolve around the beauty of Sri Lanka, drawn from my visits to many locations in Sri Lanka. Also, there are certain incidents that have taken place during the times of our kings we have not seen but they have come down through word of mouth. So I bring all of this onto the canvas in the form of paintings,” stated Abeysundara.
Canvas process
In the Mahavamsa it says that King Dutugemunu built Ruwanweliseya. Abeysundara has read on this extensively, and on canvas, he takes us through the processes on the site.
“My father, Lionel Abeysundara was in this field having worked at Lake House at one time. So I looked at my father when he was drawing, but I must say that I have never studied under him. Possibly this talent of mine is genetic. I must say I did not take studying art very seriously when I was at school. I was much better than all the other students. At school, I was taken in the direction of painting and very soon I fell into that track, it was not something I asked for. So that habit started to become a lifestyle for me very soon.
Then I went to Aesthetic University. I learnt and I learnt well. And then I started to teach there. I was quite skilful and this was evident at my stay at the Aesthetic University winning debates even with my Professors! In 2008, I left and worked as a freelance artist. I did commercial paintings and must have drawn a huge amount of pictures. At a National level, I even proposed that we create 50 sculptures of ancient battles between kings inside a memorial in Tangalle,” pointed out Abeysundara.
The only thing greater than his need for Art is his conviction that we have a purpose upon this earth.
Duty and responsibility
“I feel we have been born in this world and have been given a certain talent to fulfil a certain need in society. To perform a certain duty and responsibility before we die. Bring a certain balance to the environment,” said Abeysundara.
Abeysundara confesses that he likes artists who capture reality. That appeals to him greatly. He has one message to any aspiring artist.
“There has to be a certain level of maturity in any good artist. All the great artists have all amassed knowledge and developed their skills through a proper training, mastering the basics and proper techniques. Art should not be about passing exams. It is a vocation. It is about understanding and understanding perspectives. Do it the right way,” said Abeysundara.
The exhibition will take place at the Lionel Wendt opening on July 6 and continue till July 9.
