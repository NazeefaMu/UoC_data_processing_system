AAH to build, nurture world-class tourism and  hospitality professionals in SL

Australasian Academy of Hospitality (AAH) in partnership with the Sydney based leader in hospitality, culinary and tourism management, Evolution Hospitality Institute (EHI) announced the commencement of their academic and training institute in Sri Lanka which will offer globally recognized courses in world-class facilities for Sri Lankan students.
Australia’s High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Bryce Hutchesson, Chief Executive Officer of Evolution Hospitality Institute, Stewart Page and Kalum De Silva, Managing Director of Australasian Academy of Hospitality graced the launch event amongst a host of corporate luminaries.
Australasian Academy of Hospitality, a 100% Australian investor driven organization is the first international learning center of Evolution Hospitality Institute outside of Australia. With the first intake scheduled for January 2019 the Academy will balance expert knowledge and hands-on experience with specialist teaching that will equip students to rise in the hospitality industry while opening doors to employment opportunities locally as well as globally.
The curriculum designed by Evolution Hospitality Institute will be delivered by lecturers from EHI’s training network and local industry experts. The course will include internships and apprenticeships in leading hotels in Sri Lanka and overseas with the option of completing a bachelor’s degree from a leading business school in Switzerland. Valuable insights and input from the industry have been incorporated into AAH’s curriculum to make graduates ‘work-ready’.
Students have the option of completing their Advanced Diploma in Sri Lanka, at 1/3rd the cost or complete one year at AAH Sri Lanka and transfer to Australia to complete their chosen field of study.
Kalum De Silva, Managing Director, Australasian Academy of Hospitality and President of Sri Lanka-Australia Chamber of Commerce said, “Sri Lanka’s tourism sector is growing with the Government predicting 600,000 direct employment in the industry by 2020. We are happy to inaugurate an institute in collaboration with a global leader in hospitality and tourism education, and to create a cadre of skilled and knowledgeable hospitality professionals.”
“Our goal is to be the premier hospitality and tourism management institute in South Asia and in the Asia Pacific region, attracting students from all over the world,” De Silva said. Stewart Page, Chief Executive of Evolution Hospitality Institute, Australia said, “By setting up Australasian Academy of Hospitality in Sri Lanka, we will prepare students for management positions in leading hotels, restaurants and leisure facilities both locally and worldwide, through a combination of innovative studies and hands-on experience in different properties and environments. Classes will help inspire pupils and open their minds to the myriad opportunities that exist in the industry, for which there is a dearth of talent.”
The opportunity to learn hospitality and tourism management will be at AAH’s best-in-class facility at Alexandra Place, Colombo 7, setting the stage for unparalleled learning experience, embedded with career-defining internship opportunities in star class hotels in Australia, United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Sri Lanka.
“The demand for professionals with a thorough knowledge in hospitality and tourism management is on the rise; both globally and locally. I firmly believe this partnership will enable us to provide sound academic guidance to Sri Lankan students. AAH curriculum is well designed to bring out the best in students and it is the perfect platform for local undergraduates to nurture their skills to shine in their respective careers,” De Silva added.
