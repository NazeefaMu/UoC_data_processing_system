Harbour submerges  in overgrown shrubs

The Ambalantota fisheries harbour has been invaded by weeds as many of the buildings in the harbour remain abandoned for years. The restroom, the storage and even its main office have been submerged in overgrown shrubs.
Fisher folk in the area have set up a temporary hut to store their fishing gears.
They said they do not use the buildings which are a quite distance away from the beach.
Even electricity appliances and windows of the buildings were removed by unknown persons, they said.
