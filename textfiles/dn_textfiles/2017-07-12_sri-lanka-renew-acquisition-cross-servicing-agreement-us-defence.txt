Sri Lanka to renew acquisition, cross-servicing agreement with US defence

 
The Sri Lankan government is to renew the acquisition and cross-servicing agreement with the United States Department of Defence.
The agreement which was initially signed on March 5 this year was to stand for 10 years.
It allowed the exchange of supply and services, training of staff and humanitarian aid in disaster situations between the two countries.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his capacity as the Minister of Defence pointed out that the agreement would help improve global ties and given the global security situation would be an apt decision to make.
