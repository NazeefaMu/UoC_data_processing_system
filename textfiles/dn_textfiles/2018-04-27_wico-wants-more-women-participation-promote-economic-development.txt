“WIPO is mandated to promote the respect and protection of intellectual property including copyrights as a whole. Also WIPO has been working with member countries especially with countries in South Asia to promote the development of copyright systems in order to maximize the role of the system for the encouragement and protection of national creative industries and the same time taking care of the needs and interests of all concerned parties.”
WIPO has also been working closely with developing, underdeveloped and least developed countries including those from the South Asian region to develop and update national and legal policy framework in the field of copyrights and to promote better understanding of the usefulness of international copyright frameworks and to work with the respective governments and stakeholders to establish infrastructure for the protection and the management of copyrights.
