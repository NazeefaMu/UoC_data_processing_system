Wijeyadasa Exit: Corruption fight gets closer

The change in political culture announced with the resignation of Minister Ravi Karunanayake has moved to a faster pace with the sacking from Cabinet of the Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. The two ministers gone out so far held two very important portfolios – Foreign Affairs, and Justice and Buddhasasana. This shows a major shift in the politics of government, where a position held by a minister was unable to stand in the way of discipline, and in fact has been the key factor in the removal process.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe’s removal shows a rise in the organisational strength of the UNP, especially among its MPs, where unity of purpose in seeking removal of a Cabinet minister gained near unanimous support, even among his ministerial colleagues; showing a new trend in the organisational realities within the UNP. The call for a more determined fight against corruption in government has made the UNP attempt to take a lead in this fight, as the coalition of ‘national unity’ completes two years, and the rivalry between UNP and SLFP deepens.
The former Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana was never a ‘green personality’ in politics. His beginnings were with the SLFP, in the days of President Chandrika Kumaratunga, and a close association with the late Sripathi Sooriyarachchi, at a time of much tainted political manoeuvring, who had a portfolio in the first Mahinda Rajapaksa Cabinet, falling out over allegations of President Rajapaksa having an accord with the LTTE.
Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe also did not last very long in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, after being an MP from 2004. After the 2005 Presidential Poll Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed him as Minister of State Banking Development. But he resigned on issues of policy in April 2006, and has been with the opposition UNP benches since then. When he was Chairman of COPE the parliamentary organisation in 2006, it did produce two good reports, the recommendations of which did not move to implementation. As the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, he did make a strong protest against the efforts to impeach former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake.
That apart, his record as Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, after the election of President Maithripala Sirisena to office, and the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister, has certainly raised many questions about his commitment to fight corruption and fraud by the Rajapaksa Regime.
Hambantota Port deal
The immediate call for his removal was public criticism of the Hambantota Port lease to a Chinese company, in an interview with the Lankadeepa newspaper, considered a violation of the collective responsibility in the Cabinet. His later position he was only expressing his personal view did not impress the UNP MPs and Ministers who called for his removal. There were also signs he was playing sully politics with the Hambantota Port deal, with the knowledge of the strong public opposition to this by the Joint Opposition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his call for the Maha Sangha to call for change of this major transaction in the field of economic and foreign relations.
His argument of not interfering with the judicial system or with the state legal process through the Attorney General did not hold any water, considering the long delays in bringing the members of the Rajapaksa Regime, the family and politicians, to justice through the courts.
There were many reports about lack of sufficient staff in the Attorney General’s Department, which was his duty to remedy. There was need for new thinking on the judicial processes to fight corruption with speed. The silence and inaction of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on these issues, and later statements these would need constitutional changes, were also not in any way convincing to his open critics and organisations of civil society calling for speedy action against corruption.
The situation became worse when President Sirisena made his angry statement, nearly two months back, that key UNP members in government were delaying action against the Rajapaksas on charges of corruption during the last regime.
All of this certainly made it easy for President Sirisena to readily give in to the UNP request for the removal of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the Cabinet. Yet, this does raise other issues on how fast the government could in fact move with any measure of success against the corruption and fraud of the last regime, and fight corruption that has grown within its own ranks today.
The Media now has much more of the fight against corruption, with more emphasis on the Mahinda Rajapaksa family. But would this be like the beginning of ‘Yahapalanaya’ or Good Governance, and move away once the fight becomes tougher? Or would the focus shift to cases of little importance, when members of the present government, from the SLFP, may have to be brought in once a serious judicial process begins? These are issues the government, both UNP and SLFP, will have to give serious consideration to, if the fight against corruption is to move forward strongly, with Ravi Karunanayake and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe out of the way.
It is now the task of UNP MPs who displayed eagerness to get back the image of Good Governance rapidly leaving this government, to move with more determination in the major fight that remains, end ensure it is not confined to catchy media headlines.
Political memory slip
The battle for control of the SLFP between President Sirisena and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR) has taken many forms, from rival May Day rallies to membership drives, and the powers of office against oppositional thrusts. As the rivalry gets stronger with the UNP-SLFP coalition moving to its third year and the dual full-moon power capture promise of MR losing belief, there is a new move to push unreality to the political fight of the Blue Flag wavers.
As the SLFP’s 66th anniversary celebrations approach, MR is using a new strategy to steady his leadership claims. The declaration he remains the SLFP leader, and there was no change in the position since he assumed leadership after winning the 2005 presidential poll. He is pushing aside all talk of his having invited Maithripala Sirisena (MS) to take over the party leadership, after the latter’s winning in the January 2015 as the Common Candidate, when he challenged and defeated the then SLFP leader.
An attempt is made to push all the news and reports on how this change took place into the dustbin of recent political history, with the claim that MR never gave up the leadership and never invited MS to the position of SLFP leader.
Memory slips are not strange in politics, but when it involves such serious issues, and in a matter that has both legal and official recordings, such a “slip” can mean much more. It is either proof of complete forgetfulness, more than a question of a memory lapse, or strategic forgetfulness that can be crookedly political. It is interesting that this “memory slip” comes from the politician who manipulated parliament to pass the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, to virtually make him a lifelong president of this country. What he is now trying is to push a lifelong SLFP leadership claim, without any amendment to the party rules, but wholly dependent on his memory.
MR could well have forgotten the invitation he extended to MS to take over the party leadership amidst the turbulent politics following his defeat in January 2015. Such a memory lapse is not strange in a politician who would like to wish away memories of the bad and corrupt government that he presided over for many years. But, he cannot or should not expect the SLFP members and the public with political interests to forget he change in the rules of the SLFP that was proposed by him after the 2005 presidential victory.
Just for the record, the party president at the time was Mrs. Chandrika Kumaratunga, who had ended her two terms as the country’s president. It was MR who proposed a change to the leadership rules, to ensure his leadership of the party. It was thus decided that any member of the SLFP who is elected president of the country, shall be the president of the party, as long as one holds that national office. The party politics was thus linked to national politics. This enabled MR to remain the unchallenged leader of the SLFP till the victory of MS on January 08, 2015.
But the January 8 decision by the people to defeat MR and elect MS to the Office of President, gave the full benefit of that amendment of party leadership rules to his rival in that election. The people of the country, the voters, decided who the new leader of the SLFP would be, on the very rule adopted to serve the politics of Mahinda Rajapaksa; a political slip much bigger than any memory slips of today.
