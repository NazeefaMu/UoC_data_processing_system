Stronger ties with India as EU gives OK to Sri Lanka

This week began with that massive strike by employees of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation with signs of a dangerous extension that would threaten the entire country. It was against what was believed was a ‘sell out’ of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm to India. The strike was settled the same day with the assurance given by the Prime Minister that there was no plan to sell the Trinco Tank Farm to India, as stated by the trade unions, and the assurance that negotiations would be held with India in a cooperative effort to develop this British-built tank farm, that is a valuable asset of the country.
The strike took place the same day as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was to go on a State visit to India, where discussions with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and other Indian leaders, would involve this tank farm, along with other matters of interest to both India and Sri Lanka. In the event, Sri Lanka and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding on economic co-operation in the presence of Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Ranil Wickremesinghe on Wednesday. As reported this MoU makes important proposals for Indian investment in the development of the port and oil tank farm in Trincomalee, the setting up a 500 MW LNG power plant and terminal also in Trincomalee, and Indian participation in highway and railway development projects in the North and East of Sri Lanka.
Currently, 14 of the oil tanks in Trincomalee are leased out to the Indian Oil Company (IOC) a Government of India enterprise. The new proposal is to develop 75 of the balance tanks as a Joint Venture between India and Sri Lanka, and the balance 10 tanks to be developed by the Sri Lanka’s CPC.
There is no doubt that India is very much interested in this Trincomalee Oil Tank Project as well as the LNG Power Plant with the impact these will have on important aspects of the Sri Lankan economy and development, especially in view of the close economic relations that Sri Lanka is developing with China, mainly in the South of the country with the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport, two hugely costly projects as well as the Port City project in Colombo. Interestingly, the Joint Opposition has tried to make political capital of this aspect of Sino-Indian relations by Sri Lanka, as an aspect of selling national assets to foreign powers. At a recent meeting with the media the JO even urged the government to re-examine the India – US partnership to challenge the growing influence of China. These JO alarmists seem to be unaware of the new policies vis-à-vis India that are emerging from the Trump Presidency in the USA, that is raising questions about the India-US partnership built during the Obama administration.
The Government was successful in overcoming the danger of the strike in the petroleum sector being extended and moved ahead to the MoU with India, which covers the areas that were concerns for trade unions in the petroleum sector. It must now take more interest in keeping the trade unions and the public better informed of its policies in key sectors of the economy, and take timely measures to prevent breakdown due to wrongly informed trade unions.
Brussels success

Sri Lanka had a major success at Brussels this week when the European Parliament defeated a motion that sought deny the GSP plus facility to the country, in a special motion placed before the parliament citing the slow pace of reforms regarding human rights, labour relations, and other issues that are important for the European Union’s economic support and related concessions.
The vote on the resolution that was placed by a group of EU parliamentarians, supported by some Human Rights organisations and sections of the Tamil Diaspora, saw it being defeated with 436 against it, 119 in favour, and 22 abstentions. The resolution took up the position that Sri Lanka was too slow in carrying out the reforms necessary for reconciliation and better human rights in the country.
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva was active in lobbying EU parliamentarians and explaining the actual situation in Sri Lanka on the disputed issues, and urging that the resolution be defeated, thereby bringing Sri Lanka closer to restoration of the GSP Plus facilities, which were lost during the Rajapaksa Regime.
It was in 2010, that Sri Lanka lost the GP Plus trade scheme giving preferential access to the 27 nation European nation bloc. This followed an EU probe, after the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, finding Sri Lanka in breach of human rights laws, largely to do with the war with the Tamil Tigers. The then Sri Lankan government saw the EU review as politically motivated, and backed by Tamil Diaspora elements resident and active in Europe. It refused to give as written pledge to carry out certain reforms, which the EU demanded in exchange for GSP Plus.
Sri Lanka was then one of 16 countries with GSP Plus status and the EU its single largest trading partner. It is reported that garment exports, the country’s second largest foreign exchange earner at the time, had benefitted with 6 – 7 percent concessions. The value of benefits was then estimated at 100 million Euros (US $ 125.4 million). Losing GSP Plus made Sri Lankan exports more expensive and less competitive. The business sector believed the loss to the country could have been as much as 500 million Euros.
Had the motion against Sri Lanka been carried, it would have taken at least another ten months for the GSP Plus concession for Sri Lanka to be reconsidered. The success in the EU Parliament this Thursday has been a major achievement for Sri Lanka and an eagerly awaited support, after the actions taken to restore democracy, support and strengthen human rights, act on issues of missing persons and other aspects of reconciliation and peace building that have been initiated in the past two years.
May Day politics
The May Day events next Monday are the substance of local politics, with the coalition ‘national unity’ government seeking to show its strength, especially to the opposition led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. The May Day activities take place with Mahinda Rajapaksa repeating that the unity government will not last two months after May Day. The crowds at the rival May Day rallies at Getambe – Kandy (SLFP), Campbell Park - Colombo (UNP) and Galle Face Green (JO and SLPP), will be the show pieces of the competition, with all sides making loud boasts of the certainty to have the largest crowd.
Midst this three-sided rivalry is the division within the SLFP, with the official party being under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and its rival section led by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. The real competition for people will be between the SLFP rally at Getambe and the JO rally at Galle Face.
The big issue in this crowd competition is the removal of key SLFP Central Province organisers who are clearly on the MR side of the party. Those removed were UPFA MPs Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, Lohan Ratwatte and PC member Anura Widanagamage. Two of these have old family connections to the SLFP, with Janaka Bandara Tennakoon being the son of the late T.B. Tennakoon, one of the strongest rural leaders of the party for many years. The other, Lohan Ratwatte, is the son of the late Gen Anuruddha Ratwatte, a Cabinet Minister and strong leader of the party’s Central Province section, who also gave the lead to the military in the battle against the LTTE in Jaffna, during the leadership of Chandrika Kumaratunga. The Joint Opposition states the removal of Janaka Bandara Tennakoon is a sign of the SLFP’s breakup in the present political situation, and sees these moves by the party leader President Sirisena as paving the way for the inevitable breakup of the SLFP. They are silent on Janaka Bandara’s dual role, amidst plenty of tears, on the about to cross over situation in December 2014.
As the SLFP moves to a crucial stage on the question of party unity, there is also the strong disciplinary action that has been proposed for those who do not accept the party’s invitation to come to the May Day Rally at Getambe. One will recall that similar threats of disciplinary action did not materialize at previous events such as the May Day last year. But, the signs are that disciplinary action is most likely to follow after this May Day events, paving the way for the full emergence of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) as the new political party of the Rajapaksas. Yet, many uncertainties remain. We will be watching another May Day of major political importance in the country.
