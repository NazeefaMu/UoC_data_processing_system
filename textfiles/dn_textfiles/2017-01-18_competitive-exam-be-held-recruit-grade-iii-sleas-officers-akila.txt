Competitive exam to be held to recruit Grade III SLEAS officers: Akila

The Open Competitive Examination to recruit Grade III officers to the Sri Lanka Education Administration Service will be held annually from this year, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
“By holding a proper and transparent open competitive examination, the government has discontinued the earlier practice of recruiting Sri Lanka Education Administration Service (SLEAS) officers on political backgrounds and personal contacts. As a result of not holding recruitment examinations, qualified persons could not enter the SLEAS during the last regime,” he said.
The minister was addressing an event to hand over appointment letters to 198 new officers to the SLEAS at the BMICH on Monday. The officers were selected on the result of open competitive examination held in 2016.
The minister said capable and suitable persons can enter the SLEAS under this government since proper recruitment mechanism is now underway annually unlike during the last regime.
The new officers will undergo one-year training prior to their appointment as Assistant Education Directors, and Subject Directors at Zonal Education Offices and as principals and deputy principals at national schools.
