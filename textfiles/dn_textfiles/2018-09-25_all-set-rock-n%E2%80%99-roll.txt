All set to rock n’ roll

Breaking out of the shackles, and doing it the way they love, is what the band Dispute is all about. Melodies speaks to Chamil Ekanayake of Dispute about their Death n’ Roll music.
Their music addresses some of the questions that people in power are uncomfortable about. They raise issues that directly deal with the unfairness in society.
Wikipedia defines Death n roll as the subgenre of death metal music that incorporates hard rock-inspired elements to the overall sound with elements reminiscent of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.
“Our music is Rock n’Roll, and we do it for the love for it. Specifically the way it make us want to get out of the oppression that we experience every day in Sri Lanka. This oppression is in the society and in the capitalist way of living. This consumerist world is destroying our livelihood and the earth itself. It is the unfairness in Sri Lanka we want to highlight. How the rulers and certain elites are destroying the country and its people with their extreme ways of keeping us in control,” said Ekanayake
“Our music has a Metal Punk and Crust kind of a sound. We would like to call it Death ‘n Roll. We love rock and roll and metal. We started this because the three of us liked this crust scene and we were the only ones into it. So we just wanted to play some awesome rock n roll and crust. But lyrically we talk about social issues a lot. Because the whole country is going in to chaos and destruction. And what better way to talk about it, than by playing some heavy music!” explained Ekanayake.
The band are very much focused on putting out some thrash and some heavy metal covers. Maybe some punk as well.
“We released a demo few years back. But we have remade some of those songs. And that demo gave us a lot of success. More than what we expected. That made us make new songs. And one of them is called ‘Beera Beela’. It’s a pure metal punk song in Sinhala and it’s about drinking beer,” added Ekanayake.
Their message is very simple. It is about enjoying the journey in life and basically do what you love and you will never be too old to rock n roll!
“We started Dispute a few years back and the only obstacle was life and work itself such as finding the time and the money to do this. We would like to thank everyone and also all of you who piss us off!” joked Ekanayake
Dispute just want to keep on making music and maybe do some tours. Record and tour basically. Like all rock bands it is the power of their music that really propels them to go forward and keep on doing with what they do. It is all about drive and force.
Lemmy Kilmister is one of the band’s inspirations. According to reliable sources Lemmy was well known for his hard-living lifestyle, chain smoking, and regular consumption of alcohol. Lemmy came up through life the hard way, but Lemmy was tough and had talent, and had what it took to succeed. He played from 1975–2015 with the band Motorhead. It is common knowledge that the band's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits. Motorhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Lemmy’s body and spirit took a beating because of the lifestyle he led. In December 2000, he was hospitalized in Italy with flu, exhaustion and a lung infection.
He was hospitalized with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005. On 28 December 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, Lemmy died at his apartment in Los Angeles from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure.
“One line in a song that describes their journey so far is - Born to lose, kill mister, live to win kill mister and our favorite artiste is Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead who died in 2015. Lemmy is the greatest rock and roll and metal icon that ever lived. If you take the songs made by us, one of our songs that mean the most to us is ‘Beera Beela’. Coz beer is awesome and best thing that you can drink in this hot weather,” pointed out Ekanayake
The best part of their music is being a part of the whole Asian music underground scene. Some of them have played in Thailand and in India to amazing crowds.
