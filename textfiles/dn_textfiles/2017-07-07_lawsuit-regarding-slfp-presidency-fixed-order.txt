Lawsuit regarding SLFP presidency fixed for order

 
The Colombo District Court set August 3 to deliver its order regarding the preliminary objections raised against a lawsuit that sought an order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Chairman of the party once again, today.
 The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary through his counsel had raised objections citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case.
 This lawsuit was filed by two Plaintiffs K.D. Aruna Priyasantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath citing SLFP General Secretary and Election Commission Chairman as defendants.
 The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC on or around January 16, 2015 over the appointment of a new Chairman to the SLFP.
 The plaintiffs further alleged that the executive committee of the party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.
