WP Governor’s Office shifted

Western Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara has decided to shift the Governor’s Office from the 5th Floor of Rotunda Tower, Rotunda Gardens, Colombo 3, to a government building due to excessive rent. The new Governor’s Office is located at 10th Floor, Janajaya Medura. It belongs to the Kotte Municipal Council.
The Governor said it is futile to maintain the office in a private building paying an excessive rent. Therefore, it was decided to permanently maintain the office in a government building. The Governor had wanted stop the waste of public funds.
The new building is still under construction although it is open to the public for official purposes from today.
