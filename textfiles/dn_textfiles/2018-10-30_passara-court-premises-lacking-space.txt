Passara court premises lacking space

The litigants attending the Passara Magistrate’s Court said the space at the court premises is not enough since a part of the premises had been acquired for the Badulla-Chenkaladi main road expanding project.
They said even before the land was acquired, the litigants remained there with difficulty due to limited space. They are of the view that the government should provide or construct a building with ample space for a Magistrate’s Court.
According to them, the building had been constructed during the British rule and although the space was enough then, it is now too small for today's requirements.
