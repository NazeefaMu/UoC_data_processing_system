Launching of National Census Report on Early Childhood Development Centers

Early Childhood Development (ECD) is the centre point of Human Development. In Sri Lanka, the period from conception to 5 years of age is considered as the Early Childhood. In Sri Lankan context, the Early Childhood services can be categorized into two junctures; the first category of services are centred around the Child’s Home where the child is provided with protection and shelter by parents during 0 – 3 years of age and the second category of services are based around Early Childhood Development Centers for Children aged 3 – 5 years.
Investments made in developing Early Childhood contribute to the progression of Human Capital in two main forms. The first is building a sound foundation for primary education, and the second is creating fulfilled citizens and advancing human resource of the country through eradication of disparities in education opportunities by providing standard facilities for children from low-income backgrounds from very early stages in their lives.
Based on the gaps identified by the 2014 study on the importance of Early Childhood sector and the Early Childhood Development context of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan government with financial support and in agreement with the World Bank, Initiated the Early Childhood Development project in 2016 to upscale the quality and making Early Childhood services easily accessible for everyone.
Key objectives
The project is being implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and is planned to run through a 5 years’ time period. Non-existence of similar large-scale projects for ECD in whole South Asia places our Sri Lankan project in a special spot. This has become a great opportunity for the betterment and upscaling of the Early Childhood sector of the country.
The key objectives of the project are to upscale the quality of existing ECD services and making them easily and equally accessible for everyone. Quality management, expansion of available ECD facilities, provision of learning and teaching materials, training of ECD teachers and teaching assistants, Training of Trainers, and ECD Centers’ based health and nutrition programmes are currently implemented and ongoing under the project, explained the Project Director Dr. Ravi Nanayakkara.
Pre-school/Montessori children aged between 3-5 years and children aged between 0-5 years from the estate sector daycare centres are the direct beneficiaries of the project. The indirect beneficiaries include ECD teachers and teaching assistants, teacher trainers, ECD administrators, the ECD Centers supported by the project and the families of the children attached to these centres.
When implementing a national level, large-scale project; availability of up to date, reliable information on the relevant subject field is a necessity that cannot be overlooked. At the inception of the project, the only available accredited data on ECD Centers of Sri Lanka was from a 2010 Survey, and thus in 2016, the project had to kick off by conducting a national census of island-wide ECD Centers and Pre-schools. The project activities are based on the primary data derived from this census.
If Early Childhood Development is to progress as a discipline, it’s essential to identify the contradictions prevalence within the sector and come up with suitable remedies to address them. The census provided a mirror to the practical challenges of the ECD sector in Sri Lanka is facing and highlighted its problematic areas. The utmost importance of equally developing spiritual attributes along with physical attributes of development was among the mostly highlighted factors.
Future leaders
There are several central objectives of the national ECD Census conducted; to gain a clear understanding of the ECD sector in Sri Lanka, to elevate the admissions of children to ECD Centers, enhance the service quality of island-wide ECD Centers, and distribution of human resources for easy accessibility of everyone.
Using the main data gathered through the census on ECD Centers, a database is established. A wide range of information and data such as the district and provincial wise distribution of ECD Centers, variations among the centres, their administrative structures, ownership, registration details, resources contribution, the drinking water hygiene, and health facilities etc. have been collected through the census along with sound understanding of the current learning and teaching environment of the ECD Centers. Based on the national database information, the physical, and psychosocial human needs and facilities for early childhood aged children can be advanced productively.
In this process, the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs lead by Minister, ECD Project Team, Children’s Secretariat, Department of Census and Statistics and the World Bank worked together hand in hand.
The commitment and support of the team of over 600 government officials (ECD officers/Child Rights Development Officers, Census Officers) at divisional, district and provincial level lead by the officials of Department of Census and Statistics were core in making this process a success. On this day of launching the National Census report making all that effort behind this process count, the key aspiration of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs along with the ECD Project Team is to see all stakeholders involved in the Early Childhood Development sector making productive use of these data available in the database to enhance and elevate ECD discipline through their work.
The national responsibility of paving the way for the buddying little future leaders of tomorrow is now opened.
Invest in the future of our little daughters and sons prior to anything else. Invest wisely, and invest in all children. Do it because it’s an unmeasurable investment for the future.
