Singer Priyani’s husband was abusive

The husband of late singer Priyani Jayasinghe was arrested by the Panadura Police on Sunday, for allegedly murdering her.
The 51-year-old singer was stabbed with a scissor and killed in her home. According to the police, there were eight stab wounds, including injuries to the front and back of her neck and chest.
The suspect, Prabath Rasika (50) is employed in the cushion works industry.
Priyani was living with her younger son, his wife and infant, while her older son is studying in Japan. Her younger son lives in Kuda Arukgoda, Alubomulla, Panadura.
Priyani had obtained a restraining order against her abusive husband and it had expired on Saturday (7). The incident occurred around 8.30 pm when she had been at her residence. She was in her room and her daughter-in-law had also been in the house, while her son had gone to the shop.
The suspect had stabbed her and fled the scene.
According to the police, the daughter-in-law had heard her scream and had run to get help from the neighbour. When she had arrived and looked into the room, Priyani had been lying on the bed in a pool of blood with several stab wounds. She was holding onto her two-month-old grandchild.
The daughter-in-law had contacted her son and he returned home and rushed her to hospital, but she had succumbed to her injuries on the way. One part of the scissor that was used for the killing had been left behind by the suspect near the room door.
Panadura Acting Magistrate Sunethra Fernando conducted the magisterial inquiry and the postmortem examination is due to be held at the Panadura hospital.
Further investigations are being carried out by the Panadura Police.
