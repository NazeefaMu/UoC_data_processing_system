“La Di Da 2018” fashion extravaganza begins today

A fashion extravaganza titled “La Di Da 2018” curated by Deepa Madan and Kavitha Pandian, will be held today and tomorrow from 11 am to 9 pm at the Cinnamon Lakeside, at Earls Court.
The stylish exhibition will have Indian designers showcasing their exclusive collection for Sri Lanka and most of them are here in Sri Lanka for the first time.
An exclusive preview sale will be held today. The exhibition will showcase fashion clothing, designer wear, western wear, festive collection, bridal wear and bespoke fashion from India.
The organizers of the event said they chose Colombo as their first international destination because of its mixed ethnicity and easy accessibility for their upcoming designers from India.
“We understand the cosmopolitan crowd ratio is comparatively higher in Colombo, and they are more exposed to international brands.
“Colombo has great vibes for the latest trends and fashion,” the Organizers said in a media communiqué.
“The collection that will be showcased at “La Di Da 2018” has been created exclusively for Sri Lanka keeping in mind the fashion statements and style preferences that people like to wear and adorn,” the Organizers added.
The event is being promoted by top South Indian celebrities and actresses Andrea, Anjali, Bindu Madhavi, Gayathri, Aishwarya and Ace Music Director Devi Sri Prasad and Actor/Politician Arun Pandian. The event will feature 15 designers representing five top categories. “This is going to be a lot of head over heels fashion extravaganza,” the Organizers noted.
