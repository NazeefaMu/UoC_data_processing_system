Sugar tax increase will help reduce consumption: Rajitha

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said that the increase in tax on sugar will help reduce sugar consumption in the country.
“I stressed the need for increasing tax on sugar in 2015 with an objective of controlling Non communicable Diseases,”he said.
Senaratne added that he still believes that tax on products that consist of fat, salt and sugar should be increased to control NCDs.
Minister Senaratne was speaking at a ceremont to distribute dry rations at Aluthgama yesterday.
The Minister said that he requested the government to increase the tax on sugar as 70 per cent of patients seeking treatment at government hospitals die of NCDs.
