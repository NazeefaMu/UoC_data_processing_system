Sri Lanka Judges' Institute launches wide-ranging online database

The Sri Lanka Judges’ Institute launched a new, wide-ranging online legal database last night.
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Priyasath Dep, Minister of Justice Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and Attorney General Jayantha Chandrasiri Jayasuriya were at the Judges’ Institute to mark the event. The database is restricted to judges and permits access to reported and unreported judgements of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Courts of Sri Lanka. Judges could also view Acts and Ordinances, cases, circulars, journals and gazettes.
According to website developers, over 10,000 cases had been uploaded to the site, while more are coming. They also said the service would help judges practising in rural areas access to the most up-to-date case laws.
The project was completed with funding from the Sri Lanka Ministry of Justice and USAID.
