SLMA provides drinking water for Aragoda families

The Sri Lanka Malay Association (SLMA), in partnership with the Families Relief Sri Lanka Trust, implemented a project titled Water for Life to provide a source of clean drinking water for residents of Aragoda in Anamaduwa, recently.
The programme was carried out following a request made by Monnekulame Sri Priyarathnarama Wiharasthanaya Incumbent Ven. Pankaduwe Gnanakithi Thera, who pointed out that families had to trek for miles to obtain drinking water and were often exploited by private parties who bottle and sell water at high prices. Under the project, a tube well was dug and a water pump, storage and dispensing system was installed in the village to provide clean drinking water to its residents. Ven. Pankaduwe Gnanakithi Thera and SLMA President Taslim Rahaman,unveiled the system.
Rahaman said that the SLMA was pleased to ease the burden of families in Aragoda, adding that they would continue to lend a hand to Sri Lankans who were in need.
