Point of view
Negative sentiment continued to cloud domestic equities, with equity markets losing steam for the 4th consecutive week as the benchmark ASPI lost ~74 points WoW (cf. ~98 point decline the previous week and the ~3 point loss the week prior).
Institutional, HNI and Foreign interest which had been supporting Index gains over Q2’17 also waned this week, with crossings in three stocks (JKH, GLAS & NEST) accounting for just 30% of total market turnover. Heavy trading in JKH (crossings in JKH accounted for ~82% of total crossings and 25% of total market turnover) failed to stimulate markets and average turnover levels for the week consequently fell to LKR 0.45Bn, ~36% lower than last week’s average of LKR 0.70Bn.
Foreign inflows to the Bourse also slowed this week, with net foreign flows falling ~77% over the week to record a paltry LKR198Mn.
Compared to the 11.3% gain on the Index in Q2’17, markets have fallen ~3.8% in the first half of Q3’17, halving the YTD gain on the Index to 4.8% cf. the gain of 8.9% in the H1’17. Markets in the week ahead are likely to continue to take cues from the incoming corporate earnings releases while some pressure from profit taking is also likely.
IMF estimates gradual recovery in 2017 GDP
In its Country report released on Thursday, the IMF forecasted a gradual recovery in 2017 GDP (to 4.7%) citing continued momentum (since H2’16) in the Construction and Service sectors.
The Group noted that headline inflation levels are likely to remain over 5% while the current account deficit is expected to widen slightly to 2.5% (cf. 2.4% in 2016) amid drought-driven increases in oil and food imports, and higher capital goods imports1. The IMF noted though, that medium term growth is likely to reach 5.2%, in line with the country’s potential GDP.
The IMF highlighted however, that significant external and domestic downside risks exist, with further delays in revenue mobilization and SOE reforms, as well as pressures from the GoSL’s large gross financing needs remaining the main domestic risks1.
The possible resumption of capital outflows due to further strengthening of the USD, higher rates or a weaker external position meanwhile pose significant external downside risks. The Group further noted that risks to public debt sustainability continue to remain high with public debt expected to rise marginally to 85% of GDP in 2017 due to the continued large fiscal deficit and exchange rate depreciation.
