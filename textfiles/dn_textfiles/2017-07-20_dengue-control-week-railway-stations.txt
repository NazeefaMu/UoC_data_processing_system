Dengue Control Week at railway stations

Sri Lanka Railway Station Masters’ Association is holding a Dengue Control Week which started from July 16 until July 23, countrywide.
Accordingly, all railway stations will be cleaned to make the stations mosquito free. The programme was launched from Dematagoda Station under the patronage of Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
Sri Lanka Railway Department General Manager B.A.P.Ariyaratne told the Daily News that this programme is supported by passengers, schoolchildren, youth service club members, police community units, prison detainees and scouts. A total of 150,000 leaflets are to be distributed among train passengers and students this week to explain ways and means of preventing the spread of dengue mosquitoes.
Meanwhile, the Railway Department will take strict action against those loitering near railway lines, Railway Department Security Head Anura Premaratne said.
They will be arrested and produced before Courts to prevent tragic train accidents, he said.
“During the past six months, about 275 persons have died of train accidents countrywide. Among these accidents, some have committed suicide while others were knocked down by trains while they were taking selfies standing on railway lines carelessly,” Premaratne said.
