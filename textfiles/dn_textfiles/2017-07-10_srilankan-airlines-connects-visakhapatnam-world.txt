SriLankan Airlines connects  Visakhapatnam to the world

SriLankan Airlines, the largest foreign airline operating to India, commenced operations to Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, on July 7.
The airline will be offering a four-times-a-week service to Visakhapatnam connecting the state’s largest city and financial capital to the world through its global route network.
Known as the jewel of India’s east coast, Visakhapatnam is one of three cities in India that SriLankan is adding to its network within a nine-day period, together with Hyderabad on July 12 and Coimbatore on July 16.
This will bring SriLankan’s total operations in India to 126 weekly flights to 14 cities, with its existing operations to Chennai, Trichy, Trivandrum, Mumbai, New Delhi, Gaya, Madurai, Varanasi, Kochi, Bangalore and Kolkata.
SriLankan Airlines’ Chief Commercial Officer Siva Ramachandran said: “Travellers to and from Visakhapatnam can now enjoy SriLankan's award-winning hospitality onboard."
"This new destination addition to our network indeed reflects SriLankan Airlines' commitment in serving the Asian region, offering travellers seamless connectivity on board our brand new A320neo and A321neo aircraft.”
"Being the 12th destination to India by SriLankan, this new service would also allow travellers from Visakhapatnam to enjoy Sri Lanka’s many tourist attractions and experience for themselves the reasons why the island is fast becoming one of the most highly sought after tourism destinations in the world.”
The addition of Visakhapatnam, Hyderabad and Coimbatore will increase SriLankan’s global route network to 105 cities in 47 countries.
SriLankan would also offer all industries in Visakhapatnam, one of the fastest growing economic regions in India, enhanced opportunities for rapidly and seamlessly transport of all types of cargo throughout its network.
