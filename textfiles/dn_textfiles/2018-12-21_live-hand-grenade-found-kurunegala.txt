Live hand grenade found in Kurunegala

Kurunegala Police summoned the STF to inactivate a live hand grenade which they had found in the Badagamuwa Government Forest Reserve in Kurunegala on Wednesday.
The Police were informed by three women who noticed the weapon which was kept hidden under a mat while they were looking for jackfruit inside the forest reserve. The Police got the assistance from the STF officers as they identified the explosive was very reactive.
