UK warns its citizens about dengue in SL

The United Kingdom foreign travel advisory added a health warning over Sri Lanka and has cautioned its citizens travelling to Sri Lanka due to the escalation of the dengue epidemic.
“All regions of Sri Lanka experience outbreaks of the mosquito-borne dengue fever. 77,222 suspected cases of dengue fever have been reported between January and June 2017 compared to 55,150 cases reported for the year 2016. You should take steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes,” the report says.
Meanwhile several hoteliers and stakeholders of the industry in Sri Lanka also stated that there were many inquiries and also a few cancellations due to dengue.
They also say that the Sri Lanka Tourism should address this issue more professionally and state that dengue is not spread all over the country. They should identify the areas that are not affected and act accordingly.
