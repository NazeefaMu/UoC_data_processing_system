Changes based on elections results, a common feature - President

Effecting changes and restructuring government policies and activities in keeping with election results is not peculiar to Sri Lanka but, a common feature in all countries in the world,” President Maithripala Sirisena said.
“We all accept the need to act according to the message received from the recent Local Government elections and implement a new programme of work with new ideas and proposals by effecting reforms and changes relating to government activities, the President said.
President Sirisena was addressing the new Ministers and State and Deputy Ministers at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday.
The President said the verdict of the people shows the need to correct our wrongs, remedy the shortcomings and introduce required political reforms by changing state policies and activities.
“The Governments of our country as well as other countries make various decisions in keeping with the outcome of elections,” President Sirisena said.
“This instance shows the need to study the elections result and make the governments programme of work more attractive to the people. Accordingly, we need to effect changes in the Presidential Secretariat, Prime Minister’s office, Ministries, government departments and institutions and streamline work performed through new projects,” the President said.
“We should make the necessary dedication for the sake of the country. The country and its people take priority in our policies. We all accept the need to perform functions for the benefit of the country and its people more expeditiously and effectively,”he said.
“We need to find out the causes for the election setback and correct them,” the President added.
“Today’s Cabinet reshuffle deals with the Prime Minister’s party only. Reshuffle of the UPFA section would definitely be effected within the next two weeks”, the President added.
“Similarly, changes should be made to drive efficiency into State Corporations and Statutory Boards. Correct guidance was vital for it. I also hope to take decisions and steps needed in this direction too,”he added.
The President said he summoned Secretaries of Ministries last week and advised them to perform the duties of their institutions collectively in an efficient manner. The President said he would also request the newly appointed Ministers to summon progress review meetings of their Ministries and Institutions and drive efficiency into the services rendered to the people through annual allocation of funds.
The President said he would request them to expedite this work by convening meetings of District Development Committees and Regional Co-ordination Committees in their respective districts within this month.
“It was in this manner that these institutions would become active. This would also help to complete various programmes on target,” the President said.
