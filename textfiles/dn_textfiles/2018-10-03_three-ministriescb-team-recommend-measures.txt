Volatile global economic situation
Three Ministries,CB team  to recommend measures

If the Government wants to grant a salary increase for public servants, it must either increase revenue or cut other expenditure, Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy said.
The Governor was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Central Bank (CB) auditorium yesterday.
The journalist questioned on the proposal to further increase the public servants’ salaries through the upcoming budget.
He said that three ministries and a Central Bank team would work together to recommend the measures that need to be implemented in the short run to manage the impact on the country from the current volatile global economic situation.
He said this was agreed at a meeting on Monday. Accordingly, the Ministries of Finance and Mass Media, Development Strategies and International Trade and Trade and Commerce and a Central Bank team will recommend the proactive short term adjustments that need to be done.
“They will look at ways of increasing exports and tourism. They will focus on the low hanging fruits,” he added.
