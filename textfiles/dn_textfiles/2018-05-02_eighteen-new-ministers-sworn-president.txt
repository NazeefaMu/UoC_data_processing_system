The Cabinet reshuffle yesterday saw the reduction of the number of ministries to 42 as subject allocations to new Cabinet portfolios were made on a scientific basis.
Eighteen new Cabinet Ministers were sworn-in by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat in the presence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The remaining portfolios remain unchanged.
This was the second reshuffle of the Cabinet effected by the government since it took office in 2015.

Cultural Affairs was previously held by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
Minister Kabir Hashim who earlier held the post of Higher Education Minister was given Highways and Road Development.

Soysa’s Irrigation, Water Resources Management and former Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa’s Disaster Management was given to Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
Two portfolios which were held by the Ministers of the UPFA were given to the UNP.
The former SLFP Ministry of Social Welfare and Social Empowerment in the meantime has been split with Social Empowerment going to UNP Ministers P. Harrison and Social Welfare along with Primary Industries going to Minister Daya Gamage.
Further, the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations was given to UNP Minister Ravindra Samaraweera.
Samaraweera’s former post of Wildlife and Sustainable Development was given to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.

Minister Faiszer Musthapha who was appointed as Minister of Sports on a temporary basis earlier, will retain it along with his Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama took over the ministries of his former Cabinet colleagues Chandima Weerakkody, Susil Premajayantha and S.B. Dissanayake as the Minister of Science, Technology and Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Hill Country Heritage.

Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara in the meantime retained his previous portfolio as Law and Order and Public Administration and Management Minister.
“The reshuffle was done in a scientific manner by the collective decisions of the President and Prime Minister.
The accuracy of this scientific way will be proven when these portfolios are gazetted. The preparation of the gazette is almost complete,” stated Minister Maddumabandara speaking to the media after the event.
“This should be the final Cabinet reshuffle. We can now work towards the goal of developing the country together. There is a Unity Government at present and it will be so in the future too. Many issues crop up when two leading parties get together which is quite natural. But we have resolved those issues and have the ability to start a new journey together,” he added. Minister Sajith Premadasa who attended the event along with his other cabinet colleagues who have not had their positions changed noted, “It is unfair to judge the success of the reshuffle just minutes after it took place. We have a capable Cabinet and I’m sure that their excellence can be judged through the various policy implementations from today onwards. The decision making process that led to the Cabinet reshuffle was engineered and pioneered by the President and the Prime Minister. Both of them did it through consultation, compromise and discussion”. Minister of Lands and Parliamentary reforms Gayantha Karunathilake in the meantime said, “A reshuffle means to make the changes which did not happen in the past.
The reshuffle took place today on a scientific basis and the gazette would also confirm this. The success of the changes will be seen when the portfolios are gazetted. I believe that we can all look at this in a positive way”.
