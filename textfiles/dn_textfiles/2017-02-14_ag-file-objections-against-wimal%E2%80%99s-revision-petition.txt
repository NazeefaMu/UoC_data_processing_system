AG to file objections against Wimal’s revision petition

The Attorney General yesterday informed the Colombo High Court that the respondents including the OIC of the FCID and the Attorney General are expecting to file objections against the bail revision application filed by National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa. Accordingly, High Court Judge Wikum Kaluarachchi ordered the respondents to file their objections against the bail revision application on February 27.
Former Minister Weerawansa arrested and remanded for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government, had sought bail from the Colombo High Court through a bail revision application.
This bail revision application is to be taken up for support on February 27. Through this revision application, Weerawansa sought an order against the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court refusal to grant bail. The petitioner is seeking an order to release him on bail.
Weerawansa was arrested by the FCID on January 10 under Public Property Act charges. He was ordered to be further remanded till February 20 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
