ESOFT Metro Campus inks MoU with CSSL for NITC 2017

ESOFT Metro Campus, Sri Lanka’s largest private sector higher education network signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) recently regarding the upcoming National IT Conference (NITC) 2017 which will be held under the theme 'Towards Digital Prosperity'.
The MoU signing ceremony was held at the CSSL Secretariat and graced by top officials of both organisations including Dr. Dayan Rajapakse (Group Managing Director, ESOFT Group of Companies), Nishan Sembacuttiaratchy (CEO – ESOFT Metro Campus), Yasas V. Abeywickrama (President – CSSL) and Prabath S. Wickramarathne (Vice President – CSSL).
“ESOFT has been instrumental in transforming Sri Lanka’s ICT education space by making high quality and affordable ICT programmes available throughout the island. Therefore, I feel it is our national responsibility to create awareness and educate the public about the limitless opportunities available within the growing ICT industry. I am confident that our platform at NITC will help us to send this message.” said Dr. Rajapakse.
CSSL is the premier professional association for individuals and organisations leading the ICT industry in Sri Lanka. It is a rallying point for ICT professionals throughout the country and espouses the shared vision of over 50,000 individuals ranging from ICT practitioners, academics and policymakers to other professionals in diverse fields and members of the business community.
The NITC organised annually by the CSSL, is the flagship Information Communication Technology (ICT) conference held in Sri Lanka since 1982, involving ICT professionals, academia, technology experts, policymakers, entrepreneurs and private and public sector key decision makers both locally and internationally. It is the only national event which brings together the largest number of ICT professionals in Sri Lanka.
This year marks the 35th anniversary of NITC which will be run in partnership with the South East Asian Regional Computer Confederation (SEARCC) Conference as well as the General Assembly of International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) and thus, it is anticipated to be one of the most important global ICT events in 2017, and also Sri Lanka’s biggest-ever international ICT event.
With roots going back to the year 2000, ESOFT has grown to be the largest private sector higher education network in Sri Lanka due to an extensive islandwide branch network of 40 centres which create opportunities for over 30,000 students each year. Initially starting with IT, ESOFT today is a diversified education provider in the fields of ICT and Computing, Business, Engineering, Tourism and Hospitality, Personal and Professional Development, Corporate Training and Language Training.
In association with a number of strategic partners including Pearson (UK), London Metropolitan University (UK) and Kingston University (UK), ESOFT offers a range of internationally recognised qualifications ranging from diplomas to postgraduate programmes including MSc (IT) and MBA programmes.
