Frolicsome  school days

I was ten years old in 1950. I clearly remember a particular incident to this day of course with sadness, because the characters in the story have passed beyond the veil. My friends and I were studying in a prestigious Jaffna College, Vaddukoddai, funded and maintained by American Missionaries.
It was my favourite past time to visit my friend Thamo Thurairatnam, in the evenings, to play with him and his relations. My friend’s father had just returned from the States. A trip to the States was a rare occurrence in the fifties. His father had brought with him some very colourful running shorts, at a time when running shorts were worn only by athletes and that too, only while they were running or practising. But these running shorts were meant for casual wear and the lot of them came to play with me in those colourful running shorts, much envied by me, especially when the shorts had something called a ‘zip’, unheard of those days. They would zip it up and down just to show off!
We often played rounders, if the girls were around. One evening, when the girls were nowhere to be seen, all of us climbed a Mango tree, not to pluck fruits, but just for the fun of it. Each one of us was perched on a different branch of varying heights. The one who was on the highest branch was the late Selvan Wadsworth. He thought of playing a practical joke on Thamo, who was on a lower branch. What he did was to manipulate his loose running shorts, pass a few urine drops and then shout, ‘Adey Thamo, It s going to rain,’ while looking askance at the skies of passing white clouds. In that instant, Daya, Thamo’s younger brother, who was on a lower branch, shouted back, ‘Yes, yes, a few drops fell on my arm just now ‘displaying his arm as he did so!
I was the one who laughed out loud, because I had witnessed both Wadsworth in action and also Daya displaying his arm! The actual fact was never disclosed to them by Wadsworth. To this day, if somebody says in Tamil that it is going to rain, my mind goes back to the year 1950 , when it rained on Daya’s arm! Later on in life, he became such a dear friend of mine and I used to call him ‘Words worth less,’ which he took up with a smile!
Episode 2; The College where I studied was co-educational. For a long time, about a third of the students were girls, a good number of them being from upper and middle classes, some of them being strikingly good –looking. Since our College was a prestigious one, with a famous library, impressive buildings and producing excellent exam results, it served as a show –piece College and all the important visitors to the peninsula were taken to our College. To this College came a distinguished guest by name of Garret from Australia. While he was on stage, the Principal introduced him and he stood up and smiled at the audience of schoolboys and girls. When he smiled, it was followed by an automatic wink of the left eye. To us smaller boys, a wink at the other boy was a convenient and silent way of wishing him ‘Good Morning’ or just ‘Hi’. But to the bigger boys it meant something more. The assembly went on and the Principal was lavish in heaping accolades on Garret. He smiled for each of the compliments and each time it was followed by an automatic wink of the left eye. At first there were only some chuckles, but the chuckles became laughter after each and every accolade. The more he smiled, the more he winked and the laughter become louder and louder. The humour of it was that there were lots of pretty girls to wink at! Once he realized that his winks were the cause of the laughter, he stopped smiling and the winks came to an end.
I for one, felt sorry that the guy had come all the way from Australia to get humiliated like that.
The Principal was clueless as to the cause of the laughter and that way we escaped a shelling from him, a strict disciplinarian that he was! This episode happened in the early fifties and don’t be surprised, I still remember his face!
