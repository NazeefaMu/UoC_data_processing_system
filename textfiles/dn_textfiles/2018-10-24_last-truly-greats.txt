The last of  the truly greats

The announcement by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) that Rangana Herath will be retiring from Test cricket at the end of the first cricket Test between Sri Lanka and England at the Galle International Stadium next month brings to an end an era when the country produced international cricketers of such quality that they gave even the best cricketing nations a run for their money.
Herath belongs to an era when Sri Lanka’s cricket was beginning to bloom as a Test nation after they had won the Cricket World Cup for the only time in their history in 1996. The legendary left-arm spinner made his bow in Test cricket in 1999 against the Australian side led by Steve Waugh playing in the second Test of the historic Galle Stadium. He made an immediate impact capturing the wickets of Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Shane Warne and Damien Fleming for 97 runs reeling off 34.3 overs and providing an ideal foil to Muthiah Muralitharan who captured 5 for 71 off 38 overs. The Test ended in a draw with rain playing a major role.
But with part time spinners like Sanath Jayasuriya (left-arm), and Aravinda de Silva (off-spin) around Sri Lanka did not require a second spinner in their Test side to support Muralitharan and Herath found himself on the sidelines playing the odd Test whenever he was called upon to do so. This went on for the best part of a decade and it is to Herath’s credit that he did not get frustration get the better of him but continued to persist with his career by plying his trade in the domestic sphere.
The big break for him came in July 2009 when he was hastily summoned from England where he was playing for Moddershall CC in the Staffordshire League to replace Muralitharan who was injured and was not available for the first Test against Pakistan at Galle. Herath landed in Galle less than 24 hours before the Test match and spun Sri Lanka to an incredible win taking four wickets for 15 runs in 11.3 overs as Pakistan’s batting crumbled in dramatic fashion in the second innings from 71-2 to 117 all out chasing a target of 168. Herath was undoubtedly named the Man of the Match and it was no surprise that it was his first such award of his international career. He was to add ten more similar awards to his distinguished career in the next two decades where he went from strength to strength to establish himself as one of the modern day greats and take over the mantle as Sri Lanka’s match-winning bowler after Muralitharan.
Herath’s second match award came two years later at Kingsmead, Durban where he once again spun his country to a historic maiden Test triumph on South African soil with nine wickets in the match.
England should remember how Herath wreaked havoc with their batting at Galle the last time they toured Sri Lanka for a Test series in 2012. Herath took six wickets in each innings for a match bag of 12 to subject England to a 75-run defeat. Amongst Herath’s victims were skipper Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Jonathan Trott, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann and Samith Patel.
The England side of Joe Root is well prepared and is a better all-round side than they were six years ago. They may have plans of their own to combat the wily left-arm spin of Herath, but as all opposing batsmen have found out for themselves it is not an easy task against a past master who knows his trade like the back of his hand.
No doubt Herath will also be inspired by the fact that the Galle Test will not only be his swansong but he is also one wicket shy of reaching a century of Test wickets at this traditional venue – an achievement only performed by the great Muralitharan who also bid farewell to Test cricket at Galle eight years ago.
Although not a big turner of the ball like his predecessor Herath has his own strengths as a left-arm spinner relying on accuracy, the subtlety to vary his pace and flight, his ability to bowl long spells and a mystery ball thrown in for good measure – one that is quicker and darts back into the right-hander.
So no doubt with such an armoury at his disposal he retires as the greatest left-arm spinner the game has come to know having taken over the mantle in October last year by becoming the first bowler of his kind to cross the 400-wicket mark in Test cricket. Whatever laurels that come his way Herath, who has been a faithful servant of Sri Lanka cricket deserves every bit of it.
Thank you Rangana for the memories.
