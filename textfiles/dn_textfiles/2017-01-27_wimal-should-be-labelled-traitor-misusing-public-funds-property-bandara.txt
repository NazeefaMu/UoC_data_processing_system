Wimal should be labelled as traitor for misusing public funds, property: Bandara

Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa should be labelled as a traitor of the country for allegedly misusing public funds and property, Kurunegala district United National Party (UNP) Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said.
Speaking at a media briefing at Sirikota, the UNP headquarters yesterday, Bandara said: “Former Minister Wimal Weerawansa allegedly misused 90 state vehicles, Rs. 90,000,000 of public funds and also constructed high valued properties using government funds and sold for low prices to his family and relatives.”
Referring to the Joint Opposition meeting on January 27, he said: "United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena says that a crowd of around 500,000 will be present at the meeting. According to Survey Department information, only 80,000 persons can be accompanied in the 19,300 square metre area including the space available on the roads in the Nugegoda junction. We challenge them to bring at least 15,000 for the meeting." Bandara said Weerawansa should be punished for using the national flag inappropriately by displaying it on posters to satisfy his narrow political desires.
He said corruption was common in every government up to a certain extent. The Yahapalanaya regime will take action to minimise corruption as much as possible, Bandara added.
He said loan installments of most of the failed projects of the previous government started in 2015 and the heaviest debt burdens will have to be paid within this period.
Bandara said an internationally accepted vocational and training centre would be established in Kuliyapitiya to educate and provide training for youth regarding vehicle assembly and manufacturing.
