Japanese Government honours Prof Carlo

Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma conferred “The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon” upon Professor Carlo Fonseka, on behalf of the Japanese Emperor in recognition of Professor Fonseka’s significant contribution to the promotion of cultural exchange between Japan and Sri Lanka, at a special ceremony held on July 6 at the Ambassador’s residence in Colombo.
Professor Carlo Fonseka, one of the most famous medical doctors and a man of culture in Sri Lanka, was appointed as Co- Chairperson of the Committee of the Japan Sri Lanka Friendship “Cultural Awards” in 2010. His leadership and contribution to the Committee has enabled the “Cultural Awards” to strengthen its reputation as one of the most distinguished cultural award in Sri Lanka.
The Japan Sri Lanka Friendship “Cultural Awards” (known as Bunka Awards), established in 1993, aims to encourage and promote mid- career Sri Lankan artists with remarkable talents. The Bunka Awards is presented annually by the Japan Sri Lanka Friendship Cultural Fund and has helped many artists to develop their talents further. The long-sustained dedication by Professor Fonseka for the development of this Awards is highly appreciated.
The order conferred upon Professor Fonseka is the evidence of high appreciation and strong friendship by the government and the people of Japan.
