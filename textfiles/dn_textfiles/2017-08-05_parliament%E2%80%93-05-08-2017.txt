[Parliament– (05-08-2017)]

By not agreeing to LTTE’s Interim Self-Governing proposal:
Ranil Wickremesinghe gave away his political fortunes:Hakeem
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader and Minister Rauf Hakeem yesterday, told Parliament that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe gave away his political fortunes at two critical elections in 2004 and 2005, by choosing not to agree unconditionally to the Interim Self-Governing Authority proposed by the LTTE.
The minister came up with the revelation, joining in the felicitation debate to mark Prime Minister Wickremesinghe’s completion of 40 years’ in Parliament.
“Wickremesinghe is sometimes, unfairly criticized for many reasons. But I would wish to say something many people may have not known. If Wickremesinghe unconditionally agreed to the Interim Self-Governing Authority proposed by the LTTE, he would have been the President in 2005 and he would have won the Parliamentary Elections in 2004. I am one of those witnesses to the fact that he steadfastly refused to agree to pressure by even our facilitators to look at ISGA unconditionally and agree to some of those issues contained in the ISGA document,” the Minister Hakeem noted.
Hakeem hailed Prime Minister Wickremesinghe as “arguably the sharpest intellect in our contemporary political scene.” The minister also commended the Premier for standing steadfast for amity and harmony of all ethnic communities. “As a leader of a minority party, I am bold enough to say that only a very few lived to endure in amity and harmony with everyone in this country. Wickremesinghe is indeed an iconic leader,” he said.
Commending on “the patience and perseverance” of the Premier, the minister said Wickremesinghe is endowed with essential qualities, “to surmount the difficulties in steering the ship of Government.”
“Though some may see his human chemistry as somewhat wanting at times, which is unavoidable for any leader at the helm of power with all stress of day-to-day political pressures, even his worst enemies would notice one special trait in him. That is, whenever he speaks in Parliament, even in his most aggressive presentations, he is rarely seen as intimidating. That is an essential quality of a mature political leader which is quite unique to Wickremesinghe. He is undoubtedly one of our most gifted leaders,” he noted.
“High office sought him out not due to destiny, but for his quintessential quality of steadfast loyalty to his party and his policy consistency. When I talk of party loyalty, I would like to remind you particularly, the loyalty he showed President Premadasa when he faced the impeachment. Such qualities are the reasons why he was able to surmount all the vicissitudes of the political winds in this country and rise to the position of Prime Ministership on four occasions,” he remarked.
Hakeem also pointed out that Wickremesinghe constantly stood against racial disharmony in the country. “When the previous administration of which I was also unfortunately a Member, was blinded by the euphoria of a military victory and allowed xenophobic forces to raise their ugly head and create racial disharmony in the country, the Prime Minister from the Opposition Benches then steadfastly condemned such acts and insisted on bringing such forces to account. He did the same during the term of this Government, when these same forces were trying to disturb the hard-fought harmony among ethnicities,” he stated.
Observing that Wickremesinghe’s political trajectory was intrinsically embedded in the 1977 economic revolution, Hakeem pointed out that 1977 was a transformational year in the post-independence history of this country. “Unshackling a fully-insulated, centrally directed socialist economy and introducing a market-driven open economy, while having to retain the essential features of a welfare state, was a very difficult balancing act for any Head of State or Prime Minister. Coming into politics with President J. R. Jayewardene, who believed in market reform and free enterprise being the key driving forces to achieve economic growth and social advancement, our Prime Minister today, is following the social market economic principles,” he added.
Hakeem also reminding that he was the only one left in the House now who was part of the negotiating team with the LTTE back in 2002, said, “I will witness one thing. Several people sometimes find fault with him for having signed the Ceasefire Agreement with the LTTE.
Those who are pragmatic enough to understand the political situation then, with our International Airport being attacked by the LTTE, the new Government had few options, but to also look at the sentiments of the International Community,” he added.
