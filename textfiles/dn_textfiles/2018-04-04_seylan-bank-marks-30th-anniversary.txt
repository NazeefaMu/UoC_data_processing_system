Seylan Bank marks  30th anniversary

Empowering people & businesses for 30 years with innovative & convenient banking services, Seylan Bank has organised a series of island-wide religious observances to commemorate its 30 year anniversary. As a first initiative, a Pirith Pooja was held at the Bank’s headquarters to invoke blessings upon the staff, valued customers and other stakeholders of the Bank.
Established in 1987, Seylan Bank opened its doors for business on the 24th of March 1988, in Colombo Fort, Sri Lanka’s traditional banking district. From its very inception, the bank has lived up to its promise of being a ‘Bank with a Heart’ by revolutionizing banking services with its unique & innovative service offerings.
The meritorious ceremony was held with the participation of the Chairman of Seylan Bank Ravi Dias, Director/ CEO Kapila Ariyaratne, the Corporate Management and other members of the staff of the Bank.
