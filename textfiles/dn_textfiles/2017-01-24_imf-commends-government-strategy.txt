IMF commends  government strategy

Bid to create financial discipline hailed
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has commended the new strategy of Sri Lankan government to create financial discipline and lead the country in a correct path to economic development.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said she highly values the Sri Lankan Government’s dedication to take the country to economic prosperity when she met with the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Sri Lankan delegation at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland.
He said that the country had to face difficulties in achieving the expected economic growth, especially in the agriculture sector, as a result of the prevailing drought, the worst in fifteen years. “Climatic changes dent the economic progress of the island nation.”
Lagarde noted that the Sri Lankan government has exhibited a great deal of commitment in this regard. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lanka had to face unexpected challenges in carrying forward the operations to rejuvenate the island’s economy.
 
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that they were estimating the impact on the Sri Lankan economy following the prevailing drought.
