Do you believe in magic?

The magic of Christmas and the festive season made an early appearance at Sri Lanka's favourite department store with ODEL's annual Yuletide makeover transforming the Alexandra Place mansion in characteristically glamorous fashion.
'Do you believe in Magic?' - a question guaranteed to spark anticipation in young and old alike - is the theme for this year's festive makeover, fittingly brought alive by décor changes, exciting new products, seasonal features, special bank promotions and extended shopping hours as the countdown to Christmas begins.
For the fashion conscious, ODEL's Christmas 2015 offering features three distinctively different collections, setting the tone for what visitors to the flagship store at Alexandra Place, and to the rest of the stores in the iconic retail chain can buy this festive season.
The first of these new clothing collections themed 'Fancy Plumage' heralds the return of Gold baroque work, damask impressions, decorative border patterns, brocades, paisley plays, floral prints, jacquard weaves, lace and silk, crepe, satin and chiffon, in eye catching green, turquoise blue, dark blue and beige.
'Dark Romance' is the theme of the second collection which features creations emphasising romantic red roses, heavy beaded embellishments, floral embroidery and floral sequins, and fabrics such as Jacquard weaves, lace and shiny solid materials such as silk, crepe, satin, chiffon and velvet. The principal colours for the collection are black, shades of crimson and maroon.
The third collection for Christmas 2015 is inspired by the styles of the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic 'The Great Gatsby' and combines Silver and Gold embroidery, metallic embellishments, mosaic embroidery, stone and sequin work, applique fabrics, lace, lattice, mesh and shiny solid materials like silk, crepe, satin and chiffon in shades of extra white, gold, grey, beige, silver and black.
The arrival of these collections that mirror the latest fashion trends around the world, offer ODEL customers an opportunity to celebrate the Christmas season in befitting style and spirit.
Within the ODEL stores, seasonal décor that embodies the traditional symbols of Christmas has transformed the shopping spaces to an enchanting and elegant personification of the warmth and cheer of the festive season, as the retail chain prepares for yet another grand celebration of the Yuletide.
Evocative traditional décor such as Christmas trees, wreaths and stars dominate at Alexandra Place, but have been given a tweak with the use of metallic and diamanté materials to enhance their magical aura. A standout feature of the décor this year is the creation of chandeliers of varying sizes with wreaths and metallic star curtains that create a magical atmosphere, enhancing the golden arches and gold trimmed windows. The themes of the season are carried through the principal departments within the store, with each getting its own colour combination, in which Green, Blue, Gold and Black feature.
A series of exciting activities and other surprises are planned for shoppers at designated sections of the store to complement the special seasonal enhancements. The store will be filled with new and exciting offers of clothing, accessories and special gift items that will continue to hit the shelves from the launch date to Christmas day. A special Gift Guide has also been featured in the Christmas edition of ODEL's magazine, which is freely available to all shoppers who visit the stores. This provides wonderful gift ideas for family and loved ones, adding that special sparkle to make it a truly magical Christmas.
As in previous years, visitors to ODEL will have all the traditional requirements they have come to expect, from gift vouchers and exclusive hampers, a host of gastronomic seasonal specialties and a Home Department overflowing with Christmas décor. For children, Santa Claus will make his rounds at Alexandra Place from December 19 to the 24, providing them an opportunity to take their selfies with him.
When seasonal shopping gets into full swing ODEL's Alexandra Place store will stay open till 10pm and 11pm on certain days between December 11 and 24 and on December 30.
