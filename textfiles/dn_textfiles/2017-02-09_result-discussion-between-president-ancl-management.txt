Result of discussion between President, ANCL management

Committee appointed to recommend improvements for Lake House:
Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said that the appointment of a four member committee to look into improvements within Lake House was a result of the President previously having met with the Lake House Management to discuss various problems within the institution.
“They had discussed the problems when they met at Parliament earlier and the President pointed out certain issues to them.
Thus a independent committee has been now been appointed to look into staff and financial issues as well as ways in which it could be improved,” Karunathilake said.
The President on Tuesday appointed a four member committee chaired by retired Supreme Court judge Nimal Dissanayake to assess the shortcomings and report on possible improvements for Lake House and its publications. They are expected to produce their findings to the President in three month’s time.
