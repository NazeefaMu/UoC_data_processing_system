Security net tightened during New Year festival

A tight security net will be thrown around fifteen Police stations in the Tangalle Police Division to protect the people during the new year festival season according to Tangalle Senior Superintendent of Police Dhanapala Abeywickrama.
The SSP said that at least seven patrol units will be deployed in each Police division, while vehicular traffic would be searched extensively. He said that traffic barriers would be set up whenever the necessity arises.
The SSP said that Police officials in civil clothes will be deployed in locations where people move about freely in large numbers. The SSP requested private sector and state sector institutions and banks to make a request to the relevant OIC of the Police station in the area if they require police protection. The SSP said that although police protection would be provided to the people, they must be vigilant.
