Solar panels for one million households

The solar energy war launched by the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry will transform the roofs of one million houses into solar power panels, Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He said the ministry has adopted several strategies to encourage erecting solar energy panels in households. Solar energy panels have also been provided to temples. Cabinet approval has been obtained to erect solar energy panels on roofs of all state institutions.
A solar energy panel will be erected at the Kegalle St. Josephi's Balika Vidyalaya too within the next two months.
Minister Siyambalapitiya was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for a technological laboratory building at the Kegalle St. Joseph's Balika Vidyalaya, recently.
He said Sri Lanka possessed an advanced system of education when compared to several other countries in Asia. However, the wide gap between education and job demand was a big problem faced by the country. Although 100,000 graduates found employment five years ago, a similar number of graduates were languishing without jobs today.
Seeking a state job should not be the end result of education. The introduction of technological education to schools was a good decision taken by the state as it will enable students to branch out into other fields after completing education.
This division also helped to curtail the demand to enter the so-called popular schools because technological laboratories were a facility restricted to less popular schools, he said.
