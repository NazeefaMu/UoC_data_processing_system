Myanmar tusker to be handed over  to Sri Dalada Maligawa

A tusker donated to Sri Lanka by Myanmar in response to a request made by President Maithripala Sirisena will be formally handed over to the Sri Dalada Maligawa authorities in Kandy by the President at a ceremony at the historic Magul Maduwa in the Sri Dalada Maligawa premises today.
The 20-year-old tusker is befitting to carry the Sacred Relics Casket at the Kandy Esala Perahera, Diyawadana Nilame Pradeep Nilanga Dela said. The tusker brought by ship from Myanmar disembarked from Trincomalee harbour and transported to Kandy is in good health, Pradeep Miyanapalawa, official in charge of the Maligawa elephant herd said.
Leading tusker of the Maligawa, ‘Ekadanthaya’ who usually carried the Relics Casket died several months ago. Subsequently, the Diyawadana Nilame appealed to the President to provide another tusker and Myanmar gifted this tusker following a proposal made by the President.
