President to open Sampur Hospital on May 20

The renovated Sampur Hospital and several newly constructed buildings in the Eastern Province are to be opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on May 20, said Provincial Health Minister A. L. M. Nazeer.
Nazeer told the Daily News that the Eastern Provincial Health Ministry took immediate steps to upgrade Sampur Hospital as a district hospital and to rectify its shortcomings by renovating and constructing new buildings.
“Sampur Hospital, cultural hall and beach park will be opened by the President. The hospital has only 23 staff and we have found quarters for patients, nurses and doctors. The people of Sampur had experienced immense hardships in seeking good medical service due to the lack of infrastructure facilities in the hospital. Therefore, the Provincial Ministry intervened and provided solutions for it,” said Nazeer.
In the future, the Provincial Ministry will take measures to further develop the hospital, he said. Provincial Health Minister A. L. M. Nazeer along with other officers visited the hospital and other places to oversee the progress of the development work.
