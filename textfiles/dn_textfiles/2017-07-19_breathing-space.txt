FOR A BREATHING SPACE

It is quite evident that Sri Lanka in particular and the rest of the world in general is passing through a supreme period of enjoying human rights in the annals of the recent history. We have good reasons to be proud of our human rights index because during the last bleak years we experienced bizarre violations of human safety due to many an intractable problems in the system fathered by ourselves using our own franchise under the misgivings of the so called intellectuals and political bogeymen’s coming.
Currently, it seems that the situation is ripe for us to discuss the status quo without fear or favour on behalf of the underprivileged lot or the underdog most frequently referred to by our red brigade leaders of the proletariat.
In discussing such matters, my mind spontaneously reverses to my own experience in 1971 in which year for the first time our paradise island raised war against the Queen in faraway England. The rest is history. It is said that history does not repeat in the same way. Let’s be optimistic.
Intelligentsia
The insurgency in 1971 created a very chaotic situation in the country and stirred the deep slumber of the politicians and the intelligentsia who had taken the people for a ride since gaining the nominal independence to realize their lofty dreams. My concern here is to say that I was embroiled in this saga and was finally greatly benefited. The maiden socialist revolution of the country started on April 5 and the whole country came to a virtual standstill. I was fortunate to survive to tell the tall tale to you because of my common sense.
Even keeping the map of the country for school work was a punishable offence to be meted out with shooting. History is history even though many a leader tempted to define the situation for their own advantage. This was the year in which the writer had to sit for his G.C.E.[ADVANCED LEVEL] examination. All of us of the year had to be glued to the wireless to know about our fate regarding the examination and very poignantly some of our colleagues had to embrace death without any excuse for listening to the wireless, the only means of communication of the period.
During that time the G.C.E [A/L] examination was held in April. Under prevalent situation, the examination was put off to be held in August.
I had a ghost of a chance, I took up the cudgels with renewed interest to pass the exam to secure my seat at the university. I left no stone unturned to come off with flying colours and I did succeed. Not only that when I was selected to the university I had the good fortune to enjoy another luck by chance.
The university aspirants were given an opportunity to enter the university for their academic year after five years. In any academic year one could seek admission. As I was a poor young man I had to shoulder some responsibility to help my parents to keep the home fires burning.
This little prodigy exploited all the benefits to the fullest and saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Ever since my poor parents didn’t want to sing for their supper and family happiness gathered momentum. I thanked the relevant authorities for giving me the breathing space to achieve my target in life.
Forgive me for digressing your attention to some of the past events in my life, yet I believe it would be useful to someone like me, and based on these authentic experiences I earnestly plead mercy for a breathing space for the innocent children of the flood stricken ares who are undergoing a similar ordeal that I faced during that juncture.
Flood stricken
The then relevant authorities were sympathetic enough to take the matters in the real spirit and did the needful. In this more awakened period of our history, I hope that the present leaders would be more empathetic , not sympathetic towards the children who are burning their midnight oil with a view to seek upward mobility through education. My plea would surely not stir the peace of the parents and the children of the areas where they were not affected by the flood havoc. So, they would feel it. Yet, the situation of the children whose houses were submerged to the rooftops and had to sleep on the tiles and the asbestos, some on the bare macadamized roads and even spending night after night on treetops with the fear of snakes coming to them is a tall tale to tell and talk. The whole country is looking forward to a reasonable remedy, not that of a cabinet reshuffle.
Time and tide wait for no man. This is the time to act. The rulers of a country could go an extra mile in these matters, yet some bureaucrats would not heed such reasonable solutions thinking that their offspring in comfortable schools would stir their mind and fail the examination. The whole red tape would prevent taking timely decisions and we should not repent later for not doing the needful in the nick of time.
Even at the time of this article is being written, the great lady in England is trying to buy breathing space to form a hung parliament.
The newly appointed ministers may be enjoying a breathing space to convert themselves to unfamiliar portfolios to begin work after the assumption of duties. A breathing space is commonly offered to the needy in other countries depending on the prevalent situations. Even in ‘SENSE AND SENSIBILITY’ by JANE AUSTEN Elinor allowed a breathing space to her sister Marrianse after WILLOUBY affair. If our authorities are full of sense and their hearts become a bit more sensible , I hope the students in the flood stricken areas would be able to sigh a sense of relief in due course. Let them be sanguine.
‘HOPE FOR THE BEST, PREPARE FOR THE BEST’
Thus reads the brief note written in my autograph by the emeritus professor Dr Tennyson Perera on the swan’s song of my four year university student career.
