Mother’s ultimate sacrifice for peace

“I lost two sons who joined the army to bring peace to this country within a month 11 years ago,” 60-year-old Pattiyagamage Malini pointing to the photographs of the two soldier sons she lost during the war, said.
Being inspired after listening to Radhika Hettiarachchi speaking about her project ‘her stories’ a first-hand study of the plight of mothers from the north and south and their strength in the face of adversity, their hopes for their children’s and Sri Lanka’s future, I visited P G Malini of Lolangara, Ratmale in the Dikwella Divisional Secretariat area of the Matara District.
The road leading to Malini’s house is called ‘Ranaviriu Abesiriwardena Mawatha’ in memory of Malini’s two sons, Sargent Ranjith Rasanka Abeysiriwardena and Lance Corporal Nuwan Budhdhika Abeysiriwardena of the Sri Lanka Army, who sacrificed their lives within a space of a month in Muhamalei and Mavilaru to bring peace to the nation.
“I was born in 1957 and married young. I am a mother of 10 children, five boys and five girls. Ranjith Rasanka (Raja) and Nuwan Buddika were the eldest among boys. It was Nuwan that I lost first. He was only 21 years old. Nuwan was born on February 19, 1985.
"He wanted to join the army like his elder brother and enlisted inh the 8th Gemunu Regiment on May 25, 2004 just after his 16th birthday," Malani recalled.
"I was devastated when I got the news that Nuwan was injured at Mavilaru on August 10, 2006 and died. His body was laid to rest on August 13 and his alms giving was held on August 17, 2006. Then I looked forward to the day of my eldest son completing his term of service. My hopes were shattered when I was informed of his death a few days later (September 9, 2006), she mourned.
"Ranjith or Raja as we used to call him was my eldest. He was born on October 4, 1975 and he enlisted in the 1st Wijayaba Regiment on March 16, 1994 at the age of 19. He served in the north until he died at the age of 30 in a terrorist attack at Muhamalai on September 9, 2006,” she said.
“Ranjith was building a house next to ours and was looking forward to getting married and settling down. I have some solace as I have many children but many mothers lost their only child in the mission to bring peace to the nation. It was with great difficulty and hardship that my husband Sumathipala Abeysiriwardena, who was employed with the Irrigation Department, and I
raised our children. We had to protect them during the 1988/89 uprising in the south.
I did not oppose when they asked me to join the army as it was to protect our nation. I have another son in the army at the moment,” she said.
"I pray every day that there never be another war in our country," she said.
