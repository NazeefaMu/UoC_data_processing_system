Milo to commemorate 25 years of School Rugby with Junior Rugby Carnival

The wait is finally over for budding ruggerites in Sri Lanka as Milo’s Junior Rugby Carnival kicks off. The carnival, jointly organised by the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association, the Ministry of Education and Milo, is one of the most anticipated events of the year by young rugby players. It is an extension of the brand’s 25th anniversary celebrations in supporting school rugby under the theme of 'Team Makes Me'. 250 Junior Rugby Matches will take place in parallel to the carnival, where 1,700 budding ruggerites from 80 schools across the country will compete for the ultimate Junior Rugby Championship title.
Through the event, Milo hopes to encourage children to be more physically active and promote good team spirit to children - sharing triumphs and disappointments together, teaching collective responsibility and encouraging friendships amongst teammates.
Said Vice President – Beverages for Nestlé Lanka, “There is no doubt that rugby is a physically challenging sport that can also be emotionally tough for children, particularly young ones.
Participating in an event of this magnitude at an early stage of life not only give kids the opportunity to enjoy competitive rugby, but also inculcates the values of good sportsmanship such as treating one another with respect and managing the emotions that come with the highs and lows of the game, which will benefit them throughout life.”
The carnival offers a host of activities for kids and their families. In line with Milo’s mission to inspire every Sri Lankan household to have a healthy breakfast, the event will commence with a Milo Breakfast segment to teach kids and their parents about the importance of breakfast and encourage them to have a healthy breakfast every day.
This will be followed by other fun and exciting events including a warm-up session – ‘Positive Energy Moves’ and a kids’ zone, that will include selfie booths and a range of physically challenging and mentally stimulating games for kids.
Milo is Nestlé’s leading chocolate malt beverage, fortified with vitamins and minerals.
It is made from fresh high quality milk collected from thousands of local farmers.
