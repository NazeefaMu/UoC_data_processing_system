Johnston’s Sathosa funds case
Court asked to summon Assistant Commissioner

Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rakshana Abeysuriya yesterday pleaded before Kurunegala High Court Judge Menaka Wijesundara to include the Kurunegala Assistant Election Commissioner as a witness in the former Minister Johnston Fernando’s case on the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million of Sathosa funds, when the case was taken up yesterday (02).
The Defence Counsels objected the plea by the prosecution stating that there was no need of involving politics into this case. The High Court Judge observed that the matter on issuing notice on the Kurunegala Assistant Election Commissioner would be discussed on a future date.
Notice had been issued on the Vice Chairman of the Kurunegala Mosque to give evidence yesterday.
Mohamed Haseem Mohamed Milan, who appeared to give evidence had no document to prove his position, so that evidence was not taken from him. Thushara Sampath Ruwan of Thorayaya, Kurunegala giving evidence said that he delivered commodities of the Sathosa under the second defendant of the case Shakeer Mohamed. He said he transported goods from the Yanthampalawa Sathosa branch to the private boutiques in Kurunegala Mahaveethiya and Gattuwana. He said he did not know the third defendant.
Twelve witnesses gave evidence before the Court. The Magistrate observing that evidence have to be taken from several other witnesses ordered to further remand the defendants. The hearing was postponed for today.
Former Lak Sathosa Chairman K. M. Fernando and former Minister’s Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer were also served with indictments for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
The three suspects are charged under the Public Property Act. According to the Court, Fernando as the Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs. 5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.
