Doctors thank President for tax reprieve

Four doctor organisations have sent a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena thanking him for intervening in solving the tax issue, which affects all professionals, and requested him to amend the new Inland Revenue Act, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the four associations which took part in the discussion with the President are the GMOA, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS), Independent Medical Specialists' Association and the University Medical Specialists' Association.
According to Dr. Aluthge, one of the main demands of the associations was imposing a maximum limit of 12 percent for the tax imposed on doctors and professionals. Establishing a system to maintain the transparency of the country’s expences was another demand.
During the discussion, the four organisations pointed out to the President the importance of facilities that should be given for professionals and not degrading them when formulating the tax policy, he said.
