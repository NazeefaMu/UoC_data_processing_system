Abortion Bill to be brought to Parliament soon

 
A Bill to legalize the termination of pregnancy on two specific occasions will be brought to Parliament soon, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
The two instances are if a female is made pregnant due to rape or if a foetus is diagnosed with Lethal Congenital Malformation.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo today he said the Cabinet paper had already received Cabinet approval.
“Once the law is enacted, the mothers will receive the opportunity to decide whether to abort the fetus or go ahead with the pregnancy,” Dr. Jayaratne said.
“The decision will be up to the mother. But the recommendation will be made by two consultants and it will be done only at a state hospital,” the doctor said.
