SC turns down TRC appeal over TRN network shutdown

The Supreme Court three-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep has turned down a Leave to Proceed application submitted by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), objecting to the establishing of a digital television broadcasting network by Television and Radio Network (TRN).
The television broadcasting station of TRN which operated the popular TV Lanka TV channel from the year 2000 in Sri Lanka and throughout the world, was closed down by the CID and the TRCSL officers in May 2012, alleging that TRN operated a digital broadcasting network without the authority of the TRCSL.
At the time of forcible shutdown of TRN’s TV station by CID and TRCSL, damaging equipment in the process, TRN had established a highly advanced version of DVB-T2 digital broadcasting technology, with H.264 / H.265 / HEVC encoding technology-based digital television broadcasting station. TRN had the capacity to broadcast 200 TV channels with DVB-T2/H.265/HEVC technology in this network. This was the first such operation in the whole of Asia.
When the matter was taken up at the Colombo Magistrate's Court in June 2012, then Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the CID to restore the television broadcasting station immediately to its original state, refusing the plea of TRCSL to continue the shutdown.
As the TRCSL was determined to closedown TRN operation, the frequencies assigned to TRN was cancelled by TRCSL in December 2012 and the request for extension of the frequency licence for the year 2013 was also refused by TRCSL.
TRN appealed against that purported action of TRCSL to the Court of Appeal stating that the action of TRCSL is ultra vires and TRN has all necessary licences to carry out digital pay television transmission in Sri Lanka. After a lengthy hearing, the two-member bench presided by then President of Court of Appeal, Justice Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC, allowed the appeal favoring TRN, disregarding the objection of TRCSL.
Counsel Manoj Bandara assisted by Lakshana Perera of Sudath Perera Associates represented TRN at the Court of Appeal, while Ali Sabry, PC, appeared for TRCSL.
TRCSL submitted an application for Leave to Appeal to the Supreme Court to get the order of the Court of Appeal set aside. This application was refused by the three-judge Supreme Court bench presided by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC, on April 4.
Counsel Thishya Weragoda appeared for TRN, while Manohara de Silva, PC, appeared for the TRCSL at the Supreme Court.
