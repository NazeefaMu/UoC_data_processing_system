PM to meet Modi this week

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will visit New Delhi later this week and meet his counterpart Narendra Modi to discuss bilateral matters, The Hindu reported, quoting official sources in Colombo.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe will take part in high-level meetings, including with Modi, on October 19 and 20, the PM’s Office had said.
This visit is seen as significant from both sides, sources said. New Delhi has been concerned with the slow pace of several India-aided projects in the island, while Colombo appears inclined to iron out issues in order to better balance its ties with key partners India and China. President Maithripala Sirisena is scheduled to visit Beijing soon.
From the Indian side, ‘priority projects’ in the island include the Mattala airport, the Palaly airport, the Trincomalee oil tank farm, the East Container Terminal at the Colombo Port, and the liquefied natural gas plant in Kerawalapitiya.
India’s strategic interests in some of these projects, especially in the Mattala airport and Trincomalee oil tank farm, are well known. However, over the last few months, New Delhi and Colombo have put out conflicting messages on the Mattala airport, sparking speculation on whether India’s interest to run it would actually materialise.
In principle, India and Sri Lanka have already agreed to jointly operate the World War-era oil storage facility in Trincomalee and more recently, the two countries decided that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Lanka IOC would jointly develop the near-85 tanks in the upper farm of the facility. The upcoming discussions, officials on both side said, might help accelerate the projects.
Premier Wickremesinghe’s visit to New Delhi comes a little over a month after former President and key Opposition figure Mahinda Rajapaksa met Modi. The meeting was read by many as a possible thaw in the relationship between the former President and New Delhi. (The Hindu)
