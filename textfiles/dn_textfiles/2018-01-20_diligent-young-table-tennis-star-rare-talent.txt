Q. What made you enter the world of sports?
I think it’s my destiny. I was too small to understand those days when I took my first steps into sports. My loving mother being an old “Mayan” was a great influence I think.
Q. Who has supported you the most?
Actually there’s a big list of names to be mentioned. So I think the major roles were played by my beloved parents, my only brother, coaches and teachers. As I said there are many who helped me.
Q. What made you to choose this difficult sport of Table Tennis?
As I mentioned earlier I think it’s my destiny. Every professional athlete chooses a sport at the beginning without much knowledge on what he or she is going to go through. I started playing TT when I was in grade 1.
I had no idea of what’s coming but to be honest as I kept on playing I started to love what I was doing. Some start at a very young age and some at an age where they know what they’re going to do.
In my case I think it is destiny which made me choose TT.
Q. What are your leisure time activities?
I grew up in an environment where lots of animals are there. So it is a habit of me to observe what they’re doing and having close chats with my mother is what I do when I’m free.
