Hemas Holdings records Rs 13.5 bn  revenue in 1Q, Yoy growth 21.3%

Hemas Holdings PLC (HHL) recorded a consolidated revenue of Rs 13.5 billion for the first quarter ended June 30, 2018, ayear-on-year (YoY) growth of 21.3%,led by higher contributions inour consumer and healthcare sectors.
The Group operating profit at Rs 895.7 million in the first quarter of the financial year is an increase of 3.5% over the previous financial year. Operating profit growth has been impacted by losses at N*Able, its IT technology solutions business, coupled with a weaker macroeconomic environment with sluggish consumer demand as disposable incomes have been dampened by rising costs from Rupee depreciation and increased taxes.
The profit attributable to equity holders of the parent at Rs 554.3 million is a decrease of 20.2% in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. This is due to reduced interest income post utilisation of cash reserves to acquire Atlas in January 2018 and increased interest costs relating to higher working capital due to strong growth in Pharmaceutical Distribution and the loan financing for our new logistics park. All three of these investments should contribute to earnings from Q3. Excluding the first quarter performance of Atlas, HHL recorded revenue and an operating profit growth of 10.9% and 1.5% correspondingly.
The group’s consumer business revenue stood at Rs.5.4 billion for the three months ending June 30, 2018, indicating a YoY growth of 36.2%. Growth in the consumer sector excluding Atlas stands at 6.8%. Operating profit of Rs 569.3 million grew by 8.1% during the quarter. Market conditions domestically remain depressed with most market commentaries indicating low or negative growth in most major FMCG categories. Against this backdrop, the business has performed well.
The Grops technology business, N*Able got the year off to a slower start with revenue decline of 68.5% due to delays in project completion during the quarter in contrast to its strong start in FY2017/18.
Overall the Group had a satisfactory start to the year in a difficult macro environment. Solid performance in its core Sri Lanka Consumer businesses supported by improvements in Leisure and Travel sector performance and the seasonality effect of Atlas, has positioned the Group well to improve operating profit growth in the coming quarters of the financial year.
