The President added that the government’s drive aiming at promoting reconciliation and coexistence among the people in the North and East has proved successful.
President Sirisena lamented that the people were not well informed about the massive projects launched by the government over the past three and half years for the development of livelihood and infrastructure in the North and East.
The President said that development in the North and East had suffered a setback due to the protracted terrorist conflict and the government is determined to give priority to bring development to these provinces, while uplifting the livelihood of the people.

A number of projects to be launched in the North and East on priority basis have been identified and they would be implemented soon.
It has been planned to commence the construction of 25,000 out of 50,000 houses for the people in the North and East in August. Construction of another 10,000 houses is to begin in January 2019.
The road network programme covering a length of 1847 kms in these two provinces will get underway soon. The Myliaddy fishing harbour which would greatly benefit the fishing community in the Jaffna Peninsula is also to be developed soon.
The Northern and Eastern Provinces are to be brought under a massive infrastructure development drive with special emphasis on the development of agri, irrigation, economic education and health sectors.
