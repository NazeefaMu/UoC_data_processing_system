THASL hosts ‘Hospitality Conclave’

The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Shangri-La Hotel held the ‘Hospitality Conclave’ a discussion forum for school principals at Shangri-La Ballroom, Shangri-La Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
Over 200 principals from schools across the island, including schools offering the technological stream in their curriculum, participated in the program. The forum comprised of two sessions with resourceful panel discussions drawing attention on the importance of nurturing skilled employment in Sri Lanka and the seamless opportunities in the Hospitality sector for youth.
“With its well defining competitive attributes, it is regrettable that contemporary youth are unaware of the true potential and seamless opportunities offend by the Hotel sector, leading to a formidable challenge in attracting the local youth to enter the industry and reap myriads of benefits,” an official from THASL said.
In a bid to address this matter, the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) the apex body of the entire hotel industry in the country, devised a concerted strategy to both recognize the youth in the sector and spread awareness among the masses on The Hospitality sector and its seamless possibilities.
As the first step, THASL organized ‘Rising Stars of Hospitality 2017’, an island-wide competitive context evaluating candidates under nine key categories, Thousands of young and talented individuals representing over 200 member hotels vied for the honours and the winners were felicitated at a Grand Award ceremony in October last year. Driven by its strong passion to spread awareness on hospitality sector by means of inclusion into school curriculum, THASL has kick-started the second phase with ‘Hospitality’ conclave’ – a resourceful discussion forum.
In its endeavour to elevate Sri Lanka as the ideal travel destination in the world and Tourism as the No. 1 net foreign exchange earner in the country by 2020, THASL aims to spearhead a number of such impactful and interactive forums in the near future, across the nation.
