Best of brides

The biggest names in bridal fashion showcased their spring and summer 2019 collections during Bridal Fashion Week April 11 to 14 in New York. It was no surprise that many designers, like Theia and Reem Acra, drew inspiration from this year’s royal wedding in Britain, with reimagined contemporary looks for the soon-to-be-duchess, Meghan Markle. Other designers like Ines Di Santo and Vera Wang presented gowns that were both bold and unabashedly feminine, laden with floral appliqués and colorful details. Here’s a look at what we saw at Bridal Fashion Week.
