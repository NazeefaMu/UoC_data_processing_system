“Throughout the year there are several motor shows. For the first time in Sri Lanka, we will be showcasing the strength of a single brand and company, Ideal ! No other automotive major has taken such a step.
We are doing this at a time where there is a drastic change in the mobility space and Ideal will be at the forefront of that change for the better, especially with the launch of the E20 electric car by Mahindra”, said Chairman of Ideal Motors, Nalin Welgama.
The number of electric vehicles has crossed 2 million units on the planet with a further 200 million electric two wheelers and 350,000 electric buses.
The two day event will see the entire range of vehicles marketed by the Ideal Group showcased under one roof, while Ideal Group’s supporting partners and other related organizations will also participate at Ideal Vision
According to the Deputy Chairman of the Ideal Group, Aravinda De Silva “ Ideal Vision is not a mere business or motor event.
It will serve to fund the second stage of the Ideal Group’s CSR programme “Ideal Diviyata Saviyak” which is a water purification scheme in rural Anuradhapura.
Part of the proceeds generated will be devoted to our CSR endeavour and it is something that all of us at Ideal are very passionate about ”.
In addition to its ongoing CSR project, as a result of the devastation caused by the floods, the Ideal Group are also identifying several schools that have been affected and will assist them where necessary.
