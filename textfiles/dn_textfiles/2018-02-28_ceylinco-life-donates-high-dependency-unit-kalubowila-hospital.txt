Ceylinco Life donates High Dependency Unit to Kalubowila Hospital

The Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila, the second largest government hospital in the Colombo District, has received a fully-equipped High Dependency Unit (HDU) from life insurance leader Ceylinco Life.
Located in Ward 24, the HDU has four ICU beds, six syringe pumps, two infusion pumps, a patient warmer, a blood or fluid warmer, two DVT pumps, a piped medical gas system for the four beds, two portable ventilators, four cardiac monitors, and a central monitoring station.
