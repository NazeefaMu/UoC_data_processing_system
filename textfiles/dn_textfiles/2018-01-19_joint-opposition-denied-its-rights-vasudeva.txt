Joint Opposition denied its rights: Vasudeva

The Joint Opposition (JO), the largest opposition group in Parliament, has been subdued and denied its rights, Ratnapura district Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said.
He was addressing an awareness programme attended by JO supporters at the 3rd floor of Dias Bookshop in Ratnapura on January 17.
“The TNA and the JVP have obtained opposition posts after abusing democracy. The JVP contests the election separately supporting the government. The people should use forthcoming local election to defeat the coalition government,” he said.
Nanayakkara said the UNP-led government was following the Western Multi National Company network and had bequeathed a ship-to-mouth existence to the people of the country.
“The country’s economy was destroyed by bringing laws enabling foreigners to grab people’s lands,” he said.
“The government are selling out national resources to foreigners to overcome its economic bankruptcy. They had mortgaged several future generations to foreign capitalists.
The government’s imminent defeat at the forthcoming election would see some of the people hanging on to ministerial privileges leaving it like mice escaping from a sinking ship. It was a national duty of the voters to ensure the victory of the ‘Pohottuwa’ at the forthcoming election,” he said.
