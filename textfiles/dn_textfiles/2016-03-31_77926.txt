Rugby royalty and the art of finishing

Greetings island rugby fans as March closes another gruelling season for the entire brotherhood ...a season that promised many exotic opportunities, and grand possibilities of a new hierarchy of rugby royalty.
Purists and pundits were seen gleefully trotting around the hallowed halls with, armed with new Intel and significant details of teams packing names and skills. The season promised mighty clashes ...huge match ups, tough games that would pummel reputations and change the established order.
Police claimed the best draft with the who’s who of national rugby...Bilal ‘tank’ Hassen, Reza ‘reliable’ Mubarak, Terence ‘big bear’ Henry, Achala ‘Samoa’ Perera, Mohamed ‘Fast feet’ Sherrif and company ..Havelocks set their sights above the park horizon and more national caps...Sadun Herath, Shenal Dias, Muthutantri, Hirantha Perera, Niroshan Fernando plus Lagga as coach .
CR and Kandy the top end for sure...would the experts get it absolutely right...or will we see a change in the ownership at the top ...basically can Kandy be beaten and will Havies or CR be the possible threat ..Army, Navy and Police...looking the part with impressive pre season conditioning. The question was...who would last the pressure...step up...be fit and match the best in the middle and be consistent all the way through? Experts were heating up with predictions and many were highly qualified on FB and such exotic search engines...Google a possible 2nd?
You have to admire the level of expertise on social media platforms across the island. I think there is definitely a positive to some of it...but as a rule...it’s a good read and little left after warm up.
Kandy...Kandy...Kandy...that’s all that needs to be said. If you fail to appreciate their consistency and their structure, then you fail to appreciate the core value of team sport …a strong head means an able body, a good attitude and skills to match, with a hard work ethic and quality players ..the perfect platform to launch any ambition.
The year 2016 will long be remembered for how Kandy was nearly beaten but survived against CR and Havies, on their off days?
If a team can win after 80mins, not playing their best rugby …there is a sprinkle of magic in their boots! Looking at the boots...Marija, Nigel Ratwatte, Gayan Weeraratne, Sooriyabanda, Jehan, Roshan Weeraratne, Anthony, Lavanga Perera, Jamaldeen, Vishwamitra J, Kalhara, Williwera ...made those boots very special.
Bench strength put them up in the top drawer...work rate in the middle meant an ability to survive ...and belief in their team, gave them the league and knockout titles in style …especially Nigel Ratwatte’s inspired kicking that really did make the difference.
Champion teams have greatness in the smallest things, and can slide to the finish, despite everything the opposition has piled on them. CR found that out to their astonishment, and some clinical finishing from the 7s flier Srinath Soori...such a pleasure to watch the platinum skills, shared on the biggest platform with a diving try in the corner, to swing the game back.
The rest …as they say is history and Ratwatte just pops a corner flag kick to wound CR and complete the double....Lady Clifford would have cheered heartily!
Rugby mentions for Imthie Marikkar - a fabulous run with CR as coach ...the performance level certainly worthy, and a sign of a well planned season.
Sports Today for pictures and inspiring copy throughout. Anushi Bandara for comprehensive pictures from rugby the world over .
Adds perspective and makes the union family stronger.
Gamika de Silva and Udeini Rambukwella...my buddies from many seasons and sheer work for the game irrespective of loyalties.
Ground staff at all the venues for dedication and hardly ever mentioned. Trevor Nugawela at the Racecourse for effort and a smile, even when under pressure. Kanishka at Singer ...always on time and delivery as planned …a friend and dedicated follower of the game. All the fans who still get to games and encourage the next generation to dream beyond their horizons.
Sevens coach Matt Turner for backing us islanders and sharing Intel with our men’s team. Linda Itunu coach for the women’s 7s and a step up to the Hong Kong 7s next month.
The game goes on…players need to recharge...injuries time to heal and rehabilitate. Ask Lasantha Basnayake how he managed to keep Kandy fighting fit every weekend and still perform despite the niggles ...a good physiotherapist is worth his weight in gold. .thanks “bassa” for Sri Lanka 7s and the effort for Kandy.
The focus shifts to international rugby...the Asian 5 nations and the 7s ranking tournaments ...national trials list the players who have a shot at stamping their mark with a national cap …worthy reward for a hard graft season and the highest honour. Blessings to all who make the grade and well done to all the players for a season and inspiration.
Bula bula island rugby and the warriors who believe in the flag and live their dream.
