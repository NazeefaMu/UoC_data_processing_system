Resolving garbage issue

The good news is that Colombo has been cleared of all its festering garbage mounds as of yesterday. Minister of Megapolis and Western Development Patali Champika Ranawaka, who has been tasked with the responsibility of garbage management by the Cabinet of Ministers disclosed that at least 3,000 tons of garbage has been cleared by Saturday.
In Minister Ranawaka, the Cabinet has settled on someone who has a proven track record in this field. In his previous turn as Environment Minister, he introduced the concept of garbage separation (as glass, plastic, food waste, paper) and recycling. This programme, which went on for some time, naturally fell by the wayside as time moved on and things were back to square one. We hope that this time, Minister Ranawaka will have a more successful turn.
The garbage mounds strewn all over the City were no doubt an eyesore, not to mention the unbearable stench emanating from them. Stray dogs foraging through the trash made the problem worse. The garbage dumps also act as breeding sites for flies, maggots and mosquitoes. The latter is especially significant given the extent of the dengue epidemic, though the dengue vector mosquito is generally known to prefer clear water as a breeding site.
Colombo’s garbage crisis was precipitated by the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump which resulted in several deaths. This brought to the fore the magnitude of the garbage problem – that nearly 800 tons of garbage is collected daily in Colombo alone. Angered and scared by what they saw, residents in many other areas oppose any plans to dump garbage in their own areas. However, given the lack of an immediate alternative garbage handling mechanism, this will be inevitable at least for a few months.
While claiming that the streets of Colombo are back to their previous cleanliness, the Minister also warned of strict action against those dumping garbage in an improper manner. In fact over 1,500 people have been nabbed by the Police for dumping trash indiscriminately within the city. This is a welcome move.
All the institutions involved in this exercise deserve plaudits, including the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Private organisations, the Police Environment Division and the Sri Lanka Army. The Government has made it clear that the Army will not be engaged in garbage collection but will be playing a more technical and technological role since it has the necessary manpower and technical expertise to deal with such phenomena.
Minister Ranawaka has also made it clear that the programme is a temporary solution to the growing garbage problem. According to the Minister, the Government has commenced several waste to energy projects which will be completed soon. This was long overdue for Colombo, since several urban and municipal councils in the country already have some sort of garbage recycling programme – Balangoda has the most well known initiative.
Garbage is now becoming a fuel itself – most countries use trash to make “solid recovered fuel” and a type of diesel fuel. These plants cost a lot to build, but the benefits accrued in the long run far outweigh the initial cost. We should look at garbage recycling programmes in other countries and select an appropriate model that can accommodate local requirements.
Like everything else in this country, the garbage issue too has been politicized with accusations and counter accusations flying about. However, this is too big an issue for petty politics. It is a national issue that calls for a collective effort by all those concerned, including politicians representing all hues and members of the public. In short, the Government alone cannot handle the garbage problem without the cooperation and understanding of everyone.
In fact, all individuals have a responsibility to ensure that garbage is kept to minimum in the first place. For example, if a household only makes the quantity of food needed for a given meal, there will be little or no leftovers to throw away. If you take your lunch to office in a box instead of wrapping it in a lunch sheet and then a piece of paper, the city’s wastefills will have one less lunch sheet to worry about every day. These are small steps that can have a major impact a few years down the road.
This will complement the efforts of authorities who are now working towards introducing new policies for better waste management. In case any member of the public needs Government support or seeks to complain about any aspect of garbage handling, the Government will improve the public complaints hotline of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government. There will also be enhanced support and resources for Local Government authorities to combat the growing garbage issue.
We should think of garbage as a resource for generating energy and making various other goods through recycling. There should be a holistic approach to garbage management, spurred by a debate on the issue from garbage generation to disposal. Emotional outbursts will not get us anywhere.
