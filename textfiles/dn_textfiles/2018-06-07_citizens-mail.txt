Citizens' Mail

Beware the boomerang
The Australian aborigines have a wooden device shaped like an expanded v, and thrown into the air comes back to the thrower. It is called boomerang. A group of MPs who were in the government opposed the prime minister at the no-confidence motion and fell on their ‘bottom with a thud'.
When this government was formed, they were short of a majority. These MPs jumped on the bandwagon for their own benefit. They were nothing else but a Trojan Horse sent to disrupt the working of the government and they succeeded to a certain extent.
Mahinda Rajapaksa was expected to welcome these prodigal sons with open arms and also kill the fatted calf. But things did not work to their satisfaction. So they will sit as a separate unit.
This is not the first time that some of them have crossed the parliamentary aisle.
When the hustings come round, they do not have the strength to stand alone. So they will obviously stand with the ‘buddies'. The voters will do well to know that they only think of their own benefit and replace them at the hustings with younger men. They have not done anything to benefit the country. So they are not indispensable.
