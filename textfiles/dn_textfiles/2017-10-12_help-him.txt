Help him

 L. L. K. Karunaratne of Aluthwatta in Palatuwa, Matara, is suffering from cirrhosis of the liver and urgently needs a liver transplant to save his life according to Consultant Transplant Surgeon Dr. Ruwan Dissanayake.
This life-saving procedure and related expenses for medicines would cost Rs. 6 million if carried out locally and Rs. 10 to 15 million if carried out overseas.
Karunaratne, who is a teacher attached to Sultanagoda Maha Vidyalaya, says he is unable to foot this bill due to his present financial plight.
He requests philanthropists and the public to assist his cause by sending whatever financial contributions possible to help expedite the transplant surgery and save his life. All contributions should be remitted to account number 152200150052148 at the Peoples Bank, Matara Dharmapala Mawatha Branch. His contact numbers are 071 6310385, 071 7683757 and 076 5865340.
