NTC Hotline to report errant private bus crews

Passengers who are compelled to pay higher ticket prices other than the stipulated rates by the National Transport Commission (NTC) are advised to call the NTC Hotline 1955 to lodge their complaints.
“Although the revised bus fares were published in newspapers, some private bus conductors are still reported to be charging higher ticket prices from passengers, a NTC Spokesman said.
He said the NTC received a number of complaints from passengers against private bus crews charging higher fares, not giving their balance money and not issuing tickets.
The Flying Squad would be deployed round the clock to catch errant drivers and conductors.
Measures will also be taken to display the fare table inside the buses.
In case of additional fares being charged or tickets not being issued, commuters can lodge complaints via the NTC Hotline 1955.
NTC sources said thatlegal action would be taken against errant bus crew for flouting the law.
