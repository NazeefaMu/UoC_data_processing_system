Mozart’s comeback

 
For more than 20 years, The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka has made its Young Musicians’ Concert a platform for Sri Lankan artists to showcase their musical talents. With the generous sponsorship of HSBC, this annual event has allowed our young musicians the rare opportunity to perform repertoire for soloist and orchestra, and has become a rite of passage among those pursuing careers in classical music.
It has long been one of the SOSL’s primary aims to foster young talent in Sri Lanka, to promote classical music, and enable young musicians discover the joys of communicating through music.
Recently, the SOSL widened the parameters of this concert to include composers as well, with very encouraging results. On July 23, three talented soloists will take the Ladies’ College stage with the SOSL, while one young composer will have her work premiered.
Eshan Denipitiya, a pianist of rare sensitivity and technical ability, will perform Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 17 in G major. Eshan began his musical journey at the age of 6 under the guidance of the late Mrs. Dharmi Mudalige and later under Mrs. Ruvini Hapugalle. He is currently pursuing his undergraduate studies at the Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore, majoring in Classical Piano Performance.
Mozart’s piano concerto no. 17 is one of the rare concertos that Mozart composed with a soloist other than himself in mind – his student Barbara Ployer. This elegant concerto is unusual it its multiplicity of musical themes. Where a traditional classical concerto would give two contrasting themes, the first movement gives us six, one growing out of the previous one, and extravagance that Mozart extends into the following movements as well.
Also performing on July 23 is a very talented duo of Sopranos—Dinushka Jayawickreme and Shehara Liyanage. Both Shehara and Dinushka are founder members of Sri Lanka’s premiere female ensemble Soul Sounds, directed by Soundarie David Rodrigo, and have been the lead soloists in the group. Shehara and Dinushka have touched the hearts of many with the beautiful blend of their two voices in perfect harmony when they performed with Soul Sounds in countries such as Australia, France, USA, Kuwait, Malaysia, China and recently in South Africa.
Shehara and Dinushka will be performing Delibes’ “Flower Duet” from the Opera Lakme, and “Sull aria che soave zeffiretto,” a duettino from Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro. There may be no classical tune — operatic or otherwise — that turns up in more varied places than Delibes’ Flower Duet; this almost other-worldly piece of music has become one of the most familiar numbers any composer, in any genre, has ever written. Sull'aria...che soave zeffiretto is a short duet in which Countess Almaviva dictates to Susanna the invitation to a tryst addressed to the countess' husband in a plot to expose his infidelity.
Apart from the performances by the featured soloists, the orchestra will perform an original composition titled “Achrann” by the young composer Shannon Jacob. The word Achrann means strife in Gaelic, with connotations of battle, war and trouble. This piece takes the listener on a visual journey of a medieval Irish battle through which themes of romance, loss, hope and warfare are evident.
Shannon Jacob graduated from Berklee College of Music Boston USA with a Bachelor of Music Degree in Contemporary Writing and Production. She currently resides in Boston and works for Berklee College of Music as an Admissions Enrollment Officer.
Also on the programme on the 23rd are two orchestral items—Schubert’s Overture to Rosamunde—one of his finest and most popular orchestral works, and Sibelius’ Karelia Suite—a patriotic work depicting the beauties, history and music of the Karelia region of Finland.
The SOSL’s Young Musicians Concert is on July 23 at the Ladies’ College Hall, and is made possible by the longstanding sponsorship of HSBC. The concert is supported by TV1 and Yes FM (electronic media) and JWT (Creative Partner). Tickets are available online at tickets.lk from 4th July onwards, and can be bought in person from Sarasavi Bookshop (Nugegoda and Maharagama), Yamaha Music Center, and Abans Main showroom.
