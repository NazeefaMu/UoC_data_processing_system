Big band beats

A Competition organized by the Nalanda College Old Boys Association (NCOBA) to crown the best brass band of Sri Lanka will be held in Polgolla, Kandy on September 9. The competition will be held in district and provincial level. The final 50 bands will be showcased in a reality TV show.
The brass band dates back to the early nineteenth century and England’s Industrial Revolution as an outgrowth of the medieval waits. With increasing urbanization, employers began to finance work bands to decrease the political activity with which the working classes seemed preoccupied during their leisure time. Thus, the brass band tradition was founded. Fervent discussion has always ensued as to which band was founded first. Certainly the two bands with the longest traditions are the Bessies 0' The Barn Brass Band and the Black Dyke Mills Brass Band.
School bands are usually a sight at ceremonial events within the school or at public performances outside the school as they provide the music for various occasions. In addition, school bands also participate in competitions at both local and international music festivals. As students undergo the process of rehearsing in the band, either for foot drills or music drills, the disciplined routines allow them to learn the values of discipline, teamwork, responsibility and commitment. As they participate in competitions, students also learn to celebrate their achievements while maintaining humility or even to accept defeat in good grace. These are experiences that members of the school bands gain through participation.
As such, school bands act as platforms that develop potential young musicians, among which a significant number of whom would have gone on to pursue a professional music career. There are amateur and semi-professional bands and orchestras, national bodies, or even professional organizations where students can go on to involve themselves in. The number of students who continue to pursue professional music careers are their experience in the school bands can perhaps be an indicator of development in the area of culture and arts scene.
The musical standard that school bands have reached today can be exemplified in the recognized international competitions and events that some school bands have been invited to participate in. One example would be the Sydney Olympics Games Opening Ceremony held in Australia in 2000, when six Singaporean school band members were selected to participate in the international band display item.
So far more than 3,000 school band islandwide have registered for the competition.
