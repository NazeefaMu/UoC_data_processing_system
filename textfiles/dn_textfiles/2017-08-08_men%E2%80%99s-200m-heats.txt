Men’s 200m heats

Usain Bolt will not defend his 200m crown, one he has held since setting a world record 19.19 seconds in Berlin in 2009.
That has left the field open for a new gold medallist after Bolt’s run of four.
It could well come down to a battle between South Africa’s world and Olympic 400m champion Wayde van Niekerk and Botswanan rival Isaac Makwala, both seeking a first 200/400m world double since Michael Johnson in Gothenburg in 1995.
