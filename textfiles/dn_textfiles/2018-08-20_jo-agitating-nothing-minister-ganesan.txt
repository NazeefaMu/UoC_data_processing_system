JO agitating for nothing - Minister Ganesan

Minister Mano Ganesan said he could not understand why the Joint Opposition (JO) was so agitated about Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa being questioned by the Police as even the President can be summoned by the Judiciary under the Constitution.
He was speaking at a recent public event in Kandy.
The Minister said that all are equal before the law and today the President, Prime Minister, a minister or a parliamentarian can be summoned by the judiciary if it wanted.
The Minister said the against this backdrop, why the JO was shouting hoarse about Rajapaksa being questioned by the Police.
He said that today the JO was trying to highlight such trivial matters as they have no slogans against the government and have become politically bankrupt.
Ganesan said that by shouting against Rajapaksa questioning, the JO was trying to avoid talk about their latest defeat of not being able to win the Opposition Leader Post in Parliament.
He said that as the JO members contested on the UPFA ticket; they will even lose their parliament seats if they tried to become independent.
He said the JO was trying to scuttle government’s efforts in making a new constitution.
