AIA Insurance conducts islandwide awareness program

AIA Insurance is currently carrying out an islandwide awareness drive on the prevention and management of non-communicable diseases (NCD’s) such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease.
Notably, many NCD’s are a result of bad lifestyle choices such as unhealthy eating, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of exercise and insufficient sleep.
It is also important to keep in mind that these lifestyle NCD’s are not only preventable but also can be managed and cured, if people can be better educated about the cause and prevention and take some measures upon detection.
With this in sight, AIA has commenced a series of awareness raising seminars for customers and the public, with the help of specialised doctors, nutritionists and consultants.
The seminars, which are focused on creating a healthier and more informed community, also highlight the importance of securing one’s financial health.
They focus on dispensing advice for people to ensure financial security in the face of a medical emergency, keeping in mind the increasing cost of medical care. AIA has held 18 seminars across the country with many more scheduled for the year.
The overall objective of this island-wide awareness creation drive is to help Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives.
