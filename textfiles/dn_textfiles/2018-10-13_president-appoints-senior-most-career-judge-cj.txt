PRESIDENT APPOINTS SENIOR MOST CAREER JUDGE AS CJ

President Maithripala Sirisena speaking at an event in Battaramulla said that he had inquired on the personal, professional and academic credentials of the justices serving in the Supreme Court.
He went on to state that the appointment must be based on seniority in service and that for the first time in 30 years, he would be appointing a Chief Justice based on seniority.
“The Supreme Court judges met upon my return from Seychelles and urged me to nominate the most qualified and senior judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice. They said by doing so the career judges would nurse the confidence that they too will stand the chance of being appointed to the post sans undue influence,” the President said.
The Constitutional Council has approved the nominee of President Maithripala Sirisena for the post of Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. The President had not submitted a list of names, instead he had nominated a judge who had served the judiciary unsullied for the last 38 years and who had also served as President of a Labour Tribunal. He is credited for having risen the ranks to now hold office in Sri Lanka’s apex court.
President Sirisena said that when a politician engages in misconduct, the image of other good politicians is damaged. “The misconduct of a politician affects the images of other good politicians” he said.
