Sam Chandrasena, a generous sport personality

He created waves in society by introducing the IRONMAN4x4 brand to the Sri Lankan motor racing industry. Also, during a time when the value placed on human life is at its lowest, he spear-headed the creation of a group of volunteers known as ICERT, that would place their own lives and machines in danger during natural disasters, to rescue and assist their own fellow countrymen.
With the attention of the general public drawn to the stunning feats achieved by this group of volunteers, working towards the benefit of their country and people, he was able to change the image of 4x4 users that had become a mindset of the public. He is a well-know personality in the racing world and by continuously maintaining his standards finally was rewarded with the SLT – SILK Outstanding Generous Sport Personality in Sri Lanka for 2017. He is Sam Chandrasena, the man behind TEAM IRONMAN 4x4 and I-CERT.
Sam Chandrasena was born in Kahawatta in 1976, received his primary education at St. Thomas College, Guruthalawa and secondary education at St. Thomas College, Bandarawela. Finally he attended S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. In 1994 and at the end of his schooling career ,he migrated to Australia to pursue my higher education, whilst working. As soon as he completed his studies in Australia, he wanted to return to Sri Lanka to work in an industry for which he was qualified and trained for. On arrival in Sri Lanka and due to the knowledge and experience gained by working in the same sector in Australia, he joined Foster and Reed Pools and Spas (Pvt) Ltd.
The path to enter the racing world was opened in 2005, just after he brought a Jeep Wrangler to take-part in extreme 4x4 racing. At that time, very few people owned a Jeep Wrangler. He had a large following of fans because of this new vehicle in the racing industry. He did a few modifications to his Wrangler and entered extreme 4x4 racing, during a time period in which people treated it as a wonder. After few years he decided to change his vehicle brand and switched to the Nissan Patrol. That decision paved a pathway for another destination on his journey.
He says Most people are unaware that he is the person behind the introduction of the Australian IRONMAN4x4 brand to Sri Lanka. He considers it as huge privilege to be the ambassador for such a well known brand and to cater for people who are willing to engage in the 4x4 recreational and racing culture, in Sri Lanka.
