Suu Kyi calls for ‘all inclusive’ peace process

MYANMAR: Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi has called for “all inclusiveness” in the country’s national reconciliation and peace process, the state media reported on Tuesday.
Suu Kyi reiterated that “the door is always open” to the non-ceasefire signatory armed groups to join the signing of the Nationwide Ceasefire Accord (NCA), the Myanmar News Agency said.
Speaking at the 12th meeting of the Union Peace Dialogue Joint Committee (UPDJC) in Nay Pyi Taw on Monday, she said that her government puts great emphasis on the “non-signatories” participation,
She also urged all for the completion of work in laying down the basic principles for a federal union in 2018, Xinhua news agency reported.
Suu Kyi stressed the need for drawing up Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to be able to implement the agreements effectively and to establish an office for the UNPDC.
Meanwhile, some non-ceasefire signatory armed groups are expected to sign the government’s NCA in November.
