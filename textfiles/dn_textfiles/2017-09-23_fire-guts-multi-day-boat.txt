Fire guts multi-day-boat

A fire broke out in a multi-day-boat anchored at the Hambantota fisheries harbour reducing it to ashes.
The boat owner is a resident of Tangalle. The man who was inside the boat had jumped to the sea and saved his life.
Fisheries inspection officials, Police, the Navy and disaster management officials doused the fire.
