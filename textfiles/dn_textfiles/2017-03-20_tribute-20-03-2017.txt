Ananda Coomaraswamy
Amalgam of East and West
Ananda Kentish Coomarasamy was not an Indian by birth, but he showed more than any scholar, a wider understanding of India’s cultural heritage. He was born at Rhineland Place, Kollupitiya, on August 22, 1877, and was the only child of Sir Muthu Coomarasamy and his English mother Elizabeth Clay Beeby.
His father, Sir Muthu Coomarasamy, was well-versed in Western classics as well as Pali and Sanskrit. He translated Dhatavamsa (History of the Sacred Tooth Relic) from Pali into English, and was responsible for the establishment of the Colombo Museum in 1871. Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy was the first non-Christian form Asia to be called to the English Bar, and he was a prominent member of the Legislative Council in Ceylon.
During the reign of Queen Victoria, he was the first Asian to be knighted, and was a popular figure among the socialites in London. He enjoyed the company of Lord Palmerston, Lord Tennyson, and Benjamin Disraeli. He was portrayed by Disraeli as Kusinara in his unfinished novel.
When his son, Ananda, was almost two years old, Sir Muthu died. His mother brought him up in England where he received his education at Wycliff College in Stonehouse Gloucestershire, and later, at University College London.
In 1903, he was 25 years of age when he was appointed Director of the Mineralogical Surveys in Sri Lanka, and three years later, his contributions to the Mineralogy of Ceylon won him the degree of Doctor of Science of London University, of which he was elected a Fellow.
He was the Director of Mineralogical Surveys in Sri Lanka from 1903 to 1906, and that was the turning point of his career, when he made two discoveries, namely Serendibite in 1902 and Thorinite in 1904, at Gangapitiya in Gampola.
Writing on Serendibite, he said: “It was of a beautiful blue colour, and was discovered in intimate association with the diopside in narrow contact zones between in acid moonstone bearing granulite and limestone, which occur in alternating bonds at Gangapitiya.”
The second mineral he found was a cubic mineral of high specific gravity which analysis proved to be aside of Thorium and Uranium. The cubes were very small (2/10 inch.), and the colour was dark blue. The importance of this mineral was derived from its radioactive properties.
The travels he made around Kandy in search of minerals gave him the opportunity to visit villages known for traditional Kandyan arts and crafts. The age-old work practiced by the artisans threw much light on the different aspects of Sinhalese culture.
The information thus gathered enabled him to write his monumental treatise "Medieval Sinhalese Art," which he published in England in 1908. The publication of this book brought him recognition as a scholar. The success he achieved was due to his ability in delving into the source, and his insight, which gave him the authority to his interpretations that made his book unique.
The first edition of the book was limited to 425 copies printed under his supervision at the Essex House Press in the Norman Chapel at Broad Campden Gloucestershire. The publication of this book was considered a landmark by the scholars in the revival of Sri Lanka’s cultural heritage.
The studies he made revealed the cultural affinity between India and Sri Lanka, and he commented: “a perfect window through which to gaze on India’s past than any that can be found in India itself.”
According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, Sinhalese art is essentially Indian in outlook and Hindu in character. This aspect helped him assess culture in a truer perspective.
He said: "Every stem and leaf of the liyavela ornament in Ceylon, and in the details of South Indian architectural decoration is never realistic, but based on observations or ideal forms.”
These carved forms or ornamentations were used by the Sinhalese craftsman to depict energy and growth, and Buddhist and Hindu concepts were depicted symbolically.
He found Kandyan art as a branch of Indian art, and the architecture of Kandy was similar to that of Kerala. The folk art of the Sinhalese, especially practiced by women, was related to motif ritual of the embroidered Kantha of Bengal. This affinity helped him to assess Indian culture in true form. He then abandoned his scientific research and devoted himself to the study of the arts and culture of India and Sri Lanka.
The result was his two monographs: The Aims of Indian Art and Bronzes from Ceylon. In these studies he attempted to reconstruct and interpret the philosophy of Hinduism. His research was not in the role of a romantic aesthetician, but as the foremost academic historian of Indian and Indonesian art. He succeeded in synthesizing the ideals and traditions of Indian art found in different parts of Asia and created a new consciousness of Indian cultural unity.
He wrote: “The trained Sinhalese craftsman never falters because the carve is second nature to him. Such is the carve of energy and growth—rhythmic and disciplined, but unsatisfied, ever-striving towards an end not yet attained as of a vine climber climbing upwards vigorously, or restless flames of fire.”
The visits he made to India were fruitful. He studied art, music, dance, and religion. The worship of beauty was the motivation and message to his attitude towards Indian art.
In that sense, his role falls into three different types: First, as an exponent of the philosophical aspects and dramatic techniques of the Indian dance. Second, his influence on Hindu and Buddhist iconographic studies. Third, as an art critic whose artistic and scholarly interests ranged from the technical and theoretical aspects of Indian paintings to Tagore’s paintings.
His first essay, The Dance of Shiva, displayed aesthetic sensibility. It was his point of view and sense of the sublime. The aesthetic expression of a creative power could discover a mode expressive of fundamental rhythm and so profoundly significant and inevitable, as well as metaphysical focus of an image of reality. While Tagore pioneered the cultural experiment of the Manupuri dances in Shanthiniketan, Coomaraswamy explored the aesthetics of Bharata Natyam in Tanjavur. By doing so, he secured Bharata Natyam a place in the great tradition of the Indian dance.
The creative writings, History of Indian and Indonesian Painting and Rajput Painting were considered important for the study of art. He wanted to donate his collection of artifacts to the Indian government. Since it was not forthcoming, he left for the United States of America (USA) in 1915.
At first, he was appointed a Research Fellow at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Later, he became the curator of Indian and Eastern Art—the post he held until his retirement a month prior to his death, on September 9, 1947, in Boston, at the age of 70 years.
He supported the Swadeshi Movement in India and argued against the import of cheap machine-made articles from the west, and he was also the champion of the national system of education. He advocated the Indian cultural and ethical values and an orderly and integrated life, joy, and beauty.
It was the time when western culture and Graecian concepts of beauty and aesthetics were considered highly that he espoused Indian art and thought it as the best in the world.
He was of the opinion that a single generation of English education succeeded in breaking the threads of tradition and created non-descript and superficial beings deprived of roots—a sort of intellectual pariahs belonging to neither the east nor west; past nor future.
Coomaraswamy further said, "our leaders are already degenerated quite as much as Macaulay could have wished them to be—a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, opinions, morals, and intellect because they have yet to discover India.
They have not realized that the modern world has no longer an integrated culture, but an organized barbarism and political pandemonium.” He showed with his writings. how suicidal it was to live by bread alone and, he pointed out how disastrous it was to embark on a rudderless voyage under the illusion that it is progress.
"The measure of our culture," he said, "is not our ability to learn new tricks, but that of what we have to give. Therefore, he insisted on adherence to tradition."
As an accomplished linguist, he knew English, French, German, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Pali, and Hindi. He also knew or acquainted himself with Italian, Spanish, Icelandic, Dutch, Persian, Tamil, and Sinhala.
The last book he wrote was "Why Exhibit Works of Art." He interpreted Indian thought forms. His interpretations inspired him to compile it. He collaborated with Sr. Nivedita to write Myths of Hindus and Buddhists. His earliest work, "Mirror of Gestures," was based on Indian dancing, which he jointly wrote with D. Gopalakrishnayya.
Writing on beauty, he said, “It is a state. It is also widely held that the true critic—Rasika—is able to decide which works of art are beautiful—Rasavant—and which are not…” The concept of beauty, and the adjective, beautiful, belong exclusively to aesthetics, and should only be used in aesthetic judgement.
Ananda Coomaraswamy lived to see India usher in freedom, but soon had reason to deplore the imitation of western industrialism in free India.
His first wife, Ethel Mary, a German, helped him to write Medieval Sinhalese Art. The second wife, Alice, who was English, but called herself Ratna Devi, wrote a book on Indian songs.
Donna Luisa, his third wife, edited the books he had compiled before his death, and came to India with his ashes to fulfil his last wish.
Narada, his son, was a novelist who died in an airplane crash. His daughter, Rohini, a musician, lived in New York. The youngest son, Rama, a surgeon, worked in New York.
The interpretation of Indian wisdom to the west was inspired by his study of vedic thought.
With fame and recognition, he remained modest. He said, “Anything personal must not intrude in my work. It would be Aswargya to allow such things…”
It is interesting to note that in 1905, he founded the Ceylon Social Reform Society to stress the grave threat to native social and cultural traditions from the indiscriminate copying of western models. He gave lectures and wrote articles to the Ceylon National Review of which he was the first editor.
He also urged the use of national languages in education and preservation of the arts and crafts and modes of drawing. He supported his cousin Arunachalam in the establishment of the Ceylon University.

Amarasiri Abeyewardene
Pioneer educationist
The current senior deputy principal of Stafford International School Amarasiri Abeyewardene will be completing 50 years in the field of education at the end of September, 2017, when he will be retiring from service at Stafford International School after 39 years. Abeyewardene, fondly known by his students as Mr. Abey, started his teaching career on October 1, 1967, when still at the University of Ceylon, Colombo.
He passed his Advanced Level from Royal College Colombo in 1965, and proceeded to do a science degree at the University of Ceylon, Colombo. At the General Science qualifying examination of 1966, he was one of nine students in a batch of 120 who passed the examination. As such, the first year general science BSc. batch was thus so small that eight other students from the Peradeniya Campus joined these nine students, so that the BSc. 1 batch had 17 students in total. This batch of students proceeded from BSc.1 to BSc. 2, and all of them qualified as BSc. graduates in October, 1968.
In 1968, he was appointed as a Chemistry demonstrator, but declined the appointment, as he had already found permanent employment. At the University, he was the treasurer and then the secretary of the student Christian movement. Together with students from the universities and schools, he participated in the Triennial Conference in Pune, India, where he was in-charge of a group.
He commenced his teaching career as the Physics lecturer at Pembroke Academy in Flower Road, Colombo 7. This academy was owned by his uncle Hope Abeyewardene, who was also a well-known educationist. He was a first-class physics teacher, who even had classes in his own house. The classes at Pembroke Academy consisted of more than 100 students, and Abeyewardene was able to get the attention of all whenever he took a class. He also taught chemistry and mathematics to the Advanced level first and second year students. As Pembroke was well-known for the success of failures of Advanced level students, who proceeded to universities, medical colleges and engineering faculties in the universities in Sri Lanka, many of his students have qualified as doctors, engineers, accountants and science graduates, who will vouch for his teaching and administrative abilities. Although he started as a teacher, he soon became the principal of the academy—a post he held from 1970 to December, 1978.
As Pembroke depended on its external students for practical examination, and as the department gave up the practical examinations, institutes like Pembroke could not survive and had to close down in December, 1978. In January, 1979, english medium students were transferred to Stafford, then known as Stafford Ladies College, and the sinhala medium students were relocated at Alexandra College, Colombo 8. Initially the English medium classes were held in the film co-orporation building adjacent to the Ladies College. In a couple of years, Stafford Ladies College was re-named Stafford Institute, then, Stafford Institute of higher education, and finally, Stafford International School.
The English medium students sat the local Advanced Level, and some of them, the London Advanced level, which was conducted by the London University. In the 1970’s and early 1980’s, the students had to go to India to sit for the examination. However, in the 1980’s, the Department of Examinations conducted the examination for the London University. After some years, the conducting of the examination for the London University was handed over to the British Council, which up to now, conducts the examination initially for all candidates, but now, for the private candidates only. This is because some schools which conduct classes for the London examinations were awarded the status of “Teaching Institutes,” and these schools, such as Stafford International School, now conduct the examinations dealing directly with the examination bodies in U.K.
Abeywardena was appointed the Superintendent of examinations for Stafford International school for Edexcel, and then for Cambridge University, and deals directly with these two examination bodies. He has always been a tower of strength for Stafford as well as for his students at all times, and has conducted the examinations to the best of his ability and to the satisfaction of the examining bodies at all times.
Initially, when the English medium section commenced at Stafford, he was the head of this section. When the school became an International School, he assumed a dual role as the Vice Principal and physics teacher, then, the Deputy Principal, and now, the Senior Deputy Principal—a post he holds presently. Stafford International School changed from the Edexcel Curriculum to the Cambridge University O/L and A/L curricula, two years ago. The change was a blessing to its students as 20 world and country awards were received by students of Stafford, in 2016, which amounts to the highest number of awards received in a year by students of Stafford.
During his period of service at Stafford, he has been in charge of the school Interact Club for 25 years from its inception. He is also in charge of the School Aviation club. He has organised the school Carol Service for a number of years, seeing to every aspect of the service. With his guidance, the Interact Club has organised a number of Medical Camps in rural villages, specially in Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, and donated milk powder, dry rations, etc. to cancer patients, orphanages, and the poor, and has organized walks and fairs on three occasions.
He has written many recommendations for students, which the students will vouch for their admissions to foreign universities, and are extremely grateful to him. Even at his 40th wedding anniversary, the service there was a surprise when a past student, Malaka Talwatte, gave a glowing tribute to Mr. Abeywardena, saying that what he is today is due to his teaching and the recommendation he received for his entry to a UK University. The now famous eye surgeon Dr. Amila de Alwis and many other students also give similar tributes about Abeywardena. Even in church circles, he has held many positions. He has served in many committees, has been the Secretary of Finance of the Sri Lanka Methodist Church for 17 years, and has held the position of the Vice President of the Methodist Church Sri Lanka in 1996, which is the highest position which a layman could hold.
Abeywardena always loves and cares for the well-being of his students, and in turn, the students love him. This is simply displayed because whenever a past student working or studying abroad comes on a holiday to Sri Lanka, they make it a point to visit him at school or at his home to inquire about him, his family, other teachers, and the school. The saying goes “all good things must come to an end,” I am sure the management, teachers, and students of Stafford will miss the services of Abeywardena when he relinquishes his services to the school at the end of September, 2017. Be it Amarasiri’s Vice Presidency in the Methodist Church in 1995, their Silver Wedding in 1994, their Ruby Wedding in 2009, the one who was most excited was his wife Caryl, who died suddenly on February 10, 2017. She was always looking forward to their Golden Wedding in 2019, which is now only a dream for Amarasiri. Their two children, Arindra, who is married and in Australia, and Cheryl, who stays with Amarasiri, with her child, Malik, because her husband works in Hong Kong, now see to the needs of their father. Caryl was always a tower of strength in all the activities her husband was involved in.
