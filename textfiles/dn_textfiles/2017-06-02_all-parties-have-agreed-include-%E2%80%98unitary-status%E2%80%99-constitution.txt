All parties have agreed to include ‘Unitary status’ in constitution

All political parties including the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) have agreed to include the term ‘Unitary Status’ into the new constitution that is being formulated, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said .
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Head Office in Colombo.
He said that some media had carried incorrect news.
He said the term Unitary Status is in the Sinhala translation of the constitution and not in the English and Tamil translations.
“What members like me maintained was to include the term Unitary Status into the English and the Tamil translations of the Constitution,” Perera said.
“The TNA also has agreed to include the term ‘Unitary’ into the constitution”, he said.
