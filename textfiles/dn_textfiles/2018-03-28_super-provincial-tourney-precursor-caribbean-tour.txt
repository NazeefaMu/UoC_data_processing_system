Super Provincial tourney a precursor to Caribbean tour

Sri Lanka Cricket will kick start this year’s Super Provincial Tournament regarded as the top most domestic fixture in the country in terms of longer version of the game on Friday (March 30),
The competition will consist of six games and each of the four teams will play three matches apiece with all the national players set to take part.
The four teams are named after the district that Sri Lanka Cricket has established Centers of Excellence namely Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Dambulla. Sri Lanka Test captain Dinesh Chandimal leads Colombo while fast bowler and vice-captain Suranga Lakmal captains Galle, Angelo Mathews will lead Kandy and Test opener Dimuth Karunaratne - Dambulla.
The games will be played at Chilaw Marians Cricket Club grounds in Katunayake, Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium in Sooriyawewa and at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium.
The tournament will include two night games using pink ball as a precursor to the upcoming West Indies tour by the national team.
The provincial tournament was introduced to the Sri Lankan cricket calendar in 2003 by the current president of Sri Lanka Cricket Thilanga Sumathipala.
‘We have provided four of the best head coaches to each team and have given them a challenge to sustain their teams and to create a better squad for the national team,” said Sumathipala at a media conference yesterday. Avishka Gunawardena is the head coach of Colombo, Sumithra Warnakulasuriya heads Dambulla, Hashan Tillakaratne - Galle and Piyal Wijetunga - Kandy.
Sumathipala also stated that they were hoping to commence the Lankan Premier League for which the dates have been finalized. “We had some issues with the Lankan Premier League previously, our aim is to rectify those shortcomings and make it successfull this year,” said Sumathipala.
The SLPL is expected to field six teams.
The SLC president also stated that they planned to select some players from under 13 and above to provincial teams over the course of ten years.
