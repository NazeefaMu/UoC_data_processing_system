Kajol to get waxwork at Madame Tussauds

According to sources close to Madam Tussauds, preparations are on in full swing to create Bollywood diva, Kajol’s wax statue in London.
It’s believed that husband Ajay Devgn, daughter Nysa and son Yug will accompany Kajol at the launch of her statue this year. The team has already flown down to India to take Kajol’s measurements.
This comes as no surprise given the actor’s popularity and impressive body of work. In the past, wax statues of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan among others have been unveiled there.
