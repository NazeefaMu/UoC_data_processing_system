Festive bashes are best sans the drunken pest!

Most of us love this time of year. Everyone relaxes and parties with lots of invitations to both big and little get-togethers. Christmas Day may be no longer than any other day, but for many people, the festive party season now lasts the whole of December. We all want to have fun and indulge every now and then, especially at Christmas time, but sometimes it’s hard not to get carried away.
After all, it is meant to be the season to be jolly. But no one in their right senses would like to see anyone jolly-well smashed. I mean really sloshed, inebriated, stoned, plastered or drunk as a skunk as they say.
Imbibed judiciously alcohol can be an effective social lubricant. But being ‘under the influence’ is impolite in any social circle. Besides, becoming drunk and disorderly can become a nightmare for fellow guests and hosts. In any case, imbibing copiously and becoming cruel, mean or violent is inexcusable. Yes, we have all dealt with that one embarrassingly drunk person in otherwise polite company who is unable to hold his or her liquor and seems bent on ruining an otherwise convivial party.
‘ In vino veritas’ is a Latin phrase that translates ‘in wine there is the truth’. This is linked to the important question of drunken comportment. The way we act when drunk is a litmus test of our general behaviour. Alcohol brings out underlying manners.
This is how certain men and women choose to behave when fuelled by the lack of restraint after drinks. Depending on their disposition, they might grow taciturn and weep into their cocktail. No one wants to see grown men crying when everyone else is in gales of laughter and having a great time.
There is the ideologue drunk who is always spouting his political, religious or philosophical views, which are usually very extreme, in purely social situations. The groper is usually a male guest who gets too friendly and can’t keep his hands to himself. He keeps touching and pawing much to the annoyance of a female guest or several of them. Let’s be clear about this kind of party animal. This behaviour verges on sexual harassment and must not be tolerated.
It would be a good idea to eject him from the party soon after the infraction, provided he hasn’t already been assaulted by the woman’s husband or boyfriend. The worst of these are the drunk and violent types. This person gets drunk then belligerent. And, nothing can ruin a party more quickly than a fight.
Learn to hold your liquor at whatever cost. Even if the drinks are flowing freely, avoid drinking too much. Few things are as disrespectful and uncomfortable at a party as a drunk, obnoxious guest, particularly at more elegant affairs.
To all these characters instead of having a good time the fashion is to be a nuisance. That is bad manners as well as being technically discourteous.
But rather than embracing festive merriment, many revellers simply resort to base behaviour – being abrasive and insulting, brawling, vomiting and urinating in public. Public intoxication charges, often called being ‘drunk and disorderly’, is a legal charge alleging that a person is visibly drunk or under the influence of drugs in public.
It is usually a misdemeanour crime under the law. Public intoxication laws exist to prevent people from disturbing others and misbehaving in public and to remove people who appear to be unable to stop themselves from hurting themselves or others.
Yet alcohol is a capricious character, flipping from faithful sidekick to spiteful psychopath in the space of a few small sips – and its unpredictability is particularly acute at Christmas.
With the holidays come family gatherings, office parties, socialising with friends and get-togethers. These are occasions we look forward to all year. But there can be a dark side to the holiday cheer: Drunk driving and the injuries and deaths that result.
Every December we see a spike in highway fatalities during the Christmas and New Year holiday periods. These appalling grim figures do not reflect the other horrific consequences of such accidents such as a child's loss of a parent, a wife's loss of her wage-earning husband, and the severe injuries and lost income innocent passengers may suffer.
Most of us enjoy hosting holiday parties for friends and family. However, with the decision to serve alcoholic beverages comes the responsibility to make certain our guests don't leave the party so impaired that they are unable to drive safely.
Keep an eye on your guests as you circulate during the party. If you observe someone take more than one or two alcoholic drinks or you see someone who shows signs of intoxication, be positive. Determine whether the person expects to drive himself home. If so, intervene and ensure that a sober driver takes him.
Many of us know family members or friends who drink too much at holiday parties. You recognise your husband, friend, brother or sister risk his or her life and the lives of others when he or she gets behind the wheel in an intoxicated state. Stick to the old safety adage: ‘If you drink don’t drive. If you drive don’t drink!’
Yes, it largely depends on you. For your own safety, think twice before you travel the roads and highways late at night during the holidays. There are more intoxicated drivers on the road in the late evening and early morning hours.
Contrary to what you might think you can party up a storm over the holidays and do it mindfully
Yes and you will stand out from the rest as the responsible man who can hold and handle alcohol just as he can handle everything else in life with total class and respect. Mindfulness means being truly present for the moments of our lives on every level –body, mind and soul. So as you party and play, stay connected to yourself in the present moment - so that you feel and experience the true spirit of celebratory bonhomie and fellowship.
When your energy is high, go for it – play and dance and laugh and share and revel in the energy of celebration! Go with the flow of festivity and soak it all up. The great thing about mindful merrymaking is that you stay in touch with yourself. So you see, the silly season can be a celebratory, toppingly mindful time that can leave you feeling light, refreshed and happy.
