EPC opposition party meets Governor Bogollagama

The opposition members of Eastern Provincial Council led by Opposition Leader M.S. Uthumalebbe, met the newly-appointed Governor of the Eastern Province Rohitha Bogollagama on Friday.
Uthumalebbe told theDaily News that the discussion was mainly focussed on the recent and the present political and social issues. They had brought strict conditions created for giving approval for the pilgrims who wish to perform Haj and Umrah during the month of Thul Kahthah and Thul Haj.
“The Eastern Province officers are implementing some new rules on the issue. These rules are not implemented in the other provinces.
Especially the Education sector employees are restricted to get no-pay leaves for their pilgrimage,” said Uthumalebbe.
“The officers urge the applicants to submit unnecessary documents and order the applicants to go Makkah only during the vacation. It is a shame as the Muslims do Haj only during the month of Thul Haj. We condemn the new rule that if anyone visited Makkah during the last five years in the name of performing Umrah or Haj, they would not be able to apply for for no-pay leaves,” Uthumalebbe added.
“The Governor agreed to remove the restrictions after negotiating with the relevant officers,” he said.
M.S. Uthumalebbe, M.L.A. Ameer and Nagalingam Thiraviyam participated in the discussion.
