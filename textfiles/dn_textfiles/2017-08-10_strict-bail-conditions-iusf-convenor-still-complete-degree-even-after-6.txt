Strict bail conditions for IUSF Convenor: Still to complete degree even after 6 years

Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke yesterday told Inter-University Students' Federation (IUSF) Convenor Lahiru Weerasekera that a student leader should be exemplary to the younger generation without causing disturbance to public and damaging public property.
Weerasekera, arrested on charges of causing damages to public property by forcibly entering Health Ministry premises during an anti-SAITM protest was released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
He was released on a cash bail of Rs.10,000 with three sureties of Rs.500,000. The High Court Judge warned that bail could be cancelled and remanded until the conclusion of the trial, if he violated bail conditions.
Judge Waidyatilleke made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court decision not to grant bail.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that Weerasekera had entered University in 2011 to follow an applied science degree but he still failed to complete the degree programme even after a lapse of six years.
"He is currently having 10 pending court cases in several Magistrate's Courts," SSC Bandara said.
Defence counsel appearing on behalf of Lahiru Weerasekara moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over a month. The Attorney General did not raise objections to release the suspect on bail.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Gamini Alwis appeared for Weerasekera.
