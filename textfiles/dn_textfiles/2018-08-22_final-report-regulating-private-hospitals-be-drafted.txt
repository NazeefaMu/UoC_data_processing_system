Final report on regulating private hospitals to be drafted

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne instructed Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe to draft the final report on regulating the prices of private hospitals and other private medical institutions, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the final report will be gazetted after drafting it under the supervision of Dr. Jasinghe. The government has already removed VAT from private hospital charges.
Doctors’ charges will also be included in the `package of charges’ under the direction of Minister Senaratne.
The Health Ministry will make arrangements to regulate the prices of 46 services offered by private hospitals under the regulating system. At present, private hospitals charge different prices for the same surgery or laboratory tests, he said.
The Health Ministry has received several complaints from the public on the high rates charged by some private hospitals. Minister Senaratne had previously received information on certain incidents where over Rs. two million was charged from patients by certain private hospitals although the patients had not recovered, he added.
