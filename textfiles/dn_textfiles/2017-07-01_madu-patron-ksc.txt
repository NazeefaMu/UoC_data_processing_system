Madu-Patron of KSC

Dharmasiri Madugalle, the oldest living Kandy Sports Club ruggerite and captain deserves the honour bestowed on him by being made Patron. He was named Patron for 2017-18 at the AGM held recently.
Madu was a fine ruggerite to come out of Trinity College from 1950 and led the school team in 1953. Under his leadership Trinity won the Bradby Shield 13-0 and 3-0.
He was a good athlete and had the privilege of leading both the rugger and the athletic teams at Trinity in 1952 and 1953. He was a fine wing-three-quarter and played for Kandy SC as a schoolboy in 1953 and went on till 1961.
He was in the Kandy SC’s first cup final team in 1954 and the following year 1955.
He was a member of the Sri Lanka team from 1955 to 1965. In 1964 he led Kandy SC and in 1966 he led Up-Country.
He was in the first all Ceylon team which took part in the All Indian tournament.
He became the first Kandy SC captain to hold the President and Patron’s posts. As a president he executed his duties well because he had played the game at the highest level and he knew how to promote the game.
People of his caliber are sadly missing at the club today.
4500 girls and boys were in action
Around 4500 girls and boys were in action at the Central Province Schools Athletic Championships, which was organized under the direction of chief minister Sarath Ekanayake who is also the education minister.
The meet was organized by the Central Education Department. A big hand should go to Director of Education E.P.T.K. Ekanayake, Zonal director W.M. Wijeratne, and Sports Director Athula Jayewardene for a good job done. This four day meet was held at the Bogambara Stadium. In the girls section A.Ratnayake Central College was placed first for the 25th consecutive year. They collected 396 points.

Sean coach, Saliya assistant and Kapila manager
Once again Sean Wijesinghe coach, Saliya Kumara assistant and Kapila Silva manager will officiate in their capacity for Kandy SC in the forthcoming season.
They might just be the most valuable resource we have in our game right now. They will have the fullest backing from the rugby chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya who is also the vice president and the kingmaker of the game Malik Samarawickrema both know what rugby is all about and its promotion.
Today this club committee is with more members who have not played the game but they can cheer and clap and inspire the team. Wijesinghe learnt his rugby at Trinity, Kumara at Vidyartha College and later at Trinity and Kapila Silva at Isipathana College.
Kandy SC to call for SGM to correct accounts
It is alleged by some members that at the last Kandy SC committee headed by N. Ratwate failed to present the accounts correctly, and one of the senior persons in the rugby circle Tuan Dole pointed out this shortcoming.
Now they have to face an SGM. Sad to say all this is because of poor management. Fans are querying whether Kandy SC’s golden run is about to end with inefficient members around. Today management wise it is apparently in a mess.
Kandy’s Ransilu sets Asian record
A product of Kingswood College Ransilu Jayatilaka made Kandy proud by setting a new Asian record. He finished 5th in the 120kg category and in the dead lift was able to lift 315 kg.
This as at the 5th open world, sub-junior master classic power lifting championship held at Belarus. Ransilu is also famous in the rugby field where he is a physical trainer.

In the next round they have to play with Trinity, Mahinda and St. Peter’s. Senaka Dissanayake is the coach.
Schools badly affected at rugby
Schools are to make a request to bring down the ground fee at Nittawela. For a match they have to pay Rs. 70,000, then for practices Rs. 8000 and only 30 players can practice. This is the property of the KMC, which is on lease from 1950’s and renewed every five years for a few thousand rupees. In the good old days it was mentioned in the agreement that the grounds should be given to the village sportsman and also for schools for sports.
Today it is for big money and schools can’t afford it.
Schools rugby 7’s today
Today will be the first day of the schools rugby 7’s. St. Anthony’s, Vidyartha, Kingswood, Trinity, Dharmaraja, Sri Sumangala and St. Sylvester’s are expected to play well.
