Ceylinco Life begins work on Chilaw branch green building

Ceylinco Life has commenced construction of a new eco-friendly building to house its branch in Chilaw, continuing efforts to reduce the company’s carbon footprint.
The laying of the foundation stone for the two-storey, 6,000 square-foot building took place recently at No 90 A, Kurunegala Road, Chilaw on land owned by the life insurance leader.
The new building is designed for optimal use of natural light and will be entirely solar powered. It will also be equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems, will have a facility for rainwater harvesting and its own car park.
Conforming to the ‘Go Green’ programme launched by Ceylinco Life, all trees on the property would be preserved during and after construction, the company said.
In January this year Ceylinco Life laid the foundation stone for a similar eco-friendly branch building in Kadawatha.
Among the other Ceylinco Life branch buildings designed to the company’s sustainable energy model are those at Horana, Panadura, Wennappuwa and Bandarawela.
The company also owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincolmalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, and many of them have already been converted to solar energy.
Additionally, Ceylinco Life’s head office building at Havelock Road, Colombo 5 has its own solar electricity system which generates 63.18kw of electricity and is one of the largest of its kind in the city.
The company operates the largest network of 250 plus branches in Sri Lanka’s life insurance industry, giving it a physical presence in 142 cities, towns and villages in every districts.
