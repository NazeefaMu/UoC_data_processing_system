Praneeth excels in Asian Surfing

The Sri Lankan surfer Praneeth Sadaruwan made it up to top 8 but was unable to beat the professional Indonesian surfers in the quarter final at the Asian Sufing Championship in India. "The Indonesians were all excellent, sponsored surfers" he says. The Indonesians took over the semi finals and final, where Billabong athlete Raditya Rondi ended up winning the championship, and 10 000$ along with other gifts.
This is not the first time Praneeth Sadaruwan is showing great talent in surfing. In 2013 he won the Red Bull local hero tour in Sri Lanka and last year he ended up third in the Red Bull Both Ways event in Maldives. Still, competing internationally is relatively new for him, as it is for all Sri Lankan surfers.
Praneeth says competing in the event was a great experience and he is hoping to participate the ASC or other international competitions in the future as well.
