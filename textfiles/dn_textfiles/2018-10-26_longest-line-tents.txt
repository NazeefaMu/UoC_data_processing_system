Longest line of tents

The Guinness World Record for longest line of tents was set in China when 721 tents were pitched on a mountain walkway.
The Wugong Mountain Outdoor Sports Association said the 4,863.6-foot-long line of tents was set up at the Wugong Mountain tourist site’s sky-high walkway on the slopes of the mountain.
The tents were pitched Saturday as part of a festival of events and were counted by Guinness representatives Sunday to confirm the record.
Organizers said more than 200 volunteers fought against wind and rain while setting up the tents.
