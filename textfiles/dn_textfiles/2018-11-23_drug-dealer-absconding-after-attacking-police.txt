Drug dealer absconding after  attacking police

A drug dealer who threw chili powder onto police officers and attacked them with a club was still absconding, Sigiriya Police said.
A team of police officials attached to the Dambulla ASP’s Office, had attempted to apprehend a suspect at a grocery in Inamaluwa. The suspect, who is also the owner of the grocery, had attacked the officials and escaped.
Police had searched the shop and detected 102 tablets containing cannabis (each weighing 10 grams). Police said the suspect had been carrying out the business for a long period.
The suspect was a former member of the Dambulla Urban Council as well. Investigations are continuing.
