SLFP has not decided to continue with Executive Presidency - Chandrika

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has not taken a decision to continue with the Executive Presidency, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge said yesterday.
Answering a question from a journalist following a media briefing in Colombo, the former President said that if such a proposal is on offer, it should be presented to the SLFP Central Committee and get the approval.
While admitting she too had heard comments on the above subject she said, however, the SLFP had not taken any decision on the matter. She said although there was no war in the country, one cannot be satisfied with the progress of the efforts to usher in reconciliation between the two major communities.
She said all should set aside petty differences and join hands to usher in lasting reconciliation and unity. The former President was addressing the media on “National Unity and Reconciliation through Higher Education”.
The event was organised by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and the University Grants Commission.
