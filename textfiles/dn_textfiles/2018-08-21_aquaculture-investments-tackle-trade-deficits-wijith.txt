Aquaculture investments to tackle trade deficits: Wijith

Increasing investments in the fisheries sector was the best way to reduce the country’s trade and budget deficits, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said.
Addressing the Investors Forum for Aquaculture - 2018 held yesterday at the Waters Edge, the Fisheries minister pledged to take necessary measures to acquire more lands for the use of aquaculture investments, adding that aquaculture provided both food and economic gain to the country.
“We hope to present a Cabinet paper on the acquisition of lands for aquaculture investments and submit a special proposal to Parliament, seeking funds from next year's Budget,” the minister said. “If the government provides necessary facilities to increase investments in the fisheries sector, there is no need to obtain loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),” he said.
The minister queried as to how a country could move forward without strengthening its economy.
The Investors Forum for Aquaculture is annually organised by the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA), to provide detailed information on the status of the country's aquaculture, as well as its investment opportunities.
State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, Deputy Minister Ameer Ali, NAQDA Chairman Nuwan Prasantha Madawan Arachchi, Director-General Nimal Chandraratne, as well as local and foreign investors participated in the event.
