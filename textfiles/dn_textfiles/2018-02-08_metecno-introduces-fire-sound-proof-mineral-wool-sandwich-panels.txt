One of Sri Lanka’s premier total roofing solutions provider Metecno Lanka, (Formerly known as Metroof (Pvt) Ltd) made its mark in the country’s construction arena by being one of the pioneers to introduce zinc-aluminum roofing sheets in 1993 and introduction of the Polyurethane Sandwich Panels in 2007, which features an excellent heat resistant polyurethane layer sandwiched between two steel sheets revolutionized the roofing industry.
Metecno Lanka has yet again contributed for the construction industry by investing in a brand new continuous panel line for Mineral Wool (Rock Wool) sandwich panels.
The new line is equipped to manufacture mineral wool panels using high density mineral wool blocks which are fire proof and sound proof.
The new production line is now supplying the market with mineral wool (Rock Wool) sandwich panels with world class quality.
Mineral Wool also known as Rock Wool is made of basalt, a volcanic stone. Rock Wool is non-combustible with a melting point of more than 1000° C.
They are particularly suitable for thermal insulation, fire protection and sound reduction and absorption.
It is inorganic and contains no nutritious substances. Hence, it will not be affected by microorganisms. Rock Wool also does not rot and attracts no vermin. Mineral Wool is non-combustible, causes no smoke development and produces no toxic gases.

This time we have introduced a sandwich panel capable of withstanding extreme heat and absorb extreme sound. The products are manufactured from a state-of-the-art continuous line.
These panels will help safeguard buildings against fire and insulate against sound pollution.
We are confident that the introduction of the new panel line will be a success like our other products, Director and CEO of Metecno Lanka, Anuksha Sri Nammuni said.

I can recommend Metecno products with confidence to anybody based on the results of the stringent quality checks and the comments received from clients who have already used the product”, added Anuksha Sri Nammuni, CEO of Metecno Lanka Limited.
