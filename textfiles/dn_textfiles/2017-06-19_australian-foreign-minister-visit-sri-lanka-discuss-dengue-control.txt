Australian Foreign Minister to visit Sri Lanka to discuss dengue control

 
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop MP will visit Sri Lanka next month to discuss on the possibility of using the bacteria discovered by an Australian to control dengue mosquitoes.
Minister Senaratne said that the study shows successful results and the bacteria can be used in Sri Lanka to control dengue mosquitoes.
The research was done by the Monash University in Australia.
The bacteria can reduce the power of dengue mosquitoes and researches were carried out in Indonesia, Vietnam etc.
Apart from controlling dengue mosquitoes, the bacteria is used in agricultural activities.
Meanwhile the National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Programme Hasitha Thisera said that if the study works out, the bacteria can be used in all parts of the country to control dengue.
