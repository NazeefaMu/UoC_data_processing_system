First heart transplant patient gets a new house

W.A. Pushpakumari (34) of Kaluarachchiyagama, Hidogama, the first patient who underwent a trailblazing heart transplant in Sri Lanka on July 7, 2017, received a fully equipped house with air conditioning, from the Nachchaduwa Divisional Secretariat.
The medical team led by Dr. Anil Abeywickrama who conducted the successful operation had said Pushpakumari needed to live in a house with air conditioning if she was to safeguard her health after the surgery. Nachchaduwa Divisional Secretary Sarath Wijesinghe, responding to this request, handed over the ownership of a fully equipped house with air conditioning to her, yesterday.
Pushpakumari and her husband Vijaya Kumarasiri said they wished to thank the medical team led by Dr. Abeywickrama and the Nachchaduwa Divisional Secretary and his staff for volunteering to fulfill their prime need by gifting the house.
