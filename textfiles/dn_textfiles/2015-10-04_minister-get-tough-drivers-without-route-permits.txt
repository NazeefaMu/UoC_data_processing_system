Minister to get tough with drivers without route permits

The bus drivers operating buses without valid route permits will be punished severely in due course. Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva told the Daily News in Kurunegala.
The minister also said that he would increase the fine imposed on such drivers up to Rs. 100,000. They are presently fined up to Rs. 10,000. The present amount of penalty is not sufficient and hence the minister is planning to increase the fine by Rs. 90,000.
Amendments to the existing rules and regulations will be carried out in this regard to discourage the errant drivers.
However, 90 such drivers are reported from the Northern Province who drive without valid route permits.
The minister has instructed his top officials to arrest the errant drivers and their buses. These buses are reported to be belonging to high government officials and politicians, the minister said.
