Govt on witch-hunt against Rajapaksa's - JO

Joint Opposition member Prof. G.L Peiris said yesterday that the government is unsuccessful in all fronts and it is now trying to hunt down Rajapaksas.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said its failure in all aspects are clearly visible, at a time when it completed two years in office.
Certain government ministers have said that special court should be set up to investigate corruption that occurred during the precious regime. He alleged that the government is exacting the political revenge by using the law. Even, Hitler did not have special courts to try members of one family. Everyone is equal before the law and the law can to target specific individuals according to the wishes of the ruling party. If there is enough evidences, the suspects can be
indicted. But we are totally against the political revenge. There is a proposal of having a Trial-at-bar to try the Rajapaksas. But so far Trails-at-Bar have been used only for murder cases. So this is exactly the government’s attempt to initiate political revenge.
Only the Chief Justice can take a such a decision on the request of the Attorney General and we do not think he will make a such a request,”he added. Several government Ministers have been charged with massive corruption and fraud. So what is the action taken against them by the government?
Commenting on the government’s attempt to bring a no confidence motion against Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, he said that Minister Rajapaksa has not committed any crime or corruption or breached any laws in relation to fraud. The reason for bringing the no confidence motion against him is his statement on the Hambantota port and a heated argument he had with visiting UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter Terrorism recently.Therefore, we will take our decision considering all facts an aspects once the motion presented to Parliament.
Joint Opposition member MP Dinesh Gunawardene said the government has failed to fulfill his pledges even after a lapse of two year. Yet, the government has failed to announce at least a possible date for the holding of the local government election.The economy is about to collapse while the people are deprived of basic needs and not even provided any reliefs to uplift their livelihoods. Therefore, the Joint Opposition will hold the peaceful demonstration against the
government today in Town Hall at 2pm.
