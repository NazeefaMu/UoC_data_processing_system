The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority to host the sixth annual Sri Lanka Tourism Awards on December 6th at Shangri-La Hotel Colombo, following a six-year gap.
The award ceremony is aimed at celebrating the achievements of Sri Lanka’s Tourism industry stakeholders, recognizing contributions made by organizations as well as individuals and uplifting the industry standards through the promotion of competition.
Kishu Gomes, the Head of the Jury shared,
“We successfully concluded the process of judging with several rounds of deliberations, with extra scrutiny by the 3 expert panels as recommended by the grand jury for more prudent decision making that included site visits and ‘one on one’ interviews for individual categories. We, as the jury are satisfied with the very transparent and unbiased process, followed that the process was audited by the Ernst & Young from the start to the very end.
Trevin Gomez, the coordinator of the prestigious award ceremony used all his experience and insights to fully support the entire process not limiting his input to coordination only”
Ruwan Fernando, Country Managing Partner Ernst & Young Sri Lanka stated,
“We consider it an honor to have been the Facilitation Partner for the Judging Process of the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards 2018. The process followed by the Technical Committees and the Final Jury was guided by the evaluation criteria communicated to all applicants which were well structured and objective, backed by a transparent process with strong deliberations by the evaluating team".
SLTDA will honour 72 best performers in the industry, under 11 award categories this Thursday.
