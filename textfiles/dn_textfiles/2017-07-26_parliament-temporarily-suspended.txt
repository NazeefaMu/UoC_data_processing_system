Parliament temporarily suspended

 
The parliament was temporarily suspended following a tense situation today.
The tense situation erupted after the Prime Minister made a statement over the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) strike.
The unions launched their strike as of 12 midnight on July 24 in protest of the proposed lease of the Hambantota Port Oil Tank to the China Merchants Ports Holdings Company Ltd. (CMPort).
