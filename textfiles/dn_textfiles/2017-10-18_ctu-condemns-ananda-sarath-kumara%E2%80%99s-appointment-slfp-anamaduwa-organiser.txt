CTU condemns Ananda Sarath Kumara’s  appointment as SLFP Anamaduwa Organiser

The Ceylon Teachers’ Union (CTU) yesterday criticised the appointment of North Central Provincial Councilor Ananda Sarath Kumara as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Organiser for the Anamaduwa Electorate.
Ceylon Teachers’ Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin said in 2014, Sarath Kumara was sentenced to two years Rigorous Imprisonment suspended for seven years by the Puttalam Hight Court and ordered to pay compensation amounting to Rs.300,000 for forcing a female school teacher to kneel before him. He was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs.50,000 and in default, serve a prison term of six months.”
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa refused to grant nominations to him and President Maithripala Sirisena too cannot justify by appointing him.
“President Sirisena’s decision to reappoint Ananda is a major threat to the public service.Asking a female school teacher to kneel down was not a minor incident. We were surprised by the President’s decision and urge him to reconsider it or we would have to take stern action over the matter,” Stalin added.
