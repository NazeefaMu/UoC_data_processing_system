Sri Lanka Army participates in ‘Mitra Shakthi’ Exercise

The Sri Lankan Army contingent in India, participating in the Exercise ‘Mitra Shakthi’ during the past few days, was able to learn Indian infantry tactics, weapon training, strategic approaches, etc. in addition to the active participation in mock situations.
Troops participating in the Exercise were taken on a familiarization tour in and around the AUNDH Cantonment and India’s Pune city where the Indian Army’s Southern Command Headquarters is located, on Sunday.
The field visit was arranged by Exercise authorities of the Indian Army and all troops were divided into groups before they were accompanied by members of the Indian Army.
On the 6th day (Monday) of the Exercise Mitra Shakthi, troops rehearsed jungle lane firing and slithering in demarcated Exercise areas. After initial briefings, troops paddled across a lake to the starting point of the jungle lane. Troops were issued with safety gear and a paintball gun each for this purpose and the lane consisted of 16 targets. Sri Lankan troops succeeded in hitting all 16 to score during the Exercise.
