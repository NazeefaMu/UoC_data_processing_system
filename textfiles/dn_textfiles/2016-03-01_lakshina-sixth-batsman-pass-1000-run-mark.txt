Lakshina - sixth batsman to pass 1000 run mark

 
Sri Lanka schools under 19 cap and wicket keeper and star batsman of St. Peter's College, Bambalapitiya Lakshina Rodrigo passed the magical 1000 runs and became the sixth first eleven schoolboy cricketer to achieve this milestone this year.
He scored a chanceless unbeaten 102 runs which comprised ten hits to the ropes and six over it against formidable Trinity College, Kandy at their own den in the semi finals of the under 19 Division one inter schools cricket tournament for the Singer Trophy.
When he walked into the middle he was short of 84 runs for this rare achievement and now his tally stands at 1016 runs with three matches in hand at an healthy average of 63.5.
Playing in the under 17 tournament he passed the 300 run mark and took 35 victims as the stumper and in the following year he was the vice captain and scored 550 runs and took 25 victims and played for the District and Provincial teams. In the same year he was selected for play for Twenty20 Coca Cola Pathway team and played against the Indian Coca Cola team and earned the Best All rounders award.
Representing the second eleven team he scored 750 runs with the top score of 102 versus Royal College Colombo and claimed 30 victims as the gloveman.
Last year in the first eleven team coached by Keerthi Gunaratne he collected 860 runs and had 45 victims behind the stumps. This year too he is in fine form and his Rector, the School authorities and Peterites young and old are expecting much from him in the Joe-Peterite Big match and the one dayer.
