Former LTTers learn IT

The Army has initiated an IT course for former LTTE combatants now serving in the Civil Security Department (CSD) as permanent employees, after rehabilitation
The course is being conducted at the 57 Division Headquarters on the directions of Kilinochchi Commander Major General Niyshshanka Ranawana at the Utility Complex in Kilinochchi.
The first group of 11 CSD personnel underwent the 35-day IT course from September 6 to October 12. They were awarded proficiency certificates during a brief closing ceremony chaired by 57 Division General Officer Commanding Major General Vijitha Ravipriya.
The course participants, now attached to the Vishwamadu CSD, received instructional guidance for the course from Lance Corporal M.A.N.P.T Manathunge of the 11 Sri Lanka Signal Corps.
