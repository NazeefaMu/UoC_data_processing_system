1990 Suwasariya Ambulance Service to be expanded

The 1990 Suwasariya Ambulance Service, which has proven its efficiency in a short period since its commencement, will recruit 1300 new staff members to expand its service island wide.
Accordingly, vacancies are called for 650 Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) and 650 Ambulance Drivers who are below the age of 35. Two hundred and nine ambulances will be added to the service as part of the extension as well.
The government initiated the Suwasariya Ambulance Service in mid last year with 88 ambulances and 500 Sri Lankan staff in the Western and Southern provinces aided by the Government of India.
Many groups with their own personal agendas attempted to mislead the public by milling rumours and leveling allegations. There was a rumour campaign which mislead the unemployed youths stating that persons with Indian nationality are to be recruited as staff members for the 1990 ambulance service.
However, the Suwasariya proved itself with its excellent service and at present, the government is in the process of setting up a foundation to be called “The 1990 Suwasariya Foundation” to continue the service and extend it islandwide. The islandwide extension will be done through a grant given by the Indian Government. National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, while visiting the 1990 Suwaseriya Command and Control Center at Rajagiriya, said this service “perhaps one of the most efficient operations in Sri Lanka.” He also commended the 500 plus staff employed at the center while stating that he is “so proud” of the commitment they all have shown. “This service’s current response time is less than 13 minutes. Around 99.6% of calls are answered in the first ring. Over 40,000 emergency patients transferred to hospitals. Just imagine if we were able to save just 1% of lives! Obviously the figure has to be more. We are inundated with ‘thanks’ coming from so many quarters,” Dr. Harsha de Silva said. “We are now in the final phase of the Act of Parliament to incorporate the 1990 Foundation which will be fully owned by the Government of Sri Lanka and run as an independent entity. The discussions are currently on with the Government of India and things are moving rapidly in finalising the islandwide rollout using the USD 15m grant, which is not a loan, but a grant just like the USD 07 million for the first phase,” he further said.
