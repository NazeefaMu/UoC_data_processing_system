A Parliament of MPs without Government - Dinesh:
UNF HAS 113 SEATS TO FORM CABINET - RAJITHA

United National Front MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, claimed that they have in hand the required majority of members to appoint the Cabinet.
Responding to our question whether the United National Front was endowed with 113 members to appoint a new Cabinet, Senaratne replied: “Sure, we have that number.”
Asked when the new Cabinet will be appointed, he said the MPs of the United National Front was to meet last evening (18) at Temple Trees to decide who will be ministers in the new Cabinet.
“Once that is decided we will prepare a list of names of the members to be appointed to the UNF government’s Cabinet,” he said.”
We will hand over that list to the President,” he said.
Dr. Senaratne added that there will be more crossovers to the UNF government from the United People’s Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Contrariwise, UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said last evening that UNF still does not have in their possession 113 seats in Parliament.
They have brought about a fate that the country is now endowed with a Parliament of MPs without a government, which has but a Prime Minister. “Now, Parliament will meet without a government on UNF’s account,” he said. Asked if there would be crossovers from their side (UPFA) to UNF, Gunawardena said there would also be crossovers from UNF to their side (UPFA)
“It is very much expected under the current political climate,” he said.
