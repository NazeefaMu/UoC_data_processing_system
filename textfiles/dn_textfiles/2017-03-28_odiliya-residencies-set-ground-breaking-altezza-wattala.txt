Odiliya Residencies set off ground breaking for ALTEZZA Wattala

Odiliya Residencies (Pvt) Ltd, the latest addition to the Odiliya Group held the ground breaking ceremony for the construction work of Altezza luxury apartments amongst some distinguished guests, customers, staff and well-wishers on March 23, 2017 at the project site, Aweriwatta Road, Wattala.
Altezza, as its name suggest, is the highest building in the Wattala area with 60 luxury apartments of different floor areas and with all luxury amenities.
All 60 apartment units in the project Altezza are well designed by a renowned firm of Chartered Architects and all construction work will be done using quality building materials from cement to paints and electrical work to plumbing. At the roof top- you find a state-of-the-art gymnasium, club house and a swimming pool exclusively for the use of the residents. Being first in the Wattala area, Altezza Residencies will stand tall with a blend of urban outlook in a countryside atmosphere, which sets an ideal footing for a halcyon life.
The project is expected to be completed within two years and prices of the apartment units are starting from Rs.12 million and all the two bed room apartment were sold out.
Briefing to the media Rohitha Abeygunaratne, Managing Director of the Odiliya Homes Group of Companies told that Altezza is one of the remarkable milestones of the gradual and steady progress of the group. He further added that apartment business is the fast growing business segment of the country in present context and the government has taken some positive steps to foster this segment, namely complete removal of the restriction imposed earlier on the purchase of apartments to the foreigners from fourth floor onwards, exempting the sale of apartments from VAT, relaxation of resident visa system for foreigners who invest in Sri Lanka, to quote a few.
According to Rohitha Abeygunaratne, with encouragements given by the government to this segment, customers could look at purchasing an apartment in two angles; one is the residential purpose and the other being the investment purpose. Whatever the objective that could be, the customer will be benefitted ultimately in terms of value appreciation and guaranteed actualization of capital gain each year. So this is a golden opportunity for the customers that should not let go out of their investment plans, he said.
Rohitha Abeygunaratne attributed the reputation earned by the name Odiliya in the real estate industry and the confidence reposed on the company by customers of different social strata over the past years triggered by the untiring efforts of the staff of the group are the root causes for the growth of the group.
Dhammika Dissanayake, Sales Manager of Altezza Residencies said that since the highest quality materials would be used for the project there should not be any concern in the minds of the customers as to the strength and durability of the apartments. He also told that the even before the commencement of the constructions, 40% of the units was sold and reservations were done by customers, which itself provides good credentials on the customer demand.
