Comforting a sick dog

Identify a sick dog
Dogs are friendly companion animals, who cannot talk to express their requirements. Therefore you have to identify when the dog is sick and informed to the veterinarian. Always try to meet a qualified vet to treat your dog. You know your own dog better than anyone else, so you may be the first to notice that something is wrong.
According to the age and breed of the dog behaviors can be changed. Older dogs and some breeds of dogs are very lazy and they sleep most of the time. But puppies and some breeds of dogs are very energetic and are very active. You must have thorough understanding about the behavior pattern of your dog before you decide whether the animal is sick or not.
Signs of sickness
It's important to understand that dogs do not generally exhibit signs of illness when they first become sick. It is believed that they instinctively hide their illness as a form of self-protection as appearing weak would make them vulnerable in the wild. In addition, dogs are not emotionally attached to their own discomfort the way humans are, so they are more likely to act normally when they feel sick.
Here are some signs to watch for that might indicate the need for veterinary attention. When in doubt, don't wait. If your pet exhibits any signs that do not seem normal, call your vet right away. There are two main types of signs
1. General signs
Body temperature over 104 F or under 99 F (normal is typically 100.5 C -102.5 C), Poor appetite, Lethargy, Weakness, Appetite change associated with weight loss or gain and change in activity level, sleeping more than normal, or other behavior or attitude changes are some general signs of a sick dog.

The information needed for the vet
As your dog cannot talk you have to visit the vet with information making it easy for the vet to get a clue about the disease. This will help quick diagnosis, treatment and minimize the miss diagnosis. Information that you have to carry are the changes of the behavior, eating and drinking pattern and amount, details of stools and urine, details of gesture and posture, any discharge from any part of the body (colour and amount), previous history of diseases, vaccination record, anything you might feel important for the vet etc.
Common diseases
There are several diseases of dogs commonly present in Sri Lanka. They are Parvo viral diarrhea, Distemper, Mange, pyometra, Tick fever and gastro intestinal tract diseases. Some of these diseases are curable and mainly viral diseases are incurable. Dogs should be vaccinated against viral diseases annually.
Preventing diseases
Vaccination is the main method of preventing diseases. Dogs have to be vaccinated against Parvo viral disease at the age of 6-8 weeks, 3 months and annually. Distemper vaccination should be given at the age of 8-10 weeks, 3 months and annually. Deadly Rabies disease can be prevented by vaccinating at the age of 6 weeks (or when you get the dog), 14 weeks after first vaccination and annually.
There are treatments for other diseases. Tick fever can be prevented by oral drugs. Worms can be prevented by worm treatment. Before giving any treatment to your pet dog it is a must to consult a vet.
Keeping the sick dog comfortably
When your pet is sick it needs love and care. You have to follow all instructions that is given by the vet for quick recovery. Keep the dog in a calm and quiet place as external sounds may disturb the rest. The place should be comfortable and warm. Don’t keep on the cement floor which is very cool. If the vet recommended making the dog warm place glass bottles filled with warm water around it. Refill the warm water into these bottles when they are cold. Love and pet the dog and don’t allow to be left alone. If the dog passes urine and tools remove all and clean the body with warm water. Do not bathe the dog until the vet recommends. Wet sponge bath is recommended for cleaning only.
