HNB recognized for innovation in microfinance at IFM Awards 2017

HNB won the award for Most Innovative Microfinance Bank in Sri Lanka at the recently concluded International Finance Magazine Awards (IFM) 2017 in Singapore.
Organized by International Finance Magazine with a view to celebrating individuals and organisations in the international finance industry that have had a significant impact in their respective markets through an emphasis on value addition and innovation, this year’s awards drew extensive participation from among Asia Pacific’s most respected industry leaders.
Following a stringent round of evaluations, HNB was presented with the award for innovation in microfinance, in recognition of its remarkable, holistic efforts to extend vibrant and genuinely valuable microfinance services to the widest possible spectrum of customers in Sri Lanka.
“A substantial proportion of Sri Lanka’s economy is built on the efforts of microfinance entrepreneurs and SMEs, and we remain confident in the ability of this sector to serve as an engine of unprecedented growth, provided they are facilitated with the necessary access to finance, knowledge, skills and other advisory services for such businesses to thrive.
HNB’s approach prioritizes the early identification of promising businesses with a view to forming lasting partnerships capable of unleashing and sustaining growth at every stage of the business.
“This award therefore stands as further vindication of HNB’s tried and tested approach to microfinance and we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated team of employees and field officers who have been at the heart of our success.” HNB Deputy General Manager – SME & Midmarket, Jude Fernando stated.
Standing as the very first Sri Lankan bank to enter the market with a branded product exclusively for the microfinance sector with HNB Gami Pubuduwa in 1989, the bank has utilized its invaluable experience as a true pioneer in the field to extend vital financial services to underserved communities across the island, while tailoring its approach to suite the unique conditions prevalent in the Sri Lankan market.
