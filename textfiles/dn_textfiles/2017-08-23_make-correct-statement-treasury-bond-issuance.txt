Make correct statement on Treasury Bond issuance

UNP backbencher Nalin Bandara yesterday insisted that State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena correct his statement on the issuance of Treasury Bonds on February 27,2015 to have caused a loss of Rs. 1 Trillion over the cause of 30 years.
MP Bandara was addressing the media at Sirikotha last morning.
MP Bandara further said it is but simple Mathematics to realise that the loss calculation is erroneous. He also said State Minister Abeywardena who claims himself a former banker, should realise that according to his loss calculation, the annual interest rate for the said Rs.10 billion Treasury bonds maturing in 30 years would be approximately 333%.
MP Bandara also leveled criticism against State Minister Lakshman Yapa for questioning the subcommittee on Economic Affairs headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
“This subcommittee includes SLFP ministers such as Nimal Siripala de Silva and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa. I wonder if State Minister Lakshman Yapa does not know about their presence in the subcommittee,” MP Bandara said.
MP Bandara pointed out that State Minister Lakshman Yapa laid low when he was a minister in the previous regime and kept silent when former President Mahinda Mahinda Rajapaksa took crucial decisions regarding the country’s economy while allegedly having tea with his family at Temple Trees.
MP Bandara demanded that State Minister Yapa stop brewing conflicts between various people in the Yahapalana government.
Commenting on the manner in which former First Lady Shiranthi Rajapaksa appeared to testify before the CID in connection with the Thajudeen murder case, MP Bandara alleged that she has adapted the scenes from a South-Indian movie over the imprisonment of Jayalalitha Jayram.
MP Bandara wondered if the former First Lady wants to establish south-Indian political stature in Sri Lanka as well. “She allegedly brings people from different parts of the country and makes a scene at the CID. We would like to request everyone who will be testifying before the CID to do it in a respectable manner without all the drama,” MP Bandara said.
Meanwhile, commenting on the present status of Sri Lanka Cricket, MP Bandara observed that the removal of responsible parties should reach the higher levels.
“First they removed the captain. Then they removed the head coach and then the team manager. All attempts failed.
It is high time the President of the Cricket Board and the Minister of Sports should also shoulder the responsibility,” MP Bandara pointed out.
