They still haven't beaten the mighty  New Zealand - Zinzan Brooke: England should not 'pop champagne' if they equal unbeaten record

All Blacks legend Zinzan Brooke says England do not deserve to ëpop champagneí if they equal his countryís 18-Test record tomorrow because they have still not beaten the Kiwis.
Despite being undefeated under Eddie Jones, Brooke believes Englandís winning run would come to an abrupt end if they faced Steve Hansenís All Blacks.
England have not played the No 1-ranked Kiwis since 2014 and, speaking to Sportsmail, Brooke claimed the Red Rose record is ëjust a numberí. ëIs this England team as good as the New Zealand team that won 18 in a row? No,í said Brooke.
ëWhich coach would relish a Test between England and the All Blacks? Iíd say Steve Hansen. Theyíre in a good place for a team that lost 750 caps of experience.
ëIf I were in that England team, I wouldnít be popping a bottle of champagne. Youíve taken the record but you havenít played the team with back-to-back World Cups.
'How does that work? Youíve set a number but havenít played the best team in the world.í
New Zealandís 18-Test run included the 2015 World Cup final and overlapped the retirement of Kiwi legends Richie McCaw, Dan Carter and Maía Nonu, though interestingly they didnít face England during that time!
ëEnglandís run started against Uruguay,í added Brooke. ëThatís a good one, isnít it? But thereís nothing in clause 2.31 that says you have to play the best team in the world to break the record.
ëTheyíve been tripping up a little bit and Eddie Jones flipped his lid when Italy outsmarted them.
ëIíve watched quite a bit of the New Zealand franchises and the Lions are going to have to take 50 players down there. Some of the play is unbelievable.
ëWhen the All Blacks get together, Iíd back them against England.í ñ Daily Mail
