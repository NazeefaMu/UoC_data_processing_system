Leaves all over

Can you imagine a garden with plants without leaves? It lacks lustre! The Garden has no equilibrium. Leaves have a certain beauty. One first notices their symmetry and this symmetry is what makes it attractive. It offers a certain balance to the garden. Without it, a garden makes no sense.
A flower alone is incomplete. The leaves give it proportion. The leaves offer a certain form and without this form, a flower does not have its appeal. Leaves come in a variety of shades and colors. It takes so many shapes. Plants that have attractive leaves are called Foliage plants. They have flowers but the leaves are what are most attractive. Daily News speaks to Deputy Director of Provincial Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor G.D. Udaya Kumara on these plants who have a certain liveliness.
“The floriculture industry consists of the cultivation of Foliage plants, flowering ornamentals, cut flowers and others. In Sri Lanka this is for the local and export markets. Ornamental plants are used for decorative purposes in gardens. Foliage plants are highly valued because of their multifaceted designs,” said Udaya Kumara
They can be categorized into two-
• LIVE PLANTS- Plants with attractive foliage grown indoors as well as outdoors
• CUT LEAVES- Attractive leaves used to add color and shape to arrangements
“Cut leaves have many purposes. They can be used for Wedding, funerals and religious functions. In Sri Lanka these cut leaves are used for the export trade. Leaves of the following plants are used for export – Cane Palm, Fishtail Palm, Queen Palm and Ladies Finger Palm, Croton, Chinese Grass, Scindapsus, Syngonium, Cordyline, Dracaenas and Anthurium,” pointed out Udaya Kumara.
In many parts of the world Christmas is a special time. In European countries with the snowfall and the spirit of Christmas leaves play a special part. Cut leaves in particular. Eucalyptus leaves are said to be fragrant, calming and long lasting. Magnolia leaves are equally potent. Even in funerals leaves are used. A wreath is never the same without the leaves. Apart from artificial Christmas trees the natural ones have completely natural leaves.
“When you take plants suited for the local market they include – Hibiscus, Bougainvillea, African Violets, Euphorbia Heliconia,” added Udaya Kumara.
