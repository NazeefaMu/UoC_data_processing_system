NARA and NAQDA to conduct scientific research on star fish

 

It was reported to the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development that a variety of a Star fish which causes harmful effects to the corals are on the shores of the Eastern Sea.
This variety of Star fish is reported to have emanated a harmful substance in the form of a chemical enzyme which has been causing serious damage to the corals, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Minister Amaraweera disclosed this at the consultative committee meeting held at the Ministry recently and has issued directives to NARA and NAQDA to conduct a scientific research in this respect and also instructed to get necessary assistance of Sri Lanka Navy.
Prevalence of such Star fish had taken place a few years back in a similar manner and measures were taken to deter their prevalence on that occasion too.
