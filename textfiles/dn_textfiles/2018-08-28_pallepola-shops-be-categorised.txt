Pallepola shops to be categorised

The Pallepola Pradeshiya Sabha had taken measures to categorise shops and business centres within its jurisdiction according to their product quality. There are 400 shops in the Pallepola town, and each stop would receive a sticker that would correspond to its standards. Green colour stickers would indicate high quality, while yellow and red stickers would represent medium and low quality, respectively.
