Navy arrest five Indians for illegal fishing

Naval personnel attached to a Fast Attack Craft belonging to the Northern Naval Command arrested five Indian poachers and a fishing trawler engaged in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters west of the Delft Island on Sunday, the Navy media unit said..
The fishing trawler and their fishing gear are to be handed over to the Jaffna Assistant Director of Fisheries for legal action.
The Navy assisted another Indian fishing trawler in distress in close quarters of the IMBL north-west of the Analativu Island, as sea water trickled into the vessel. A Fast Attack Craft on patrol were rushed to the scene to control the damage and arrest the flood situation in the Indian trawler. Three Indian fishermen were aboard the trawler. It was handed over to another Indian trawler close by to be flanked.
