India celebrates 72nd Independence Day

The Indian High Commission celebrated India’s 72nd Independence Day, hoisting the Indian flag at the Indian High Commission premises, yesterday.
Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and Maldives Taranjit Singh Sandhu read out a message from Indian President Shri Ram Nath Kovind on the occasion.
The message stated: “For every Indian, whether living at home or anywhere else in the world, August 15 is sacred. It is marked on our calendars as a celebration of our sovereignty. We unfurl our national flag with great joy and enthusiasm.”
The message from the Indian President depicted August 15 as a time to celebrate the sacrifice and valour of those who brought about India’s Independence, namely by freedom fighters and Mahatma Gandhi. He called freedom, “a constant and relentless endeavour,” adding, “decades after 1947, each one of us can contribute in the manner of a freedom fighter.” The message also highlighted the work of Indian farmers, the Armed Forces, police and paramilitary forces, women, and young people in the perennial work of securing India’s freedom.
