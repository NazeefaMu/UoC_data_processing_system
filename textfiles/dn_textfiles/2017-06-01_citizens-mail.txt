Citizens' Mail

Hats off to Parliamentarians!
It is heartening indeed to be informed that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to CEASE further vehicle imports for their use till the end of 2017. At long last, our servants have realised the folly of spending our money on their luxurious lifestyle. We fervently hope that these elected servants of ours will be further prompted by their conscience to cut down on their ostentatious lifestyle. To spend Rs 140 million to redecorate/ partition rooms of a ministry, Rs 5 million to renovate a Governor's residence, Rs 70 million on a car for a ministry, were the most recent requirements, but fortunately, sanity has prevailed and this allocation of precious money belonging to the people, has been cancelled or temporarily terminated? Better late than never!
We will admire them if they will continue this trend of thinking and action. Will they have the sacrificial nature to curb their greed that has no boundaries? Can they ever live up to the statesmen like ministers of some 50 years ago?
John F Kennedy's famous phrase "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country" is very relevant in this situation.
It is quite clear that in Sri Lanka it is those in power that have to be disciplined at present to be examples to the general public.
