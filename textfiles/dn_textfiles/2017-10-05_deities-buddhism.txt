Deities in Buddhism

It is often asked if there are gods in Buddhism. The short answer is no, but also yes, depending on what you mean by “gods.”
It also is often asked if it is all right for a Buddhist to believe in God, meaning the creator God as celebrated in Christianity, Judaism, Islam and other philosophies of monotheism. Again, this depends on what you mean by “God.” As most monotheists define God, the answer is probably “no.” But there are lots of ways to understand the principle of God.
Let’s start with poytheistic-type gods. In the world’s religions these have been understood in many ways, Most commonly, they are supernatural beings with some kind of agency---they control the weather, for example, or they might help you win victories. The classic Roman and Greek gods and goddesses are examples.
Practice in a religion based on polytheism mostly consists of practices to cause these gods to intercede on one’s behalf.
If you deleted them the various gods, there wouldn’t be a religion at all.
In traditional Buddhist folk religion, on the other hand, the devas are usually depicted as characters living in a number of other realms, separate from the human realm. They have their own problems and have no roles to play in the human realm.
There is no point praying to them even if you believe in them, because they’re not going to do anything for you.
