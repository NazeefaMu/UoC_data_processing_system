UNDP, Ministry come together to further develop ‘Idea Board’

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) today entered into a partnership with the Science, Technology and Research Ministry to further develop and co-fund the ‘Idea Board’, an online crowd sourcing platform anchored at the Sri Lanka Innovation Dashboard, an initiative by the Ministry.
A collective effort between the UNDP and the Ministry, the Idea Board, was developed by a group of young developers brought together by the UNDP. The concept behind an online crowd sourcing platform is to create a space for communities, including young people from across the country, to voice their opinions and thoughts, after which they will be consolidated into a larger effort to create solutions for social issues ailing the country.
Through the Idea Board, the Ministry and the UNDP will be able to identify ideas that could be expanded into solutions; making this platform an effective bottom-to-top approach in finding solutions to development challenges faced by communities.
With the interest of expanding the reach, the UNDP and the Ministry have now come together to co-fund the second phase of the Idea Board. It will see further developments made to the platform to make it more dynamic and user-friendly to attract more users.
The Ministry Secretary Udaya Seneviratne said the Ministry through the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) is pleased to partner with the UNDP to develop the ‘Idea Board’. The platform aims to give the general public a space to voice their opinions, ideas and solutions.”
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen said that they are very pleased to continue their partnership with the Science,
Technology and Research Ministry to further develop the Idea Board platform.
