Transmission center shut down by TRCSL:
TNL to file facts before Polgahawela Magistrate

The TNL Media Network will file facts before the Polgahawela Magistrate on Friday (08) with regards to the shutting down of their repeater transmission center located in Polgahawela, TNL News Manager Teran Karannagoda said.
Responding to Daily News, Karannagoda said that they are to appear before Polgahawela Magistrate’s Courts where they will present their case.
He also said that the TNL media network denies the charges leveled against their company by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRCSL).
Karannagoda further said that they will take other necessary legal measures after appearing before the courts on Friday.
A repeater transmission center in Polgahawela belonging to the TNL Media Network was shut down last Tuesday.
The Polgahawela Magistrate’s Court issued the relevent court order. The Police have presented facts to the court based on a complaint made by the TRCSL and the Polgahawela Magistrate Court has issued an order to seize the equipment and conduct an investigation in to the charges leveled against them.
According to reports, the removal has affected transmission to areas including the Sabaragamuwa, Wayamba and Western Provinces. The shutting down on the transmission center was the highlight at the Parliament sittings on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) says that action was taken to shut down TNL’s illegal transmission in Polgahawela due it causing interference to other government channels and causing a loss to the government and that there is no other undue ambition behind the action.
The TRCSL said it has taken action against such violations with regard to illegal broadcasting stations operated by different companies including Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation at Balangoda.
Issuing a statement yesterday, the TRCSL Director General P.R.S.P. Jayathilake stated that the TV transmission operated by Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd is presently licensed for 9 locations throughout the country namely Colombo, Nuwara Eliya (Mt. Oliphant), Karagahatenna, Piliyandala, Awissawella, Badulla, Gongala, Hantana and Ratnapaura.
He said that a television transmitter should be used at each of above location and a valid licence should be obtained under Section 22 of Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No 25 of 1991 as amended by Act No 27 of 1996.
The licence issued will be valid for a period of one year and renewable for another year, on payment of relevant licence fee.
“Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd has obtained a valid licence for the year 2018, after payment of relevant licence fee for the above 9 locations. But no licence has been issued in favour of above Company by TRCSL to use VHF CH 11 or VHF CH 3 at Polgahawela.”
Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd has operated VHF CH L1 and CH 3 from time to time for a considerable period of time in contravention to the Section 22 of Sri Lanka Telecommunication Act No 25 of 1991 as amended causing interference to other licence government broadcasters.
The TRCSL said it has informed Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd to shut down this illegal transmission on April 27, 2016.
“Ignoring the above letter, Telshan Network (Pvt) Ltd has continued the aforementioned transmission causing interference to other government channels and without making due payment causing loss to the government.”
Therefore the TRCSL has been compelled to take action against this violation based on above grounds and the TRCSL emphasizes that there is no any other undue ambition behind this action, the statement said.
The TRCSL said it has taken action against such violations with regard to illegal broadcasting stations operated by different companies including Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation at Balangoda.
