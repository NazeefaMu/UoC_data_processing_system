Aquatic plants disrupt freshwater fishing

Freshwater fisherfolk in Hambantota have been left high and dry as most tanks in the district have been overrun by aquatic plants.
Fisherfolk said that they found it impossible to use fishing nets because they get entangled in the plants.
Hambantota National Aquaculture Development Authority Officer Gayan Chandrasena said it has hindered the breeding of freshwater fish as well. Hambantota Irrigation Engineer Buddika Wijesekera said the aquatic plants had spread at an alarming rate in Ridiyagama, but the Irrigation Department did not have the proper equipment to remove them.
