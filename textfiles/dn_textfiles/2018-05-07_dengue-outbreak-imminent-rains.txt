According to epidemiologists, the highest number of dengue cases, 2,665 had been reported from the Colombo district, while the second highest number, 2,208 had been reported from the Batticaloa district. The third highest number of dengue cases, 1,510 had been reported from the Gampaha district.

Medical experts and consultants advice the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
