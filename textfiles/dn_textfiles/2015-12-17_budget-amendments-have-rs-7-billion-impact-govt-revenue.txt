Budget amendments to have Rs. 7 billion impact on govt. revenue

The amendments proposed to the Budget 2016 by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will result in a Rs 7 billion impact on the government revenue, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said in Parliament.
The minister said he would brief the House as to how this income would be recovered when the Budget debate concludes on December 19. The minister was responding to a supplementary question by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena.
The minister noted the allocations for development purposes or relief measures would not be curtailed to facilitate additional allocations required for the proposed amendments.
"The Budget is not something engraved on stone. The Prime Minister was was flexible enough to incorporate the proposals of various segments in society. Various proposals are put forward at the Committee Stage of the Budget and we need to consider them. Even if you make constructive proposals that benefit the country which are not extreme, we are ready to accommodate them as well" he replied.
The minister said the Prime Minister had made four proposals, while President Maithripala Sirisena made a proposal with regard to excise tax.
"The President's proposal actually increases the revenue by Rs 250 million. If the GMOA insists on the car permit, we will have to provide for it from the allocation made to the Health Ministry," he said.
MP Gunawardena asked the minister to submit a report to Parliament clarifying how the Government is going to revise the budgetary allocations to accommodate the amendments proposed by the Prime Minister.
Meanwhile, the Finance Minister replying to another supplementary question by MP Gunawardena stated the Government is not directed by the IMF policy, but, it follows what it thinks is best for the people and the country.
"At the same time, we must be sensitive to external threats like ISIS too. I am confident that dollars will flow in to the country after the Budget," he said.
"There is no issue with the balance of payment. The issue is with the trade deficit. To control it, we need to take effective steps to reduce imports and increase exports," he added.
