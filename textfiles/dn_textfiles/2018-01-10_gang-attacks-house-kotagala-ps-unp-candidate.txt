Gang attacks house of Kotagala PS UNP candidate

An unidentified gang had attacked the house of UNP candidate for Kotagala Pradeshiya Sabha Sailaja Alexander on Monday (8) night.
The Lindula Police report that the attack had damaged the windows at the front of the house.
Alexander is contesting the upcoming local government polls as a candidate of the Upcountry People’s Front under the UNP list. She has already made a statement with regard to who she suspects to be responsible for the attack.
Police investigations thus far reveal that a candidate contesting from the Ceylon Workers Cogress under the symbol of the chicken, through the United Peoples’ Freedom Alliance nomination list and his supporters might be responsible for the attack. The Lindula Police are carrying out investigations to apprehend the suspects.
