Towards a clean city

We should be ashamed that almost 25 percent of the 5,252 constituents of the Cinnamon Gardens ward do not have proper housing even today, SLFP candidate for the Cinnamon Garden ward Pradip Jayewardene told the Daily News.
“Cinnamon Gardens is considered the area where Sri Lanka’s elite live. Even to this day, there are a few colonial mansions still standing within the ward.”
Pradeep is the grandson of Sri Lanka’s first Executive President, Junius Richard Jayewardene. J. R., as he was fondly referred to even to this day, was the leader of the United National Party (UNP) and Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister from 1977 to 1978 and Executive President for two terms from February 4, 1978 to January 2, 1989.
However, Jayewardene is Sri Lanka Freedom Party’s (SLFP) candidate for the Cinnamon Gardens ward of the Colombo Municipal Council at the upcoming Local Government polls.
“About 25 percent of the constituents in Cinnamon Gardens that deserve better housing are lower middle class wage earners and are an essential part of the Cinnamon Gardens community as they are the service providers. I believe that they should not be relocated but be provided with modern housing and better facilities. They lose their livelihood when they are relocated. I have seen this happen in other areas,” he said.
“Traffic is another problem that needs attention.
“To provide essential services within walking distance is a solution that many other countries have adopted to ease this problem. As you know Cinnamon
Gardens was mainly a residential area a few decades ago, but with the unplanned and chaotic development of Colombo 7, the many high rise buildings coming up are also disrupting the neighborhood,” he added.
“Isn’t the reason obvious?” Jayewardene quipped, when asked why he had distanced himself from the political party his grandfather led and joined the SLFP - the UNP’s main rival prior to 2015.
“It is because, for the past 20 years or so, the UNP has gradually deviated from the party’s original principles and conservative values. The ideology of the UNP is betrayed today. I consider myself fortunate that I am not with the UNP now,” he added.
“The open economy system introduced by my grandfather is not a problem as long as you keep control of your resources such as land and other key sectors which are being handed over to foreigners now.”
“Cinnamon Gardens has been a UNP stronghold, but I am confident that the people will vote for the candidate who could resolve their problems the best on February 10.
“It’s time the constituents of Cinnamon Gardens elect a clean citizen for a Clean City!” said Pradip Jayewardene.
