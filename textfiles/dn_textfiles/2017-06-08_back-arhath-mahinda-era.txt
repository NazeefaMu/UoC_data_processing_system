Back to Arhath Mahinda Era

‘May the bikkhus shed enmity and hatred; even as the Jasmine creeper sheds its faded flowers’. Dhammapada]
Poson Full moon is a day of great significance to Sri Lankans, for it is on such a day that Arhant Mihinda visited Mihintale and preached the profound Dhamma. Two thousand three-hundred years after this sacred event, what we observe in this thrice-blessed land is hatred, based on ethnic, religious, cast, creed and various other divisions created mainly by misguided groups or politically motivated ‘Sinhala-Buddhists’. Violent display of protest by section of ‘bikkhus’ in yellow robes participating with unruly mobs has turn into be the order of the day.
A religion known as Buddhism was not in existence in this Island or in any part of the globe then. The idea of this article is to examine the achievements of Arahath Mahinda’s endeavors twenty three centuries before and its significance in today’s context, where the performance of pure serene Dhamma is fast fading away, or being overshadowed by observation of new socio- cultural myths and pooja systems.
Chullahasti-Padopama Sutta’
ArahathMahinda thera tested the IQ of King Devanampiyatissa with a sequence of enquiries which is famous and welcomed as the first I.Q. Test recognized in any part of the world. Happy with the king’s insight, he preached the ‘Chullahasti-Padopama Sutta’, MajjimaNikaya. This sutta describes how a follower recognizes the Samma Sambuddha-hood of the Buddha by active involvement in the path; the Buddha revealed to them, in an analogous way that an individual who knows well of elephants how he would distinguish a male elephant from a female.
Buddha Rejected Differences
Buddha’s rejection of caste, race, and class was not just ideological, he admitted inhabitants from all castes and creed - Suneeta and Upali found respected spaces in the sasana.
‘Monks, all the rivers, like Ganges, Jamna , Achiravati, and Sarabu once fall into the ocean lose their former names and identities and recognized as the ocean’.
Bikkhu Vagga; Dhammapada says,
“He who controls his hand, controls his foot, controls his speech and is well controlled in all respects…is composed, solitary and content—him they call… a Buddhist monk” – verse 362.
Unfortunately, today there is no direct control; the four Maha Nayake theros of the three Nikayas must act now. The bikkhu order is vitiated by the presence of astrologers, brokers, physicians, political henchmen, merchants, landlords, car sale owners caring naught for the spiritual welfare of the people or society, they are wrapped in their own worldly interests. Steps must be taken to expel such undesirable elements from sasana; also prevent others from joining their ranks. The Nayake thera’s have no way of ruling on what is being done outside their temple precincts, no proper mechanism exists for communication. Some monks are like a flock without a leader; they have their own ways of handling ‘grievances’.
The Third Buddhist council by summoned by Emperor Asoka was an outcome of his great thinking. This historic Council initiated the dispatch of several missions to neighboring countries for the purpose of distributing the ideologies of Dhamma. Emperor Asoka specifically selected Sri Lanka ruled by his friend Devanampiyatissa when he decided on missions. Accordingly, Emperor’s son Mahinda Thera was entrusted with the assignment of introducing Dhamma to Sri Lanka in 236 BC. The Theravada Buddha Dhamma introduced by him lasts even after two and a half millennia. But sadly the Sasana lacks an organized institution or a connecting link between one activity and other: it is wandering aimlessly like a headless body.
Strategy of Arhant Mahinda
Arhant Mahinda Thera did not rush but spent time researching the circumstances that existed in the island. He found King Mutasiva who was ruling the nation was old and feeble that he may not be able to handle the enormous task affectively. He marked time until the advent of most suitable period to launch his mission, but took advantage of the wait by learning language of Lankans. Arhant Mahinda suspected the vicious clans that pay reverence to the mythological deities, worship trees rocks would have thwarted the launch of an unfamiliar philosophy that rejects such practices. Arhant Mihindu thera faced challenges successfully through King Devanampiyatissa subsequently. However, soon he established unstinted support from the rulers and the people.
In the Parimandala Vagga Vinaya rule no. 7 says,
‘A Buddhist monk should wear the under-robe all round. A Buddhist monk should wear the upper-robe even all round. A Buddhist monk should walk well covered in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should sit well covered in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should walk well restrained in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should sit well restrained in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should sit with lowered eyes in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should not walk with robes hitched up in inhabited areas. A Buddhist monk should not sit with robes hitched up in inhabited areas.’
At numerous student demonstrations it is a common sight that a good number of young monks leaving their robes behind and running for safety when attacked by security men.
Dhamma and Vegetarianism
king Devanam piyatissa whose hobby was to kill animal, became a vegetarian, followed by large section of the nation’s population. Agricultural economy outdid the customary meat industry. Arhat Mahinda’s visit followed later by his own sister, Sanghamitta Therini, who arrived with the idea of inaugarating a Bhikkhuni Sasana, in the island.
The Bo sapling, a branch of the Siri Maha Bodhi she brought with her, was planted in the Mahamevuna Uyana, which continues to bless the nation.
Foreign invasions over the centuries have, to some extent, reformed the cultural distinctiveness of the people, especially in the Western costal belt where, since the 16th century, the Portuguese, the Dutch and the British had some influence in the people, but the cultural and religious uniqueness of the nation remained unscratched to a great extent. The introduction of tobacco, alcohol, and flesh including slaughter of cattle for food by them, changed the lifestyles of sections of inhabitants. We believe that the Buddha picked Lanka as the place that would preserve the Dhamma. The nation was resurrected on that noble day. This leads to a profound understanding of the nation for all groups of people in Sri Lanka to live in peace and harmony.
Mihintale was somewhat neglected with the shifting of the capital in 1058 to Polonnaruwa; the commitment and royal sponsorship that the sacred place received began to vanish.
Offering hundred thousands of flowers, one hundred thousand of Jasmines one million Araliya, and conduct of processions with hundred elephants, the vesak pandals and veask zones are not true Buddhism. We need learned Theros to preach pure Dhamma discourses the way Arahant Mihinda Thero did.
Young Siduhath as a boy, saw the plough turning up the soil, killing worms, and exposing the others to be picked up by predators. Even consuming rice involves the inadvertent destruction of life. The only response is to get off the wheel.
The problem with this argument is that it creates confusion. On an existential level, pretty right, any form of being, including the most scrupulous, will manifestly cause injury to some beings.
This is one of the causes why it has become necessary to flee away from rebirth on the whole. Ethics or principles are not concerned with the final escape from all suffering. Being vegetarian or vegan we will still cause destruction. And there are boundary concerns as to what is really vegetarian. Bees are destroyed for honey? Animal bones are used for the decontamination process… organs are used in production of medicinal drugs.
The real truth is that eating meat cause massive destruction to many creatures. That harm is, always easily avoidable. Becoming vegetarian does not employ any huge sacrifices or ethical bravery. It just takes a little self-control and concern. Today, there is a large variety of delicious, cheap, nutritious vegetarian foods easily accessible. The choice of becoming vegetarian is, of all ethical choices we can make, one of the most beneficial, at the minimum cost to ourselves. Back to the fundamental problem; as Buddhists, we expect that the Buddha preserved the highest possible ethical ways; and for the most part, he did. So if the Buddha allowed something, we feel there can’t be anything wrong with it. There is nothing inflexible or unreasonable about such a conviction.
Let us resolve on this important occasion, to re-establish inter-ethnic, inter-religious harmony that we have been yearning to achieve for over the decades. Work towards temperance and an anti-tobacco nation which is free of meat eating. Practice the basics of the Dhamma.
