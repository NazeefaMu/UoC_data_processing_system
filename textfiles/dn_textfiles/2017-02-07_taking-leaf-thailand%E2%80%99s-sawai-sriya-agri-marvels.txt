Taking a leaf from Thailand’s  Sawai Sriya agri marvels

The Sawai Sriya Garden, Nakhon Nayok Province Thailand is offering the technology of producing bio diesel from used cooking oil to Sri Lankan companies.
Chairman Sawai Sriya told the Thailand Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Nopporn Adchariyavanich, that he is now ready to share this technology with Sri Lanka and also rest of the world.
He said that he gets used cooking oil from houses and mixes them with agriculture waste and producers diesel for the past six years. “This has been very successful and I am using this diesel to power my double cab vehicle for the past five years.”
He said that the unique feature of this system is that it’s very much cheaper than diesel sold in fuel stations and there is no damage to the vehicle as he together with villagers have been using it for the past five years. “In addition this process also helps the environment since we are re-using the used cooking oil and agri waste.”
In addition they also have several unique, cheap and cost effective agri methods that could be easily adopted to homes and farms.”One simple method is to fill a used glass bottle with water and just turn it around and put it in flower or agriculture land. The water in the bottle would then be absorbed to the plant and this has to be replaced only after several days.”
Another unique method he has invested is to dig a small hole in plantain barks and plant red onions and green leaf like Kankun in them. The water from the plantain tree could sustain the plants.”

He said that there are several tropical healthy plants that could be budded with oranges, lemon and lime.
Sawai Sriya Centre also today is one of the biggest attractions for tourists who come to see these unique agri marvels and exploiting this several shops too have being put together by villagers. “I also have the world's tallest sugar cane tree which was made tall by joining PVC pipes and allowing the tree to pass through it. The PVC pipe is tied to a lamp post.”
Nakhon Nayok is a small province in central Thailand, northeast of Bangkok. In the east are the mountains, forest and grassland of the vast Khao Yai National Park, home to diverse wildlife including bears, elephants, macaques and rare birds. However the province was virtually abandoned until the Thailand King, in 1989, under the Chaipattana Foundation bought a piece of land covering an area of six acres near Khun Dan Dam in Nakhon Nayok Province and developed the area. Later the Vajiravudh College Alumni Association under the Royal Patronage was given permission to use this piece of land as a learning project for King Bhumibol’s Concept of Development. This led to the planning of a recreational centre to demonstrate the royal concept and theories of agricultural development, environmental improvement, and natural resources conservation.
“I took a leaf from the philosophy of the King and built The Sawai Sriya Garden, which is a major success.The philosophy tends to encourage us not to forget who we really are and what is suitable for our culture, tradition, as well as our way of life.The late king also emphasized on natural resources development.
The king paid attention to every element of natural resources which helped with the alleviation of the agricultural, environmental to livelihood and economic problems. I am now old and want to give these R&D to the benefit of the world,” he said.
