Unruly tourists polluting Kaluwala waterfall

Kaluwala waterfall in Paleegala, off Eheliyagoda town has been polluted due to the unruly behavior of visitors, residents claim.
Holidaymakers and residents often visit the attractive waterfall but some do not care to keep the place clean, residents allege.
A villager told the Daily News that some people pollute the environment by scattering polythene bags, empty lunch containers, biscuit wrappers, beer cans and empty bottles etc.
Apart from drawing crowds because of its attraction, Kaluwala supplies water to hundreds of paddy fields in the Paleegala village.
Villagers request authorities to take steps against perpetrators.
