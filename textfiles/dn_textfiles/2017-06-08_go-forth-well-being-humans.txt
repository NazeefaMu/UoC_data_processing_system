Go forth, for the well being of humans

The Buddha the perfect one was of an exceptional breed.
His message was to all mankind regardless of colour caste creed.
The fountain of compassion the universal teacher blessed the humanity with the supreme truth as a great preacher.
Enlightenment of the Buddha viewed with great reverence
Led to the doctrine of Dhamma and its emergence
“Go forth Bhikkus taking the message into the world explain to them, what I have explained” the Buddha so, said
For the wellbeing of the majority solace of the living so that they will see the light with no craving.
The message thus proclaimed was the greatest victory to have been achieved by anyone inhuman history.
This is also the greatest and most glorious single event in Sri Lankan culture endowed with the gist of all that is meant.
The message thus proclaimed was brought in the Poson full moon day. Arahath Mahinda appeared on Mihintale to everybody's dismay.
This was the most historic event in the Buddha Sasana. For each and every Buddhist for their endless wasana.
Poson in many respects marks the coming of age of our nation.
For it is Arahat Mahinda, that gave birth to the great civilisation.
This is a wonderful way for Lankans to realise the uplift of the cultural diversity accompanied with the immortal gift.
It was a precious gift from Emperor Asoka the great. To his friend in Lanka that decided its fate.
Arahat Mahinda led the Dhammadutha Mission and Lanka became the recipient of his far-sighted vision.
The king was engaged in hunting chasing a deer when Arahat addressed him by name as a person very close and dear.
He tested the king's intelligence in the course of the conversation
To understand Buddhism sans any hesitation.
The king accepted Buddhism followed by the people the supreme truth which in no way could be called simple.
Mihintale rock emerged as a platform of our civilisation. It is here that the king embraced Buddhism minutes after his conversion
To the Great Masters spiritual message in addition. It's influence on daily life had a great impact on our tradition.
Arahat Mahinda not only brought Buddhism, but also a culture comprising of arts and crafts, architecture and sculpture.
He also brought Pali language which enriched Sinhala literature.
It is the widely revered Tripitaka the most sacred Buddhist scripture.
The archaeological remains found in main cities are a glowing tribute to the cultural development that was currently prevalent.
Ahimsa was honoured as the theme of non-violence righteous living became the order of the day giving if prominence.
Introduction of ordination was another major event.
Paving the way for the attainment of spiritual heights.
Ever since, Thera Mahinda came to be called Anubudhu Arahath Mahinda, being second only to Supreme Thathagatha
Samanamayang Maharaja Dhammarajassa Sevaka
Thamena Anukampaya Jambudeepa Idhagatha”
So said, thera Mahinda, the disciples of Supreme Thathagatha.
