Scandinavia’s signage software provider Shoppa partners with Creative Software

With an installed base of more than 5000 stores, Shoppa is Scandinavia’s market leader for retail in-store signage.
Intent on expanding into other European markets, Shoppa partnered with Creative Software to boost their development capacity in order to serve an even larger client base.
According to Shoppa’s Head of Development Nicklas Kittelmann, as the company penetrates new markets, retaining the high quality of their offering will be the priority.
“Quality – that is why we partnered with Creative [Software],” said Nicklas. “Creative Software comes highly recommended by some of Scandinavia’s leading [tech] companies and I expect them to be able to meet our standards as well as our deadlines.”
“As we move into new markets, we have to increase our development capacity, but we also have to ensure that this growth does not compromise the quality of our products and services,” concluded Nicklas. “If anything, with Creative [Software] on board, we are confident that we will be able to focus even more on increasing the value we bring to our customers.”
Shoppa and Creative Software are now in the process of building a dedicated team of software engineers that will contribute to Shoppa’s product development and help streamline their development pipeline. The team will be based at Creative Software’s R&D centre in the heart of Colombo.
In April, the team will receive product training at Shoppa’s Sweden-based headquarters, while their Scandinavian colleagues are expected to visit Creative Software in May this year.
Creative Software’s Director of Engineering Damitha Liyanage said that the new partnership has positioned the company for yet another successful year.
“The steady growth of our client portfolio means that Creative Software will create many more jobs and attract more foreign investment into Sri Lanka,” said Damitha. “In 2018 we expect to go on another recruitment spree which will open great opportunities for software professionals and recent graduates alike.”
Founded in 1999, Creative Software is a pioneer and leader in Sri Lanka’s software industry. The company specialises in building and managing dedicated teams of software engineers, as well as providing project-based software development and maintenance services.
Shoppa, founded in 2004, is a software company located in Enköping, Sweden. Shoppa provides a unique multi-channel in-store signage solution, where users can create and control content for printed POS material, digital signage, social media and online stores.
