‘Regrettable that some have resorted to trade union action despite solution on SAITM’: President

 
President Maithripala Sirisena today said it was regrettable that some have resorted to trade union action despite a solution given to the SAITM issue.
Speaking at a function in Anuradhapura today he urged medical students not to be political pawns but to complete their medical education successfully for their benefit as well as for the sake of the nation.
He assured that no student would be subjected to injustice.
The President said that several steps have been taken to resolve issues with regard to SAITM – these include making clinical studies compulsory for SAITM students; SAITM students having to face examinations approved by the Medical Council and the University Grants Commission; announcing minimum qualifications for medical studies; taking over the private hospital; single ownership of the medical college to be expanded into a broad based ownership and appoint a professional council to administer it.
The President stated that it was those who are poor and marginalized that suffered from this kind of strike action.
He further said that if there is any issue, there is room for the any trade union to discuss those issues with the Government.
President Sirisena further said that it was regrettable that trade unions were holding the public hostage in an environment in which preparation are being made to hold the UN International Vesak festival.
The President recalled the requests made by Wimal Weerawansa to hoist the black flag when the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives in Sri Lanka to attend the International Vesak festival.
He also said that everyone must understand that strengthening the Indo-Lanka relationship established since introduction of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, does not mean that Sri Lanka is bowing down to India.
President Sirisena also emphasized that he will not sign any agreement with any country which is detrimental to Sri Lanka and said that he came into power not to hand over part of a country to another country or to annul the privileges and rights of the citizens by signing unfavorable agreements with other countries.
He attended the religious ceremony to unveil the newly built Buddha statue at the premises of the Local Government complex, Anuradhapura.
The President engaged in religious observances and participated in alms giving ceremony for 100 Bhikkus.
The Maha Sangha including Chief Incumbent of Ruwanweliseya Ven.Pallegama Hemarathana Nayake Thera, Ministers Duminda Disanayake,Chandrani Bandara, P. Harrison, Governor of the North Central Province, P. B. Dissanayake, Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathna and many others participated in this event.
