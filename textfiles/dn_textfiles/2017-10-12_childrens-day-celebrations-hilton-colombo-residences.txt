Children's Day celebrations at Hilton Colombo Residences

Hilton Colombo Residences partnered with Igniterspace to introduce a specially designed workshop during Children’s Day, held on October 1,2017. They are a ‘makerspace’ for kids to unleash their imaginations through technology. A makerspace is a place where students can gather to create, invent and tinker technology using tools, materials and some guidance that inculcate an idea of ‘anything is possible’.
The activities are aimed to build children’s natural curiosity and introduce the essential engineering principles such as mechanics, electrical, electronic, computing and robotics from very young ages of 5 – 15 years. The foundation of this program was to build a passion for creativity in students as the first step of their innovation journey. The program exposes the students to a wide variety of technological and engineering concepts.
For Children’s Day, the programme was aimed at building a car that functions using wind power.
