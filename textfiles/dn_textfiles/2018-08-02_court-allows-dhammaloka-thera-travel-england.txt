Court allows Dhammaloka Thera to travel to England

Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera whose passport was impounded by Court as part of an indictment filed by the Attorney General over an alleged offence of possessing an elephant without a valid licence was yesterday permitted to travel abroad by the Colombo High Court.
Ven. Dhammaloka Thera through his lawyer requested Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne that his passport be released to travel to England for a Dhamma sermon programme.
Ven. Dhammaloka Thera was permitted to travel when his passport was ordered to be released until September 10 by the High Court.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed an indictment against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera on two counts for allegedly possessing a baby elephant without a valid licence.
The indictment has been filed over two counts under Section 22 (12) of the Fauna and Flora Protection (Amendment) Act, No.22 of 2009 and Section 5(3) (a) of the Public Property Act.
The Attorney General had named 19 persons as witnesses in the case and three documents as production items in the case.
Wildlife Department officials had taken into custody a two and half year-old elephant calf which was found inside the Alan Methiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda on January 28, 2015.
