Scientists finally know how birds get their colour

There are about 18,000 bird species on Earth, and every species is differently coloured.
While some birds are so bright in colour, one can spot them from afar, some are coloured so as to camouflage- you’ll never realise if you’re even looking at the bird! The feathers are composed of intricate combinations of mottles, scales, bars, and spots, making each one unique.
It has already been discovered that different patterns and colours help camouflage the birds from predators, but have you ever wondered how they get such different colours?
Dr. Ismael Galvan and his team of expert researchers conducted a study on about 9000 bird species’ plumage coloration to answer the very question.
Two types of pigments are responsible for the pumage coloration: melanins, which produce a range of black, grey, brown, and orange colors, and carotenoids, which are used by specialized feather structures to generate brighter color hues.
