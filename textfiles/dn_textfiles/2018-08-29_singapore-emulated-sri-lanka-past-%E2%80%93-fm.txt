Singapore emulated Sri Lanka in the past – FM

Singapore took many examples from Sri Lanka several decades ago, Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said.
The Singapore Foreign Minister said this when he met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his delegation for bilateral talks at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Hanoi, Vietnam on August 28 morning.
“Although some tried to spread ideas likely to mislead people by creating myth and fear, a large majority of people aspired for jobs, income avenues and a high living standard. As such, Singapore always followed a policy catering to majority welfare”, Minister Balakrishnan said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Singapore which took examples from Sri Lanka in the past was spearheading a large scale forward march in the development field while Sri Lanka had suffered a serious economic and social setback as a result of implementing petty political objectives and personal agendas. The good governance government in Sri Lanka was trying to reverse this trend and transform Sri Lanka into the main focal point in the Indian Ocean.
Special attention was drawn towards present international political and economic trends.
Attention was also drawn towards studies underway throughout the world about the possible dangers created through a tribal and gossip society via social media networks. Ideas and views were also exchanged on possible challenges faced by Sri Lanka’s development efforts.
Minister Sagala Ratnayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Ekanayake, Sri Lanka’s Ambassador in Vietnam Hasanthi Dissanayake, Additional Secretary Saman Athaudahetti and Shashikala Premawardane of the Foreign Affairs Ministry were associated with the Prime Minister.
