Seventeen cops from Jaffna station transferred

Seventeen Police officers of the Jaffna Police station including its Crimes Division Head have been transferred with immediate effect, while another officer has been suspended due to an allegation of not properly investigating into a complaint received.
All these officers would be subjected to a disciplinary inquiry and according to sources, a Sub Inspector is likely to be suspended.
Northern Province Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police Roshan Fernando had received a complaint on Tuesday over the attempt to suppress the investigations into a complaint into a Rs.1.1 million robbery from a business place in Jaffna.
