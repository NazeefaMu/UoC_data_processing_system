Rookamanie’s Colombo Seven moment

Meet Rookamanie Fernando. She is the newly-appointed General Manager of Jetwing Colombo Seven after more than 33 years of experience in various roles within the Jetwing group. Her professional journey, in an industry where a woman rarely gets the opportunity to break through the glass ceiling to the upper level of management, is truly inspiring.
Here Rookamanie talks about how she started her career as a young school leaver and worked tirelessly to take up one of the highest positions in the hospitality industry.
 
Q: Tell us about your family and how you ventured into the hotel industry?
A: I am a twin child, the other being my brother. I have an older brother, so we were three children in our family. Our parents inculcated in us strong values reflective of our Roman Catholic faith; we were brought up with love and discipline. I studied at Newstead College, Negombo and excelled in languages. Even as a school girl I realized the value of languages, and how they have the power to attract and connect people. After leaving school I studied German and soon joined Browns Beach Hotel as a trainee receptionist. This was my humble entry into the hotel industry.
 
Q: What was your next career move?
A: I had a strong desire to continue learning German. Somewhere during this time I met a foreign delegation who invited me to represent Sri Lanka at an environment convention due to my people oriented skills. So I went to Vienna. It was a wonderful experience. I soon enrolled in the University and pursued my German language. Being away from SL as a young single woman was a nice experience and taught me many valuable lessons in life. In 1986 I came back to my country, as a more mature person.
 
Q: How did you join the Jetwing group?
A: I wanted to join a hotel, so I sent my CVs to the top brands in that era. Would you believe I got called for 3 interviews on the same date! My Interview at Blue Oceanic Hotel, Negombo was conducted by our late Chairman Herbert Cooray. He made such an impression on me and I was touched by his gentleman qualities that I opted to join them without any hesitation. It was a new challenge for me working as a Guest Relations Officer. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world.
 
Q: Tell us about your family, and the balance of work- home routines?
A: Before I left for Vienna, I had met and known Neil - my present husband. At that time I was focused on my career until he proposed to me. I patiently waited for the approval and blessings of my beloved parents. So we got married in 1987 and I have a son and daughter. As you know the hotel industry is not a 9-5 job and consumes your time. However I managed to be a good mother and equally a supportive wife. Today my children are doing well in their own careers, and I am indeed a happy mother.
 
Q: Your challenges and progress made as a female manager?
Rookamanie Fernando
A: I face my challenges with a positive attitude. I must thankfully recollect the kind support given to me by the late Herbert Cooray, present Chairman Hiran and his sister Shiromal and all my colleagues. At Jetwing we believe in teamwork. We operate on family values. A turning point in my hotel career was when I realized the potential of ayurveda and wellness. In 1992 I studied the deeper points of this subject for six months and gave a proposal to Chairman, who was mildly hesitant but gave me two rooms at Blue Oceanic. Soon the trend of decent spas caught on and I am delighted to say we built and opened the Jetwing Ayurveda Pavilion in 2001 at Negombo, with 12 rooms.
I was promoted General Manager of this property. Soon I was overlooking the spas of the entire Jetwing hotels. During my career I have travelled to about 15 countries, using my German language skills to promote Sri Lanka. I was surprised when Hiran Cooray asked me to take the reins of Jetwing Colombo. It was a new challenge but I am able to deliver beyond guest expectations.
 
Q: What inspires your success and your advice to aspiring young women in the hotel industry?
A: I give all thanks to God, as I feel I am blessed. It is God who guides me. I always want to understand and connect with my staff- and transform their lives too. We are a team. I start each new day with prayer supplemented by a good attitude, passion and the desire to meet challenges. I never feel tired at work. I often speak at womens forums and propagate womens empowerment. Women must enter the hotel industry. They cannot be restricted by culture or any other stigma. I also want to see more women in the kitchen as creative chefs. If I were to describe my 3 decades as a hotelier I would say “my passion to succeed carried me”. I hope to remain with the Jetwing family and take this new hotel to greater heights as we have much healthy competition from other hotels including International brands.
