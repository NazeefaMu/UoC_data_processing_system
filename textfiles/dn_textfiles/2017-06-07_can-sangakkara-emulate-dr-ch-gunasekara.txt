Can Sangakkara emulate Dr CH Gunasekara?

Many Sri Lankans have over the years since 1919 when Dr CH Gunasekara became the first Sri Lankan to play for an English county have gone onto play county cricket in England, but no one has played in a champion county side other than Dr Gunasekara.
That rare honour - to be a member of the winning team Dr Gunasekara got while representing Middlesex in 1920 under the leadership of Sir Pelham ‘Plum’ Warner. Dr Gunasekara represented Middlesex from 1919 to 1922 and was widely regarded as the best fielder in county cricket at the time.
Dr Gunasekara moved to England in order to study medicine at Cambridge University and excelled in sports missing out on a Blue due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1919 he made his first-class debut for Middlesex and had a good all-round Championship season capturing 36 wickets at 27.72 and scoring 351 runs at 21.93. Against Essex at Leyton he scored 58 and took five wickets for 90 runs. Despite batting at nine, he top scored for Middlesex in the first innings of their match against Surrey at The Oval with 88 not out. His best performance with the ball came against Lancashire at Old Trafford where he dismissed their last five batsmen to finish with figures of 5/15. The following summer he was part of Middlesex’s successful campaign for the 1920 County Championship and became the first Sri Lankan to gain a county cap. He didn’t play at all in 1921 but returned in 1922 for one final season. In his three seasons for Middlesex Dr Gunasekara scored 644 runs (avg. 14.63) and captured 75 wickets.
It was Dr Gunasekara’s fielding at cover point that evoked high praise. He was rated along with Patsy Hendren as the best fielder in England. Ronald Mason in his book ‘Plum Warner’s Last Season (1920)’ wrote: “Hendren in addition to being one of the fastest runners was the safest catcher in first class cricket and Gunasekara had a mercurial oriental brilliance which labeled him as among the outstanding fielders of the day.”
Dr Gunasekara represented his country on 12 occasions 9 of them as captain and was the first Ceylonese to lead his country in an unofficial test. He was also a good tennis player and was the doubles and mixed doubles national champion on several occasions and represented his country against Davis Cup teams that passed through Colombo.
Nearly a century later (2017), Kumar Sangakkara stands on the threshold of emulating the great Dr Gunasekara. Sangakkara playing in his third and final season for Surrey has his county sitting in second place in the current English County Championship table, one point behind leaders Essex.
If Sangakkara can continue his extraordinary run of form he has displayed so far for the season after he completes his maiden stint as a cricket commentator for the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy, Surrey is bound to benefit a great deal from his broad bat. He is the season’s leading run getter with 876 runs (avg. 109.50) from 5 matches. With 9 more matches to go before the season’s end, Surrey could fancy their chances of landing the championship title for the first time since 2002.
In 2015 Sangakkara’s first season with Surrey he helped them win the Division 2 title and gain promotion to Division I scoring 870 runs (avg. 45.78) from 11 matches. In 2016 Sangakkara enjoyed his best season with the county scoring over 1,000 runs (1039) at an average of 49.47 from 12 matches but Surrey could finish no better than fifth. The current season could see him better that figure and help his county win the championship title and equal the feat of Dr C.H. Gunasekara which has stood unchallenged for 97 years.
Like Dr Gunasekara, Sangakkara is also a former tennis player before he decided that cricket was going to be his future and, Sri Lanka cricket has greatly benefitted by that decision. By his achievements on the cricket field Sangakkara, a former captain of Sri Lanka is today widely regarded as one of the world’s most influential and greatest cricketers of all time and holds numerous batting records of his country across all formats.
In the ongoing season Sangakkara scored five consecutive centuries for Surrey narrowly missing out being in the company of Don Bradman, Charles Fry and Mike Procter who had scored six consecutive first-class hundreds. Going for a record equaling sixth hundred he was dismissed for 84 in the second innings in Surrey’s county game against Essex last week. Surely fate cannot deprive him of another achievement in one season. Let’s hope his batting carries Surrey to a county championship triumph and make him only the second Sri Lankan to figure in a county championship winning team.
