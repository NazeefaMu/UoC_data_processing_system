PPP projects for Port City infrastructure services

The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development this week received Cabinet approval to enter into Public - Private Partnership (PPP) projects for the provision of infrastructure services to the Colombo Port City.
The first such project would be the Marine Drive extension to connect to the Port City’s proposed elevated highway.
On July 11, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka asked for Cabinet approval to have PPP projects for underground Marine Drive extension to connect Elevated Port Access Road, a 350MW power generation plant using LNG, a District Cooling Plant, sewerage/wastewater treatment plant and city airport on a sea sand fill in Colombo.
The Cabinet directed his proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management for further proposals and they, in turn, recommended that a joint venture would be more suitable for the above projects and the viability of the above projects be looked into by a three-member committee comprising Secretary, Finance and Mass Media, Secretary, Megapolis and Western Development and a representative of the Attorney General’s Department.
The government is bound to provide certain infrastructure to the Port City according to the tripartite agreement signed between the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Urban Development Authority and CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd on August 12, 2016.
The agreement stipulates that the government through the RDA will make efforts to provide a new Kelani Bridge and Port Access Elevated Highway connecting the existing Colombo-Katunayake Expressway to the project, an extension of Marine Drive to connect to the Port Access Elevated Highway and Connection of Baladaksha Mawatha to Galle Road.
It has the flexibility to decide whether it would be done under a PPP or any other structure.
The three-member committee pointed out that the projects listed above, except for the marine drive extension, needed a critical mass of end users at the Colombo Port City for them to be viable and thus approval at present has only been given to the Marine Drive extension.
The Marine Drive extension, they viewed, would also benefit the Colombo city, as a link between the Airport Highway and Marine Drive, increase the width of the Galle Face Green without disturbing heritage buildings and could provide an underground road connection to the Shangri La Hotel area.
The Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development thus invited the CHEC to undertake a feasibility study on the project but given the high costs, the company had asked that they sign a PPP agreement to ensure that the government will evaluate and negotiate the PPP on an exclusive basis.
Thus, it was decided that a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee be appointed to discuss the PPP for the project.
