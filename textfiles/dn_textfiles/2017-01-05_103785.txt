Kanagana's shocking adult film experience

Multiple awards, including three National Awards winner Kangana Ranaut’s life is a true rags to riches story and in a recent interview has revealed that she almost did a blue film.
Kanagana said that when she was a struggling actress, she was ready to take on any film and one such offer was obviously soft porn. She said that her situation forced her to accept the film just as she bagged her breakthrough role as Simran in Anurag Kashyap’s ‘Gangster’. At that time she was seventeen and she said that when the director gave her a robe with nothing inside to wear she realized that she was in a wrong kind of film but still decided to go ahead to make ends meet. Of course ‘Gangster changed her life and the rest as they say is history for this ‘Dhaam Dhoom’ girl who is now one of the most respected leading ladies of Indian cinema. (India Glitz)
