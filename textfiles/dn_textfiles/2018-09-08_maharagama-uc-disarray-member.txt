Maharagama UC in disarray - Member

Condemning the assault on four workers of the Maharagama Urban Council by its Chairman, UNP Member Dhanushka Ramanayake said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his authority should take responsibility for this situation.
He said the former President fraudulently helped the group that contested the local government elections under the bicycle symbol to win the election and capture the power of the council. So he should take the responsibility for these incidents.
He further said that the entire administration of the council has collapsed due to the poor management.
He stressed the importance of making Maharagama, a proper Urban Council in order to create a business friendly environment since Maharagama is a large suburb of Colombo city which famous as a destination for clothing and textile.
“The poor administration of the council has affected activities of the city since the council failed to fulfill the main services of the urban council such as garbage collection and disposal, providing health services and other public services,” he charged.
