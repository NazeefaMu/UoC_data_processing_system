Minister not ready to assess CTFRM recommendation on foreign judges

Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said that he was not ready to assess the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms’ (CTFRM) recommendation to include foreign judges, lawyers, and investigators in the transitional justice mechanism.
“I cannot make a statement on the inclusion of foreigners in the reconciliation process right now. I can say that we have communicated our position on the issue to the UN Commission on Human Rights. We are an independent nation that can make the final decisions,” Rajapakshe said.
The minister did say, however, that it would be very difficult to include judges in the proceedings under Sri Lankan law.
“Under the Constitution, no foreigner can sit as a judge. The recommendations will be difficult to institute because of this,” he added.
Rajapakshe also hit back at the idea that those who had suffered abuse during the war had little trust in the judiciary.
“No one is complaining about the independence of the judiciary. I have full faith that the Sri Lankan judiciary can handle this important task fairly and professionally,” he said.
He also complained that some members of the CTFRM were prejudiced and unfit to be a part of the task force.
