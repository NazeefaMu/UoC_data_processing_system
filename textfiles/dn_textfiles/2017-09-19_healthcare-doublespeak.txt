Healthcare doublespeak

Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot bear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. (W B Yeats ‘The Second Coming’)
Get thee glass eyes and like a scurvy politician, seem to see the things thou does not (Shakespeare, King Lear, Act IV, Scene 5) For the good of the many (bahujana hitaya) – The Buddha
Every country has faced the need for market forces and liberalization in public health. For the achievement of health objectives, there can be state non-market oriented, market-oriented or integrated healthcare systems. The pressing issue in Sri Lanka has been the inadequacy of health human resources, in particular, the doctors. There has been a perspective plan for health manpower development, in the late 90s which indicated the requirement of doctors on an annual basis. The governments through have been trying to respond to health manpower needs. State medical colleges have been increased at a slow pace. But needs ever increased with time. The 30-year civil war heavily and adversely influenced the implementation of the health manpower development plan. If not, the government could have increased the number of admissions of the eligible students, expanded the existing training institutions, rented out accommodation and invested on new infrastructure.
The attempt of planning, and producing doctors in private medical colleges has been a much-concerned issue. The best example was the Colombo North Medical College (NCMC). The schemata and the scripts connected with the NCMC cannot be blot out of memory. These schemata and scripts foreshadowed the sequence of similar mishaps in the future as a private medical college could pave access only to the minority of financially affordable privileged segment of students.
The same issue erupted after the establishment of a private medical college at Malabe. This medical college was established with constitutional and legislative cover. There have been no protests when it was established or when it had been functioning for a decade until the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) began a series of protests and organised hospital strikes. The patients were taken to risk adventures. Malabe Medical College has been given a rude metonym. The GMOA was dissatisfied with the culture, climate, policies, and procedures in private medical education. Their demands revolved around two issues. They were against the establishment of private medical colleges. This was the main issue. Their stand was that medical education should not be a commercial commodity and free education should continue to flourish. They also pointed out that the quality of medical education in private medical colleges would be below the accepted international standards. Some members of the public, university students, Trade Unions and some politicians too were actively supporting the GMOA demand. The government was under intense pressure from this powerful professional group.
Malabe Medical College
It could have been fortunate to have changed the pressure to an advantage for an unplanned policy change. The government might have thanked the GMOA for offering an opportunity to change a wrong short-sighted decision taken by the previous governing regime. The second issue pertaining to poor quality did not carry sufficient weight in the perspective of total quality management as the management of Malabe Medical College (MMC) has been taking positive steps to launch full-scale quality programmes. Further Dr Neville Fernando, the owner of MMC has been a medical doctor who has been conscious of quality criteria. But, there has been no opportunity for quality monitoring and evaluation of the products. However, the GMOA was resolutely firm that the quality of the products would be far below the products produced by the state medical colleges and employing the medical graduates from this private medical college would be a risk to the patients. The GMOA too has been aware of the unqualified quack doctors practicing in the country. It has been criticized that integrity is associated with professional jealousy. Total quality management was part of a holistic approach to quality progress which was already available in the state medical institutions.
The GMOA was the powerful backbone to the state health services. The large numbers of doctors were coercive leaders, innovators, and powerful change agents. They have exploited their power for influencing planning and managing changes with success. The doctors as change agents took an expert role as well as a facilitating role. As internal change agents, doctors became catalysts. They were pioneers in the field of medical education.
The government was placed in a state of a dilemma when the GMOA demanded the closure of the Malabe Medical College (MMC). There were three topics that one would wish to broach significant in comprehending the issue of Malabe Medical College (MMC). Firstly, the government was aware of the nationalization schemes that failed in the past. Secondly, there were private schools, private international schools, private institutions and even institutions affiliated to foreign universities. All these were fee levying institutions. Many countries have private medical colleges. These colleges were available even in developing countries. Further, after the breakdown in the Soviet bloc, the former socialist countries too have established private medical colleges. Many Sri Lankan students sought admission to these institutions and these were recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Private institutions did not run at a loss. There were the profit motive and the surplus income motive in operation in addition to service provision. Thirdly, in a democratic milieu, the existence and operation of fee levied teaching institutions were not restricted.
The establishment of the MMC became a solace that vastly curtailed the high cost of medical training in foreign medical colleges and saved foreign expenditure. But the GMIA was of the opinion that a private medical college should be disallowed to function because it was marketing medical education, catering the minor segment of the financially affordable population. No politician knew better than a medical professional about the quality of medical education because the doctors were voicing their opinion through first-hand practical experience, the GMOA perspective has been resourcefully and programmatically sound.
Essential services and goods free from direct cost to the population in need, are a panacea. The population would be too pleased to enjoy free services and free goods. In Sri Lanka, education and healthcare are free services. Prevision of water to the farming communities has been a long-term welfare measure. Every government has been efficiently managing environmental disasters. Some time ago we enjoyed two measures of free rice and free school mid-day meals. Free housing schemes and free distribution of lands are in operation. Free manure and a pension scheme for the farmers are available. The Poverty Alleviation (Samurdhi) Programme is open to raising the living standards of the poor. All these schemes and projects are aimed to serve the deserving and eligible majority of the population. But yet sugar and salt do not come under the list of free goods. The list of free services and goods could be expanded. In some countries, there are some other services and goods that are free to their population. Some countries offer a financial incentive to the unemployed. Sri Lanka is moving towards a welfare state and Sri Lanka is a country with widespread democracy. There have been protests, trade union actions, and even riots over human, economic, political and social issues since 1947. The outstanding feature of all these protests has been their success. For instance, soon after the 1947 mass protest, the salaries of the minor employees were increased, they were issued free railway certificates and a pension scheme was devised.
GMOA demands
Democratic governments are transient. Some politicians blamed the government for becoming autocratic. Further, the elections were around the corner. Suppose another party came into power, say those who were supporting the GMOA, they would have to implement the GMOA demand. The government has diagnosed its far-reaching relevance and impact. It would be a step for weakening capitalism (private ownership) into public property. The Government has committed itself to a dedicated, honest and genuine free market economy subject to the preservation of a welfare state.
What was essential was quick and appropriate management for a patient injured by an arrow and not waste time in finding out the answers to the five questions connected with the injury. Why the GMOA did not protest at the inception of Malabe Medical College has been argued. However, the government could be happy when there was a powerful professional organisation levering, nurturing and rewarding a wholesome workable policy planning response.
Malabe Medical College (MMC) was established with full recognition and with good intentions and the management has been improving the quality of medical training. It could be looked upon as a feasibility project and having germinated, flowered and came to fruition. The blessings of democracy have been with it for a decade but an unexpected shift has taken place. The medical graduates of MMC need not be crestfallen as medical training goes beyond frontiers and local boundaries. Human genetic potential finds its expression best in a democratic environment. There are avenues for making effective use of their knowledge.
As long as Malabe Medical College remains a state recognized medical degree awarding institution by the Government, international institutions like the World Health Organisation and other countries, it can continue to perform its assured functions and there would be clients opting for its valued services. Even foreign students would seek admission. Making it a non-fee levying state-recognized institution or affiliating it to another state university would be justifiable in the context of the GMOA. Such a policy change would favour availability, accessibility, coverage, equity, efficiency, effectiveness, quality and impact of medical education without extra cost to the eligible students. However, the ownership should be suitably compensated while ethical, legal and human rights issues require careful attention as Dr Neville Fernando has invested on it with good intentions and under the constitutional agreement.
“There are those who know and those who don't want to know. If the latter remain in the majority, and we prove so unimaginative, cowardly and self-interested that we fail to tend the early growth of this small seedling, we will soon ourselves wither and die with it. (Kinsman 1990).”
A democratic government is determined to uphold, safeguard and develop free public education at all levels including university education to ensure that national education would not be left to the mercy of market forces and the privileged class. In particular, only a very small percentage of the students with secondary education are admitted to the universities.
Danger of selfishness and private ownership
The principal characteristic of a democratic, socialist society should be the absence of private ownership of property. The Buddha did not find fault with such capitalists as guild leader Anatha Pindika or Maha Dhana. He did not suggest that their wealth should be distributed among the poor. But, he indicated how best the wealth should be utilized and pointed out the danger of selfishness and private ownership. The Buddha advised that one should treat everybody alike, like the moon, (Sarda 1998). In the MMC 30% of the students study on a scholarship basis the financial value being Rs 550 million declared Dr Neville Fernando (Mavbima, 23.7.1917 p 25). Undoubtedly the percentage could be increased.
Negotiations have been going on. Both sides have refused to give in. The GMOA made their request loud and clear. The MMC was a two-sided systemic conflict which became a win-win situation linked to a power struggle. The GMOA had a fixed objective; no other acceptable alternative and refused flexibility from the other side. Making a decision became a power struggle.
The GMOA gave deadlines and the government made concessions. Both parties were concerned with Democracy but did not split the difference and lay planks through the quicksand. One option was to allow MMC to continue while the government made positive steps to absorb the increasing number of eligible students to the state medical institutions. Another option was to carry on as usual and win a no-confidence motion and the coming elections. Yet another option was to conduct a stratified sample study of the general population for a consensus or present a proposal in parliament for free voting on the MMC issue and other burning issues.
