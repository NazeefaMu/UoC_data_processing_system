Massive hunt for double murder suspects

Four Police teams including three from Hikkaduwa Police and another seven member special team directed by Galle SSP have been deployed to arrest the suspects involved in the shooting at a digital printing press in Hikkaduwa which killed two youths on May 23.
The dead victims were Sajith Himal (34) owner of the press and Putuwatha Vithanage Kushan Danuttara (26) an employee at the press. Both succumbed to their injuries on admission to the Karapitiya hospital. A customer who visited the press had escaped by jumping off a window in the first floor of the building. He sustained injuries and was admitted to the Balapitiya hospital for treatment. Hikkaduwa Police investigating the incident believe that a longstanding rivalry between two underworld gangs had led to the shooting.
