Gazette minimum standards of medical education: GMOA

A letter had been sent to Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne requesting him to gazette the existing minimum standards of the medical education within two weeks. The duration ends on March 30, Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said. Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the minimum standard of the medical education in Sri Lanka existed for decades but according to the Court of Appeal ruling, it is not a law.
Therefore, the GMOA requested Minister Dr. Senaratne to issue the gazette notification making it a law. The GMOA will never let anyone or any organisation to lower the existing minimum standard of medical education. it can be updated and improved, he said.
Dr. Aluthge, said the GMOA along with all the other organisations will take stern action by the first week of next month if the Government does not take a decision on the issue.
It can be countrywide strike or something else. “We appeal President Maithripala Sirisena to take action to halt so called final year examination for the third batch of `medical students’ from the SAITM and the intake of students.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said it is very pathetic to see how the owner of a fraudulent company act above the country’s law no matter which Government in power. Cabinet Ministers support him without supporting the state bodies.
When a low quality company comes up, the institution which safeguard the high quality is threatened by many. Attacking the SLMC and its members means attacking the rights of patients.
