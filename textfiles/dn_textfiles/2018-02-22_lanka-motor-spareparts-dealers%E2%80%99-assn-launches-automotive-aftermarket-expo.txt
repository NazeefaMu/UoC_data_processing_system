Lanka motor spareparts dealers’ Assn. launches automotive aftermarket expo

The Lanka Motor Spare Part Dealers’ Association of Sri Lanka, in conjunction with AMB Tarsus Events Group, a leading trade show organiser in the Southeast Asia region, officially unveiled the LANKAAUTO 2018 Expo at a members’ event held on February 20, 2018. This was held in conjunction with a signing ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding between the two parties which cemented their cooperation in co-organising the exhibition.
A first of its kind in Sri Lanka, LANKAAUTO 2018 will provide a platform for international and local manufacturers and suppliers of auto parts, accessories and service and repair equipment to meet and network with buyers and business owners throughout Sri Lanka.
The expo will be held from August 23-25, at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre in Colombo, and is expected to showcase over 100 international brands with Pavilions from Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, India, UAE and China.
The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding officially acknowledges LMSPDA as the host and a co-organiser of the LANKAAUTO 2018 expo. In addition, LMSPDA will also nominate a group of its members to form the LANKAAUTO organising committee to provide advice and support to AMB Tarsus Events Group with their local knowledge on Sri Lanka’s automotive aftermarket industry, in order to ensure the successful organisation of the exhibition.
At the same time, AMB Tarsus Events Group, under the MoU, will provide a special rebate on the participation fees at LANKAAUTO 2018 for participating LMSPDA members. The company will also help to foster cross-border relations between LMSPDA and other similar associations in countries where it is active in the automotive aftermarket industry including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and the Philippines. LANKAAUTO 2018 aims to shed light on the newest trends in the auto aftermarket, both on the local and international scale. Visitors will also be introduced to a variety of innovations and developments in automotive parts and systems, accessories, vehicle electronics and media devices, specialised tuning and modifications, and much more besides.
