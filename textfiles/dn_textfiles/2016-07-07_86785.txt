Currently the gross weight is stated in documents but a certificate is not issued. Hence, legislations which were made with the consultation of all parties by the Merchant Shipping Secretariat, should be drafted through the Legal Draftsman to issue licence for Container Weight Verifiers and Container Transporters. The proposal made by the Minister of Ports and Shipping, Arjuna Ranatunga, to draft above legislations and thereafter publish in the gazette and present in parliament for approval, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Being IDPs their political rights including the right to vote were affected, and they face difficulties in accessing services rendered by the Divisional Secretariat, registration of Births and Deaths as well as enrolling children for schools.

Maintaining a pool of elephants for cultural activities
The perahera culture of Sri Lanka has a great history and has attracted the world’s attention. It has been observed that it is essential to use elephants in peraheras to maintain its pride and devoutness. When several cultural activities are held together with the Dalada Perahera, the number of elephants are insufficient. Therefore, a pool of about 35 elephants is proposed to be established under the Zoological Department, with elephants obtained from Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage and Udawalawa Eth Athuru Sevana, with the objective of training for perahera purposes. The proposal made by the Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, on the above matter, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
