Files related to Lasantha’s murder discovered

Many files, similar to those that were reported missing, in the investigations related to the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge, had been discovered from the house of the arrested former Crimes OIC of Mount Lavinia Police, according to CID sources.
According to Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara, the police have the authority to search the residence of a person who is under arrest even without a search warrant.
The CID had also found several forged documents at the arrested Crimes OIC SI Sugathapala’s residence.
On January 8, 2009, Lasantha Wickramatunge was killed by two assailants who had followed him on a motorcycle at Attidiya. Although investigations were initiated into the crime, the case remained stagnant with no promising progress.
However, the present government recommenced investigations since assuming power and evidence pertaining to this crime has been surfacing gradually.
The arrested Crimes OIC had also admitted that he had acted to conceal the evidence of the killing based on the instructions of senior officials of the police.
Meanwhile, CID sources said further statements will be recorded from them shortly, including the former IGP who is currently overseas.
Lasantha’s case is scheduled to be taken up at the Mount Lavinia Courts on February 16 and it is believed that vital information pertaining to his murder will be revealed in court on that date.
