Hindu Makkal Katchi oppose Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka

 
Accusing the Sri Lankan government of suppressing Hinduism and following a policy of Buddhist chauvinism,  Hindu Makkal Katchi leader Arjun Sampath on Saturday opposed the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the island nation to take part in the Buddhist festival.
He said “From the times of twin epics Mahabharath and Ramayan, Tamil Eelam is the land of Lord Siva and a part of the expanded ‘Paripoorna Hindu Rashtra’. But, the entire island had been declared as a Buddhist state and the Hindus in the island who are the natives of Lanka had been massacred, Arjun Sampath added.
