Matale teachers take students for a ride

Students of Matale State schools face many second-hand treatments if they do not attend private classes that their teachers conduct in the town, members of parents’ associations in Matale said.
Some teachers condemn students who do not attend private classes in front of other students, parents say. State school teachers conduct private classes at different locations in the town for one subject and when they ask students to attend their classes, the students are in dilemma as to how they can fulfill their teachers’ demand.
The parents said the teachers use State schools for their marketing purposes and utterly neglect their duty towards the students and society.
Matale educational authorities turn a blind eye to this issue and that resulted in degenerating the educations of State schools in the area, they said.
