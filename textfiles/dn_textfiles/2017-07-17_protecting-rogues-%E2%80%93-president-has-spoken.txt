PROTECTING ROGUES – THE PRESIDENT HAS SPOKEN

Even without modern forensic technology, the Sri Lanka Police successfully investigated celebrated criminal cases such as the Whitehouse murder case, the Ceylon Turn Club murder and robbery, the Adelene Vitharane Murder Case, the Kadugannawa Parcel Bomb Case etc., To investigators of the calibre of Albert Silva Makalanda, Iyer, Ambalavanar, Thavarajah, Sergeants Appuhamy and Sediris the crimes of the last regime would not have been challenges. However, it must also be conceded, the politicians of the time were truly honourabe
The entire nation has waited anxiously with bated breath and in hope for over two years to see at least one crook of the last regime prosecuted, convicted and punished. To bring those who had robbed the nation to justice was the main plank of the platform on which this government came to power giving the people the promise of good governance and better times. This remains a distant dream.
Law abiding citizens are bitter. They are angry. Day by day they are losing faith in their leaders. Even those who had been considered clean have sullied their hands and even their faces with layer upon layer of bonded faecal matter. The stench is unbearable. But with no alternative, not even a Macron on the horizon the peoples’ despair keeps on rising.
Celebrated criminal cases
Coming back to the subject, all were blaming the IGP, FCID, the NPC, the Bribery Commission and even the Minister for Law and Order. Even a potty passport forgery that could have been solved by a recruit PC or a peon of the Department of Immigration and Emigration has become a mighty challenge to our Scotland Yard trained investigators.
Even without modern forensic technology, the Sri Lanka Police successfully investigated celebrated criminal cases such as the Whitehouse murder case, the Ceylon Turn Club murder and robbery, the Adelene Vitharane Murder Case, the Kadugannawa Parcel Bomb Case etc., To investigators of the calibre of Albert Silva Makalanda, Iyer, Ambalavanar, Thavarajah, Sergeants Appuhamy and Sediris the crimes of the last regime would not have been challenges. However, it must also be conceded, the politicians of the time were truly honourabe. They did not commit crime, encourage crime or protect criminals.
Today even with all the unpleasant extraneous constraints, OICs of Police Stations, loaded with unproductive work such as providing security to tin pot political riff-raff successfully investigate, without the assistance of the AG’s Dept, well planned bank and highway robberies and the activities of drug cartels.
These overworked, underpaid, least recognized, but infinitely more honourable than those officially carrying the prefix are indeed delivering. The country can be proud of these dedicated middle rank officers.
Ongoing investigations
Why then have these vital investigations gone awry? At last the cat is out of the bag. The lead story of an English weekly on July 9 says it all: “President Maithripala Sirisena has virtually declared a three month deadline for his coalition government to prosecute those responsible for high profile murders and corruption or risk losing its hold on power. President Sirisena told the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that he was extremely uneasy about alleged backroom dealings of two key figures of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa’s administration.”
The President has also stated that he was aware of those who have cut deals to either delay or scuttle some of the ongoing investigations; this is unacceptable.
The President has spoken. He must now translate his words to action. He has not only to deal with the rogues but also the rascals protecting the rogues. It’s now or never. The people expect their President to do his duty.
