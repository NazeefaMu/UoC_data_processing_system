Govt all out to contain underworld - MP

The government is doing its best to mitigate and control underworld activities and the UNP does not have any connection to any underworld activities. If anyone is against its mitigation, they would be against the country’s justice system, MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said.
Speaking at a press briefing held at Sirikotha yesterday, the MP said that many members of the Joint Opposition had ties with the underworld which are the reasons for the recent shootings of Karandeniya Vice Chairman Donald Sampath and Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia Municipal Councillor K. Ranjan de Silva.
“They were killed due to their ties with the underworld which is not the case with the UNP,” he said.
“Many criticise the party’s agreement with the LTTE and say that the party is pro LTTE. However, the UNP did not pay the LTTE large sums of money and bring LTTE leaders to Temple Trees and offer them high ranking places in 2005 as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did, which prevented our party from winning the Presidential elections then. If there is any LTTE activity, we will thwart it as evident from the arrest of the persons transporting weapons recently,” the MP said.
He criticised the actions of the Joint Opposition of electing members of the same family when there are many senior politicians. “The UNP has many senior politicians with high potential and do not count on a family to win the presidential election,” Amarasena said.
