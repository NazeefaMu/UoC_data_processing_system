Unresolved issues of Samurdhi officers and staff would be solved fast and Samurdhi recipients would be empowered, Social Empowerment Minister P.Harrison said.
He said Samurdhi Officers had been stagnating in the same position deprived of promotions and career opportunities. He said their issues have to be addressed soon as it was a grave injustice. “Then only their fullest service could be gained for the benefit of the Samurdhi recipients,”

He said although Samurdhi programme continued for a long period under the previous government after the Janasaviya programme, the country had yet to reach the expected targets. He said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had placed their confidence in him to deliver on the expected targets in reaching the rural masses.
The Minister it is for the first time that the Samurdhi subject had been vested under a UNP Minister.”But nobody needs to take me as a monster,” the Minister said. “I would like to take the support of all and to empower the poor Samurdhi recipients as it is a national responsibility.”
Minister further said that both his Previous and incumbent Ministerial Portfolios had to deal with the people in rural areas so that he could attend address the issues of the common people.
