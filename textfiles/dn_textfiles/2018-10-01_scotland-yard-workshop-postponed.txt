Scotland Yard workshop postponed

The Scotland Yard workshop that was to be attended by the Deputy Law and Order Minister Nalin Bandara, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara and several ministry officials in the UK has been postponed, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
Deputy Minister Bandara, IGP Pujith Jayasundara, Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanne, Senior Assistant Secretary Malika Sooriyapperuma and Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Mahesh Senaratne were scheduled to attend this workshop organised by Scotland Yard from October 1-6 based on an invitation extended by the British Government.
However, Minister Maddumabandara said that due to the ongoing investigations of IG Pujith Jayasundara and the country’s situation pertaining to several issues within the Police force, the decision was taken to postpone this workshop. IGP Pujith Jayasundara is facing allegations of having accepted a bribe in 2008 and is currently under investigation by a three member Committee appointed by Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara.
