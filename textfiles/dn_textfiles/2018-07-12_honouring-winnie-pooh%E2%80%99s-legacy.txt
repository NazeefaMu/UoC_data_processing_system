HONOURING Winnie the  Pooh’s  Legacy

“It really is a lovely, funny adventure. We’ll come out the better for it, having seen it, I think.”
That much Ewan McGregor promises of ‘Christopher Robin’ in ET’s exclusive featurette. McGregor plays the titular Christopher in the film, the grown-up version of Pooh’s best pal.
“Winnie the Pooh comes back to him at a difficult time in his life,” McGregor explains. “He sort of speaks a lot of truth, Pooh.”
The film, which opens in theaters on August 3, is from director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) and co-stars Hayley Atwell as Christopher’s wife, Evelyn, as well as one of the original voice of Winnie the Pooh, Jim Cummings. New additions such as Brad Garrett and Toby Jones round out the voice cast, as Eeyore and Owl, respectively. Of returning A.A. Milne’s beloved stuffed animals to the screen, Atwell gushes, “These are the characters that my generation, my parents’ generation and now this generation are growing up with... This is a charming story of a man finding his home again and finding that inner child.”
In addition to honouring a legacy like Cummings, Christopher Robin enlists the songwriting of Richard M. Sherman, who wrote music and lyrics for the very first Winnie the Pooh short film, 1966’s ‘Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree’.
“Winnie the Pooh became a dear friend of mine when Walt gave us the assignment to write songs for the first Winnie the Pooh short film,” Sherman says.
“And here, so many years later, it is very special to be back in the Hundred Acre Woods.”
