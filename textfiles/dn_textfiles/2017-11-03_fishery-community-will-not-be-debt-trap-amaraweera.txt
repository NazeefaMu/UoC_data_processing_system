Fishery community will not be in debt trap: Amaraweera

Since most housing projects make people indebted to banks, the Fisheries Ministry will never place the fishery community in a debt trap. As such, the Ministry will grant Rs. 350,000 to each family to build a permanent house and Rs. 100,000 to complete a half-complete home, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister made this observation at a ceremony held at the Nonagama Cultural Centre to mark the distribution of Rs. 33.9 million as housing assistance among 339 fishery families in Hambantota district.
A consignment of 26 boats and 23 containers were also distributed at this ceremony, where Rs. 30,000 each was distributed among another 50 families to uplift domestic sanitary facilities.
The Minister said owning a house is a dream come true for each and every family. Since he assumed office, he had directed Ministry officials to conduct a census on fishery families living in shanties without proper sanitation facilities in their homes, to assist them with financial grants to overcome their housing problems.
According to the statistics compiled by them, 30,000 fishery families lacked proper sanitation facilities. As such, the Ministry would grant Rs. 30,000 to each family to fulfill this shortcoming in their homes.
