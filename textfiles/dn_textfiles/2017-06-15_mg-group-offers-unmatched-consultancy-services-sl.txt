MG Group offers unmatched consultancy services in SL

While Sri Lanka remains strategically placed to benefit from the changing global marketplace, development of economic and social infrastructure is pivotal to unleashing our true potential.
With a distinct focus on bringing economic success, serving the increasing infrastructure requirements of our country, the MG Group of Companies (MGC), a dynamic trailblazer in the form of a network of independent companies has broken new ground.
MGC was established in 1998 as MG Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. When international consultancy firms dominated the infrastructure industry as the lead consultants and local counterparts only provided a limited range of support, MGC had a unique ability to drive fundamental change through its depth and breadth of expertise and experience which assisted the organization to break away from the shackles of international firms and traditional norms and be the first local consultancy firm to be recognized as the lead consultant for many projects.
MGC strengthened its ascent through the acquisition of the country’s pioneering engineering consultancy firm, Engineering Consultants (Pvt) Ltd. (ECL) in 2011.
ECL is endorsed as the most respected engineering services provider in the industry. Together they offer the widest and most varied range of consultancy services unmatched in Sri Lanka.
Infrastructure-related entities that compliment each other were added into the Group such as ECL Energy (Pvt) Ltd and Enterprise Technology (Pvt) Ltd (ETPL).
ECL Energy has carved a niche for itself in the renewable energy industry as a highly successful hydro power solution provider for both local and international projects while ETPL is a leading network systems integrator offering SMART ICT infrastructure solutions. Further expansion was witnessed through the amalgamation of Nimbus Venture (Pvt) Ltd, expanding the group’s ability to provide smart IT platforms and cutting-edge technology for its clients.
Through these strategic acquisitions and having consistently outgrown boundaries MGG has grown into an international reputed brand. The Group serves the nation as Sri Lanka’s leading provider of end-to-end services for infrastructure development offering complete turnkey solutions to the infrastructure sector under one roof.
A truly integrated, multi-disciplinary organisation, MGG has diversified across a broad spectrum of sectors including transportation, built environments, education, health, urban development, water, irrigation, sewerage, environment and land, ICT, enterprise technology, renewable energy and property development.
With a global footprint spanning eight countries, a proven reputation locally and internationally for technical excellence and exceptional client satisfaction, to date MGG has completed 1,235 projects, valued at over US$ 1.8 billion.
As the group confidently looks forward to continued strong growth, it is now exploring the challenges and opportunities in executing a global expansion strategy and looking towards merges and acquisitions.
The group has vast experience in the transport sector, providing consultancy services for expressways, national and rural roads and has also been able to successfully conceptualize and execute several landmark end-to-end infrastructure projects and has revamped existing ones, delivering better efficiency and profitability.
A few of these include the Colombo South Harbour Container Terminal, the Epilepsy Hospital and Health Centres, Phase 4 Building of the Medical Faculty of Sri Jayawardanapura University, the Greater Kandy Water Supply Project and the Moratuwa-Ratmalana-Ja-ela Waste Water Disposal Project.
