Campaign against alcohol abuse, drugs

The students of All Ashraq Junior School conducted an awareness campaign on eradicating alcohol use, recently.
They commenced the campaign from the school premises, walked along the main road for about 4 km and returned to the school premises. They carried placards stating, ‘Taking alcohol kills your innocent children's lives’, ‘Don't sell alcohol to students’ etc.
The students also distributed leaflets on the negative effects of alcohol.
The principal and teachers also participated.
