Curd industry on difficult path

The curd industry in the Hambantota district is facing a crisis due to various reasons. Increasing cattle thefts the rising cost of poonac and cattle feed, lack of treatment for cattle when they fall sick and lack of grazing lands have resulted in this situation.
Meanwhile, farmers said buffaloes are ill-treated by owners.
They die on roads as they are abandoned due to old age.
