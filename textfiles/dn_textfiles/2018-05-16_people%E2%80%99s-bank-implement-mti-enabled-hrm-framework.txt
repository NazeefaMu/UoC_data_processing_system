People’s Bank to implement  MTI-enabled HRM Framework

People’s Bank is set to execute a Scientific Capacity Planning Study linked to Career and Succession Planning and a Two Way Performance Appraisals Mechanism, which was facilitated by MTI Consulting with the main objective of realigning the HR systems and appraisal process of the bank.
Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of People’s Bank, N. Vasantha Kumar stated: “MTI worked closely with People’s Bank in developing the Strategic Plan in 2015, and are very acquainted with the challenges faced by the Bank and its employees, relating in particular to customer service quality and human resources management. The intended study is a result of the outcome of the Bank’s Strategic Plan, which will lead to the implementation of two of the most important Strategic Initiatives identified using MTI’s 8S® Model relating to human resources. This study will involve the interactive engagement from all employees of the bank.”
MTI CEO, Hilmy Cader expressing his pleasure to work with People’s Bank again, stated that it is vital for the bank to implement a Scientific Capacity Planning study linked to Career and Succession Planning, which will impact and enhance the service quality and motivation of the staff. Cader further added that a Two Way Performance Appraisals Mechanism is essential to improve the effectiveness of the bank’s current HR system and ensure the processes are agile with the objective of satisfying both internal and external customers.
