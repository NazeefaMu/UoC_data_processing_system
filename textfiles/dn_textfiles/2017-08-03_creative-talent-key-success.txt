Creative talent - key to success

The staff of an organisation is its most valuable asset thus managing, nurturing and keeping staff engaged and motivated is a key to an organisation’s ability to provide high-quality product and service. This requires the development of a creative talent management strategy which must be related to the organisation’s vision, mission, strategic goals, and objectives and to be implemented in daily processes throughout the organisation as a whole.
One of the most important goals of any organisation is to promote efficiency and effectiveness that could lead to organisational success. In this competitive and dynamic business era, learning and development has become a backbone of success thus without continuous learning gaining and maintain performance may become impossible. Talent is the primary driver of any successful organisation.
Successful organisations which practice effective learning and development begin with their employees. Organisations with first class learning and development initiatives are excellent in listening on employee improvement needs and are able to express those needs back to the employee in clear and enlightening terms.
The talent management strategy is at the centre of attention in many modern organisations. The effective implementation of a talent management strategy requires continuity and regularity because decisions in this area involve significant resources and their effects are only noticeable in the longer term.
Strategic objectives
A talent management process is part of strategic workforce planning, and an exercise that helps determine the future talent requirements an organisation will need to meet its strategic objectives. Talent identification and development, which is known as talent management, refers to the process by which an organisation identifies employees who are capable to play leadership role in future. Developing and implementing talent management requires the commitment of senior management as well as HR department and all the members of the organisation.
Modern enterprises face deficit of talented workers and find it difficult to retain human resources of a quality sufficient to ensure a competitive edge. The supply of highly qualified, commitment and incentivized personnel is at stake. Personnel of these calibres will generate a sustainable competitive edge. Attracting, retaining and developing talented workers are become crucial.
When staff hiring, organisations traditionally focus on competencies, knowledge, skills, work experience and qualifications as these are generally easier to articulate, identify and measure. However, values, traits, behaviours and motivational drivers are equally and sometimes more important. While the competencies and knowledge provide valuable information and insight about an individual’s readiness for a particular role, traits and drivers help to reveal a person’s potential for leadership.
As businesses continually apply new technologies, new business growth models, and new marketing strategies, the workforce’s up-skilling becomes constant and continuous. Understanding strategies to talent retention and development will be able to help to be successful in operating in the market place hence lead to good organisational performance.
Talent management
Many organisations understand the idea of a high potential pool or a group of people who receive more development attention. But unfortunately, most of the organisations too often fail to engage in the activities that bolster their talent pipelines, equip individuals with business critical knowledge and skills, and properly deploy those individuals in positions that serve to develop and engage them. Organisations that have a strategic talent management programme in place generate more than twice the revenue per employee that those without programmes, have a low employee turnover rate, and have a higher level of employee engagement.
There are number of reasons why certain business leaders undervalue talent management. Some business leaders believe their organisations survive without top talent. Other business leaders may acknowledge that talent management is important, but not as important as other business functions like finance or technology. Still other business leaders simply fail to see the link between talent and their organisation’s business strategy because their backgrounds are not in HR and talent management.
Taking a leader from potential to readiness is an equally long process.
A recipe for five-star talent management includes a potent blend of content, expertise and technology. It takes best-in-class content to drive the assessment and development of people and a system constructed by knowledgeable experts who have seen a range of implementations. Software should support the process, but it can’t stand alone.
Smart organisations need to offer staff stretch opportunities within the business which allow motivated individuals to work a set number of days per week or month in a completely different discipline or department. This process enables them to explore their transferable skills, their intellectual flexibility and offers the opportunity to develop their leadership potentials. Many organisations equate the concept of talent management with senior leadership succession management. While succession planning is obviously important, talent management must encompasses a far broader portion of the employee population. Value creation does not come from senior leadership alone. The ability of an organisation to compete depends upon the performance of all its key talent and its ability to develop and promote that talent.
Talent management practices can create the most permanent competitive advantages. New technologies and innovations can be easily be replicated by competitors and generates only temporary competitive advantages. Sustained competitive advantage comes from talent management practices in other words, how the organisation attracts, develops, retains, motivates, manages and rewards its talent.
Like a machine, a business will fail to operate successfully if key elements such as processes, systems and structure are misaligned or hindered by friction between those elements and like a machine, a business must be designed, operated and maintained. These functions are performed by the human capital employed by the enterprise indeed, talent typically is the single biggest lever for driving improvements to business performance thus an organisation’s talent inject capabilities that are very difficult for competitors to benchmark and replicate.
Competitive environment
More than any other asset, talent provides the potential for long-term competitive advantage. The talent pool is a group of employees with special traits and is source of future senior executives and these sources of talented employees can be internal or external. The best way to create a talent pool is the internal sources since the employees have already the knowledge of how business process work and can be incorporated directly into the new position and morale of workforce uplifted. However, if the organisation wants to introduce radical changes or to renew the culture, external sources are the best.
Most of the organisations today have an adequate supply of talent. However gaps exist at the top of the organisation, in the first to middle level leadership ranks, and the front lines. Talent is an increasingly scarce resource so it must be managed to the fullest effect. Along with the understanding of the need to hire, develop and retain talented people, organisations are aware that they must manage talent as a critical resource to achieve the best possible results.
In the current competitive environment, talented people are important in every field. Successful organisations know their talent management needs because they have designed and implemented a viable talent management strategy. In today’s organisation, talent management needs to transform from a support activity to a competitive activity.
