The ‘Kick’ actress has been managing her films, brand endorsements and partying, and she is enjoying her busy life.
“One can work and play. One can do both the things. You have to work hard for something what you like. It’s is part of my job and I am happy about my work and it translates on-screen. For me my work has become a play,” said the actress. The Times of India
