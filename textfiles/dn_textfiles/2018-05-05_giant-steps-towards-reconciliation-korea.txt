Giant steps towards reconciliation in Korea

Decried as a reclusive leader and ridiculed as a madman by the Western media and its acolyte media sources in the Third World, the leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Kim Jong Un proved smarter than his adversaries thought.
Unmoved by criticism and slander, often mincing no words in denouncing US imperialism and its allies, Kim Jong pursued his own strategic goal of achieving nuclear deterrence often going to the brink of war but never resorting to war. Thus in a hostile international climate in which country after country, especially in West Asia and Africa succumbed to US aggression and collapsed, North Korea struggled to exist albeit with much sacrifices and even UN facilitated sanctions. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on April 27.
The two leaders agreed to pursue complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and set a year’s deadline for the conclusion of a peace treaty. The two countries are technically at war since the Armistice at the end of the Korean War. The Panmunjom Declaration issued jointly by the two Heads of State “confirmed the common good of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula” and “carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard.”
Several minor yet important measures were also contemplated. Already both countries have dismantled the public hostile broadcast systems that were in operation in the DMZ. The DMZ is to be converted into a Zone of Peace. There will be regular meetings between the military commanders of the two sides. A hot line has been established connecting the two Presidents. Another Summit between the two leaders is being planned and it is expected to be held in Pyongyang by December 2018. North Korea has halted its missile development and nuclear test programme and joint military exercises by the US and South Korea also stands suspended. However, there is no mention of the fate of 28,000 strong US military contingents in South Korea. The development of the peace process would make their presence redundant and the dismantling of US bases a necessity.
Internationally these developments have received positive evaluation (except for few skeptics, mostly in the US, Japan and Israel) and Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un are expected to meet in May or June, probably in the DMZ. Of special significance is the support and security provided to North Korea by China and Russia throughout. Peace in the Pacific Ocean area and especially in the areas around the seas of Japan and China is very vital to contain the ever more aggressive incursion of the United Sates in the region, which has declared the Pacific Ocean as its most strategic zone of action.
North Korea has strengthened its relations with China recently, Kim Jong Un himself travelling there few weeks ago. This relationship is a vital existential one for both countries.
Japan in the vortex of North East Asian politics and having its own historical problems with both Koreas is naturally sensitive to these developments. A tripartite Summit of Japan, China and China attended by Premier Shinzo Abe, President Moon Jae and Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled for May 9.
Asian giants meet
The Korean summit has taken the glare out of the summit of India and China that was held recently in Wuhan, China. The two Asian giants decided to strengthen their relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping in a statement said, “China and India are both important engines for global growth and we are central pillars for promoting a multi-polar and globalized world. A good China-India relationship is an important and positive factor for maintaining peace and stability in the world.”
Modi said that as India and China represented 40 percent of the world’s population, they needed to try to work together to tackle global problems.
Stressing the importance of world peace, Modi said both nations have to “make all possible contributions”.
The two leaders have decided to issue strategic guidelines to their militaries to strengthen communications so as to avoid unfortunate incidents like the Doklam clash last year.
India and China share a 3500 km border, much in the deserted and snow-clad Himalayas. There is no Actual Line of Control (ALC) and the border is disputed in several places.
The two countries also agreed to implement a project jointly in Afghanistan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit India in 2019.
The improvement of relations between the two countries will have a salutary effect on peace in Asia, especially in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. A clash of the two giants, on the other hand, will seriously affect littoral states in the region including Sri Lanka in particular. Actually improvement of the relations between the two Asian giants will directly improve the prospects of development in Sri Lanka.
