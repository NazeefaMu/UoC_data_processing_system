Cathay Pacific to commence non-stop service to Seattle

Cathay Pacific will commence a new non-stop service to Seattle from March 31 2019, becoming the only airline that will directly link Hong Kong with the fastest-growing city on the west coast of the United States.
Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer Rupert Hogg said the Seattle route, which will be operated by the airline’s state-of-the-art Airbus A350-900 aircraft, underscores the airline’s expansion strategy to connect new destinations not otherwise served from Hong Kong – and to link its home, one of the most innovative cities in Asia, with tech hubs the world over.
The Cathay Pacific Group is undergoing a period of unprecedented growth, with nine new destinations having already been announced for launch this year.
Hogg further added, “We are very pleased to be introducing Seattle and to provide more convenience and choice to our customers. There are strong business, trade and cultural ties between Hong Kong and the city and we believe there will be considerable demand for both business and leisure travel on this new route.
“We have developed a significant presence in the United States and the launch of Seattle not only reaffirms our commitment to the important North American market but also to strengthening Hong Kong’s status as Asia’s largest international aviation hub.”
The four-times-weekly service will see Seattle become the airline’s eighth passenger gateway in the United States, and its 10th in North America. Cathay Pacific currently serves Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York (JFK), New York (Newark), San Francisco, Toronto and Vancouver. A new Cathay Pacific service to Washington DC will commence from September 15 2018.
In terms of tourism, Seattle, also known as “The Emerald City” for its year-round greenery, delights even the most discerning traveller. Lovers of the great outdoors will find inspiration in the beautiful hiking trails that are a feature of this city of nearly three quarters of a million residents, while magnificent views of Puget Sound, Lake Washington and Mount Rainier await those who visit the observation deck atop Seattle’s iconic Space Needle, the setting for many romantic movie scenes.
