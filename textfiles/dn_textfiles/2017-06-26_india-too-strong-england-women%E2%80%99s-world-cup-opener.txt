India too strong for England in Women’s World Cup opener

LONDON, Saturday – India beat hosts England by 35 runs on the opening day of the 2017 Women's World Cup at Derby on Saturday.
India piled up an imposing 281 for three in their 50 overs thanks to fifties from Smriti Mandhana (90) and Punam Raut (86), who put on 144 for the first wicket, as well as 71 from skipper Mithali Raj.
Only reigning world champions Australia had previously made a success of chasing a bigger target in a women's one-day international. England just about kept themselves in the hunt and were still in with a chance thanks to Fran Wilson's maiden fifty at 229 for six in the 44th over.
But her departure for 81 -- one of four run-outs in the innings -- left the lower order of England, now a team of full-time professionals, with too much to do.
Three-times champions England, who've won the previous two World Cups staged in their own country, were eventually bowled out for 246. “It was a brilliant opening partnership between Smriti and Punam,” said the assured Raj, who was seen reading a book before she came into bat wearing a floppy hat rather than the now ubiquitous helmet.
“After I batted, I realised that the wicket didn't have much assistance for the bowlers, and that the spinners, in particular, will have to bowl in the right areas.”
England captain Heather Knight, who opted to field first after winning the toss, added: “I thought the wicket would do a bit more, but to be honest, we didn't put the ball in the right areas.
“We bowled too short and let them get away. We backed ourselves to chase it down but lost wickets and struggled.
“India took the game away from us with the bat. It was an exciting match but I'm really disappointed to end up on the losing side.” Scores: India 281-3, 50 overs (S Mandhana 90, P Raut 86, M Raj 71)
