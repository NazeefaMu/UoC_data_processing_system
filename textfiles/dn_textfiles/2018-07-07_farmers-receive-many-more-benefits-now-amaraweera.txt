Farmers receive many more benefits now: Amaraweera

No past regime has showered the farmer population with such enormous benefits as done by the government, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a media conference held yesterday at the Agriculture Ministry.
The Minister said his ministry has already allocated funds to start number of agriculture development projects to make 500,000 home gardens, rehabilitate 1,500 reservoirs, and establish 1,500 agriculture villages by 2020. The government has taken measures to offer farmers with free insurance coverage for six varieties of crops starting from the 2018 Yala season.
The Agrarian Insurance Board will provide the insurance policy for the farmers who cultivate big onion, potatoes, maize, soybeans and chilies. Rs. 40,000 per acre or Rs. 100,000 per hectare will be paid if their crops get damaged.
The government has already directed the necessary funds amounting Rs. 5.228 billion for the insurance scheme, the Minister said.
