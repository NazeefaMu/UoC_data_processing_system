Nearly 82,000 H’tota families sans houses

About 82,000 families in the Hambantota district live under trying circumstances without permanent houses, Housing and Constructions Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He said this was revealed after a recent survey. He added that steps have been taken to provide houses to families under the housing projects launched by his ministry.
Families without houses will be provided with a plot of land and loans to build houses, the minister said.
