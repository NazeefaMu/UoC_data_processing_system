In favour of unity

There is a special significance in 2018, related to March. The first day was Medin and the last day is Bak Full Moon Poya Day. Another notable feature of the forthcoming month is that it is the festive season for both Sinhalese and Tamils.
It was on a Bak Full Moon Poya Day, in the fifth year of the Buddha that he perceived, with his divine eye, a dispute brewing between two Sri Lankan Naga Kings: Chulodara and Mahodhara. According to Mahavamsa Mahodhara ruled the Naga Kingdom by the sea. His younger sister married the Naga King of the Kannaraddhamana Mountain. Her son was Chulodhara.
His beloved mother's father had given to his beloved mother a magnificent gem-studded throne. This finally resulted in a war between the uncle and nephew to possess the throne.
The Buddha visited Sri Lanka, enlightened Chulodara and Mahodhara with the noble teachings. The Buddha arrived in Sri Lanka on a Bak Full Moon Poya Day, accompanied by Deity Samiddhisumana.
The Enlightened One illustrated the evils of discord and the benefit of unity. The Buddha expounded Kakoluka, Dhandana, Latukika and Wattaka Jataka stories. The Blessed One can be considered as the greatest communicator. His sermons are simple and easy to understand. The Kakoluka Jataka relates the controversy between the birds and animals. The Bhikkus questioned:
“Most Venerable Sir, when did the crows and owls begin to hate each other?”
The Buddha replied: “The hatred began an aeon ago: Finally, the controversy ended when they elected a Golden Swan as their kings. Monks, I was the Golden Swan at that time.”
The Latukika Jataka centres round Devadatta. Even in his previous births, he was wicked and vicious. “Venerable Monks, as a Bodhisatva, I was born as the King of Elephants. Katakirilla – an innocent bird, appealed to me not to kill its eggs while roaming the forest. I advised them not to harm the eggs.
There was a lonely elephant. He was the present Devadatta. He planned to destroy him with the assistance of a frog, fly and a crow.
My message was never to take revenge on anyone and be kind and compassionate to all,” stated the Buddha.
Wattaka Jataka was woven around the story of a crow and a bird, known as snipe or quail.
