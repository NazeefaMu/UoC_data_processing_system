SLTA coaching programme gets underway

 
The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) has signed Eric Pietersz from the Netherlands to improve the standard of the sport in the country with its new coaching programme. He was selected after interviewing many coaches and he was the national coach of Malaysia from 2014 to 2015. Vice President of SLTA Sohan Patrick said this at the press conference held at SLTA premises recently to introduce the new coach.
SLTA has strived to get numerous foreign coaches, systems and processes and tried very hard to bring the SLTA coaching program back to former glory since 2005.
Pietersz has a good track record where ever he has coached, including the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. He is an ITF level three qualified coach and last year Malaysia qualified from the Davis Cup group three to group two under his guidance.
He has worked extensively in Barcelona, Spain and in the Netherlands. He is also a writer and holds a Bachelor's degree in sports education. He has worked with players in the ITF Juniors top 100 in the world, he further said.
The new coaching program under Pietersz began last Tuesday. The SLTA focused on the top 5-6 players of each age group and managed the national pools by the guidance of Pietersz. Other than the SLTA has chosen top six seeds of each of the junior age groups from under 12 to under 16 in both boys and girls categories from private tennis academies under its wing to train under the mentorship of Pietersz.
SLTA is expecting to build top juniors for the international level by doing these programs, Vice President pointed out.
Speaking at the press conference, Pietersz said, "I hope to bring back the good times back to the SLTA during my stint as coach. I understood about Sri Lanka's achievements in the past and I accept the challenge."
President of SLTA Iqbal Bin Isaac, Vice Presidents of SLTA Ravindranath Perera, Udith Wickremesinghe, Sohan Patrick and General Secretary Pradeep Goonasekara participated on the occasion.
