Death-defying cheese rolling race

A champion cheese chaser has smashed the record for the most wins in Gloucestershire’s death-defying cheese rolling race.Chris Anderson, 30, says he now has “nothing to prove” after scooping his 22nd Double Gloucester cheese in 14 years.
The professional soldier, who doesn’t even like the taste of Double Gloucester, tumbled down Cooper’s Hill in Brockworth to get his hands on an 8lb wheel of the cheese.He broke the record held by fellow dairy-devil Stephen Gyde, who boasted 20 cheeses before retiring in 2009 to focus on being a father.
Anderson won the first and third of three races on Monday, with thousands of spectators turning out to watch the centuries-old tradition.
It is unclear how many people took part in 2018’s event, but the chase is said to attract at least 40 competitors a year.
Heavy rain over the past few days meant the hill was extremely wet on Bank Holiday Monday.
Anderson, who only likes cheddar cheese, skipped the second race but won again in the third despite tearing his left calf muscle in the process. He said afterwards: “The kid next to me was pulling my shirt all the way down.
“I’ve got nothing to prove now, I’m happy. There was a bit more pressure this year as there were a few more locals running and as we saw one of them was a bit dirty.” When asked about the secret to his success, he replied: “Just run and try and stay on your feet.”
Anderson will not be competing next year because he will be on holiday.
The chaser has put his body on the line on his long road to success, having suffered a broken ankle in 2005 and bruised kidneys in 2010.
He has dedicated his victories to his wife’s nephew Arthur Bace, who suffers from the rare genetic disorder Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia.
Nathan Anstey, 30, travelled all the way from Melbourne in Australia to take part in the event wearing just a pair of “budgie smugglers”.
He said: “Last year was the first time I did it and I knew I had to come back. It’s a no-brainer. It’s the most exhilarating thing you can do.”
Explaining his risque costume, Anstey said: “It’s an Australian thing, the budgie smugglers, and the crowd absolutely love it.”
The women’s race was won by Flo Early, 27, who picked up a Double Gloucester for the third time having won in 2008 and 2016.
Four cheeses weighing about 3kg each and three smaller ones, weighing about 1.5kg, are used. The unusual event has been celebrated for centuries and is thought to have its roots in a heathen festival to celebrate the return of spring.
