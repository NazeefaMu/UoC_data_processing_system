Fuel prices will be reviewed, reduction likely - FM

Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said fuel prices will be reviewed today. This is comparing with world market prices.
The minister hinted that fuel prices may come down further in comparison with the current world market prices.
The Minister soon after assuming duties yesterday said the special price formula for fuel prices on par with world market prices initiated during his tenure as finance minister earlier, will continue.
Minister Samaraweera said fuel prices have reduced in the world market and said the finance minister who replaced him after the political crisis two months back had taken advantage of it to reduce prices slightly.
He said the price formula was simplified with the aim of providing relief to the common masses and added it was a very fair method in comparison with the accepted international norms. Minister Samaraweera in reply to questions by journalists also said the Vote on Account for state expenditure in the first quarter would be submitted for parliamentary approval today. He said the budget for next year will be presented in January and promised wide reaching relief to the public.
