Attempt to stall probe on corruption against Govt.:Herath

Closure of Anti-Corruption Secretariat::
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday, expressing his displeasure over the closure of the Anti-Corruption Secretariat, said the move was an attempt to stall investigations into corruption charges against the Government.
The MP addressing a press conference yesterday, predicted the impending closure of the FCID as well.
“The Government said the expenditure of the Secretariat was over Rs 400 million. This was not true. Its total expenditure was Rs 32 million. However, through its investigations it helped the Government to earn more money than what it spent. The Government could find Rs 159 million by taking over the CSN as a result of the investigations carried out. The value of the Malwana land, which was taken over to the Government, is also over Rs 300 million,” he said.
“The closure of the Secretariat came at a time it was about to investigate on the corruption charges against the members of this Government. The next in the line would be the FCID,” he noted.
