Avant Garde Chairman, Major General Palitha Fernando notified to appear before High Court

 
The Colombo High Court issued summons on Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd Chairman Nissanka Senadhipathi and Maj. Gen. Palitha Fernando ordering them to appear in court on September 19 for allegedly offering and accepting a bribe of Rs.35.5 million following the Avant-Garde floating armoury transaction. 
The Director General of Bribery Commission filed indictments against the two accused on 47 counts under section 17, 19, 21 and 25 of the Bribery Commission Act.
 When the Magisterial inquiry into the matter came up before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the Court was informed that the High Court had issued summons on the two accused to appear in Court on September 19. 
The Chief Magistrate decided to lay by the Magisterial inquiry into the matter and advised the accused to appear in High Court on the next date.
This was the first time that both the bribe giver and the bribe taker were indicted in the High Court.
It was alleged that when Avant Garde took over the Navy's operation, the security firm offered a bribe of Rs 35.5 million to Maj. General Palitha Fernando, who headed the state-owned Rakna Lanka company and the latter invested the money in a private trust.
