Create a container vegetable garden

A container vegetable garden that gives you a bountiful harvest of fresh homegrown vegetables and herbs in limited space and also looks appealing and aesthetic!
1. Grow climbers and vines
Support climbing vegetables and vines and direct them upward with the help of a trellis or a cage or by any other way. Such plants use vertical space and are abundant in production. Bitter melon (a unique tropical gourd known for its health benefits), gourds, cucumber, pole beans and other beans, Malabar spinach, vine tomatoes, squashes, peas, if you want to try– pumpkin and melons.
2. Choose colorful containers
You can brighten up your container vegetable garden by choosing colorful containers to grow your favourite vegetable and herbs.
3. Use hanging baskets
Don’t cast out the idea of growing herbs and vegetables in hanging baskets. Tomatoes, strawberries, many other vegetables, and herbs can be grown in hanging baskets successfully. It also creates space!
4. Start one pot vegetable garden
This one pot vegetable garden idea is perfect if you don’t have space to set up a container garden. For those who have a small balcony or open window that receives full sun.
Growing a lemon tree in a pot is not difficult and probably an intelligent addition to your container vegetable garden.8. Give Space to Herbs Your container vegetable garden may look incomplete if you don’t grow some herbs. Fresh herbs can enhance the taste of your meal always, so it’s a great idea. You don’t need to grow all the herbs, consider adding 2-3 plants that you like most and suits your location. A window box, a few small containers, hanging baskets, etc. can be used. balconygardenweb
