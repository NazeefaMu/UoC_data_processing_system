SAITM issue: GMOA questions Minister’s silence on SLMC recommendations

The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) yesterday questioned as to why Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne was not making any statements about the recommendations forwarded by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) with regard to the standards of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Secretary Dr.Navin de Soyza said that Minister Senaratne should explain his stance on whether he is willing to accept the SLMC recommendations or not and questioned the Minister’s silence on the matter.
“Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and the secretary to the Higher Education Ministry are responsible for it.
They are taking a SAITM- biased stand and their irresponsible behavior will cause chaos with in the country,”the GMOA Secretary added.
He further said that medical students cannot be allowed to practice as doctors without SLMC approval.
Dr.Soyza pointed out that when President Maithripala Sirisena was the Health Minister, he accepted the Five member committee report that clearly stated that SAITM had failed to meet the expected standards. Now, the Health Minister who took measures to complete the unfinished initiatives of the former Minister (present President) had failed to follow his steps with regard to the SAITM issue.
He said they would strongly fight against this matter and added that awareness programmes and discussions would be held with political leaders, state university students, parents and several unions during this week.
Dr.Soyza further said that Minister Senaratne had been informed in writing about the GMOA’s stance regarding this matter.
When asked why the GMOA is not against John Kotelawela Medical College, Dr Soyza said the GMOA cannot oppose it as it has SLMC approval.
“If the Health Minister has got issues with regard to the standards of KDU Medical College,he can directly get involved in that matter and find the truth,” he said.
