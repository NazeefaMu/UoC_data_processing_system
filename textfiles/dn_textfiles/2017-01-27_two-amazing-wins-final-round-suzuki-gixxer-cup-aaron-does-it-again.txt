Two amazing wins at the final round of the Suzuki Gixxer Cup: Aaron does it again

An action-packed weekend for Aaron Gunawardena as he took on a few seasoned riders in the Suzuki Gixxer open event. Aaron who initially entered the Red Bull Road to Rookies Cup won the series and got himself upgraded to the over 24 year open event, he had 2 wins in Greater Noida 2 months ago as well as sealed the final round once again with two wins at the Madras International Circuit over the weekend.
MotoGP Rookies Cup has grown into one of the most electrifying 2 wheel spectacles in the world and it is great to see an Indian manufacturer coming forward to support young Talent. Speaking about the races and the talent, Suresh Babu, Head Marketing & Product Planning for Suzuki India said, “The sight of the race track was exhilarating, with an infectious atmosphere of zeal and a sheer passion for motorsport. The Red Bull Road to Rookies Cup was a unique initiative, to encourage and support young, budding racers. Suzuki is happy to associate with Red Bull to put India on the map for motorsports, which is a common goal we share.” We are glad that the 13 year old rider from Sri Lanka was among the team to set a benchmark for our road to rookies program, and we are also amazed with the outcome of Aaron’s talent and happy that most of the riders were able to clock faster timings than the last year.
