Kyrgios confident he’ll be fit for Davis Cup

Sydney, Tuesday: Australian number one Nick Kyrgios played down concerns over his hip injury on Tuesday and said he felt ready to play this week’s Davis Cup World Group play-off against Slovakia.
The injury forced Kyrgios, the world number 15, to quit the US Open third round in tears just a week ago. But he said in Sydney: “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t want to play.”
“I feel ready. I’m playing probably the best tennis I have,” added the 21-year-old. AFP
