Wimal on hunger strike in remand prison

National Freedom Front leader and MP, Wimal Weerawansa had commenced a hunger strike in prison, protesting against the rejection of his bail application, it is reported.
According to Prison Department sources Weerawansa started the hunger strike yesterday morning claiming that he had been kept in remand prison for 74 days without being released on bail. However, it has also been reported that several members of the Joint Opposition (JO) who visited Weerawansa yesterday have instructed Weerawansa to give up the hunger strike as the case is before courts.
They had prevailed upon Weerawansa to give up the hunger strike since it is inappropriate to launch a protest against a court decision.
According to Prisons Spokesperson Thushara Upuldeniya ,Weerawansa has been engaging in the protest fast refusing meals since last morning.
The MP , who is in remand prison, after being arrested on charges of misusing state vehicles, was further remanded till April 3, following the rejection of his bail application by the High Court.
He was arrested by the Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) on January 10 when he arrived to give a statement pertaining to allegations of misusing state vehicles.
A few years ago, he launched a hunger strike against Ban Ki-Moon, the then United Nations Human Rights Commission chief , opposite the UN compound in Colombo . However, he gave up that protest when he received a glass of king coconut water from former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
