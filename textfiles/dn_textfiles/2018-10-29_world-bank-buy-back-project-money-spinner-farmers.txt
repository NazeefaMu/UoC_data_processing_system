World Bank buy-back project, money spinner for farmers

Agriculture has always been a paradox in Sri Lanka. According to World Bank Statistics in 2016, 81.59 percent, the majority population, live in rural areas. But only 27 percent (2017), just over a quarter of the Sri Lankan population is engaged in agriculture and the sector only contributes 6.9 percent to the GDP of the country. If you live in a rural area, the potential of your engaging in some sort of agriculture is high, and yet, more and more are moving away from it. Why? The answer to this is simple: money.
According to the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project – a World Bank funded project under the Agriculture Ministry – an average farmer earns around Rs. 30,000 per month. The work a farmer puts into earning this paltry sum is back-breaking, the weather may be unkind, and the debts taken out for each season eat into any profit made.
Thus the five-year World Bank–funded project costing US$ 169.84 million working together with the Primary Industries Ministry and Agriculture Ministry (US$ 58.63 million) has sought to solve these issues by connecting farmers with technology and markets.
Project Director Thulani Weerakoon brought into the Agriculture Ministry to accelerate the programme which was signed in 2016 but lay dormant until last year has a Master’s in Project Management and a Bachelor’s in Economics. With no agriculture background, she has managed to stir the project into action. Her progress thus far has been captured in the success of their ‘pickled green cucumber’ pilot project launched in war-torn Vakarai in the Eastern Province.
Cucumbers to the rescue
“This was an area where they had not engaged in any agriculture for a long time. In addition, it is a water- scarce region and there wasn’t a reliable supply of electricity,” said Weerakoon.
In May of this year, the project signed an agreement with Hayleys PLC for 500 farmers (starting with 70) to grow green cucumbers under a buy-back system. A project office set up at the location ensured that the farmers chosen with the assistance of the area Agriculture Instructor, based on 20 criteria, were given all the necessary support to make it a success. This included a grant of Rs. 400,000 to each farmer which included a diesel water pump, post-harvest equipment such as crates and sprinkler facilities for an acre which could be expanded later. The water pumps were designed to be able to be used for four to five acres. Thus farmers who wanted to grow more than an acre were helped in securing a Bank of Ceylon loan to expand the sprinkler facilities to cover a larger area.
“This is given to them based on the money they earn through the project, so costs could be covered. We calculate the Return of Investment (ROI) based on the grant. Three to four years down the line, they have to replace the equipment and should have enough money on their own for that.”
In addition, the farmers were also given soft skills training such as entrepreneurial and farmer business school training and technical training and training in other capacity-building courses.
In a matter of two months, the harvests were in and Weerakoon reported that farmers earned between Rs. 250,000 – Rs. 300,000 in that one season. “You need two months to grow it and one month to harvest. So a farmer can grow three seasons in a year.”
With the buy-back programme in place, Hayleys purchased the cucumber at Rs. 27 per kilo and given that the cucumbers were being used for pickles, even damaged cucumbers were bought.
“Every project has to be connected with a buyer; that is how you get a guaranteed buyer. And in our agreements between the company and the farmer, we look at what the company gives and what the farmer gives. Here, the farmer contributes, seed, fertilizer, land and labour and the company provides a guaranteed price, on ground technical support.”
Hayleys, Weerakoon explained, also helped the farmer go through the banking system and take loans at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, so that they had the money to purchase the seeds and fertilizer sold by the company to the farmer.
The cucumber project which cost a total of Rs 200 million, has been worked out as a 60:40 percent partnership between the government and the farmer.
Hayleys which supplies the pickled cucumber to international food franchises has now decided to put up a warehouse in Vakarai to accommodate an expansion of the project after its initial success. The company is also planning to build a Rs. 400 million factory to process the cucumbers in Vakarai itself.
Building clusters
The World Bank in its overview of the project states that the main objective of it is to “support increasing agriculture productivity, improving market access and enhancing value addition of smallholder farmers and agribusinesses in the project areas.”
It proposes to achieve this through three main components: (1) Agriculture Value Chain Development (export-oriented agriculture and agri-businesses with financial support); (2) Productivity Enhancement and Diversification Demonstrations (modern agriculture technology parks and farmer training); and (3)
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (Primary Industries and Agriculture Ministries to coordinate activities, procurement and social and environmental safeguards)
In keeping with the above requirements, the project was designed to form two or three clusters of high value fruits and vegetables in the districts of Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Moneragala, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Matale. European Union funding slated for next year is expected to expand the project to Badulla, Ampara, Killinochchi and Vavuniya.
“Clusters have to be at a certain location so that we can also provide all the other services. The warehouse, laboratory – we want to provide all the necessary things for the crop to succeed.”
Overall, it aims to benefit 14,000 farmers directly and 30,000 farmers indirectly and at present 20 pilot projects similar to that in Vakarai are running with around 100–200 farmers in each. In Jaffna, Matale and Moneragala ‘mango clusters’ have been initiated, whilst Moneragala has also been given a ‘pineapple cluster’. Mullaitivu has a cluster of cashew, Anuradhapura – bitter gourd and Polonnaruwa – mushrooms, among many others.
Weerakoon explained that they chose projects based on their suitability for each district and more importantly, whether they would be able to churn out a net profit of at least Rs. 60,000 (double the average) per month. “The project is about the market. We look at the market and if we have a market, we fund the project. That is how we have designed the pilot projects.”
Value addition and markets
One of the most significant aspects of the project has been the emphasis on ‘value addition’ and matching the product to a ‘long-term buyer’ with international linkages for export.
When it came to cucumber, Weerakoon’s team had insisted that the farmers not just grow cucumbers but grow it for a specific purpose. Similarly, they have been asked by Ceylon Biscuits Limited whether a project could grow organic papaya. “We know that they are established and need this for one of their products. So to grow produce for a readymade product is easier. We ask the private sector what they need, and work backwards, and see if the farmer can get at least Rs. 60,000.”
Pricing backwards, Weerakoon said, is the safest way and it ensured the farmers a long-term market. Though there have been questions about the fixed prices determined by the buy-back agreements with the companies, Weerakoon said this was more stable for a farmer, rather than depending on a constantly fluctuating open market.
From the mango to cucumber, each project has had to be customised to suit local needs
Working out the details
At present, however, the projects are in their pilot phase and to formally launch it, Weerakoon and her team have to first procure an international consultant to design the clusters.
“The agreement with the World Bank states that we need to get an international consultant to design clusters. We are still in the process of procuring a consultant, and because of the delay, we started pilot projects. We plan to have the consultant by the end of November. He is coming to develop, design and implement the whole project.”
When asked why a foreign consultant was specified, she explained that the consultant would help in securing new technology from overseas for the project and bring in a new look to the agricultural system as stated in the agreement.
In the meantime, Weerakoon has had to be resourceful to get the government machinery moving at a faster pace than usual. Having hired the former Director General of the Agriculture Department, Dr Rohan Wijekoon, she had been successful building an active relationship within the various departments in the Ministry and Department.
“I have also hired many personnel from the Finance Ministry to help me out with the procurements. At present, we have 180 procurement activities worth Rs. 2,500 million, as each pilot project is unique and complex; a normal road project will just have 10 procurements.”
They have also asked the Agriculture Insurance Board to provide their farmers with a crop insurance scheme where the farmer also contributes to it. “Agri-businesses are very risky so insurance comes up at a premium and no insurance company wants to touch it.”
Funds from the project have also been used to conduct research studies on ‘value addition’ for vegetables and fruits for studies on how to improve yields of native fruits and vegetables.
The project, in addition, also insists that all pilot projects employ 40 percent women and attract more youth into farming, “We hope that the introduction of technology which would cut down on heavy labour would attract more youth.”
For example, the project provided small thrashers to groundnut farmers which cut down production costs in half. In Jaffna, the mango farmers were given pruning kits and trained pruners to save labour costs. In both these cases, costs were also brought down by having machinery shared within farmer organizations.
“We buy one tractor which is given to a cluster and the farmer pays for the number of hours the tractor was used. When it comes to the mango trees, we give the pruning kit to the farmer organisation, we train the pruner, and the pruners go from field to field and get a sum for doing it. Not all trees pruned at the same time, so two or three kits should be enough.”
Despite these successes however, Weerakoon is aware that they would have to continuously innovate and adapt to keep the momentum going.
In the next three to four years, cucumbers in Vakarai will not as successful as soil conditions change, she observed, and thus the team is already studying the option of replacing it with Jalapeno chilli.
““This is agriculture. Nothing is static so we too have to adapt,” she said.
