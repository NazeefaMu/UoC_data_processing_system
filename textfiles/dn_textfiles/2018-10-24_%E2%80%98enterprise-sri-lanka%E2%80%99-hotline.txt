‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’ hotline

The Finance Ministry yesterday, launched the hotline ‘1925’ to handle complaints and inquiries into ‘Enterprise Sri Lanka’.
Enterprise Sri Lanka which offers concessionary and at times collateral free loans, has thus far granted 29,389 loans worth Rs 58,817.5 million to beneficiaries around the island, said Finance and Mass Media, Minister Mangala Samaraweera addressing a media briefing yesterday. The Minister explained that the schemes of ‘Haritha Naya’, ‘Diriya Saviya’, ‘Sonduru Piyasa’, ‘Govi Navodya’, ‘Madya Aruna’ and the ‘Homestay loan’ were some of the popular options among beneficiaries who approach the State Banks such as ; Regional Development Bank, Bank of Ceylon and the People’s Bank.
“From the time of the launch, in general applicants were welcomed to the banks but certain banks we hear are treating them badly and discouraging people from taking loans. They have chased away applicants, scolded the government or placed unnecessary conditions before them”.
Those who face issues with accessing loans specified in Enterprise Sri Lanka thus have been asked to contact the hotline through any phone line, where they would be directed to a Dialog call center.
Complaints would be recorded and emailed to the Finance Ministry where feedback will be given. The Finance Minister however observed that loan applications from the North and East were low and he hoped that in future it would approve. Given the major issues faced in the regions with regard to micro financing, the Government, he said has also taken steps to write off and pay loans of 45, 139 borrowers in the North, amounting to over Rs 141 million in interest rates and Rs 1.23 billion in capital.
