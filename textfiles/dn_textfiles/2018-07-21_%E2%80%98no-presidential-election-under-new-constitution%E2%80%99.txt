‘No Presidential Election under new Constitution’

Once the new constitution comes, there will not be a Presidential Election. Therefore, the Joint Opposition is trying its best to make Parliament disabled and make way for a Presidential Election, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP) Leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the party office in Colombo yesterday. He said that it is the sole responsibility of the Prime Minister to get hold of his MPst and protect Parliament. “Well organised problems erupted in the country from time to time to make it unstable. Recent issues in the Railway Service is one. This Government should protect Parliament,” Dr. Karunaratne said. He said Sri Lanka would lost GSP Plus facility if the death penalty was reintroduced. “Before introducing the death penalty, the Government should punish the prison officials who looked after drug kingpins, who communicated with outside to carry out their `businesses’. The first task should be to find out how prisoners communicated with outside people while in prison,” he said.
Dr. Karunaratne said the Government taking action against persons who insulted Human Rights Commission Chairperson Dr. Deepika Udagama is admirable and the persons who insulted her, acted like stray dogs.
“Their threatening proved that armed forces committed grave crimes during the war. Their actions during the war should be investigated and punished if they had committed crimes during the war,” he said.
