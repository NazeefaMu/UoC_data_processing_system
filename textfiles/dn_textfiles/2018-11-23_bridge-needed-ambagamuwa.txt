Bridge needed  in Ambagamuwa

The absence of a bridge over the Kelani river on the Yatiberiya - Thebuwa road in the Ambagamuwa, Nuwara-Eliya, has inconvenienced the residents of Thebuwa and Yatiberiya.
Hence, villagers have been compelled to cross the river using an outrigger canoe. They said that the river often overflowed during rainy seasons, and added that they had to risk their lives every time they crossed it.
They urged authorities to take swift action and construct a suspension bridge over the river.
