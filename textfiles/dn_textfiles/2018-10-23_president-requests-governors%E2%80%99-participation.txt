Release of lands acquired by military during war
President requests governors’ participation

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested governors to participate in the programme to release lands in the Northern and Eastern provinces which were acquired by security forces during the conflict, to its original owners.
He was speaking at a meeting held to review the progress of provincial council procedures, yesterday.
Governors, Chief Ministers, Provincial Secretaries and other officials were present at the event.
Monetary issues, the progress of physical assets, vacancies and other issues were discussed at the meeting.
President Sirisena also instructed chief ministers to contribute to the projects aimed at eradicating poverty.
“Everyone should contribute to accomplish the objectives of the Gramashakthi People’s Movement, which is a project to eradicate poverty,” the President said.
Another topic discussed was the issues of plantation workers. Minister Palani Digambaran expressed his appreciation for ensuring the ownership of lands for estate workers after presenting them land deeds for the first time.
He said that those achievements were due to President Sirisena’s intervention.
