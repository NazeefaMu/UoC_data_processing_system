We cannot challenge court verdict - Deputy Minister

As Buddhists, we feel sorry about the imprisonment of Bodu Bala Sena General Secretary Ven.Galagodatte Gnasara Thera, but we cannot challenge the court verdict, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, the Deputy Minister said that the verdict has been given considering only the legal facts and not about the individual since the Goddess of Justice is blind.
He further said that the Goddess of Justice with her blindfold symbolizes equal justice under the law.
Ven. Gnanasara TherA can submit an appeal which he has already done,” the Deputy Minister said.
“As a government which has ensured the independence of the judiciary, we will never interfere with any court case. Everybody must be treated equally under the law regardless of religion, political affiliation, ethnicity or other characteristics, without privilege, discrimination or bias,” he added.
Responding to a question by a journalist who inquired about the removal of yellow robes of Ven. Ganasara Thera without any Vinaya Karma, Deputy Minister Bandara said that he is not aware about the prison traditions and Vinaya Karma.
Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said that only the person has been imprisoned and not the yellow robes, which is considered most sacred by Buddhists.
