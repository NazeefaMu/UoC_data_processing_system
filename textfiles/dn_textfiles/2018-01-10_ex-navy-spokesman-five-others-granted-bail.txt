EX Navy Spokesman, five others granted bail

Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others who were held in remand custody for over six months were granted bail under strict conditions by the Colombo High Court yesterday.
They were remanded on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were yesterday ordered to be released.
Each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with three sureties of Rs 1 million. They were severely warned not to interfere with witnesses in the case and further ordered to appear before the CID every Saturday.
Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order after taking into consideration a revision application filed by the suspects challenging the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s decision to reject bail on the suspects on several occasions.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing for the CID raised objections to release D.K.P. Dassanayake and three others on bail citing that CID investigative officers had received death threats.
President’s Counsel Anil de Silva appearing for the suspects informed court that the prosecution was making baseless allegations without evidence. The Magistrate’s Court had earlier refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident. The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.
