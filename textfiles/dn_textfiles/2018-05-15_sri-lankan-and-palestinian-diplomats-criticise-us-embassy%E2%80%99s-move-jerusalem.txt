Sri Lankan and Palestinian diplomats criticise US embassy’s move to Jerusalem

As the United States moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem yesterday, high-level diplomats in Sri Lanka spoke out condemning the decision.
“The new Nakba that we have today is the shifting of the American embassy to our capital, Jerusalem,” said Zuhair Mohammad Hamdallah Zaid, the Ambassador of the State of Palestine to Sri Lanka.
The Americans’ move coincided with the 70th anniversary of Israel declaring independence, which Palestinians regard as Nakba Day, or the “Day of Catastrophe.”
Thousands of Palestinians protested at the border to oppose the embassy change on Monday, and by Monday evening news outlets were reporting that Israeli forces had killed over 40 people with live ammunition.
“So what is this democracy (the Israelis) practice?,” Ambassador Zaid said, speaking at a press conference at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.
“Palestinians … should have the freedom to live independently, in dignity and freedom, and (have) the right of return of refugees to their homeland from which they were ethnically cleansed,” he said.
Foreign Affairs State Minister Vasantha Senanayake said Sri Lanka would always stand in solidarity with Palestine. “In 1948, “nobody took too much time in recognizing Israel as an independent state,” he said. “It is quite ironic that the people who were there before that are still not recognised by some countries as a sovereign state.”
“Sri Lanka’s point of view has always been that Palestine must be recognised as a sovereign country by the whole world,” he added.
Citing the fact that Palestine’s claim to East Jerusalem as a capital has for years been condition in peace talks, State Minister Senanayake said the Americas decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital would only cause more strife.
He said that the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem, “an area that Sri Lanka has always maintained should belong to the cultural heritage of both Palestine and Israel” was “insensitive, boorish, and arrogant.”
