EVOLUTIONARY  DINING  EXPERIENCE

COLOMBO SUPPER CLUB AND JETWING BEACH HOSTS NAKED FINN 
Featturing yet another fusion dining experience, this time around the Colombo Supper Club together with Jetwing Beach, Sri Lankan Airlines and Wine World will be hosting Ken Loon from the Naked Finn, Singapore. The event will take place on September 15, 2017 at Jetwing Beach’s fine dining restaurant, Black Coral from 7.30 pm.
Ken Loon believes in “less is more” and this is portrayed through each and every dish he puts out to the table. The magic is in the fresh produce and letting it work its way through mixing ingredients and so came to being his love and obsession with prawns and lobsters. Naked Finn was born in November 2012 inspired by Loon’s philosophy of unadulterated simplicity when cooking. Over the years, Naked Finn has established direct business relations with fisheries in Alaska, Hokkaido, Sri Lanka, Europe and Australia. To date, they have experimented with more than 182 species, and developed an in-depth understanding of how every part of a species can be used to complement itself or another, in place of sauces and have termed in “species flavouring”.
This nine course dinner menu has been divided into three distinct styles/periods based on their lunch, dinner and the one-off Hokkaido experiment they did in December 2016. It has been designed in the hopes of offering a clearer picture of their culinary evolution, very much like an artist’s retrospective exhibition. This wonderful experience is met at Jetwing Beach’s Black Coral, offering an unmatched fine dining experience in Negombo. With an exceptional selection of wine from Wine World, the restaurant allows guests to taste the exceptional cuisine in a unique ambience.
Colombo Supper Club is a venture founded by former lawyer, travel enthusiast and passionate foodie Naserah Tyebally, a Singaporean who now calls Sri Lanka home.

The supper club has met an enthusiastic response and Naserah is eager to test new waters by constantly bringing innovative elements to the supper club to leave divers wondering “what next”.
