Students protest decision barring them from exams

The Engineering Faculty of the Peradeniya University was closed indefinitely from 6 am on July 17.
All engineering students were ordered to leave campus premises by 2 pm yesterday.
The university administration has decided to prevent three percent of the students from sitting examinations this year for failure to attend 80 percent of lectures. Members of the Peradeniya university students union have launched a protest against this since July 6 by entering the senate building. The Vice Chancellor and other university officials faced difficulties in trying to enter the senate building which is the administration block. As a result, they have been staying out of the administration building after reporting for duty since July 12. Vice Chancellor Prof. Upul Dissanayake said attending 80 percent of lectures was a pre-requisite for engineering students to quality to sit the examinations. However, three percent of the students had failed to satisfy this condition.
Students Union President Mahil Bandara said they launched the protest against 'the student oppression by the university administration' based on the condition of attending 80 percent of lectures. They also decried the arbitrary action taken by the administration to set up CCTV cameras in the campus as it would be an obstruction to their freedom. The 11-member university senate appointed by the Higher Education Ministry comprises Vice Chancellor Prof Upul Dissanayake and Dean of the Engineering Faculty Prof Leelananda Rajapaksa among others.
