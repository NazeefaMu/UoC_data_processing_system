Transcendence
Depp lacks depth

Director Wally Pfister’s sci-fi thriller ‘Transcendence’ plays with a lot of smart ideas. It ponders over what the future might hold in the advanced technology scenario. The results could be both fascinating as well as terrifying.
Johnny Depp plays the role of the protagonist, Dr Will Caster. Unlike other scientists, Caster believes that human consciousness is a code that can be cracked. He has spent his life chasing the idea of creating fully functioning artificial intelligence. Supporting him in his quest is his partner in science and life, Evelyn.
The story takes a tragic turn when an anti-technology activist group guns down Caster. Just when there is no hope of getting Caster back in the picture Evelyn is struck by a brainwave. She uploads Caster’s mind into their work.
Caster now hold incredible powers . There are plenty of resources at his disposal. He aims to help mankind but soon ends up scaring all those around him.
This is not light stuff but beckons some heavy thinking. Unfortunately it is such a bore as well. It makes a decent movie but it could have been much more had the script writing task fallen into the right hands.
‘Transcendence’ comprises an A-list cast. It is a pity that such a seasoned cast and a talented filmmaker had gone to waste because of the script. Depp has a special challenge playing Dr Caster as a person as well as an image on the computer screen. However he cannot do much with what the script requires him to do. Humour is his main strength and he is not given any space to put it to good use. Rebecca Hall tries her best to add depth to Evelyn’s character. The rest of the cast too do their bit in trying to make an interesting story.

Johnny Depp as Dr Will Caster
Though big ideas are present, the movie fails when they are stringed together to make a compelling story.
The plot and structure also creates character issues. We hardly get to know the personality of the characters or relate to them. Screen writer Jack Paglen does not seem to know where to go with the storyline.
Though he has the avenues to an extraordinary story at hand Paglen chooses to focus on the relationship between Caster and his wife.
The idea behind this is to play upon the sympathy of the audience but that too fails when we realize that Evelyn is partly to blame for the turn of events.
Adding insult to injury the story takes an unexpected turn with Caster using nanotechnology to create his own army of workers who he has healed one way or the other. This adds to the silliness and baffles the audience.
Once Caster’s mind is uploaded into the computer the story takes a monotonous turn.
The scenes are limited to back and forth shots of Caster’s advanced lab, the RIFT headquarters and the FBI officers.
There is definitely room for improvement.
Backed by Depp’s star power, the film may aim high but misses its target.
