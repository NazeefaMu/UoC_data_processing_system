Moves to educate children not attending school

The Education Ministry has planned to implement a programme to educate children in the school-going age who are not schooling due to economic difficulties.
Under this programme, the students will be assisted by the Education Ministry to recommence their schooling.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said this programme will be implemented with the next Budget proposal aiming to carry it out from next year.
