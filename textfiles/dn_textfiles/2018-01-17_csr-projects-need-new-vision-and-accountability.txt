CSR Projects need new vision and accountability

During seasonal times the corporate sector embark on specific corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects in keeping with their annual budgets and corporate vision. The corporate set aside specific sums based on their budgeted profitability and social commitments.
CSR budgets also depend on type of products and services marketed, specific requests by governmental authorities, environmental hazards, natural disasters, public needs and many other factors. Normally, the corporates which deal in consumer goods and services spend larger sums on CSR projects to assist their marketing drives and boost profitability. Some corporates confine their CSR activities to a specific area or a district based on prevailing conditions. On a smaller scale, some others assist charitable organizations.
On a broader sense the CSR activities should include and inherit the following features amongst others and focus mainly on.
Usefulness and benefits to a vast majority of the general public
Assistance to the good governance measures of the state
Projects should be regular with meaningful appraisal and value addition
Achieving value for money spent
Fostering “environmental and green effects”
Creation of new employment avenues at least for a few
Assistance to local authorities in serving public utility programmes
Reduction of crime rates, fatalities and indisciplinary behaviour of public
Assistance to other corporates and reap benefits of synergy for similar projects
Beefing of law enforcement authorities in the country
Ensuring social and religious harmony
Enhancing of language skills of the general public
Provision of career guidance to school leavers especially in rural areas
Production of short Documentaries on drugs, narcotics, alcohol usage and smoking.
Tourism assistance and promotional measures
Agricultural output enhancement
Fortifying of marketing centres for agricultural produce for price stability and lower cost of living
Assistance to local authorities in garbage collection and disposal
Conducting of regular community development programmes at village level
Holding regular seminars and workshops on above measures among the members of the corporate, community, lions, rotarians and other service organizations.
Unless and until we educate the youth especially in rural areas in our development drives in a meaningful way the crime rates and social unrest will continue to thrive. Our politicians are not engaging in any meaningful programmes to remedy the situation as they are stuffed with various elections from time to time. Every party is interested only in defeating the other parties and come to power and they are least bothered in achieving the priority goals in the development of the country. Therefore, the corporate sector should push for reforms for a civilized, law abiding. Hard working and a punctual population at all age groups. It is the corporate sector that would suffer ultimately by way of enhanced taxes. With effect from April 2018, the government has introduced various measures to augment the proportion of direct taxation collection in comparison to the indirect taxes.
It is highly praiseworthy that a large number of quoted and unquoted companies carry out their annual CSR activities and depict same in their annual reports. If liquidity of these companies fall due to future higher taxes, they may well find it difficult to continue with the ongoing CSR activities. The richest conglomerates have started their own foundations to serve the masses in diverse projects throughout the world in a very methodical and in a well structured manner. Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is an iconic example. In Sri Lanka John Keells Foundation and Foundation of Goodness have shown continuity in their activities with set objectives. Ruling governments are unable to address human resource development programmes in a structured manner due to shortage of expertise and committed staff. The void has to be filled by the local private sector. If not for the large number of employment avenues created by the private sector in this country, economic growth of this country may have even reached negative levels causing the economy to collapse long ago.
Regional development of this country has taken a back seat due to the very limited participation of our Private Sector. Main reason for this is the dominance of politicians both at the main stream and at district and village level. They demand protection money, kickbacks, jobs to their supporters from the investors both local as well as foreign. Some even demand percentages of profits achieved. Due to this both local and foreign investors are reluctant to set up ventures, especially in the manufacturing sector as they run the risk of being harassed by the area politicians. The local corporate sector should seek the assistance and continued support in eradicating this menace, from the state and the law enforcement authorities in creating an environment conducive to private sector investments. In the alternative unruly and corrupt politicians will take over the country. It is high time that we appoint a minister for private sector development from the private sector itself, preferably a strong Administrator and Director of the Corporate Sector. Take the unwanted situation that will arise after the proposed local government elections. The existing 4,000 plus members will double to over 8,000. Who will pay for their salaries, perks, luxury vehicles and security. It is the taxes to be collected from the private sector, private individuals and the indirect taxes to be paid by the general public. Will the tax payers get benefitted? A big no. So why did they create this situation?
Now we come to the specific meaningful development of CSR initiatives. I wish to present the following methodology for the success of meaningful CSR projects to be initiated by the corporate sector.
Our neighbour India has formulated laws where the corporate sector is mandatorily required to spend 2% of PAT (profit after tax) annually on CSR projects. This was brought in by the companies act of 2013. However, amounts spent on CSR activities have declined due to the lower profits achieved, due to contraction of world economy. The TATA Group, Mahindra & Mahindra, Coca Cola and a few others have been engaging in continuous CSR activities on a larger scale during the past few years. TATA group has a number of companies and the TATA Steel alone spent over Rs.171 crore in financial year 2014/15, which is approximately 2% of average net profit for the last three financial years. Key CSR areas were education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, ethnic harmony, sports promotion.
The proposed methodology for Sri Lanka for value added CSR projects for rapid economic growth is enumerated below:
2% of PAT - contribution from the corporate
Amount equivalent to the contribution of the corporate to be put in by the state
Amount equivalent to the contribution of the corporate to be put in by an international donor agency on a grant basis
All three parties are equal stakeholders. The benefits of this scheme will be:
Formation of a large capital base for the project
Good Governance measures
Undertaking of worthwhile projects benefitting a large number
Creation of direct and indirect employment
Accurate information sourcing
Preparation of accurate and timely accounts
Rapid rural poverty alleviation
Improvement of literacy rates in rural areas
Higher contributions from rural areas and provinces for the national GDP levels
Reduction in rural crime rates
Each project will be jointly managed by the corporate, international donor and the Minister for Private Ssector development.
The state can well afford to cut down on funds allocated to provincial councils and local government authorities as bulk of the funds to be spent by them will be spent for unproductive purposes by the nearly 500 Provincial Councilors plus the 8,000 plus Local Government members.
I also propose the selection of only 50 corporate sector companies for the first year based on highest profitability achieved for the financial year ending March 31, 2017 or ended on December 31 2016, as the case may be. Success measurement could be jointly carried out by all three parties during and after the project.
We should now look at the mega type of a CSR activity which will benefit the country and the masses at large. As we all know Sri Lanka had been at the receiving end of a number of natural disasters and “Acts of God” in the past. Some of them are:
The Tsunami in 1994
2016 floods including a vast area of Colombo
2016 ‘Salawa’ blast
2017 floods
Droughts from time to time
Orugodawatta garbage dump collapse
The relief measures provided and compensation provided were late and not adequate according to the victims. They talk to the media to draw attention to their plight and sufferings.
The general public is of the view that a new relief agency be created by the state in collaboration with the private sector and through funds generated from the international donors. This agency should invest their funds in safer investments to earn returns for the agency. In a number of years the relief agency will grow up to be a substantial wealth accumulator and will be able to deal with any type of situation in future. All international aid in monetary and non monetary terms should be channeled through this agency with a monthly internal audit carried out by an international firm of auditors based in Sri Lanka and a report be produced for insertion in the agency website. The number of staff and emoluments be minimized so that a greater part of funds be spent in the provision of aid and relief. The agency can employ a substantial number of volunteers for relief assistance and damage assessment on a daily paid basis. This agency can recommend preventive measures and projects to the government so that these measures and projects be completed early. By this way the disasters will be reduced and will result in lower casualities, business losses and the costs to be incurred. This agency will have credibility in the eyes of international donors and relief providers and the general public as well. An annual report containing the audited accounts and the details of projects attended to and the beneficiaries. Both Electronic and Print Media will also highlight the success of the projects undertaken and relief provided. The board of governors need be appointed by the three promoters, namely, the Private Sector, State and the International donors. This will be an ideal type of a mega CSR initiative which would serve the masses for a very long period of time and will fill in the role of a disaster relief bank.
Another important aspect of disaster management is to create the awareness on the part of the masses and the preparedness. A good example of this is the state backed Tsunami alert programme which is held from time to time. However, a smaller number of public engage in environmental pollution and environmental damage knowingly and unknowingly, triggering many natural disasters. At times the Police are unable to stop this due to political interferences.
CSR activities
CSR activities for corporate and others could arise from their immediate surroundings. A vastly neglected aspect is the Traffic Mmanagement and the safety measures in force for the public by the state. A good example is the non functioning of traffic signal lights at crucial points of the city. A good prevailing example is the non functioning of Traffic Signal Lights from Galle Face Hotel junction upto the Crescat Boulevard. There are three Pedestrian Crossings with Traffic Signal Lights covering the above two points. The Galle Face Hotel Junction Traffic Signal Lights are out of action for a considerable period of time. The other two are not functioning from time to time. The pedestrians who want to cross to the other side of the road are at the mercy of the speeding motorists. There are times that all three Traffic Lights are not functioning. The users are the school children at St. Thomas’ Prep, hotel guests, office and bank staff, visitors to the Diplomatic Missions, visitors to Galle Face Green and bus passengers. There are many hotels, banks, restaurants, apartments, offices in the immeadiate vicinity. On rainy days, peak hours and especially in the night the crossing are not at all safe. The corporates, hotels and the banks in the area can easily put an end to this by effective co-ordination with the relevant authorities to ensure all three Traffic Signal Lights are working at all times. They can appoint a joint committee to monitor the task. This will give rise to a new concept on CSR initiatives by the launch of “CSR At Your Doorstep’ . This type of initiatives will draw immediate public appreciation and applause. This will be a very fruitful exercise at a very minimal cost benefitting a large number of citizens on a daily basis. Similarly, the monitoring of Traffic Signal Lights at other points of the Colombo City and in the towns of Western Province is also a very worthwhile CSR Project benefitting the masses and will reduce the accidents at road crossings to a very minimal level. The costs involved are minimal, perhaps a few telephone calls to the authorities a month, a few hoardings and time recovery costs for supervision. What is required is the commitment to make the project successful on a continuous basis. We Sri Lankans have the habit of starting projects with controls and loosening the grip on controls after some time. An awareness campaign for all motorists especially the state run and private buses coming to the city and leaving on a daily basis be also initiated through Media and service organizations like lions, rotarians and others to draw more participants to the success of this scheme.
With more and more vehicles coming to the streets of Colombo this project will ensure public safety and may well result in an increase in National Productivity Levels by getting down to the bottom of the problems faced by motorists, pedestrians, school children, office staff and visitors to Colombo on a daily basis.
The State and the Private Sector should form a “Public Private Partnership” in carrying out the CSR activities in a more development oriented manner with the aim of poverty alleviation and upliftment of the living standards of the public. Our Private Sector should take a leaf out of the CSR initiatives of our neighbour India in formulating new strategies for carrying out CSR activities from the year 2018 onwards. The Private Sector is more capable of designing large scale CSR projects and accomplishment of tasks with rigid supervision. The hard earned profits of the corporate sector should be ventured into long lasting and meaningful projects so that no funds will be spent on the same project later for rectifications and damages or defective work.
The beneficiaries should always endeavour to maintain and safeguard the quality of all CSR projects carried out by the corporate sector as funds are scarce for any repeat work or maintenance. The beneficiaries should form vigilant committees in supervising the successful functioning of the project. They should also carry out ‘Shramadana’ Campaigns to add value to already completed CSR Projects of the Corporate Sector, so that the same corporate entity will channel more funds for new projects in the same area in an appreciative manner. This is a “Win Win” situation for both parties. The government is needed to provide more incentives and inducements for the corporate sector to carry out more CSR Projects.
