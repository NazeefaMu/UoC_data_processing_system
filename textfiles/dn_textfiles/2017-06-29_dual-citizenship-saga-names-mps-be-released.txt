Dual Citizenship Saga: Names of MPs to be released

The Department of Immigration and Emigration has informed People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) that they would be able to provide the names of Members of Parliament who are holders of dual citizenship and the relevant details of such citizenships within next two three weeks, Executive Director of PAFFREL Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
Addressing the media today at the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), PAFFREL Executive Director said that the PAFFREL asked the Department of Immigration and Emigration to provide the names of Members of Parliament who are holding dual citizenship.
This request was made under Section 12 of the Right to Information Bill.
The Court Verdict and order regarding the female MP should apply to all other parliamentarians too, he said.
He paid his gratitude to the Immigration and Emigration Department for their positive response to the issue.
