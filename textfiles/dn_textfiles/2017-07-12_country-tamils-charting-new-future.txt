Up-country Tamils: Charting a new future

The conference will bring together scholars of Up-country Tamils in Sri Lanka, including historians, economists, sociologists, anthropologists, political scientists and social activists to examine this community from multiple disciplinary perspectives.
Up-country Tamils have always held a precarious position in Sri Lankan society, politics and economics, and this conference will examine the vicissitudes of their status in relation to other ethnic communities on the island and to India. Featuring Daniel Bass, Kumari Jayawardena, P Sahadevan, Muthulingam Periyasamy, Kalaimagal Thangavelu, A. S. Chandrabose, Tudor Silva and others, the dialogue will use Up-country Tamils as a locus for wider discussion of what it means to be a Sri Lankan citizen today. Simultaneous interpretation into English andTamil has been organised to facilitate discussion.
The conference will be held at the ICES Auditorium, 2 Kynsey Terrace, Colombo 8, on August 2 and 3 at 9.30 am and 5.30 pm.
