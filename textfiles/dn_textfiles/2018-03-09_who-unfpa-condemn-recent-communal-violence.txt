WHO, UNFPA condemn recent communal violence

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) jointly echoed the statement issued by the United Nations in Sri Lanka earlier, regarding the recent incidents of communal violence, by jointly condemning these actions in the strongest possible terms.
According to the statement, particularly in relation to the Ampara incident, which stemmed from inaccurate information relating to reproductive health, the joint statement by the WHO and UNFPA was released to clarify misconceptions.
The UN Resident Coordinator and WHO Representative in Sri Lanka Dr. Razia Pendse said: “There is no medication or ‘pills’ currently known or available that can permanently make a human being sterile. The information on the use of an ‘infertility pill’ or ‘sterilization pill’ mixed with food is baseless with no scientific evidence,” the statement said.
In the same statement, UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka, Ritsu Nacken, stated that “the need to ensure increased access to accurate reproductive health information, especially among youth, is so apparent. Wrong information on reproductive health is being used to ignite hatred and create tensions between ethnic communities. This should not and cannot happen.”
Together with the United Nations, the WHO and UNFPA urge authorities and all citizens to ensure that action is taken to counter misinformation and to ensure that the rule of law is upheld, human rights are protected, and security is ensured for all, the statement said.
