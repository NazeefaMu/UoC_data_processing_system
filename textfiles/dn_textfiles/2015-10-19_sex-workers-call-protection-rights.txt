Sex workers call for protection of rights

Prostitution should be legalized, said National Organizer, Centre for Sex Workers' Rights, Attorney at Law Senaka Perera.
He said there is no one to speak on behalf of sex workers.
"Their rights should be protected," Perera said.
He was speaking at a press conference held at Colombo yesterday.
"Legislation should be introduced for the protection of sex workers. They do not choose to become sex workers. It is the situation that compels them to take to this profession," he said.
"We do not promote prostitution, but, we support the rights of sex workers. Police should behave in a more responsible manner when handling cases with regard to sex workers," Perera said.
"Sex workers are arrested under the Vagrant's Ordinance of 1841 and Brothels Ordinance of 1889.
These laws should be abolished and new laws introduced to safeguard their rights.
The Vagrant's Ordinance was introduced to control the Indian labourers and alleged that the Police treat sex workers in a rude manner under that Ordinance," he added.
He further said that the perception of society towards sex workers has to be changed. If this situation continues, even their children will not have a secure future.
"There are around 600 members in our centre. It is for the first time in Sri Lanka that a centre has been formed for the betterment of sex workers," Attorney at Law Perera added.
"The Police, people and society look down upon them as they do not have any provisions in law to safeguard them, said Attorney at Law Thushara Daskon.
Chairman of the Centre for Sex Workers Rights B. Maheshwari said the male population and society in general are the prime reasons for women to become sex workers.
She said that women choose this as profession as they do not have any alternative solution and only when women are trapped financially in the hands of men.
"The government needs to look into the problems faced by the sex workers. The media and the police reveal the identity of the women who are alleged to be involved in prostitution unaware of the consequences on the women and their children.
She also quoted the Police Media Spokesman as having said that there are over 6,000 people involved in prostitution.
Sakuni, a transgender said the government should make arrangements to provide identity cards for transgenders. "I have faced several issues as I do not have a proper Identity Card. Not only me, there are several people who fear to reveal their names," said Sakuni.
"The government has granted us voting rights, but, they do not take any measures to provide identity cards," said Sakuni. It was also claimed that provisions should be made insisting that Women Police Constables be present when women involved in prostitution are arrested. Nava Lanka Samasamaja Party General Secretary Dr. Vickramabahu Karunaratne said the sufferings of sex workers should be redressed through law.
"The people who are against this process are the ones who promote this trade illegally. They lack virtue,"he said. Vickramabahu further said that young girls and women are raped and murdered today as sex workers are not legally accepted in society.
Attorney at Law Lakshan Dias and several other members attached to the centre were also present.
