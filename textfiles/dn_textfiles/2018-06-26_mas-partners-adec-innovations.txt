As part of its zero toxic commitments, MAS needed a process and reporting system that provides inventory registration and management, usage tracking and dashboard views for each of their facilities spread across the globe. After reviewing a number of different solutions, MAS selected CleanChainas it offered a number of unique features not offered by other software companies while allowing them to create solutions beyond the potential of their manual approach.
MAS,in collaboration with ADEC Innovations, has implemented CleanChain with an aim to fulfil their specific reporting needs. MAS has since facilitated the adoption of CleanChain at 20 chemical intensive manufacturing facilities including Australia, Bangladesh, China, Germany, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Jordan, Mexico, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam.
“We needed to more proactively and systematically manage the vast amounts of chemical information across our global operations,”Sharika Senanayake, Director Environmental Sustainability, MAS Holdings, said. “Since implementing CleanChain and collaborating with the ADEC Innovations team, we have transformed our inefficient and labour-intensive processes into a comprehensive system that helps us better understand and reduce risks, as well as reduce our manual burden and the associated costs of aggregating supply chain data,” he added.
MAS attributes significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of chemical management across their supply chain to CleanChain. An early adopter of the platform, MAS joined in 2016 and has since played an important collaborative role in improving ADEC Innovations’ pioneering chemical information management solution.
“ADEC Innovations is thrilled to partner with MAS Holdings in the deployment of CleanChain within their organization and across the supply chain,” Robert A. Francisco, President, ADEC Innovations, noted. Elaborating further he said, “Our collaboration supports MAS Holdings’ continued commitment to being a proactive and forward-thinking organization with products, plans and strategies that focus on sustainability.
