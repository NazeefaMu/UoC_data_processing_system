Tyson Fury named fighter of the year by Ring magazine

Tyson Fury has been named Fighter of the Year by influential boxing publication Ring magazine after he dethroned world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko.
Fury travelled to Dusseldorf in Germany last November and made the Ukrainian look every one of his 39 years as he earned a unanimous points decision. Fury's fellow British world champion Anthony Crolla and his coach Joe Gallagher were also recognised in the annual awards.
Tyson Fury's achievement has been recognised by influential boxing publication Ring magazine. 
Crolla said he was 'honoured' to be named 'Most Inspirational' boxer after recovering from a fractured skull and broken ankle sustained chasing two burglars to first draw with and then defeat Darlys Perez to win the WBA lightweight crown.
As well as Crolla, Gallagher coaches world champions Scott Quigg and Liam Smith and the latter's brothers Paul, Stephen and Callum and was named 'Trainer of the Year'.
He said: 'Thank you for the award.
Absolutely flattered and speechless to win this after buying magazine for years.'
Fury was given little chance of beating Klitschko who had not lost since 2004.
But despite the frustration of seeing the fight postponed and rescheduled, he dominated in front of more than 50,000 fans.
Since then however the traveller was stripped of the IBF title after he was unable to fulfil his mandatory obligation due to a rematch clause with Klitschko.
That means the WBO and WBA belts will be on the line when the two touch gloves again later this year. Fury tweeted on Monday: 'Can't believe it. OMG. So proud.'
He follows in the footsteps of fellow Brit Ricky Hatton who won the award in 2005 while the 27-year-old's victory was also named 'Upset of the Year'.
Fury saw off competition from Canelo Alvarez, Gennady Golovkin, Roman Gonzalez and Floyd Mayweather to win the main award. Mayweather, who retired after beating Andre Berto last September, did win 'Event of the Year' along with Manny Pacquiao for their May 2 fight.
With the long-awaited clash smashing through the four million pay-per-view barrier, Mayweather banked more than $200million with Pacquiao not far behind.
