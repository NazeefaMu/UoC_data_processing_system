Madhavan  makes digital debut

With Netflix and Amazon Prime becoming popular avenues for entertainment, stars are now beginning to explore the digital space to put out content as well. The latest in line now is actor R Madhavan, who is now stepping into online content with an original series for Amazon Prime Video.
The teaser for the series, titled ‘Breathe’, was released recently. The teaser, which opens with the lines “For someone to live, someone needs to die”, is dark, gritty, and promises to be a psychological drama.
The teaser is intriguing – it shows a child being rushed to the hospital, and someone being hit by a car, but ensures that it doesn’t reveal too much.
According to Firstpost, the series follows the murder of organ donors who are connected to the character played by Madhavan.
Madhavan’s character, Danny, faces the difficult choice “between morality and the possibility of saving his son’s life, but Kabir will not stop till he solves the case,” the Indian Express said. Sapna Pabbi also stars in the series. It has been directed by Mayank V Sharma. It will be a trilingual show comprising of eight episodes. It will be released in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu on January 26.
