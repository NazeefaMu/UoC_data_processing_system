PM clarifies tax on vehicles below 1000cc
Tax amendments on vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1000cc would not affect Letters of Credit (LC) opened before August 1, 2018, while these new taxes are not applicable for vehicles cleared before January 31, 2019, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday informed Parliament.
He also said that the government hoped to revise these amendments in future, depending on trade and economic behavioral changes.
The trade balance increased from a 17% during the first five months of 2018, was due to the significant rise in vehicle importation, PM Wickremesinghe pointed out. The trade balance increase amounted to US$ 4,914 MN, he said. He made these observations in reply to a question raised y JO MP Bandula Gunawardena.
Premier Wickremesinghe also pointed out that the expenditure on imported vehicles for personal use have increased by 110% in the first five months of 2018, compared to the first five months of 2017. In 2017, the expenditure had been US$ 316 MN, where as it had risen to US$ 666 MN in 2018, he explained.
Import of vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1000cc and hybrid vehicles have contributed immensely to the increase of vehicle import expenditure, PM Wickremesinghe further pointed out. The increase in vehicle imports led to a further expansion of Sri Lanka's trade deficit, which has adversely affected the balance of payments, with high pressure on foreign exchange, he added.
The Import Duty on vehicles less than 1000cc was recently increased up to Rs. 1.5 million and hybrid and electric vehicles less than 1000cc up to Rs.1.25 mn. The price of petrol vehicles with an engine capacity less than 1000cc would be increased by Rs. 3,50,000, while electric and hybrid vehicles less than 1000cc engine capacity would be increased by Rs.4,15,000.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that economic sanctions on Iran would affect fuel prices in Sri Lanka, as Sri Lanka purchase Iranian crude oil.
“We don’t know how the USA economic sanctions on Iran will affect our oil prices. We need to be ready to face any changes. It is difficult to predict how it would affect, but we must be ready to manage any situation,” he furthered.

Detection of kidney disease in Rajarata hospitals
Minister asked for special report
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said he asked for a special report on the opinion of Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital Consultant Nephrologist Dr.Pramil Rajakrishna over the problems in the detection of kidney disease in Rajarata hospitals.
The Minister made this observation in response to a question by JVP MP Dr.Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament yesterday. MP Jayatissa directed the Minister’s attention to newspaper reports which said the detection of kidney disease had become problematic due to substandard machines in the hospitals in the North Central Province.
The MP citing the report said if the revelation made by the consultant doctor that half of the patients detected with kidney disease are not actually suffering from that illness is true that gives rise to many other concerns.
The minister said what the Consultant had expressed is a new opinion and therefore he requested for a report to know the real situation of the issue.
“We will have to check the biomedical equipment. Sometime back, the Provincial Councils were given the authority and money to directly buy the required number of such equipment. We have changed that decision and now the ministry is purchasing them together because we can get the quantity discount. However, I doubt the claim that there are issues on the standards of the machines purchased as all those who sit on Technical Evaluation Committees are consultant doctors and biomedical engineers,” the Minister said.
