An entry from Sri Lanka was placed third at the Global Poster Contest held for World Food Day (WFD) 2017. A poster titled 'Zero Hunger: Happy Villagers' submitted by Rithini Perera was awarded third prize in the 5–8 years age category.
The contest is organized annually by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The certificate and prize was presented to Rithini by FAO Representative to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Nina Brandstrup, in Colombo.
The poster by Rithini, a Grade 3 student of Musaeus College, Colombo, was among 3,000 posters submitted for the 5–8 years age category. The WFD 2017 Global Poster Contest which was open to children and youth between ages 5–19 from around the world, received a total of 10,000 posters from 100 countries. The posters illustrate how investing in food security and rural development can change the future of migration.
