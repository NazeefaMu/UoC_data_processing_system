Hambantota gets state-of-the-art hospital

A state-of-the-art hospital is being constructed in Hambantota at a Rs. 7 billion cost, Health Ministry sources said.
The project on a 10-acre land being funded by the Netherlands Government will have a 900 bed capacity. Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne will provide Rs. 300 million worth MRI scanner for the hospital.
This is the first ever MRI scanner to be installed in the Southern Province.
An electric fence around the hospital will be erected to protect it from wild elephants, the sources said.
The hospital will cater to growing demand for healthcare services in three districts - Moneragala, Hambantota, and Ratnapura, the sources said.
