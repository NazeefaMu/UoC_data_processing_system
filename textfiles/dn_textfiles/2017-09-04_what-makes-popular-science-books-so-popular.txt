What makes popular science books so popular?

Neil deGrasse Tyson begins Astrophysics for People in a Hurry by assembling evidence of the increasing popularity of “the universe”, drawing our attention to the fact that “the highest grossing movie of all time” is “set on a planet orbiting a distant star” and features, as its lead, an astrobiologist (he declines to name the film, but one of us needs to re-watch Gone with the Wind). His claim that astrophysics tops the list of popular sciences is convincing, though devoid of hard data; the explanation he offers is that most of us have looked up at the night sky and wondered some version of “what is my place in the universe?”
The book, he hopes, will help answer that question – an ambitious aim for just 200 pages – but it is the following claim that will reassure (or terrify) readers: “If I’ve succeeded, you’ll be culturally conversant in my field of expertise”.
Are we, the laity, now meant to be having informed conversations about astrophysics? Having raised the bar to “foundational fluency”, Tyson rapidly lowers it to something more like “not embarrassing yourself at the water cooler”.
The concern is one of cultural survival. But still, is there a danger here?
In attempting to become culturally conversant does one risk becoming a boulevardier of scientific conversation or, worse, a sincere tourist who believes that, because he has read the guide book, he has something to say? That Tyson pitches his book at people “too busy to absorb the cosmos via classes, text books or documentaries” adds to the initial worry.
Trillionth of a second
Concerns quickly evaporate as Tyson relates the vital statistics of the young universe: smaller than a full-stop, 14 billion years ago.
Then, more precise details emerge: at 10-45 seconds old the universe was less than 10-35 metres across.
By the fourth page we are only a trillionth of a second into the history of the universe, but our guide is rattling along at full speed: he has already covered the Planck Era and the four forces (weak, strong, electromagnetic and gravity), and we feel confident that somehow, he is going to reach 2017 before the pages run out. By the eighth page we find ourselves one millionth of a second after the beginning of the universe. The temperature has fallen to below a trillion degrees kelvin and “yes, antimatter is real”. Two pages later, we start to think on a more human scale: a full second has passed. Things are slowing down. The universe is now a few light years across and only a billion degrees kelvin. Tyson’s dramatic device of announcing the passage of time every few pages works well, giving a sense of scale and drama: time is running out for the universe to get itself into shape.
He recounts these events with a great deal more certainty than most of the physics community feels about them, but he is trying to prepare us for a conversation, not a viva.
The book is a collection of essays but the arrangement is coherent, and those truly in a hurry may be frustrated both by the absence of diagrams, timelines and a clearly described canon of theories, as well as by the presence of appalling dad jokes (the one about the dairy farmer and the astrophysicist especially does not bear repeating) and recycled internet memes.
Tyson is, nonetheless, the world’s best science communicator. This may seem like a subjective claim but the data support it.
When he relaunched Carl Sagan’s television series Cosmos in 2014 the first episode reached 40 million viewers internationally.
His current programme, StarTalk, an astrophysics chat show featuring former presidents, Hollywood A-listers and scientists has broad appeal: I teach undergraduate students who watch it while stoned, and have friends in their eighties who find it enthralling.
Pressure peers
His achievements are hard-won: black astrophysicists are rare, and as a student at Harvard University in the 1970s Tyson had to resist not only the white establishment but also pressure from his peers: “blacks in America do not have the luxury of [their] talents being spent on Astrophysics”, he was told.
Now, he doggedly defends science as a quest for truth, a position that allows him to occupy the political centre and see “the hot air on both sides”. Indeed, one gets a clearer sense of Tyson’s politics in the final chapter, “Reflections on the Cosmic Perspective”, in which he asks, who is able to celebrate a cosmic view of life? “Not the sweatshop worker. Certainly, not the homeless person rummaging through the trash for food. You need the luxury of time not spent on mere survival.” This chapter, which addresses the pettiness of most earthly problems, ends with a kind of creed: the “cosmic perspective”, Tyson says, embraces kindness, environmentalism, kinship and a search for truth, and rejects “low contracted prejudices”; he urges readers to “once a week if not once a day ponder what cosmic truths lie undiscovered before us”.
Prominent expert
The question “is there a god?” is broached early on: “some religious people assert, with a tinge of righteousness, that something must have started it all”. Tyson seems tired of dealing with this old chestnut: he is the public face of science in America, and the country’s most prominent expert on the origins of life and matter. As such his opinion on God is sought frequently. He demurs (“Ignorance is the natural state of mind for a research scientist”), and stays on solid ground: “we do know that the universe had a beginning” and that “we are stardust brought to life, then empowered by the universe to figure itself out”. Throughout, the language of the book hints at the complex role of spirituality in astrophysics. Although he draws on Christian imagery (the first three chapter headings are “the greatest story ever told”; “On Earth as in the heavens”; “let there be light”), his cosmic perspective is “spiritual – even redemptive – but not religious”.
If Astrophysics for People in a Hurry examines the infinite reaches of time and space, Storm in a Teacup: The physics of everyday life by Helen Czerski addresses the life-sized and relatable. Her intent is to titillate and excite with details such as this: “To make a standard full household bath as salty as the ocean you need to add about 10kg of salt, a large bucket full”. Dull would he be of soul who did not marvel at this information, especially when it is coupled with an explanation of buoyancy and the thermohaline currents of our oceans. Czerski is a bubble physicist, an underappreciated specialism, and bubbles are deployed throughout as devices that will lead us from the everyday (bubble bath, focaccia bread dough, frying halloumi cheese) into complex physics. Physics inspires fear in many; bubbles do not. Indeed, a large part of the book’s charm lies in its embrace of the seemingly banal.
A discussion of gravity and why the Titanic sank begins with Czerski’s creation of a raisin lava lamp with her family, in her mother’s back garden. The anecdote is footnoted thus: “By coincidence, the distance that the Titanic sank relative to its size . . . is pretty much the same as the distance that the raisins sink in a 2-litre bottle”. The shift in perspective leaves one gazing, god-like, at a shipwreck in a bottle.
