‘Producing bio-degradable polythene, possible’

Industrialists belonging to the Polythene Producers and Recyclers' Association are capable of producing bio-degradable polythene and plastic products, said Association President Anura Wijetunge.
The association pointed out their ability to do so when they met Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen for discussions on August 8, he said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo on August 10, Wijetunge said they pointed out to the minister that the livelihood of nearly 300 businessmen and several lakhs of workers engaged in the polythene and plastic industry would be disrupted directly and indirectly when the ban on polythene and plastic use comes into force from September 1. They pointed out that they were capable of producing polythene and plastic that would disintegrate within one year and thereafter, completely decay due to micro-organic activity within five years, without causing any environmental pollution. They pointed out that the biodegradable technology would be used for this production.
He said they could change over to this technology within a short period using the same machinery. The cost would also be very low and these products could be marketed at the same prices prevailing in the market today.
Wijetunge said they pointed out that the new hydro bio-degradable technology to be introduced shortly would be costly and unsuccessful because even though polythene and plastics produced in this manner would disintegrate, it would produce methane gas after mixing with earth. Moreover, industrialists would have to purchase completely new machinery to change over to this production and the products would also be more costly in the market. For instance, a lunch sheet would cost nearly Rs. 7 to Rs 8. This showed that the entire industry would face danger if it used the hydro bio degradable (compostable) technology.
Therefore, the association hoped to have further discussions with authorities to create awareness on this matter and make representations to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too on this matter shortly. Minister Bathiudeen promised his support towards their effort, he said.
