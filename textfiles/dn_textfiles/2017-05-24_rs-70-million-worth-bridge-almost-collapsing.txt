Rs. 70 million worth bridge almost collapsing

The bridge setup at a cost of Rs. 70 million at Mahasen roundabout on Sella Kataragama Road in Kataragama vested with the people a month ago, is on the verge of collapse.
The bridge was built by the Road Development Authority with funds from the Irrigation and Water Management Ministry. Residents said it took the RDA almost an year to set up the bridge.
Hambantota Zonal Engineer W. V. P. S. Aruna said he will look into the matter and provide solutions.
