Joshua at his heaviest for Klitschko clash

LONDON April28: Anthony Joshua weighed in at a career-heaviest for his eagerly anticipated showdown against Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday.
The Briton tipped the scales at 17 stones 12lbs 2oz (113.4 kg) ahead of facing Klitschko for two versions of the world heavyweight title in front of 90,000 spectators at London's Wembley Stadium.
Joshua, 27, was ten pounds heavier than Klitschko, who tipped the scales at 17 stones 2lb 6oz at Friday's weigh-in at nearby Wembley Arena, with a crowd of 2,000 watching proceedings.Klitschko (64-4 53 KOs), 41, was five pounds lighter than he was for his previous fight 17 months ago when he lost a surprise points decision to Joshua's fellow Briton Tyson Fury. The Ukrainian, who was his lightest since 2009, can win back two of the three titles he lost to Fury by beating Joshua, who has stopped all 18 professional opponents since turning professional after his 2012 Olympic gold medal triumph.
Thursday saw Klitschko try to unsettle his opponent by suggesting Joshua's physique was like that of an over-muscled and immobile body-builder.
“I've never seen AJ (Joshua) as big as he is right now. He is as big as Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best,” said Klitschko. “He's a puncher. I'm a boxer that can punch.” - 'Beat Klitschko, don't hate him'
But Joshua refused to rise to the bait and on Friday he would not be drawn when asked about how he would win.
“It depends if I see an opportunity,” the 27-year-old Joshua said about the possibility of a knockout.
“My main focus is to focus round by round, for 12 rounds. I don't hate Klitschko, I just want to beat Klitschko.
“I've been switched on since December 10, my last fight. All I have to do is focus on this fight and making it as easy as possible. “When you are competing it's tunnel vision. Even though there are beautiful people, I have to keep tunnel vision.” Klitschko, who has had 50 more professional fights than Joshua, hopes his superior experience will see him become world heavyweight champion for the third time.
