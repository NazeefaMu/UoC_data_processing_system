IPL 2019  auction: Will Lasith  Malinga  find any takers?

Sri Lanka’s fast bowler Lasith Malinga has listed himself in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) auction to be held in Jaipur on December 18.
The veteran pacer is the highest-wicket taker in IPL history and had enjoyed tremendous success earlier. After being unsold in IPL 2018 auction, Malinga is back. But will the celebrated bowler find any takers?
 
MALINGA HAS A BASE  PRICE OF RS. 2 CRORE 
Malinga has listed himself among nine other players with the maximum base price of Rs. 2 crore.
This comes as a surprise for many as the Lankan ace had joined Mumbai Indians as a mentor for the IPL 11 season.
But now he has once again flirted with the possibility of being called up by a team.
 
MALINGA HAS BEEN  ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS 
Malinga has been one of the most high-profile players in the IPL since its inception in 2008.
He has won three titles with MI to script his name in the record books.
Malinga has been always known for his slinging action and dearth of pace to trouble batsmen.
From toe-crushing yorkers to sublime slower deliveries, Malinga was in the thick of action.
 
MALINGA TROUBLED BY  INJURIES IN RECENT PAST 
The 35-year-old pacer has been troubled by injuries in the recent past.
He did make a successful comeback to international cricket this year in limited-overs.
But he has lost the pace and fear factor that governed his success.
Malinga is wanting to represent Sri Lanka at the ICC World Cup 2019, but the IPL is altogether a different prospect.
 
WHY CHAMPION MALINGA  IS LIKELY TO BE IGNORED? 
Malinga has an impressive 154 wickets in just 110 matches in IPL.
His contributions will never be forgotten.
But at the moment, Malinga will find it difficult to make a comeback to the IPL.
Firstly, it’s his base price of Rs. 2 crore, which is seen as a massive sum.
Secondly, teams would want to go for younger options.
