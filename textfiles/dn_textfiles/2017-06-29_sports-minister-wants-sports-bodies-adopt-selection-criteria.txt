Sports Minister wants sports bodies to adopt a selection criteria

An order has been made to all the sports associations to adopt selection criteria when selecting sportspersons to the respective national teams, Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara said yesterday. There were no such criteria until this decision was made, Minister Jayasekara pointed out.
The Minister was speaking at the Cabinet press briefing yesterday which was held at the Department of Government Information.
“The sportsmen had no way to question as to why they were not selected to a team. They have a right to ask so. No one knew how selections were done regarding any national team.” Minister Jayasekara pointed out.
The sportspersons who have doubts regarding the selection process can now make an appeal to the National Selection Committee, the Minister said.
The final decision will be made regarding selections by the Minister of Sports, as provisioned by the Sports Act.
“One cannot call it a political involvement since it is the same method adopted in all the other countries.” he explained.
Minister Jayasekara also said, the fitness levels of the national cricket team was not satisfactory. “They have promised to improve their fitness levels within the next coming three months.” he said.
Minister Jayasekara also said that he will not give his approval to the selections unless the athletes have provided the certificate issued by the Institute of Sports Medicine regarding their physical fitness.
Questioned on cricketer Lasith Malinga’s suspension, Minister Jayasekara said he has no personal vendetta against any sportsman or sportswoman.
Jayasekara said he did not intend to isolate one cricketer when he was commenting on the fitness issue of the Sri Lanka cricket team. “If, however, someone wears the cap as it fits, I cannot help it.”
“I have nothing personal against anybody in the Sri Lankan cricket team or against any other sports person in the country. It is important that all feel responsible towards Sri Lanka sports. No responsible party should try to brew animosities between the Minister of Sports and the cricketers.” Jayasekara said.
