New Constitution is a fundamental necessity - Sumanthiran

TNA Spokesman and Parliamentarian M.A.Sumanthiran yesterday said that a new Constitution is a fundamental necessity and the Sinhala majority should accept it.
Addressing a seminar on the new Constitution in Galle, Sumanthiran speaking in Sinhala said that the country was dragged into a protracted war as successive governments failed to give an ear to the problems of the people.
“All the problems of Tamil People won’t be solved by a new Constitution, but a new Constitution is fundamental. Without this, no issue can be addressed, Sumanthiran said.
He added that it is important to share the powers of governance in such a way that all people have equal citizenship rights’ in a country with a permanent majority. “Sri Lanka’s Sinhala majority must itself acknowledge this injustice and clamour for reform and justice for other peoples,” Sumanthiran said.
He added that the county does not need a federal system of governance and the Tamil people would accept if the Provincial Council system undergoes minor changes.
