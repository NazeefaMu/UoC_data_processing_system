Abolishing cess will destroy local industries - Ven Rathana Thera

Abolishing the cess on imports will destroy local industries in the country, MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
“Our dream of doing good deeds with this Government have been shattered and the only thing left now is preventing it from engaging in more harm to the country, Ven.Rathana Thera said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo yesterday he said that if this political change done by him and others harm the country and the people, there is no point of being alive.
There is no point of living if the change we made harm the country. The President did not know about the letter issued by the Prime Minister’s office abolishing the CESS tax.
According to Ven. Rathana Thera, the CESS was imposed by the UNP regime during the time of late President J.R.Jayewardene and Minister Lalith Athulathmudali to protect local small and medium scale industries.
“What is happening now is a few try to form national strategies and policies which will only ruin the country.
“We cannot let trade agreements destroy the country and we will not let it happen.We cannot let individuals to plan and submit cabinet papers enabling them and their friends to earn money while destroying the country,” he said.
This Government saved the port city land and that is what should be done when it comes to signing trade agreements. “But a few persons are trying to do the opposite,” he added.
