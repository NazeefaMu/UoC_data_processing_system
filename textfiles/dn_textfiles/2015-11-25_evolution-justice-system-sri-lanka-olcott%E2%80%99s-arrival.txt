Evolution of the Justice System in Sri Lanka since Olcott’s arrival

Reproduced below is the second part of Colonel Henry Steel Olcott Memorial Speech delivered by Attorney General Y J W Wijayatilake, PC at Ananda College on November 21. The first part was published on November 23.
Leaving room for judicial and quasi-judicial decisions to be made on extraneous factors such as faith, rumour or popular belief rather than evidence or proof is akin to tearing off the blindfold from the face of Lady Justice. Reasoned and conscious conduct which is upheld by Buddhist philosophy is the very principle which underlies the sound administration of justice. Calls to act upon rumour and belief should, therefore, be treated as those based on ignorance of the law. Bowing down to the pressure of such calls and making decisions without sufficient evidence would be a travesty of justice. This brings me to the subject of ignorance and how the Dharma views ignorance. Olcott deals with the subject in Catechism Nos. 116-118:
Q. When our Bodhisattva because Buddha, what did he see was the cause of human misery? Tell me in one word.A. Ignorance.
Q. Can you tell me the remedy?A. To dispel ignorance and become wise (Prajna).
Q. Why does ignorance cause suffering?A. Because it makes us prize what is not worth prizing, grieve when we should not grieve, consider real what is not real but only illusionary, and pass our lives in the pursuit of worthless objects, neglecting what is in reality most valuable.
Q. And what is that which is most valuable?A. To know the whole secret of man’s existence and destiny, so that we may estimate no more than their actual value this life and its relations; and so that we may live in a way to ensure the greatest happiness and the least suffering for our fellow-men and ourselves.
In Catechism NO.215, Olcott goes on further to explain the Dharma’s criticism of ignorance:
Q. What says the “Dhammapada” about ignorance?A. That it is a taint worse than all taints that a man can put upon himself.
Now that we have an idea of Buddhism’s perspective on ignorance, it is interesting to note that the law too is equally critical of ignorance and, certainly, ignorance of the law is no defence. Ignorantia facti excusat; ignorantia juris non excusat. This is a Latin maxim which means that ignorance of fact excuses; ignorance of the law excuses not. This principle from English common law is found in section 69 and 72 of our Penal Code and has been adopted by our courts too. Thus, it is only a mistake (including ignorance) in fact and not one in law which is recognized as a defence. Therefore, in procedural law, a person’s rights or duties would be determined after considering whether he has acted in ignorance of the law. And as such, ignorance of the law can have dangerous ramifications. In light of criticisms levelled against the process of justice in the current context, without seeking or, even worse, overlooking both factual and legal clarifications which have been generously and sincerely offered, it appears that human beings can even be wilfully and blissfully ignorant. So I use this opportunity to say to all of you gathered here today, that, where law is concerned, ignorance only serves to undermine the entire justice system.
Part II: Protection of Buddhism as reflected in the law
When tracing the evolution of laws in this country from the 19th century onwards, it is significant to note that Buddhism has been granted a special status by law even during the British colonial period. However, it must be said at the outset that, our laws and judicial pronouncements on these laws have sought to equally ensure the freedom and tolerance of other religions. The result has been that, at least within the legal framework, Buddhism has continuously been protected by the State, whilst at the same time a happy co-existence has been maintained between Buddhism and other religions.
We are all aware of the famous encounter between Arhat Mahinda’s and King Devanampiyatissa and this country’s embrace of Buddhism and State patronage for the faith since that ancient royal era. Whilst the period of colonization under the Portugese and the Dutch saw the introduction of the Christian faith to Ceylon and would obviously have diluted Buddhism’s presence within the local population, what is illuminating is that in the Convention of 1815, British rulers showed an express intention to return to Buddhism its pre-colonial status. The fifth clause of the Convention stated that “The Religion of Boodhoo professed by the Chiefs and Inhabitants in these Provinces is declared inviolable, and its rites, Ministers and places of Worship are to be maintained and protected.” Thereafter, in the Adoption of Roman-Dutch Law Ordinance of 1835, the British legislators recognized in section 6 the liberty of conscience and the free exercise of religious worship.
Despite the libertarian features of these laws, the influence of Christian missionaries in the 19th century led to a de facto policy of Christianization. Therefore, Olcott arrived in Sri Lanka at a time when the Buddhists of this country had been demoralised and were in need of a strong revival of the faith. And so it must be reiterated that Olcott was not a missionary who was seeking to convert non-Buddhists to Buddhists. To the contrary, his was a didactic mission to revive the faith amongst its followers, but in a cleansed form of Buddhism since he viewed its practice and understanding among the local community as being primitive, and to fight for Buddhist civil rights in the face of insidious British oppression. Going back to my point that the law of this country has continuously reflected the protection of Buddhism, I now draw your attention to the country’s first home-grown Constitution. The SVASTI or preamble to the 1972 Constitution referred to the date of the enactment of the Constitution as being the “tenth day of the waxing moon in the month of Vesak in the year two thousand five hundred and fifteen of the Buddhist era”. And Article 6 stated that “The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster Buddhism while assuring to all religions the rights guaranteed by section 18(1). Section 18(1), by the way, contained fundamental rights including the freedom of religion. In the 1978 Constitution which is what we are bound by today, the date of enactment in the preamble is once again in terms of reference to the Buddhist era, whilst Article 9 like its predecessor confers Buddhism the foremost place in Sri Lanka, the only difference being that this time the State’s duty is to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana and not Buddhism.
Therefore, the protection of Buddhism has been unambiguously reflected in ours laws throughout a long period of time. Yet, this has by no means posed a threat to other religions and, in fact, what is reflected in the law is the principle of tolerance that is an integral part of the Buddhist philosophy. Here, I return to Olcott, in particular his Catechism No. 295 which refers to the greatness of Emperor Ashoka, who converted to Buddhism and is regarded as responsible for the permanent establishment of Buddha’s religion:
Q. What made him great?
A. He was the most powerful monarch in Indian history, as warrior and as statesman. But his noblest characteristics were his love of truth and justice, tolerance of religious differences, equity of government, kindness to the sick, to the poor, and to animals. His name is revered from Siberia to Ceylon.
It is of significance that the recognition of religious freedom which was included in laws enacted by the British as I mentioned earlier did not fade away after Ceylon gained independence or when Constitutions came to give expressions of special status to Buddhism. For instance, there has been both legal and judicial commitment to ensure religious freedom and tolerance. The legal commitment is demonstrated in several provisions of the present Constitution. Article 12(2) guarantees that no citizen shall be discriminated on specified grounds including religion, whilst Article 14(1)(e) guarantees every citizen “the freedom, either by himself or in association with others, and either in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.”
Then in the Principles of State Policy, Article 27(5) refers to the State’s objective to strengthen national unity by promoting co-operation and mutual confidence among all sections of the People of Sri Lanka, including religious groups and Article 27(11) refers to enabling people of all religious faiths to make a reality of their religious principles. Furthermore, under Article 28(e), there is a corresponding fundamental duty on the part of every person in Sri Lanka to respect the rights and freedoms of others. The Penal Code already sets out offences relating to insulting religions in sections 291A and 291B, while hate speech too may soon be criminalized.
Judicial commitment to religious freedom and tolerance is seen in Supreme Court Determinations on Bills which have been sought to be enacted as Law in this country. The first of these is in the 2001 Determination on the Christian Sahanaye Doratuwa Prayer Centre (Incoporation) Bill. The objectives of the Centre included not only the promotion of the Christian faith, but also to assist persons to obtain job opportunities and enable them to engage in self-employment. Having considered that the Centre combined religious and commercial activities, Court stressed that the freedom guaranteed by Article 10 to every person to adopt a religion or belief of his choice postulates that the choice stems from the free exercise of one’s thought and conscience without there being any fetter of allurement which in any way distorts that choice.
Accordingly, Court determined that the Bill would permit conversion by allurement or other subtle means and thus held it to be unconstitutional. Subsequently, in 2003, when the Supreme Court gave its Determinations on two other religious bodies sought to be incorporated, New Wine Harvest Ministries and Provincial of the Teaching Sisters of the Holy Cross of the Third Order of Saint Francis in Menzingen of Sri Lanka, the same judicial position was upheld. In those two instances too, the objectives of the two proposed religious bodies included those of a socio-economic nature and thereby posed the possibility of conversion by allurement of socio-economic benefits.
Of course, at this point, you may think that all of these Determinations ironically held against religious bodies of a faith other than Buddhism and you may, therefore, question whether they were actually examples of the judiciary’s commitment to religious freedom and tolerance. But before you think any further, I refer you to another Determination. In 2004, a Private Member of Parliament sought to bring a Nineteenth Amendment to the Constitution substituting Article 9.
The amendment contemplated that Buddhism is elevated as the official religion of the Republic, the State should not only foster and protect but also patronize Buddha Sasana, persons professing Buddhism were bound to bring up their children in the same faith and that conversion of Buddhist to other forms of worship is prohibited. However, the Supreme Court rightly determined that these provisions would destroy the secular notion of the State, violate the right to equality and non-discrimination under Article 12, freedom of religion under Article 10 and freedom of a person to manifest his religion under Article 14(1)(e) of the Constitution.
The conclusion is that all these developments in the judico-legal arena of this country in the last two centuries demonstrate that laws reflect a desire to protect Buddhism, but always within a secular, multi-cultural framework. Therefore, together, the legal provisions and judicial pronouncements I have cited appear to be in harmony with the principle of tolerance encapsulated in Buddhism’s moral philosophy. It is also in harmony with the vision of Olcott himself. In The White Buddhist, Stephen Prothero describes Olcott as a “religious liberal for whom religious tolerance was something akin to dogma” and that Olcott affirmed a creolized faith that was “optimistic, activistic, adaptationist, cosmopolitan, reform-minded and committed to resolving particularities into unity.”
Conclusion
Given the boundless nature of the two disciplines I chose to combine in the topic of today’s oration, Law and Buddhism, there is much left to be said on the subject. But time does not permit any further discussion. So I leave you with a summary of my ruminations. Sri Lanka has a rich legal heritage and an even richer religious heritage, especially where Buddhism is concerned. The evolution of the justice system from the 19th century period of Olcott’s errand to Asia up to the present time has amply shown that the content of these two heritages are not unlike each other. Important aspects of the moral philosophy of Buddhism are reflected in the law, none more so than the concept of justice.
This should give added justification to strictly observe the substantive and procedural elements of the law so that injustice is avoided at all cost. On the other hand, the law has provided Buddhism special protection, but without compromising on freedom and tolerance which are themselves fundamental tenets of the Buddhist philosophy. Therefore, I invite you to consider the idea that if we are to assist the State to foster Buddhism and protect this great faith, the best way to achieve that is by living our lives according to the moral philosophy of Buddhism. And if we live such a life, we would automatically become law-abiding citizens and the rule of law and justice would prevail in abundance.
