One for the fans

The world is closing inDid you ever thinkThat we could be so close, like brothersThe future's in the airI can feel it everywhereBlowing with the wind of change
The Scorpions – Wind of Change
Music has the power to change and transform lives. It is our past, present and our future. Scorpions is one band that inspires Sajith Gunaratna. And these lyrics are powerful because it carries a certain message with it and that message is that we are a brotherhood or sisterhood. And music brings us together. And it is possible for there to be change, if we only follow our hearts and believe that change is possible. And if we can believe that we can do anything. Melodies features Sajith Gunaratna of N-Chord.
“The bands that inspire me internationally are Toto, Guns and Roses and Scorpions. Obviously in our time we grew up with boy bands like Backstreet Boys and N-sync. From them I got the enthusiasm to sing English Songs, but later on when I listened to Queen it took me to a different level of listening and learning. I personally love Marc Anthony and Lionel Ritchie. But recently I'm in love with ‘Perfect’ by Ed Sheeran,” said Gunaratna.
The beginning of N-Chord started in 2014, when Gunaratna’s good friend Sahan Hewadewa at that time the F&B Manager at OZO Colombo invited him to play at 14 rooftop bar. As a result he formed the band N-Chord, first as a trio, and after that as a full band. Gunaratna believes that the best platform that N-chord ever got was being the resident band for Shangri-la Hambanthota. That was a real experience and exposure.
“N-Chord is a commercial band. We cover weddings, cocktails and dinner dances. We play all the genres starting from golden hits to the new charts. Also we play some beautiful classic Sinhalese songs for client’s satisfaction,” said Gunaratna.
When it comes to N-Chord what they believe in is pleasing their fans. Bands owe everything to their fans. Bands are what they are because of their fans. What N-Chord believes in is loyalty to their fans. They do not let their fans down by playing music that is half- hearted. They give their fans their everything. They are honest and enthusiastic about what they do. When they get their hands on an instrument or when they are up there on stage, they just want to make their fans enjoy the evening and leave a lasting impression.
“When you talk about music in Sri Lanka, there are different bands playing a different kind of music for a different kind of audience. What N-Chord believes is Quality!! I want to do quality music which is one reason to form my own band. The Crowd loves it,” pointed out Gunaratna
If you are passionate about what you do, then no matter who says what, you are going to succeed. Let people talk and say what they want, at the end of the day you are the winner. When you are passionate about what you do and you do it every day, then everything else in your life becomes meaningful. Life starts to make sense. You need to have passion
“Well I'm passionate, because this is what I always love doing. God has given me the talent to sing, so then I simply took it to the next level of entertaining the audience. Anyone can sing, but it's very hard to entertain the audience. Therefore I have a passion for music,” explained Gunaratna.
Gunaratna’s advice for anyone who wants to take up music is to be humble, do what you love, always think about quality and be disciplined. This is what makes him successful. You have the passion but you also need the maturity to handle it and you need self-control. If you don’t have that self-control and you don’t have that maturity then your tremendous talent will be of no avail. You will burn up. You will crash like a meteorite.
“The world is full of music lovers, some love jazz, some love reggae, Some love heavy metal, it's a carnival to be honest. I choose music because that's always what I have loved and it is my passion. Music heals souls, therefore I'm proud and happy, because I'm a part of that. Last but not least I want to thank my parents and my sister for playing a huge part in my life, my beautiful wife Dinu, who brings so much encouragement to my music life and my family life, My mother in law and all my family. I also want to thank my friends Shean, Sahan, Sean and Ashan, who always inspire me. I want to thank my band and I cannot forget my two beautiful daughters Sehali and Leo, for being my Lucky Charms,” added Gunaratna.
