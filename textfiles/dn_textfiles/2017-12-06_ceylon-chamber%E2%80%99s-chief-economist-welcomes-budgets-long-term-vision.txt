Ceylon Chamber’s Chief Economist welcomes Budget's long-term vision

Ceylon Chamber of Commerce’s Chief Economist Shiran Fernando welcomed Budget 2018 for its more long-term vision and complementary nature to recent policy documents while putting forward new initiatives such as the ‘blue-green’ concept.
“The big positive in this Budget is that there is a significant consistency with recent policy documents and strategies such as Vision 2025 and the Prime Minister’s 2017 Economic Policy Statement,” Fernando said, citing private enterprise, liberalization and macro stability as common trends in these state policy documents.
He also said this Budget has more realistic proposals than previously, such as the mechanism for levy of the carbon tax on vehicles. Last year’s Budget mentioned such as a tax but offered no method of levy.
The previous Budget also proposed a committee to look at implementation of Budget proposals, but this year, the Budget has moved towards establishing a unit under the Finance Ministry for this purpose.
Fernando was hopeful that this unit will be operationalised this time around. “I think there is a concerted effort to improve on this,” he said.
“They will have to prioritize which proposals require the greatest level of attention.”
Fernando commended the repealing of the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises or Underutilized Assets Act No. 43 of 2011 as an important Budget announcement. This if enacted will send a positive signal to investors that private businesses will not be expropriated overnight for underperformance or any other reasons.
Fernando conceded that there was repetition of proposals in this Budget such as the Debt Repayment Levy which was present in the 2017 Budget as a Financial Transaction Levy. “Repetition serves to underline the urgency for implementation of what merely remains on paper.”
He however underscored the need for implementation to avoid repetition of proposals which is undesirable.
What Fernando would have liked to see in this Budget was an action plan or direction with regard to SOE reforms.
Fernando said the new taxes such as those on sugary beverages and cellular towers will have a negative impact on those sectors and reiterated the Chamber’s call for a more medium term plan that factors in grace periods for businesses to adjust when such taxes are introduced.
Speaking on the tourism industry which has been earmarked as a thrust sector, he said while this sector has seen organic growth, much more needs to be done in terms of offering attractions such as those offered by other countries which are more experiential in nature.
He welcomed the VAT refund scheme for foreign passport holders in principal as having the potential to complement Sri Lanka’s ambition in becoming a shopping hub.
