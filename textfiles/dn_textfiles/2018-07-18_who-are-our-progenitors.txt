Who are our progenitors?

In the Ceylon Department of British Library of London, my eyes were captivated by a report written by Sir Henry Ward, Governor of Ceylon, to the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain.
“My irrigation engineers submitted to me a descriptive project regarding an ancient tank called the Giants’ Tank and 122 small tanks lid in geometrical order around, in the Manner District of North Ceylon. Now they are abandoned lying in the arid zone under the blazing sun. They are only fed by monsoon rain from November to January.”
This cluster of tanks is not mentioned in any chronicle of Ceylon. When Indo-Aryans came headed by Prince Vijaya, according to history, they were there displaying their splendours. There are no historical accounts to prove by whom they were built or when. It was said by this peculiar 228,000 acres of land was cultivated for paddy producing bumper harvest to fill up the country’s panarium. Now cattle and goats are grazing and wild animals including elephants come at nightfall to appease their thirst in untold numbers. Aravi-or Malwathu Oya, at tekkem, in Periya-arnalkulam, was harnessed in the olden days, on the 27th-mile post on the Mannar-Madawachchi road, for the purpose of turning waters of the river from the natural course into the channel which feeds the Giants’ Tank. It is an imposing sight. Araviaru brings so much of gurgling waters, we ken, if they flow into the cannel, the whole tank might be blasted, luckily 122 tanks come into rescue sipping them passes to the fields to save the mother tank. It was unsuccessfully repaired in 1897. As the tank is 40 ft. high, we are unable to convey the water uphill.”
In the time immemorial there must have been kings who built these sorts of irrigational wonders, we can’t imagine as they were gone with the cyclone of time. For thousands of years, South Indian invading armies came here and settled down driving natives interior. A South Indian Prince called Magha, came with people called “Vanni” and settled them there. For the reason, Manner area turned out to be a Tamil Domination. They, I hear, are boasting that these tanks were built by Tamil giants. That’s why they bear giants’ names.
It is all nonsense. This marvellous project requires at least the labour of 25,000 workers for 10 years to do the framework. They don’t have scientists gifted with scientific know-how. Only a powerful native king who could do it. South Indian history does not mention a single giant. Only Lanka history wrote about giants. King Gemunu’s army had 14 giants including Nandimitra, and Velusumana, who killed Tamil soldiers in Vijitapura. King Parakramabahu himself was a giant. King Gajabahu had a giant called Neela Maha Yodaya, who went to South India and captured 75,000 Tamils abs brought them here to restore tanks destroyed by Tamils. Very recently there was a giant from Tamuttegama, unfortunately, he died of starvation.
Assyrian Giants
No need to cite, the whole world know how 7 Assyrian giants who rebuilt marvellous Ashur temple. They irrigated whole Euprerese-Tigris valleys and adorned them with rice and wheat fields and orchards. In 2500 BC Assyria’s first king, Tiglath-pileser 81115-11029 boasted that he was the king of the whole world. The last emperor Assurbanipal died in 626 BC. Fourteen years later, an army of Babilonia, under king Nabopolassar, united with an army of Medes under Cyaxeres and hordes of Scythians from the Caucasus and with amazing ease and swiftness captured the citadels of the north Nineveh – the capital was laid waste as ruthless and completely, just like Assyrians destroyed Capital Susa of Babylonia. And they put the torch to all towns. The population was slaughtered or enslaved and places levelled to the ground as rubbish and Assyria disappeared from history. Their God was dead.
Paradise Lost
For the first time, Assyrians brought the Industrial Revolution to the world. They invented cart to run on the land, and the ship to plough the sea, metals and minerals tamed to serve the man, because of the world could write and read, they showed how to irrigate the land and how to water reservoirs. Now they lost everything. Very few of them fled to neighbouring lands to save their dear life. Some were on board of ships, they invented, sailed through opened Persian Gulf, sojourned for some time at Adana /Aden/ and navigated to the Indian Ocean to look for an uninhabited land if existed. According to the accounts of Greek historian and geographer, Strabo (61BC-24AD) and Arabian historian Marki Ahamed Oglu, they found an island in the Indian Ocean, at last, to settle down in peace without fear.
About three centuries later, Assyrians together with Phoenicians, former trading partners who sold their cunei-forms and Alphabet for exorbitant prices abroad, opened an emporium at Mantota, in the jutting out tip of the north-central shore of Helia. Phoenicians were the tycoons, floating in money by committing piracy on high seas. The Vedic name for Helia was Lanka. By Persian was Hela. Aryans were late to get the alphabet, when they were writing Veda on the bank of Nelukha (Indus) they heard some giants making wonders in Lanka and they wrote, “Yaksha people could transform themselves into giants or formless spirits. The author of Mahavansa had drunk this elixir.
Mantota
According to Persian history Mantota international market was rich in diversity of articles such as ivory, gems, pearls, peacocks, rice, vegetables and various kinds of tropical fruits. According to the accounts of Greek geographer Ptolemy, new inhabitants could transform the barren lands into unsurpassed fertility and made the landscapes mysterium trimendum. At that time north-central part of Helia was known as “Manaram Adaviya”. Legends said it was “Kuméni Adaviya”.
