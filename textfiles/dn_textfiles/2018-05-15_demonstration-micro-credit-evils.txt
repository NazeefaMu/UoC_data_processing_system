Demonstration on micro credit evils

A demonstration was staged by the residents of Vantharumoolai in the Eravur Pattu Chenkalady secretarial area to make people aware of the negative effects of micro credit facilities in the Batticaloa district.
The demonstration took place from Ammalathadi Pillaiyar Temple up to the Chenkalady market and back to the starting point on Saturday.
By now, recipients of 17 micro credit facilities have committed suicide while families have broken up and recipients were subjected to severe mental and social ills, the demonstrators allege. People who are receiving micro credit facilities are in desperate financial straits. Therefore, they jump at the idea of obtaining micro credit loans but suffer immensely in repaying it daily, weekly or monthly.
Demonstrators requested Batticaloa District Parliamentarian S. Viyalendran and former Eastern Province Agriculture Minister S. Viyalendran to look into the issues.
