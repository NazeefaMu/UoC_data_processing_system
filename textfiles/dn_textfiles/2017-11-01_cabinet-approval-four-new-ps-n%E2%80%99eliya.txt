Cabinet approval for four new PS for N’Eliya

The Cabinet yesterday granted approval for four additional Pradeshiya Sabhas in the Nuwara Eliya District, thus delivering a 30-year promise to the parties of the hill country.
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha will sign the relevant Gazette needed to bring in electoral reforms to allow Provincial Council Elections, today. This had earlier been held up due to the need to create six new Pradeshiya Sabhas.
“It’s an achievement in the Tamil Progressive Alliance’s visionary patriotic journey,” tweeted National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan yesterday, a strong advocate to have six Pradeshiya Sabhas in the district rather than the two Nuwara Eliya and Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabhas.
The area which comes under the purview of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha will be sub-divided into three areas such as Ambagamuwa, Norwood and Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabhas while the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha division will be sub-divided into three areas such as Nuwara Eliya, Agarapathana and Kotawila Pradeshiya Sabhas.
Minister Ganesan pointed out that the earlier two Pradeshiya Sabhas which struggled to deliver services to 225,000 people each can now easily cope with each Pradeshiya Sabha covering a population of 50,000.
