“Year after year we’ve experienced the growing demands of consumers when it comes to the quality and finer details of kitchen finishes. With this in mind we began to search for a brand that could meet those demands and we found LEICHT to be one of the best brands to affiliate with. Their innovation, quality and finishes have been evaluated and awarded by prestigious external bodies. This gives us the comfort of knowing that LEICHT is actually walking the talk”, said Fairway Holdings (Pvt) Ltd, Chairman, Hemaka De Alwis in a press release.
