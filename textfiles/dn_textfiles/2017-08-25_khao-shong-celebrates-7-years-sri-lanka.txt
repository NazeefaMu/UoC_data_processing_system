Khao Shong celebrates 7 years in Sri Lanka

The Khao Shong Brand recently celebrated its Seventh Year in Sri Lanka. Khao Shong has created a new wave of interest in the Coffee drinking at home habit. Khao Shong is often referred to as the ‘Home Coffee Café’. With the range on offer, it would enable any housewife to make not only her family happy, but also surprise guests with innovations based on the variety of choices Khao Shong offers. When it comes to the professionals, the single serve options enable their refresh breaks more exciting and group meetings more productive.
The Khao Shong story in Sri Lanka came about when Chula de Silva Managing Director of Visvaka Marketing, the Company which imports and markets Khao Shong was visiting Bangkok and in the Robinsons Supermarket which is considered a premium store in Thailand, noticed just two bottles of Khao Shong Instant Coffee in a shelf otherwise well stocked with numerous brands. The space allocated for the brand was significant. De Silva told himself this must be a good Coffee not well marketed and worth a trial. Back at home on blind tests it fared significantly ahead of the market leader in taste and aroma. There was no need to hold back but move forward to link up and start getting the product on shelf. Subsequent to a short test-marketing in a single chain in the latter part of 2009, Khao Shong Instant Coffee was launched in the Year 2010 in Sri Lanka; the rest is history.
The success of a Coffee is derived from how well the Coffee is roasted and the choice of the right Coffee bean. Khao Shong selects its Coffee bean from the Trang Province in Thailand and uses a special technique Unique to Khao Shong for roasting the beans.The result of this effort is that Khao Shong is been the preferred choice in blind sampling when serving the discerning chefs and industrial customers
‘Refreshingly fresh and tastes So Good’ is the Khao Shong promise. The Brand has fulfilled this promise in many different ways, starting with the breaking of the boredom other brands offer of just a black coffee option and Kiri Kopi. Khao Shong Offers two choices in the ‘Black Coffee’ segment with a 100% Coffee in the Brown Label and a 92% Coffee 8% Caramel version in the Red Label. The Brown label is available in three bottle versions and three soft packs starting from a very affordable 25g pack yielding 25 cups and priced at LKR 195 per unit. With the Red Label offering two options and the 3 in 1 range offering five variants: Espresso, Condensed Milk, Super Rich, Mocha and Cappuccino, the consumer has many reasons to ‘Switch to Khao Shong’ the Bold Invitation from the Brand.The Single Serve sachets in the 3 in 1 category can be innovated to a luxury coffee drink with extra milk and served hot, chilled or even on ice.
