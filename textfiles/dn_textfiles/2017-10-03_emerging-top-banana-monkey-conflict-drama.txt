Emerging top banana in monkey conflict drama!

Some people think that monkeys are cute and mischievous and great entertainers. Ok, I agree their antics are enjoyable and make great subjects for social media snap shots, assuming they haven’t stolen your camera by then. Certainly in this neck of the woods you are likely to encounter them in the wilds and even in suburbia.
It appears that there’s no escaping their anthropomorphic presence anywhere in our tropical island nation. I once tried spending a quiet Christmas at a fancy eco resort in Dambulla. Fat chance! I may have been mercifully spared the commercial big city Jingle Bell jingles only to be replaced by the Jungle Bells jangles by large troupes of monkeys discoing on the aluminium roof top.
A good many people go ape about apes, far more than they do about fellow humans. Personally, I really don’t like monkeys. In fact, I kind of detest them particularly those ruddy-faced pestiferous varmints of the Toque Macaque species, which the locals call the Rilawa. Those cute little monkeys that hang out in tourist areas might be fun to watch, but they can be dangerous.
These little scoundrels are the gangsters of the animal world.
They’re like those out-of-control, hyperactive children who never got any discipline growing up and so feel like they can go around pestering, stealing and harassing people with impunity. The average local macaque is about two feet high and weighs probably around 15 pounds - but just because they are small it doesn’t mean they can’t harm you.
In fact, macaques can be very aggressive. Injuries that require hospital care are reported yearly, and authorities have even put up signs in tourist areas warning people to beware, but incidents continue to occur. These darn macaques give new meaning to monkey-shine and mischief in general. Most of their time their aggressive poses and teeth-revealing expressions are bluffs meant to intimidate. Male monkeys seem to enjoy harassing women and children more than adult men apparently as a way of showing off. Sometimes they bite and sometimes they carry nasty diseases.
Regardless of how tame and accustomed to people wild monkeys may seem, they should still be approached with caution. These creatures can be devilishly devious, in ways that are not immediately apparent to the untrained eye.
Monkeys are incredibly smart and wisely hang around snack areas in tourist spots. Be vigilant around food and drink carts and open-air restaurants that are situated close to the jungle cover. The grandkids and I had a traumatic encounter with an entire colony of marauding monkeys at an exclusively swank boutique eco-resort in Anuradhapura last week.
We made the mistake of opting for an alfresco breakfast a few feet outside the luxury cabana situated in the midst of the jungle canopy. The amenable resort staff left in their eco-friendly golf-buggies after laying out a delicious spread on a small table. Everything seemed serene as the three kids and I sat down to enjoy our first repast of the day. That was until we started to take the wrapping off our plates.
Suddenly we were surrounded by a ferocious horde of hirsute apes hanging off the nearby trees. The kids were terrified as they left the table duly prepared to abandon their appealing breakfast. Even though I had to think of an action plan I began to wonder about their sudden appearance at our impromptu dining site. There was certainly no evidence of their presence when the staff were setting the table. There was no time for frivolity but I quipped that they must have got their gossip on the ‘Ape Vine.’
I had to square up to a whole troupe of the little buggers to get the grandkids and our breakfast to the safety of our cabana. The terrified kids were out of their seats before you could say: ‘Brass monkey’ or ‘Monkey with brass’. The ecologist advice in a situation like this is: ‘Avoid smiling at them: For monkeys, showing teeth is a sign of threat and aggression. A misinterpreted smile or yell may provoke an unnecessary attack. And when a monkey smiles at you, back off immediately.’
Okay so I didn’t smile at the advancing ruddy army. No one in such circumstances would. This seemed like full-scale war with no quarter given. The first thing I did in the face-off was roar while ignoring little Moya’s warning of: “Dada, don’t yell. They attack when yelled at!” So I unleashed what I imagined was my stentorian, full-throated Tarzan-like challenging bellow that must have echoed through those silent green mansions for miles around.
You see, when it comes to a crisis it is sometimes prudent to throw conventional wisdom to the winds of chance. I was determined I should stay and defend our property and my little charges. Frankly I did not know how to defend property and my kids against a macaque attack. Such a skill was never covered in my fleeting two months of judo training, 25 years ago.
Sure, the macaques were smaller than I was, but they possessed a fearlessness certain human antagonists I have faced could only dream of. Yet, I was aware that if one bit or scratched me, I’d be in the hospital getting rabies shots – an activity possibly less pleasant than the macaque bite.
The ape-man war-cry stopped that bunch of red-faced rapscallions in their tracks, but only for a time. About a half dozen of the shameless scallywags came forward like relentless commando fighters ready to pounce. I handed over the plates on the table to the oldest grandkid, Keshini to take inside the cabin, while reaching for my ever-present switchblade.
The evacuation operation took only a few minutes while the kids relayed the food and drinks into the safety of the cabin. I stood in a heroic Publius Horatius stance against the invading army of Lars Porsena at the bridge gate of Rome. The only thing left on the table was a heavy metal dining knife which I grabbed with my right hand while flicking my pocket switchblade open with my left hand.
There were screams from the advancing imps as the blade flashed open. There was a warning shout from the partially open doorway as the youngest of the grandkids Kingsley yelled: “Dada watch out behind you!”
I instinctively kicked backward as I observed another gang of ruddy rascals sneaking up on me. I realised that getting into a fight with an army of apes was not a wise or practical strategy. That is because the sneaky simians are quite adept at waging ‘gorilla’warfare. Leading the rearguard troop was a large alpha male with his vampire-like fangs flashing expressive eyebrows telegraphing rage.
I threw the heavy table knife at him which hit him square on the chest and he backed down while I reached the safety of the cabana. The indoor breakfast was an amusingly serene one as the children recounted the monkeyshines conflict. Little Kingsley between mouthfuls cracked: “Thank Heavens our DaDa showed those silly monkeys that he’s the top banana!”
