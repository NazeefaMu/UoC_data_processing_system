Jaffna  University clash must be nipped  in the bud:JVP

 
The clash at the Jaffna University last Saturday could be perceived as an extension of the racist mind-set developing in the people in the North, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday. He made this observation  while raising a question under the Standing Order 23 (2) on the social impact of the recent incident in Jaffna University. “This is not just another normal clash in a university. It occurred between two groups of students belonging to two different ethnic communities. It has severe political and social dangers. We can see the traits of racism behind it, and society must condemn it collectively,” he said. The MP pointed out this incident acts as a provocation to other racist groups. “We have the horendous experience of the protracted war in this country. We still don’t know exactly how much were killed and disappeared during that war. It was a great setback to our country. Therefore, we should nip these kind of attempts in the bud. This incident cannot be suppressed by taking disciplinary or legal action,” he said.
The MP queried about the progress of the investigations and the Government’s plans to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.
