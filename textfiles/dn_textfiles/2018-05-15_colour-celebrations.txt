Colour celebrations

The Elizabeth Moir Junior School Art Exhibition 'A Thousand Shades of Colour’ was held on May 3 and 4 at the Barefoot Gallery. The exhibition focused on various styles and techniques from origami to painting on canvas, and weaving. Students between the ages of 2 1/2 years and 10 1/2 years created the artwork on display.
