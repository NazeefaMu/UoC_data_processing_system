“As an industry that changes with the seasons, adaptability through innovation is crucial for our nation to increase profitability in a manner that is harmonious with the needs of all stakeholders. We are always cognizant of the vital role that Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector has played in our past, and its enduring potential to serve as an engine of prosperity for the nation in the future. In this regard, we are deeply honoured to be presented with two Gold awards at the NBEA and remain committed to our continuing role as an engine of innovation in the agri-sector,” Hayleys Agriculture Holdings Limited Managing Director Rizvi Zaheed stated.
