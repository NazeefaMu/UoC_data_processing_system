State officers should be trained to formulate RTI Act: TISL

Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) Executive Director Ashoka Ubeysekara said state should appoint and train officers to formulate Right to Information (RTI) Act and educate citizens about their right to information and how they can make use of it.
Speaking at a press conference at the Organization of Professional Association (OPA) auditorium yesterday, Ubeysekara said that the TISL along with the Sarvodya Movement will contribute towards implementing the Act.
TISL Right to Information Manager Sangeetha Gunaratne said a project was to be implemented yesterday and a bus would travel island-wide starting from Colombo Fort educating citizens about the RTI Act in Sinhala, English and Tamil.
She said centres would be established in the Colombo, Matara, Anuradhapura, Trincomalee, and Ratnapura Districts with Sarvodaya to assist public in understanding the RTI Act.
“Public officers still do not know enough about the RTI Act or its implementation procedure. We understood it when we visited public authorities on Friday. Therefore, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry needs to train public officers to practise it, she said.
Sarvodya-Deshodaya National Organiser Nishantha Preethiraj participated.
