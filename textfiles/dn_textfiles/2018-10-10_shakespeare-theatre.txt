SHAKESPEARE IN THEATRE

The cultural diversity and the confusion that was evidently felt, needed to be interpreted on stage and removed from roadside shows as was during his time. Where and how to start becoming the major issue. It was revelatory. In today's point of view, theatre is like a monarch of a toppled regime. It was involved in attempts to resolve a paradox and be faithful to Shakespeare plays and this process was central. Traditions continued to dominate but the plays' limitations became excessively a problem for lack of permanent settings to board the plays.
As actors trudged the countryside playing in the open and marketplaces until James Burbage changed the scenario. He secured a permanent patent for a London company and built an outdoor theatre in 1576 and called it the theatre of the day where later the Lord Chamberlain's Men who were Shakespeare's company would eventually perform. The theatre was not free but was subject to opposition by those who resented the Bard. However, with permanent players, the idea caught on. Theatres like The Curtain, The Swan, The Fortune, The Rose became popular.
And Shakespeare was on the rise.
SOCIAL STRUCTURE
From beautiful open-air shows to today's magnificent theatre
Later, they were to face problems with the fast developing professional companies but with the traditional social structure, theatre-going had developed into a craze by the end of the century, protected by the great and watched by Queen Elizabeth.
There was no stopping Shakespeare.
So, James Burbage built the Theatre to the north of the city and by 1594 The Lord Chamberlain's Men including Shakespeare were residents in this theatre. The Globe was on the north and The Rose on the south bank of the River Thames which was a part of Surrey. There was also the Blackfriars that had been a monastery outside the city authority. Their functions were different but with a single determine goal; to popularize Shakespeare plays. The ideas and ideals flourished when one by one as a dedication to Shakespeare blossomed, from a small theatre to another, they became the celebration to future generations. We see the magnificent Royal Shakespeare Theater a testimony to the greatest poet that ever lived. Like his humble beginning, the theatre too fought its way simultaneously to preserve English that was to make a world of difference from the classroom to the academics of high calibre. The literary scene buzzed and buzzed and still buzz with new vocabulary, unprecedented dialogue and Shakespearean English, and there was the theatre 'live' to the audiences not only in England but around the world, from generation to generation, from century to century and presently in the millennium.
THE GLOBE
People felt a new experience because the theatre favoured two things above all others; actors and spoken word. It was difficult for actors to establish a sense of place as the play required as there were no sets. Girls had to play boys in the plays and the backup music was hard to get emotions and feelings were lost as most of the time actors had to raise their voices from marketplaces or roadside, but people were there to display growing appreciation. The actor's power required the active co-operation of the audience. The audience played along; such was their admiration. The indoor hall-type theatres were boring and admission charges were so low, there was a recess but not before the Burbage brothers made a unique deal for the short capital in 1599 with leading sharers of the actor's company. There were five and one was Shakespeare and the GLOBE built. The new deal secured for Lord Chamberlain's Men stability and self-determination. In 1603, Lord Chamberlain's Men came to be known as King's Men and remained intact until 1642. This Shakespeare and his plays established going from strength to strength.
SHAKESPEARE IN THE MID-THEATRE
Somehow everything did not go well by 1642 when those opposed to the theatre, it closed down. When they reopened in 1660 they were different from those whom Shakespeare had known. Blackfriars with the TEMPEST reflecting its different resources, but his company still played at the Globe. Unfortunately, the open-air theatres did not survive into the 17th century. From 1660 Shakespeare's plays had to be adapted to suit and accommodate different kind of theatres as well as to different genres. In the 17th century, Shakespeare's plays gave the impression of being embraced without knowing why. Critics and scholars were on to neo-classical literature theory which of course, Shakespeare gleefully flouted upon. Shakespeare demonstrated flouts which at times let him be an exception to neo-classical doctrine but at other times, reworked him to fit their taste. Shakespeare had the capacity to evolve around the unsung and unpolished mess left behind by his critics who by now had faded out of the scene.
But the order had not changed because the Restoration actor still enjoyed something of his Elizabethan predecessors' intimacy with the audience. Most important at that time, 'he' was also now a she. Gone were the days that boys acted in girls' roles. It was Margaret Hughes who initiated the profession of actress-playing by acting as Desdemona in 1660.
Still, everything was not clear for the stage as it was hugely expensive to create new sets of scenery and players often used what was available as props. The tradition continued to dominate the acting of Shakespeare plays and actors were faced with the limitation on time and cultural conservatism of the 18th century.
In 1700-79, Charles Macklin scored a massive hit as Shylock when he first played the role in 1741. Followed by David Garrick in 1717-79 who played Richard III in a London debut from an adaptation by Colley Cibber and later as a redefined Shylock and there still was no assumption that performance needed to be organized. One role after another when mounted on a stage enhanced the importance of Shakespeare dialogue. People enjoyed a collective identity and plays became extremely popular as part of London life.
STRATFORD-UPON-AVON
This bring us to Daniel Baker, the puritan High Bailiff of Stratford who banned players from the town in Shakespeare's lifetime and for over a century after his death, there were few performances in Stratford until 1746 when a touring company led by John Ward who was the grandfather of John Phillip Kemble and Sarah Siddons, presented OTHELLO in the Old town hall. Slowly and steadily the plays emerged on and off until David Garrick mounted a Shakespeare 'Jubilee'. The still flourishing Shakespeare Club was founded in 1824 and in 1827, a small theatre open in 1827 in the Chapel lane only to be put down in the following year.
In March 1926 a mysterious fire destroyed the old building with only the library and picture gallery left. Generous donations from America made possible the building of the present Shakespeare Memorial Association and was opened by the Prince of Wales on Shakespeare's birthday April 23.
