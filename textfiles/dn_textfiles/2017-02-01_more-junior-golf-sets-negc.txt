Golf recognized as the fastest growing sport in the world, is long considered a 'rich man’s' sport in Sri Lanka but now the doors are being opened by the Sri Lanka Golf Union with the blessings of the Ministry of Education to introduce golf to schools island-wide without limit.
R&A (Royal & Ancient) the International governing body over the local governing body of golf, assists the SLGU with junior golf sets and other equipment to develop the game at school level.
The NEGC, which boasts of the oldest golf course in Sri Lanka, has over the years, promoted golf among schools in Nuwara Eliya and is currently actively training a pool of over 30 Juniors.
NEGC has produced top golfers and among them K. Prabagaran is a former National Champion and subsequently turned Professional. Prabagaran won the Sri Lanka Open twice and is very successful on the PGTI – Professional Golf Tour of India.
Captain of NEGC intends to increase the numbers of the Juniors now playing by reaching out to more Schools and the continuous support from R&A with equipment, can help the SLGU realize the vision of producing world class golfers from Sri Lanka in the vision of 2020+.
