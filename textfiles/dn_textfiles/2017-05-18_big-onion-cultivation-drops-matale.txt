Big onion cultivation drops in Matale

Big onion cultivation in the Matale district has decreased by nearly 90 percent this season, District Agriculture Deputy Director Kusum Seneviratne said.
She said preparation of plant nurseries should have been completed by this time. But they had recorded a sharp decrease and only 10 percent nurseries had been completed in comparison to the previous years.
The main reasons for the reduction of big onion cultivation are the dry weather conditions, limited water from the Mahaweli reservoirs and rapid increase in production costs.
