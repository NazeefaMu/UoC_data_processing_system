Serenia Residences construction on schedule, completion by December 2019

 With completion as promised on track by December 2019, Serenia Residences is making quick progress each day.
After a mere 7 weeks since the ground breaking, a lot has been achieved on the construction front.
The next important mile stones is the completion of the Ground floor slab for both towers by December 2018, while the superstructure is due for completion in May 2019.
K A.C.P Bandara, General Manager, Access Projects said, “At the moment the project is progressing well ahead of schedule. Both the buildings have been prepared for the foundation raft concrete and we will be casting the ground floor by mid December 2018. As all logistic arrangements are based in Colombo, this facilitates better planning and controlling. Our project team is pretty confident of the completion of the structure on time with the help of all parties involved.”

Once completed by the end of the next year, Serenia Residences will consist of 47 serviced residences located on the “Million Dollar Golden Mile” in Talpe, only 8km from the Galle Fort. Designed by a-designstudio, Serenia will feature a 6000-sq-ft pool overlooking 100 meters of a semi-private beach. Shared amenities will include a kids club, a pool deck with private cabanas, BBQ facilities, gym, indoor and outdoor yoga studios, a meditation garden and a parking building with car wash facilities.
Buyers are 65% foreigners who strongly believe in Sri Lanka’s south coast as they confidently add Serenia Residences to their investment portfolios.
