Bowled over - a life with poems

After being visibly moved by dance adaptations of four of her poems, Dr. Nelson delivered the following keynote to the packed audience in attendance, which included several hundred students from the Norman middle schools.
The title of my meditation on my life as a poet makes reference to three things: First, the words “bowled over” describe my immediate response to the news I received last year that I was to receive the NSK Neustadt Prize. Of course, all writers dream of having their work rewarded—an embarrassingly large proportion of most writers’ daily thought menu is devoted entirely to envy:
Why did one’s friend X’s new book win the X-Prime award, while one’s own book lies, with several thousand other books published in the same year, in the dustbin of literary history, waiting to be pulped? In my opinion, one of the wisest things writing guru Anne Lamott says in her by now already classic book of suggestions for writers, Bird by Bird, is that all writers experience envy. Accepting that reality with humility, hoping for but in no way expecting awards, I couldn’t help being absolutely bowled over by the NSK Prize news. I’ve been pinching myself all year! How can I be so lucky?
Since I am a poet and express myself best in the words I struggle to shape, I’d like to let a poem speak that sense of being bowled over by the blessings of good luck. The poem is from my book Carver: A Life in Poems, which is a biography of the great African American scientist/saint, Professor George Washington Carver. The speaker in the poem is the young Carver, at this time a twenty-nine-year-old orphan, a former slave with no living relatives, who has struggled to get an education and is at a point in his life when it seems likely that his genius will come to full flower as a painter: his painting Yucca and Cactus had won a prize at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair.
King Midas
Before I read the poem, l want to make sure you know that the phrase “sustained by dew” is an allusion to the book of Exodus, when the Israelites in the desert had nothing to drink but dew, and nothing to eat but the miraculous manna, bread out of thin air. I know you’ll recognize the allusion to King Midas, blessed and cursed with a magic power that made everything he touched turn to gold.
What I had in mind when I wrote the word “exponentially” was an illustration I saw years ago in a Disney film about atomic fission: in a room whose floor is covered with mousetraps, each set with two ping-pong balls on it. On it, one ping-pong ball tossed into the room sets off a chain reaction: within a few seconds every mousetrap has snapped, every ping-pong ball is in the air (you can see this on YouTube). This is what “exponentially multiplying” means.
In my poem, in spite of the many disadvantages with which he has had to struggle—his mother was stolen and never found again; he and his brother were raised by the white couple who had bought and owned their mother; he has had to struggle to find schools willing to educate him; he faced racism, poverty, loneliness, etc.—in spite of all those barriers and burdens, Carver feels bowled over by his good luck, his sense that he’s living a “charmed life.”
And he is so grateful for the many blessings he has received that he feels he must dedicate his life to a higher cause.
That’s a long introduction to a short poem, but I hope knowing these things will enhance your experience of the poem.
A Charmed Life
Here breathes a solitary pilgrim sustained by dew and the kindness of strangers. An astonished Midas surrounded by exponentially multiplying miracles: my
Yucca and Cactus in the Chicago World exposition;
friends of the spirit; teachers. Ah, the bleak horizons of joy.
Light every morning dawns through the trees. Surely this is worth more than one life.
That’s what I mean when I say I’m “bowled over.” The rest of the title of what I want to say here also refers to my Carver book. But, while the book about Carver uses poems to tell his life, what I’d like to discuss here is how my life has been “a life of poems.” A poet moves from word to word, line to line, poem to poem, and (if the poet is lucky) from book to book, as the poet grows and his or her gift blossoms. My own love of poetry began in childhood, with a two-volume Childcraft anthology of poems selected and illustrated for children, Poems of Early Childhood and Storytelling and Other Poems.
Here I discovered poems by master poets like Robert Browning, Lewis Carroll, Countee Cullen, Emily Dickinson, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Christina Rossetti, Carl Sandburg, William Shakespeare, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Alfred Lord Tennyson. I spent countless afternoons swimming through the words and pictures in those pages, lost in their alternate universes. I can still close my eyes and savor the first lines of John Masefield’s “Sea Fever” or Longfellow’s “Hiawatha’s Childhood,” or Alfred Noyes’s “The Highwayman.”
My life of enjoying poems began with Childcraft. When I was about twelve, I graduated to a poetry anthology my father had kept from his college days.
I read its poems over and over and began to feel something new: beyond the pleasure of enjoying poems, I was starting to sprout the ambition to write my own poems, to be a poet when I grew up.
Way back in the olden days, schoolchildren were not encouraged or expected to write poems. We might read them in class, and the teacher told us what they “meant.”
I’m a few years older than most of you are, and when I was a child, way back in the . . . (I’m suddenly reminded of a time in the car with my family, when my mother was starting to tell us a story about something she remembered from her childhood. She began, “When I was in third grade, I . . .” My younger sister exclaimed, “WHAT? You went to school!?!? Our teacher said girls didn’t go to school back in the olden days!!”) . . . way back in the olden days, schoolchildren were not encouraged or expected to write poems.
We might read them in class, and the teacher told us what they “meant.” Occasionally we were made to memorize and recite them to class. Although I remember that my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Gray in Kittery Point, Maine, predicted that I would someday be known as a poet for young readers, and that she was the one who first made me understand the concept of poetic meter, I don’t remember being asked to write poems in her class.
