Severed head found following double-homicide

Two persons of the ages 27 and 38 had been shot and hacked to death on Sunday, around 8.00 pm, at a boutique in Ranthotuvila, Uragasmanhandiya.
The severed head of one of the victims had been discovered by the side of a road, 100 metres away from the boutique.
The deceased were identified as 38-year-old Kumarage Chamila Deepal Ranasinghe and 27-year-old Thushaya Hewage Saman Suresh of Ranthotavila. The severed head was Suresh’s.
They were said to be former navy and army personnel. Police suspect a longstanding grudge to be the motive. It was revealed that two people, Mahakumarage Ushan Randika and Suranga Suresh, had previously been shot dead following a clash. Thereafter, a businessman called I.D. Sarath Kumara who was suspected to have supplied the firearm for the murder, had also been murdered. Saman Suresh had then been arrested in connection with his murder, but was later bailed out. Acting Elpitiya Magistrate Duminda Lelwala held the magisterial inquiry and instructed police to hand over the bodies to the Judicial Medical Officer at the Elpitiya Base Hospital.
Uragasmanhandiya Police said that no arrest had been made. Investigations are continuing.
