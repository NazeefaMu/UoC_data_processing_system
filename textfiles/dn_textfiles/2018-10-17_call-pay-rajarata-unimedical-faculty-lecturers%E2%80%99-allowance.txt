Call to pay Rajarata Uni.Medical Faculty lecturers’ allowance

The State Medical Students Parents Union demands the Government to pay the due allowance to the Medical Faculty lecturers attached to the Rajarata University,Media Spokesman of the union Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the Rajarata University Medical Faculty faces closure. This is a huge injustice for state medical students who passed the G.C.E.Advanced Level Examination in the Science Stream with flying colours and are studying in order to become MBBS doctors.
According to Alwis, the Dean and all the lecturers of the Rajarata University Medical Faculty resigned because of non payment of the due allowance. This may be a ploy to promote private medical education.
“The medical students just re-commenced their education after eight months wasted on preventing the illegal and fraudulent SAITM coming into operation.Now there is no issue at all to pay the due allowance for lecturers. The relevant authorities should make arrangements to pay it and enable state medical students to study without further delay,” he added.
