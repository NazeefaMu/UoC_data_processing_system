Tragedy off Dondra:
Rs one mn compensation for each family of dead fishermen

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed Ministry Secretary Jagath P Wijeweera to distribute Rs one million as compensation for each of the families of the fishermen who died after their vessel collided with a ship in the seas off Dondra on Tuesday (9).
The Ministry has already decided to pay a monthly allowance for these families and award scholarships for the education of the children, Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, these families will receive another one million rupees if they have been insured under Ceylinco General Insurance Plc.
The Ministry had also taken measures to distribute Rs one million as compensation for the families of fishermen affected by the adverse weather conditions which prevailed in the country at the end of November 2017.
Around 49,848 fishermen have already been insured under the fishermen insurance scheme.
