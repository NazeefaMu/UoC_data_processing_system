Workshop for schoolchildren on bribery and corruption

A countrywide programme of workshops targeting schoolchildren has been launched by the Bribery and Corruption Commission as a long-term programme to completely eradicate bribery and corruption from the country.
Arresting people involved in bribery and corruption and taking legal action against them would not help eradicate this social problem unless people are trained to eschew bribery and corruption from childhood, Bribery and Corruption Commissioner Neville Guruge said.
As such, the countrywide workshop programme had been launched targeting children from their school days.
The first two workshops under this programme were held at Thalawa and Kebethigollewa under the theme ‘Supiripana Wedamuluwa’, he said.
