Navy assists to bring ill fisherman ashore

Based on information provided by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department, the Navy rendered assistance to bring a critically ill fisherman ashore for immediate treatment on January 25.
The fisherman who went fishing from the Trincomalee harbour on January 12, aboard the multiday fishing trawler Minos Putha, had taken seriously ill due to high fever out at sea.
Upon receipt of information, the Navy promptly dispatched the Fast Attack Craft P 4446 to the sea area about 100 nautical miles off Trincomalee harbour. Having reached the location, the patient was safely transferred to the naval craft and brought to the Trincomalee harbour.
Subsequently, he was rushed to the Trincomalee District Hospital for further treatment.
