GMOA to invoke RTI on Health Ministry Secretary

Says SAITM cannot award medical degrees:
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) said it will reveal to the country about the inability of SAITM to award MBBS degrees, GMOA Deputy Secretary Dr. Navin de Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters yesterday he said the truth about SAITM's degree awarding status will be revealed to the country shortly through the Higher Education Ministry Secretary under the Right to Information Act of 2016.
Legal action will be taken against him if he does not provide information requested by the GMOA on illegal and contradictory gazettes issued, he said.
According to Dr. Zoysa, SAITM does not have legal authority to award MBBS degrees and it will be legally proved shortly. A committee has been appointed to solve the SAITM issue with the participation of SAITM students, their parents and all the other relevant parties. Once the problem solved, only the Health Minister will stand by the SAITM demanding its existence.
If the Government pressurises the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register SAITM students as doctors, all the doctors will withdraw their registration from the SLMC making the SLMC an invalid, useless and 'dead' body. The GMOA urged the President and Prime Minister to intervene and solve the SAITM issue without giving in to pressure put on them by Health Minister.
