Cabinet nod to obtain electricity from private sources

Cabinet approval has been granted for the paper submitted by Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya requesting for Rs. 2.5 billion to purchase supplementary electricity from private power generating sources, Co- Cabinet Spokesman Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said. He was responding to a question posed by a journalist at the weekly Cabinet media briefing held at the Government Information Department, yesterday.
“Currently, there is no need to purchase supplementary electricity from the private sector. The Minister made this request considering the possibility of the continuation of the drought prevailing in the country,” said the Minister.
