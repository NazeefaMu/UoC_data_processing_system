ICC U19 Cricket World Cup
India move towards Super League

Left-arm spinner Anukul Roy finished with a superb haul of five for 14 as three-time champions India completed a facile 10-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea (PNG) for a second successive win at the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup that took them closer towards qualification for the Super League stage.
Roy’s haul followed a fine spell by opening bowlers Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti as PNG could only set a measly 65-run target in the Group B match played in front of broadcast cameras in Tauranga.
Captain Prithvi Shaw then knocked up a neat half-century as the target was achieved in only eight overs.
In the other match of the day, 17-year-old Shaheen Afridi produced the best bowling figures for his country in an ICC U19 Cricket World Cup as two-time former champions Pakistan bounced back in style after their five-wicket loss to Afghanistan with an easy nine-wicket victory over Ireland.
The tall left-arm fast bowler grabbed six for 15, the fifth best figures in the tournament to date, as Ireland were bowled out for 97 in 28.5 overs in a Group D match in Whangarei.
Pakistan got to the target in only 8.5 overs to brace up for their last match against Sri Lanka on Friday.
