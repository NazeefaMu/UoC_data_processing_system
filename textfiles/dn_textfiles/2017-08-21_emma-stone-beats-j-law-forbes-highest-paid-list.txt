Emma Stone beats J-Law in Forbes highest-paid list

 
Oscar-winner Emma Stone has been named by Forbes as the highest-paid actress of the year.
The 28-year-old star scored £20m in pre-tax earnings in the year up to June, beating Jennifer Lawrence off the top spot for the first time since 2015.
Stone has La La Land to thank for the boost, after the musical won her a best actress Oscar and made £345m worldwide.
She saw a 160% increase on her earnings in 2016, when she made £7.75m.
In July, Stone gave an interview to Out magazine revealing her male co-stars in past projects had to take pay cuts after being offered a larger salary, to close the pay gap.
"That's something they do for me because they feel it's what's right and fair," she said.
"If my male co-star, who has a higher quote then me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life."
Lawrence, who topped the list for two consecutive years, slid down to number three after Jennifer Aniston, who made £19m last year with comedies Mother's Day and Office Christmas Party.
J-Law's £18m fell short of her earnings in previous years, when she won the Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook and scored £35m.
This year, Forbes' top 10 actresses made a combined gross of £133m - 16% less than the same top 10 spots in 2016.
The actors' list, due to be published later in the week, is expected to show once again men banking far more than their female counterparts.
The issue of pay disparity grabbed headlines in 2014 after a leak of stolen emails from Sony showed that Lawrence was paid less than her male co-stars Christian Bale and Jeremy Renner in David O Russell's American Hustle.
Last year, Dwayne The Rock Johnson topped Forbes' list of highest-paid actors at £49m - more than double Stone's total this year.
Missing from the list was Scarlett Johansson, who failed to make more than the £8.9m cut off with Hail, Caesar! and Captain America: Civil War.
