All nature lovers are invited Sri Pada clean up project by Young Bilogists’ Association

Young Biologists’ Association Sri Lanka has organized a cleanup project of Sri Pada on March 3 and 4 for the 6th consecutive year. Since the Sripada is located in the peak wilderness sanctuary , first day of the visit will be a field trip along the Sri Palabaddala route. Organizers are planning to conduct field technique workshops and photography field work with the experts on the first day. Also it may take up to bird watching and identification in the peak wilderness sanctuary .
Once reaching the peak, next day the cleanup project will take along the Hatton Nallathanniya route, which is the busiest route of pilgrims to worship the peak. Main target of the project is educating and conduct awareness workshops for the pilgrims while cleaning the garbage from the sanctuary . As the Young Biologists are celebrating their 20th Anniversary this year, they would cordially invite all the nature lovers to take a part of this project to save sripada . For more information you can contact Young Biologists Association through their official facebook page..
