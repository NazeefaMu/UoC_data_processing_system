UNP says No Confidence in Wijeyadasa

The Working Committee of the United National Party and its Parliamentary Group yesterday unanimously adopted a resolution stating that they do not have confidence in the conduct of Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.
The resolution submitted by Parliamentarian Ashu Marasinghe and seconded by Parliamentarian Sydney Jayarathne comprised 5 points.
During deliberations which lasted for close to two hours at Sirikotha yesterday, Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is reported to have said that he did not make the statement to the effect that “ I will not look back without taking control of the Hambanthota port”.
Following the presenting of the resolution, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had asked those present if any member present opposed it. No member had opposed the resolution. The resolution containing five points said that, Minister Rajapakshe had failed in his duties as the Justice Minister, the Minister had failed to bring in new laws to tackle bribery and corruption as promised by the United National Front’s manifesto, that the Minister had failed to bring in laws which provide for criminally earned moneys to be given back to the agencies, that the Minister is being blamed for the prolonged delay in the hearing of criminal cases, and that the Minister conduct had brought the government and the United National Party into disrepute.
Minister Rajapakshe who was present during the deliberations had said that he had not made the purported statement to the newspaper. He was given time until August 21st to clarify his statement. Rajapaksa was asked to obtain the advice of Ministers Malik Samarawickrema, Mangala Samaraweera and Ravindra Samaraweera in this regard.
Responding to the delays in prosecution, Minister Rajapakshe had said that despite the assertions by parliamentarians, he could not interfere with the work of the Attorney General’s Department.
