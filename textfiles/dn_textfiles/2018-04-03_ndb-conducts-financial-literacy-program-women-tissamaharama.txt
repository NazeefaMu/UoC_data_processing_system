NDB conducts financial literacy program for women in Tissamaharama

NDB recently conducted a program to promote financial literacy to women in Tissamaharama as part of the Bank’s micro finance strategy as a joint initiative between Micro Finance and CSR in parallel to Women’s Day.
The program which mainly targeted female small scale business owners was done with the NDB Tissamaharama loyalty group members.
NDB realized the need to hone the skills of female business owners in terms of financial literacy. Therefore, the Bank conducted a workshop to further empower women especially in the rural areas by providing financial literacy and business skills training for lower income customer segments.
The workshop consisted of providing the participants with financial literacy and financial budgeting to help them better understand the functioning of the financial services offered by the Bank and to teach them successful strategies regarding the management and marketing of their business.
This project targeted women who were mainly involved in the fisheries sector, small businesses and agriculture.
As a responsible corporate citizen, NDB strives to make meaningful contributions to the society through its strategic sustainability initiatives that aim to inspire the sustainable growth of a progressive Sri Lanka.
Sustainability is a strategic priority at NDB and the Bank continuously endeavors to foster it across all its business decisions and activities.
NDB remains dedicated to bringing its customers one step closer to accomplishing their life long ambitions and uplifting their standards of living through the range of services that is accessible through its growing branch network.
