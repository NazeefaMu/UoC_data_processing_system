Foster creativity

Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation (LCYTF) or popularly known as Somalatha Subasinghe Play House commenced its session of “Creative Activities for Children” program on January 6.
Children from ages four to fourteen can take part in the program. The prime objective of the program is to develop child’s mental and physical aspects and to enhance artistic taste, cheerfulness and playful sense of the child through aesthetic experiences. Therefore, this program can be considered as an extracurricular learning that supplements the formal education the child obtains in school. The program gives the child the opportunity to learn the basics of enjoying and appreciating music, free movement, dance and rhythmic movement, acting and language, art, singing, puppetry and handwork.
The program is conducted by Kaushalya Fernando, Dr. Chandana Aluthge and Mayura Perera. The Late Somalatha Subasinghe founded Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation in 1981 to promote theatre productions and performances specifically for children and youth, training of actors, and research on theatre studies. This organisation presently is the top most institution for children’s and youth theatre productions in Sri Lanka. Since 1981 the organisation has produced a repertoire of mainly musical theatre for children and youth and mainstream art theatre productions and performed them in the island as well as abroad. This institution was incorporated in the parliament in January 2007 under the Act of Lanka Children’s and Youth Theatre Foundation, No. 3 of 2007 to further its quest for the young audiences in Sri Lanka.
This program is conducted on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. at Battramulla Lion’s Club Activity Centre situated in Jayanthipura main road.
