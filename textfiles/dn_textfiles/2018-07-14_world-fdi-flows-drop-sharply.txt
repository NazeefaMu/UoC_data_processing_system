World FDI flows drop sharply

In 2017 global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows fell sharply by 23 percent to US $ 1.43 trillion from 1.87 trillion in 2016.This significant drop was marked especially in developed and transitional economies with relative stability in the developing economies.
As a result the developing economies increased their share of the total global FDI to 47 percent in 2017 from 36 percent in 2016. Flows to developed countries fell by over one-third to US $ 172 billion. The drop in flows to the United States was 40 percent while the drop in flows to the UK was 92 percent.
Of the developing countries only flows to Africa declined. Flows to Asia remained stable and Latin America and the Caribbean region showed a modest 8 percent growth.
The United States remains the largest recipient of FDI with US $ 275 billion investment, followed by China with US $ 136 billion. Germany, France and Indonesia have also increased FDI inflows.
Developed countries also lead in FDI outflows. The United States, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany, Canada are among the countries from which most FDI flow out besides China which is the second largest supplier of FDI after the United States.
In the meantime the rate of return on FDI also declined during the last 5 years. In 2017 it fell by 6.7 percent. This affects the developing countries most as FDI amounts to 39percent of their incoming finance. The situation is worse in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) where FDI fell by 17 percent in 2017.
Today Asia is the largest recipient of FDI. In 2017 it received 33 percent of total FDI in contrast to 25 percent it received in 2016.
According to UNCTAD 65 countries have revised their investment policy measures. They have 93 new policies favouring liberalization and promotion of foreign investments.
NATO Summit achieves nothing new
The 29 nation summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which met in Brussels from July 11-12 ended with no significant new achievements. Instead it has been unable to agree on President Trump’s call for doubling the military expenses to 4 percent of the GDP of member countries.
However, President Trump insists that was a decision arrived at the summit. The joint communique signed by all leaders including President Trump said that members agreed to commit themselves to the earlier decision to increase military spending for NATO to 2 percent of the GDP by 2024. President Trump, on the other hand, insists that it should be done by January 2019, a deadline other leaders may not agree. In fact, leaders of France and Germany have already said so. President Trump has also hinted that in case his call to double military spending is not heeded the United Sates would consider withdrawing from the organisation.
This is in line with his election pledge of putting America First. However, it would need a two-thirds vote in the Congress which is unlikely given the opposition of the Democrats to the withdrawal.
President Trump says that the United States bears 90 percent of NATO military spending while Germany denies it. It says not all that expenditure is related to NATO and the actual NATO expenditure by the US is 67 percent of military costs of the Alliance.
In any case the leaders have agreed to increase military spending for NATO according to the previous decision and the target date. Thus the NATO remains a divided family as before despite a show of unity.
Theresa May’s Brexit worries
British Prime Minister Theresa May faced a mini-crisis when her Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit-Secretary David Davis quit the Government over disagreement with Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit Plan titled The Future Relationship Between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
According to the results of the Referendum held on June 23, 2016 a majority of voters – 51.9 percent opted to leave the European Union. Britain invoked Article 50 of the European Union to withdraw which gave it a two year period for negotiations which ends on March 29, 2018 with or without an agreement. A further transition period will be there till December 31, 2020 to finalize all procedures.
The EU Council will meet on October 18 to ratify the exit deal, failing which a fallout date of December 13 has been named for final ratification.
Prime Minister Theresa May is facing opposition from her own party in addition to the Labor party opposition. It is doubtful whether Parliament would approve the Prime Ministers Brexit deal.
Even if it is passed the final agreement approved by the EU would have to be approved by Parliament and it remains to be seen how the PS would vote for it. Theresa's Brexit worries are not going to be over soon.
