We will restore the ‘elephant’  in Trincomalee – Imran

Trincomalee District UNP MP Imran Maharoof said the ‘elephant’ will be restored to Trincomalee.
He was speaking at a public meeting on Tuesday at Kinniya.
“We will bury these minority parties in Trincomalee on February 11. We know they are going from house-to-house house promising jobs. Over the past two decades, most of them were in the provincial council. Yet they could not provide a brick for the people here. People still live in houses provided by the United Nations. So let us hand over the power of these councils to the UNP. We will show again the era of the United National Party that was found during my father’s day,” he said.
