INSEE Cement partners PIM  to develop business leaders

INSEE Cement partnered with Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), to successfully complete the Executive Leadership Development Program (ELDP) for 2017/18. INSEE Cement promotes a culture of learning within the organization through its learning and development arm INSEE Academy and implements best-in-class people development initiatives.
The objective of ELDP is to transform INSEE cement’s functional leaders into business leaders by moving them from mastery in their own individual functional areas to broader multi-dimensional roles. From over 40 self-driven middle managers who applied for the program, 24 were selected based on their individual development needs. After going through a challenging 8 months program, 23 participants successfully completed the program.
The ELDP course framework includes three types of skills that are essential for a successful management process namely, Technical, Human and Conceptual skills development.
The program is designed to go beyond a standard ‘class room’ learning experience in which participants used learning diaries, case study methods and a final project which was directly linked with specific organizational objectives.
Buwaneka Dushyantha - Health and Safety Engineer from Puttalam Cement Plant topped the batch, closely followed by Asha Dissanayake - Accountant (Treasury and Tax) Finance, who came second and Amila Batagalla - Mining Engineer, Puttalam Quarry Operation and Sahan Chamruk- Operations Engineer of INSEE Ecocycle who came third.
Organisation and Human Resources Director of INSEE Cement, Prasad Piyadigama, “ INSEE Cement has a strong learning culture; our employees feel valued and know that the company is investing in them.” He further said, “Apart from the knowledge and the skills that were acquired, the unique value of this program was the opportunity to apply the learning thereby adding value to themselves and the organisation”.
Buwaneka Dushyantha who came first in the batch of 2017/2018 was appreciative of the learning he gained from the ELDP.
“I am more inspired now, looking forward to contributing to the progress of INSEE Cement and its objective of strengthening the nation. The program used many innovative tools to make us deeply involved in the subject.
INSEE Academy made the learning truly valuable” he said.
