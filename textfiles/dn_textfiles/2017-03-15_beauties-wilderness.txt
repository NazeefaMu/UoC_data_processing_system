BEAUTIES OF WILDERNESS

According to Bible, the Lord then said to Noah: “Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation. Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate, and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth”.
The world at the very inception was filled with more the animals than people. The world was a thick green carpet with forests, rivers, mountain ranges and animals. Our great ancestors survived with the produce of the trees and catching their prey in different styles.
Wildlife plays a significant role in maintaining the ecological equilibrium of nature.
The presence of wildlife affects the character of its habitat by continually supporting the evolutionary adaptations of everything in its environment.
The animals’ colours, size, variety change from near the equator up to the Northern/Southern Pole. Thereby you find snow white coloured animals in the Northern Pole and near the equator dark coloured animals. Even from continent to continent the habits and appearances differ.
As the world population is increasing and introduction to the modern era of development and technology, most of the jungles have been destroyed to put up buildings and improvise difficulties for the wildlife.
In countries like South Africa, Rwanda, Namibia, Tanzania and Botswana have introduced wildlife safaris, for the people to watch and study their behavior. Even in Sri Lanka we have sanctuaries where wild beasts are allowed to gaze and move about freely.
