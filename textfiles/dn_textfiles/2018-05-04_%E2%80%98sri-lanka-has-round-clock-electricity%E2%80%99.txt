‘Sri Lanka has round the clock electricity’

The government is setting up solar panels in almost all public schools and Sri Lanka is the only country in the South Asian region that provides electricity round the clock while catering to the increasing demand, said Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday.
The Minister said since the country is using all possible water resources to generate hydro electricity, the country has to use solar power.
He made this observation during a ceremony held to grant solar panels to Siri Saman Vidyalaya, Kegalle. He said while India imposes a power cut of six hours and Pakistan imposes a 5.5 hours’ power cut, Sri Lanka has been able to provide electricity 24 hours. However, this would be expensive during the drought.
The Siri Saman Vidyalaya was granted solar panels worth of Rs. 1 million. The school would get the required power for its use while the balance electricity generated would be supplied to the national grid. The Ministry has so far provided solar panels to more than 1,000 schools and temples during the two years the government was in power. Minister Siyambalapitiya said he would take measures to turn each roof in the Kegalle district into power generators as a sign of gratitude to the people in the Kegalle district for electing him to Parliament for 18 years to represent them. He added that the panels would be a source of income. Those who don’t have the capital could get bank loans to set up solar panels, he added.
