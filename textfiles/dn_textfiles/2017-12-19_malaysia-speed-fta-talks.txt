Malaysia has invested US$ 3.1 billion in 47 projects in Sri Lanka and Malaysian entrepreneurs are looking into many sectors of potential investments, the Prime Minister said.
Premier Razak said bilateral trade had steadily grown in the last few years and during the first 10 months of this year, bilateral trade has reached US$680 million. However trade was heavily balanced in Malaysia’s favour.
