TAMBA VILLAS LAUNCH IDYLLIC ‘HOME AWAY  FROM HOME’ DEVELOPMENT IN TALPE

The Southern coast which in recent times has witnessed a flurry of development and related activities, will soon be home to an idyllic, luxurious, yet at the same time, a home away from home development; Tamba Villas.
“To build a home that is so exceptional that coming home either for a holiday, or to live there permanently would be the ultimate in paradise living! This is Eduard Hempel’s vision for his latest venture, Tamba Villas, which he expressed at an exclusive gathering held in Colombo at Tintagel, to appraise those present of his latest project. Eduard Hempel Director & Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas, a project in excess of US$ 15 million, went on to say , “we want to give each home owner an idyllic life in a beautiful, safe space with all the comforts of modern day living. Our collection of 37 Villas have been purpose-built for people who like to work, holiday or retire in one of the most beautiful areas of Galle, a place that affords them a 5-Star life-style; in short Tamba villas in Thalpe”. Tamba Estates Pvt Ltd, a Sri Lankan Limited company, owns 100% of the land that Tamba Villas. In Sri Lanka very specially for the launch of Tamba Villas were Architects to the project Darlene Smyth and Warren Liew from AD Lab Singapore, Anita Ricquier, Financier, Trust Singapore and Trevor Morgan, Director & Co-Project Principal for Tamba Villas. “Previously, foreigners could only buy Freehold from the 4th floor up, and consequently Sri Lankans were wary of buying the lower floors since they couldn’t sell them to foreigners, but this latest development now opens the doors wide for foreigners to invest in real estate in Sri Lanka,” said Hempel.
