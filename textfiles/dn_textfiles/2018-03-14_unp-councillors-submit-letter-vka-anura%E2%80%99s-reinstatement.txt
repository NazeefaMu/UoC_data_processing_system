UNP councillors submit letter for V.K.A. Anura’s reinstatement

A group of newly elected councillors of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) handed over a letter to Western Province Governor K.C Logeswaran requesting the rescinding of the decision to remove V.K.A. Anura from the position of Municipal Commissioner.
The letter signed by 31 UNP councillors was handed over to the Governor on Monday at the Governor’s Office. The UNP councillors have maintained that the service of V.K.A. Anura was essential to the CMC.
“You have removed V.K.A. Anura who provided an efficient and honest service as the CMC Commissioner since 2015, in a very unfair manner."
"You are well aware that he operated the CMC, the largest local government authority in the country, successfully for a period of one-and-a-half years even without a mayor and a sitting council."
"Therefore, we hope you will cancel his transfer paying heed to our request. If not, we will be forced to take stern political action against your decision,” the UNP councillors said in the letter.
