Pettah pavement hawkers will not be evicted: Faiszer

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha met with pavement hawkers in Pettah with a view to address the issues that they face.
Expressing his views, the minister said, “I have always championed the cause of the pavement hawkers and have always fought alongside them in winning their demands; this is not a United National Party (UNP) stronghold, but Faiszer Musthapha stronghold.
If there is any movement aimed at evicting pavement hawkers or creating any problems for them, I will be the first person to rise up on their behalf.”
The Minister added that he would take all necessary steps to raise their welfare standards, and would act to minimize any issues that may be raised by the Police. He further said in future, the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) would be run by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and he expects the people of Colombo to support him.
