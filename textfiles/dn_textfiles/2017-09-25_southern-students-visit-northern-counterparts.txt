A group of 60 students from the Southern Province together with their teachers and principals visited Jaffna last Friday to join hands with their Northern colleagues.
The visit was carried out under the student exchange initiative, 'Sahodara Pasal/Padasalai,' launched by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) in collaboration with the Provincial Education Departments

On Southern Province Chief Minister’s special invitation, 12 media personnel from Galle also took part in the tour. The ONUR introduced the novel programme to unite schoolchildren, understand and respect diversity and bring diverse communities in the country together.
Sixty students from the Southern Province and 39 students from the Northern Province of the two diverse ethnic, religious and linguistics backgrounds together with respective teachers, principals and education officials participated in the four-day residential students’ camp.
