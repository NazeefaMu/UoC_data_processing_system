SLC CEO gives  statement to CID

Sri Lanka Cricket Chief Executive Officer Ashley De Silva was among four senior officials of the institution summoned to the Criminal Investigation Department to record statements over an attempted fraud involving US$ 5.5 million.
CID officials recorded nine hour statement from Silva and others yesterday.
He had lodged a complaint with the FCID in connection with an attempt to transfer USD 5.5 million, connected to broadcasting rights of the England tour, to an offshore account.
The IGP later directed the CID to take over the investigations.
