Water Board in need of equipment
It was around 10.00 p.m. when I was walking down Jetawana Road on my way home to Layard’s Broadway, I noticed water oozing out from the payment which had been renovated recently by interlocking bricks. When I reached home, I called 1939 and made a complain regarding the above leak specifying the location. I received an acknowledgement instantaneously through SMS to my hand phone –
Your complaint submitted to the relevant officer for action. Please call 0777 708410 for any inquiry, quote ref. no. 490523. Thank you! NWSDB
The exact location of the leak is on the pavement adjoining the showroom marketing electrical items belonging to an upmarket vehicle importing prestigious Company (Diesel & Motor Engineering Company Ltd.) which is opposite the Isurudisi building and the Jetawana Temple.
The following day after the early morning prayer at Al Ma’hadul Bukhariyul Kadirie Thakiya mosque 178, Layard’s Broadway, Colombo 14, I was surprised to see water leaking through the pavement very close to the entrance to the above mosque. When I enquired from the caretaker of the mosque, he told me that in response to his complain, the Water Board workers had visited the place but have left without attending to the necessary repairs and the excuse was that they do not have the required equipments!
It is ironical when Water Day is being celebrated, the above leaks have not been attended to as at today.
To keep water leaking without attending to it - is this the Water Board’s way to mark Water Day 2017?
