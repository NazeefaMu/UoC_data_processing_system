NWSDB pumping station near Walawe Ganga polluted

The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) pumping station near the Walawe Ganga, remains polluted, posing a threat to the hundreds of thousands of water consumers in Hambantota and Ambalantota, residents said. Remnants of slaughtered cattle and poultry, garbage, and refuse, have clogged this pumping station, they added.
When questioned on the matter, officials attached to the NWSDB Office at Ambalantota said those who live on either side of the Walawe Ganga throw the above mentioned pollutants.
They said these pollutants get clogged at the salinity barrier of the pumping station and added that they would take every precaution to provide clean water to consumers.
