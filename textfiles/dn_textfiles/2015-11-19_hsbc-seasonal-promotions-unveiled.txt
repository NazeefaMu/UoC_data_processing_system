HSBC seasonal promotions unveiled

HSBC unveils an array of amazing savings this season. With an extensive range of categories offering up to 50% savings throughout the season, every moment becomes a reason for celebration for HSBC cardholders.
These savings start from early November and end on December 31.
If you are on the lookout for electronic appliances and hope to upgrade yours, check out the wide selection of brands and special offers available exclusively for HSBC credit card holders at all Singer and Singer Mega outlets.
"For our customers, the season is all about special moments; moments that they look forward to no matter what. We fully understand this and that's why, apart from offering sensational savings at popular partner merchants highly patronized during the season, we are delighted to launch a unique Christmas zone at the Arcade Independence Square starting December fourth for all our customers.
This no doubt will enhance their enjoyment of special moments of the season with friends, family and loved ones," said Nilantha Bastian, Head of Retail Banking and Wealth Management.
Look forward to an unforgettable season full of special moments this year with HSBC.
