Kandy SC continue unbeaten  run with win over CH

Kandy Sports Club cashed on home advantage to post another win in the first round of the Dialog league rugby match by beating CH & FC by 38 points to 22 at Nittawela grounds yesterday.
Kandy SC came from deep, with stand-off Arshad Jamaldeen breaking out of defence on many occasions to set up counter attacks before sending his team mates for two tries to keep his side in contention.
Physically the intensity for Kandy was there from start to finish, they were technically good, CH & FC didn’t help themselves kicking away possession when they didn’t really need to. They needed to make Kandy tackle and they didn’t do that often enough.
After the turn over possession in the game was more for the winners, they expended a lot of energy tackling.
Kandy made CH & FC to work for everything it got, but the gap between a rugby powerhouse Kandy and CH was quite evident.
Kandy put pressure on them in all departments, at set phase, breakdown and in defence — mid way of the game, even with the kicking there was hardly a contest. Kandy’s attacking master-class helped them to score six tries.
They weathered a strong beginning by handling the ball well and began to feast on CH & FC’s errors to find holes in a porous defense.
All hopes of CH & FC had to upset the table leaders was buried due to some good thinking coming from the fly half and the lineout jumpers of Kandy.
The scorers for Kandy SC were tries from Danush Dayan, Richard Dharmapala, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Danushka Ranjan, Arshad Jamaldeen and Sashik Jayawardene. The goal kicking was done by Thilina Wijesinghe.
For CH & FC the tries came from Prasad Madushanka two, Sudam Sooriyarchchi one and the goal kicking from Samuel Maduwantha.
