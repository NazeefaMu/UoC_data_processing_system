LAUGFS, Ministry of Education partner to strengthen mathematical knowledge of O/L students

In a bid to help strengthen mathematical knowledge among students, LAUGFS Holdings has partnered with the Mathematics branch of the Ministry of Education to facilitate a series of Math Camps conducted using Advanced Learning Techniques developed by the Ministry. The ‘Nana Maga Math Camps’ will assist over 3,000 students sitting for their G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) Examination in the years 2017 and 2018.
“Enhancing mathematics knowledge is critical for a student’s higher studies and career prospects. Our efforts to strengthen maths within the school curriculum is driven by a long term aim to strengthen our country’s human resources with the necessary aptitudes and skills. This is critical to secure the future of our nation,” explained Sunil Hettiarachchi, Secretary to the Ministry of Education.

“We need the support of corporates, media and all others to reinforce this message with renewed interest in this important subject. We are extremely pleased to have the support of a large corporate like LAUGFS to take this endeavour forward.”
The Nana Maga Maths Camps are conducted for G.C.E. (O/L) students with a specially designed Accelerated Teaching Methodology developed by the Ministry of Education’s Mathematics Branch.
The project will be rolled out in the Southern Province during 2017/18, and is expected to be expanded across the country in different phases.
“As a truly Sri Lankan conglomerate, we have a strong focus on nurturing future leaders of our country. The LAUGFS Nana Maga program was set up with this vision in mind,” remarked LAUGFS Holdings Chairman, W.K.H. Wegapitiya.
“The Nana Maga Math Camps project is one such initiative under this, where we have collaborated with the Ministry of Education’s Mathematics Branch, whose work is truly commendable in continuously elevating and enriching mathematics knowledge and understanding among students.”
The project launch took place at the Sariputhra Maha Vidyalaya in Galle recently, with the presence of LAUGFS Holdings and the Ministry of Education. During the event, over 3,000 academic textbooks were also handed over to the Ministry of Education by LAUGFS Holdings.
“We partnered with the Ministry of Education to roll out this unique program for children across the island with a firm resolve to help make quality education more accessible and engaging for all,” commented LAUGFS Holdings Managing Director Thilak De Silva.
“As a conglomerate, we employ talent from a diverse range of professions. These range from the engineers at LAUGFS Engineering, to scientists at our R&D facilities of LAUGFS Lubricants. Maths is a critical subject for many professions today, whether it is finance, IT, engineering, auditing, quality control or procurement. Therefore, we felt the need to play an active role to help create awareness of the importance of mathematics to build a successful career, which needs to start from the classroom.”
“These interactive maths camps have been designed by using newly developed advanced learning methodologies with the aim of increasing student interest and understanding of mathematical concepts. They are also aided with activity-based learning techniques to better engage students and to make learning maths an enjoyable experience,” explained Priyatha Nanayakkara, Director of Education (Mathematics Division) at the Ministry of Education.
“With the support of LAUGFS, we are now able to reach out to a large number of deserving students across the country,” she further elaborated.
A solid foundation in mathematics is important to enhance essential skills such as problem solving and analytical thinking. The unique and advanced methodologies used to introduce mathematical concepts at the LAUGFS Nana Maga Maths Camps will significantly support students with the proper guidance and tools to develop mathematical skills in a supportive and enjoyable environment.
