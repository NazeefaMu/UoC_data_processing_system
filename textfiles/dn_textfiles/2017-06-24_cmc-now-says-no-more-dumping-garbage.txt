CMC now says no more dumping of garbage

Meethotamulla tragedy :
Supreme Court refused interim order in Nov ‘15:
FR was filed calling for immediate stop:
40 death certificates presented to court:
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) for the first time since the Fundamental Rights petition was filed in November 2015 calling for the immediate stopping of the dumping of garbage, informed the Supreme Court that it has ceased dumping garbage in the area. The Fundamental Rights petition filed by residents of Meethotamulla was filed in November 2015.
The Petition asked the court for an interim order prohibiting the dumping of garbage. However, the interim order was rejected although leave to proceed with the application was granted.
During the successive court dates, the Colombo Municipal Council presented proposals and reports on alternatives. The Supreme Courts continued to grant dates.
The garbage dump collapsed on April 14, killing 40 people and displacing hundreds.
The counsel who appeared for the petitioners tendered in court 40 death certificates pertaining to the persons who died owing to the tragedy.
This petition was filed by seven residents of the Meetotamulla area citing Colombo Municipal Council, Urban development authority, Western province waste management authority, Central Environment Authority, Kolonnawa municipal council and the Attorney General as Respondents.
In the petition filed around 15 months before the tragedy, the petitioners proposed means of disposing the garbage among others.
The petitioners sought a declaration from Court that the proposed expansion of the said dumping site is an imminent infringement of their Fundamental Rights.
The Petitioner states Kolonnawa city is a highly residential area, with high population density and laments in the middle of this highly residential area is a huge and growing garbage dumping site, with a huge mountain of garbage, which has now grown to over 18 acres in extent.
They state the garbage from the Colombo Municipal limits is brought and dumped into this mountain of garbage and that approximately 750 to 1,200 tons of garbage come into the site on a daily basis.
They allege the stench was becoming unbearable for the families and children and that there is a tremendous and serious health hazard, with around 30 people of the area having died due to germs and dengue, rat flu, skin deceases, kidney diseases. Hundreds of other families are affected and the affected numbers are growing daily.
They maintained there are other sustainable solutions (other than the dumping of garbage in the aforesaid manner), which could bring an end to this problem, but that these measures are not being taken by the Respondents.
They allege the Respondents are taking immediate measures to demolish another 100 houses to expand the site for a further 3 acres.
They stated that if the proposed expansion takes place there will be serious, immeasurable, irreparable and disastrous ramifications. They stated there are persons and companies who are interested in purchasing the garbage (for money) and who will recycle the said garbage at their own expense in an environmentally friendly manner.
