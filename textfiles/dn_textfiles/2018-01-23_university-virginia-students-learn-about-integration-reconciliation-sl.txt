University of Virginia students learn  about integration, reconciliation in SL

 University of Virginia’s MBA students recently participated in a knowledge sharing programme with the Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation about reconciliation projects and programmes initiated by the government of Sri Lanka.
About 20 MBA students headed by Professor Marc Modica participated in the programme at the Ministry.
The students studied the innovative interventions such as the integration-friendly school programme, peace journalism and the integration-friendly media programme, the inter-religious district reconciliation committee to address ethnic and religious tensions, National Integration Week, the reconciliation declaration, seven core virtues on reconciliation and the reconciliation-focused economic empowerment programme initiated by the Government of Sri Lanka.
The session also addressed the challenges in reconciliation. The participants were interested on interventions that addressed regional disparities.
The briefing was also centered on the importance of results-based management and development evaluations as part of the learning exercise.
Ministry officials including V. Sivagnanasothy, Secretary, Somasiri Ekanayake, Deputy Director and Vaidehi Anushyanthan, Assistant Director, Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, participated.
