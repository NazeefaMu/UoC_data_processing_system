Burning birds among starving brutes

Sanjeewa Pushpakumara has directed several short films and two feature films. Flying fish (Igilena Maluwo) and Burning Birds (Davena Vihagun) show his talent in feature film-making, and his films have brought him many acclaims at international film festivals.
Davena Vihagun is simple. Its cinematography has no difficult techniques and the story is told in a linear flow. Like a folk story, it starts from the very beginning and flows towards the end without intermediating flashbacks and other difficult-to-understand cinematic strategies.
The story begins against the background of Sri Lanka’s most terrorized JVP riot era and its immediate aftermath. Kusum (Anoma Jinadari), a mother of eight children, lives in a remote area of Sri Lanka with her husband - a fish seller (Sanjeewa Dissanayake). Their poor family was shattered when the husband was taken into custody and brutally killed, in suspicion that he was an ex-JVP member, by a few members of the security forces who came in a white van.
Abattoir Vs brothel
Isolated along with eight children, many of them are girls, Kusum, braces the burden of looking after her children and mother-in-law (Leonie Kotalawala). Not finding suitable employment, she worked at a quarry and then at an abattoir before joining a brothel. She was exploited, humiliated, raped and jailed as the story flows to its end. Finally, not finding any solace in society, she killed the principal who helped army personnel kill her husband by bowing his (principal’s) head towards the fish seller thus marking her husband as a JVPer. Thereafter, she set fire to her house and merged with its flames as the film concludes with an iambic cord.
Burning Birds terrorizes us with brutalities of the JVP riot era and of its aftermath. The film tells us societal inhumanity and commercializing of womanhood. Set on a barren land in a shanty shelter, the film rarely pushes our attention towards other aspects which are essential to flow the film’s realism uninterrupted. As shadows reflected by the kerosene lamp draw lethargic images on walls, the film ties us to the lives of the occupants of the house. Only after stepping out to the road, we get a chance to have a retrospection of what we have viewed that far in the theatre.
First of all, the film lacks the credibility - the credibility of most of its characters and scenes. When the film begins, Kusum has eight children of varied ages. The eldest, Vasana (Samanalee Fonseka), is around 17 years of age. If Kusuma had married at age 20, she would have been at least at around age 40 when she delivered all these children and mothered each at least two years. She has done the toughest jobs that a woman rarely does. Can a woman maintain a body desirable for the trade after the immeasurable chores she had gone through before her final job - prostitution?
Linear flow
The slaughterhouse owner, (Mahendra Perera), gang-raped Kusum after abducting her assisted by his henchmen. The owner is portrayed as a kind man, but all of a sudden, he turned to a brute and committed a heinous crime. Only by absorbing to the linear flow of the story, you will be able to believe such a character shifting. The similar episodes are many in the film. The elder daughter, Vasana’s arrival in the city and finding a job at a garment factory, which her mother was unable to do and her being in the village all alone with seven kids where her mother is a victim also question the credibility of its characters.
Moreover, the shelter of the family lies at an extremely lonely place. Except for some Palmyra trees, the house views only a few greeneries. Kusum lives along with her eight children, mother in law, and Sumana (Chandani Seneviratne) at this house. We are hardly shown any neighbours. This also gives doubt in mind of the audience of the credibility of the film and of many of its scenes.
The principal who betrayed Kusuma’s husband is another enigma. Why did he do that? Has he had any grudge against the fish seller? How could Kusuma, all of a sudden, entered principal’s house and hacked him to death? All these pose us questions and we have to shun them and view the film in silence.
The music of the film (R. Abaji & Philip David Sheppard) is praiseworthy. It elaborates the theme of the story and rouses our imagination. Silence plays the major part of the music but it has been used expertly to highlight main episodes of the film effectively. The isolated house and its lonely occupants help the director sharpen his theme and focus on it very well.
Brave attempt
Anoma Jinadari, Samanalee Fonseka, Mahendra Perera, Pubudu Chathuranga (brothel owner), and Shyam Fernando (paramilitary leader) do justice to their roles. The cinematography is laudable. The film is a join production (Neon Production (France) and Sapushpa Expressions (Sri Lanka), and they must be praised for their brave attempt.
The film has represented Sri Lanka for many international film festivals. It won the Best Film Award at the 15th International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights in Geneva and clinched the Youth July Award at the 15th International Film Festival and Forum on Human Rights in Geneva. Anoma Jinadari emerged as the Best Actress at the 3rd Asian World Film Festival in Los Angeles for her character of the film and the film was nominated for the best film award at many more international film festivals.
Sanjeewa Pushpakumara has grasped filmmaking at many acclaimed international universities. His attempts so far brought in many credits to Sri Lanka. Burning Birds provides ample evidence for his creativity and honesty towards his themes. Film lovers can expect a range of good films from him in the future.
More we need people talented like him.
