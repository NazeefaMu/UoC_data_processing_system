G.C.E. (O.L) examination
Answer script evaluation from December 23

Commissioner General of Examinations B. Sanath Pujitha, in a circular, stated that the evaluation of answer scripts of G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination is to commence from December 23.
About 541 coordinating centres are to be set up countrywide for the examination, Pujitha stated.
He had informed all school heads that admission cards of school candidates for G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination 2018 should be handed over to candidates without delay.
He said if school heads delay the handing over of admission cards, they are liable to face disciplinary action as they would breach the rules of the Department of Examinations.
The Department of Examinations had informed all school heads that schoolchildren sitting for the G.C.E. (O.L.) Examination from December 3 to 12 should behave decently at examination centres.
If they fail to do so or create disputes at examination centre premises, their candidatures would be cancelled and they would not be allowed to sit for public examinations thereafter held by the Examinations Department.
If candidates are found to have violated the rules and regulations of the Department of Examinations by way of committing misdeeds, malpractice and fraud, their results would be cancelled and results would not be issued to them.
School heads were informed that these instructions have to be conveyed to candidates immediately and parents too should be enlightened over the punishments imposed if students are proved to have violated the regulations.
R. M. Jayawardena, a senior head of a national school in Kurunegala, confirming these facts, added that 234 candidates who sat for the G.C.E. Examinations within the last two years faced accusations of violating rules and regulations of the Department and thereby, they were not issued their results as a punishment.
