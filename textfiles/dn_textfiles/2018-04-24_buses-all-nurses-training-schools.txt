Buses for all Nurses Training Schools

The Health Ministry is to provide buses for all Nurses Training Schools (NTS) in the country. Under the first phase, buses valued at Rs. 53 million will be provided for NTS in Galle, Matara, Kalutara, Kandana and Batticaloa, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, buses will be provided to all NTS in the country soon. There are 18 NTS in Sri Lanka which train nurses for state hospitals and other state health institutions. There is a principal for each NTS.
The new nursing faculty is to be built at a cost of Rs. 8 billion at Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital premises. It can train 2,000 nurses at once. Another Rs. 6.5 billion will be spent on constructing hostels for nurses studying in the faculty. The new nursing faculty will be turned into a Post Graduate Institute in the future, he said.
The hostel to be constructed for the nurses who study at this new faculty will consist of sports facilities, swimming pools, bodybuilding centre etc. A special (British) English course will be offered for nursing students, he added.
