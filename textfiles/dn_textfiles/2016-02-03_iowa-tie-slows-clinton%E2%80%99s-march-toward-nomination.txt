Iowa tie slows Clinton’s march toward nomination

US: Hillary Clinton’s vow to never again lose the Iowa caucuses, as she did in spectacular fashion in 2008, was paying off in a near-dead-even tie. But for Mrs Clinton, that’s probably going to be enough.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ strong showing almost certainly denies Mrs Clinton a glide path to the nomination and prolongs the contest deeper into the calendar than Mrs Clinton hoped, by likely giving her opponent an infusion of cash and momentum.
It’s also sure to resurrect the questions that have long surrounded Mrs Clinton and nagged at Democrats, about why she can’t close the deal, why many voters remain cool to her and whether she truly is capable of knocking out a Republican in the fall.
In the caucus, 22 delegates sided for Mrs Clinton and 21 for Mr Sanders, but the Clinton campaign said it expected one outstanding delegate to go with her as well. Despite it all, Mrs Clinton’s campaign was designed to withstand a bad night in Iowa, and a loss in next week’s New Hampshire primary, where Mr Sanders leads in the polls. She has the money, the state-by-state organisations and a spate of Clinton- friendly contests coming up that still give her the inside track on the Democratic nomination.
“I think it’s important to take the long view. Unless numbers change dramatically in South Carolina and Nevada and more importantly the states in Super Tuesday, it will be difficult for Senator Sanders to win the nomination,” said Mitch Stewart, a Democratic strategist and Clinton supporter who was President Barak Obama’s Iowa field director in 2008 and battleground states director in 2012.
David Axelrod, a former adviser to Mr Obama who directs the Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago, called it “a good night for Bernie.”
“A tie when you’re duelling with the champion is a win, even though the terrain was more hospitable to Sanders, and the diverse states beyond New Hampshire will be far more challenging for him,” Mr Axelrod said. “She’s still the favourite, but he will raise big money off of tonight’s showing, which could, at a minimum, prolong the race.”
Sanders, a Democratic socialist without the youth or biracial appeal of Barack Obama, nevertheless tapped into Mr Obama’s voters and this year’s angry, anti-establishment wave. He rode a wave of young voter turnout after his campaign worked hard to organize voters on college campuses across the state.
Sanders said when he began his campaign in Iowa nine months ago, “We had no money. We had no name recognition and we were taking on the most powerful political organization in the United States of America.
Sanders said Iowans are sending a “profound” message: “It is just too late for establishment politics and establishment economics.”
In a speech to supporters, Mrs Clinton never outright declared victory but said she was “breathing a big sigh of relief” following the caucuses. Rather than dwell on the results, however, she focused her remarks on her argument that she is the candidate best suited to take on the opposing party in the general election.
“We may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals but I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic party and this campaign stands for what is best in America. And we have to be united when it is all said and done” against Republicans, Mrs Clinton said.
Later in the night Mrs Clinton’s press secretary Brian Fallon circled back to the question of which candidate could claim victory in Iowa.
“We believe strongly that we won tonight,” Mr Fallon told reporters aboard a press plane preparing to depart Des Moines for New Hampshire. He said Mrs Clinton had proven her ability to organise and turn out voters. With 22 delegates going to Mrs Clinton and 21 to Mr Sanders, Mr Fallon said the campaign expected one outstanding delegate to go to Mrs Clinton as well.
