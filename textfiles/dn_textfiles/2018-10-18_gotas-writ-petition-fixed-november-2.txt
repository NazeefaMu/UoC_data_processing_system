D.A. Rajapaksa Museum case:
Gota's writ petition fixed for November 2

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed the writ petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa challenging the FCID inquiry, for November 2.
The FCID filed a case stating that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.33.9 million.
The Court was informed that Rajapaksa expects to present his stance regarding the petition on the next date.The Attorney General had filed indictments against seven persons including Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in the Permanent High Court-at-Bar regarding this incident.
The Court of Appeal has already issued an Interim Order preventing police from acting against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over this incident. On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal had upheld the petitioner’s version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of the petitioner’s legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
