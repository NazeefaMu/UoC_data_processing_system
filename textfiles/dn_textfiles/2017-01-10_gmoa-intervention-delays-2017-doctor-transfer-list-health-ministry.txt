GMOA intervention delays 2017 doctor  transfer list: Health Ministry

The Health Ministry is unable to release the list of doctor transfers for 2017 due the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) intervention, Health Ministry sources said. According to the sources, the ministry requested the GMOA to post doctors in order to re-open 40 rural and peripheral state hospitals closed down due to lack of doctors, but the GMOA is not responding to the request, the sources said. The real reason for the shortage of doctors at some state hospitals is lack of new doctors, and they are undergoing training now. The ministry will recruit more new doctors in future, the sources added.
