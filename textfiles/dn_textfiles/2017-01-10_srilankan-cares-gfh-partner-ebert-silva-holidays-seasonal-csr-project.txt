SriLankan Cares, GFH partner Ebert Silva Holidays in seasonal CSR project

SriLankan Cares, the charitable arm of SriLankan Airlines,Galle Face Hotel and Ebert Silva Holidays joined hands to spread the spirit of Christmas in giving, sharing and caring with the theme ‘Christmas in the City’, on December 22.
Twenty three children with their parents and 12 adults from the CCC Home, the transit home for out-patients at the National Cancer Hospital, Maharagama, most of them from far away areas from Colombo in a half day excursion, enjoyed their day from Maharagama on a special city ride on the Ebert Silva Holidays double decker Party Bus to enjoy the festive lighting and decor in the city with music and Santa Claus on board.
The group was shown the city and the attractive Christmas illuminations with stops at the World Trade Centre and similarly decorated areas to arrive at the Galle Face Hotel where they were extended a welcome with soft toys and treats. Thereafter the children and the group were hosted to dinner at the Galle Face Hotel’s Long Room.
SriLankan Cares ensured the children were presented with the personalised Christmas gifts they had requested from Santa Claus for this Christmas, adding a magical touch and making it a most memorable and beautiful Christmas for the children, their parents and elders as well.
Ebert Silva Holidays Chairperson Rajini de Silva Mendis, SriLankan Cares Manager Niroshan Ranawake, and Galle Face Hotel General Manager Deni Ohlsen-Dukic with their teams participated.
