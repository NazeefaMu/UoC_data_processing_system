Demand for skilled Lankans in West Bank

Palestine is looking to recruit skilled Sri Lankan workers as housekeepers and jewellery makers in the West Bank.
This had been conveyed to Sri Lanka’s Representative in Palestine, M. Fawzan Anver by Palestine’s Civil Affairs Minister Hussien Al-Sheikh.
There is a demand in the West Bank for Sri Lankan housekeepers and jewellery makers, Hussien Al-Sheikh said. He promised to make all arrangements with the Israeli authorities to get special working permits to enable them to work in the West Bank, where the remuneration is good.
The Minster also said in future all arrangements for work permits have to be made directly through the Civil Ministry of the State of Palestine.
If Sri Lankans transit in Jordan, they need special approval to pass through Allenby Bridge to reach the West Bank.
The Minister has also placed a request for a Sri Lankan restaurant in the West Bank.
He thanked envoy Anver and the people and the government of Sri Lanka for the support to the Palestinian cause.
