Over 65,000 apply for postal voting in Kurunegala District

About 560,000 applications for postal votes have been received from public servants for the LG polls on February 10, but about 41,000 of them have been rejected as they were erroneously filled and some were received after the due date.
The highest number of applications for postal votes have been received from the Kurunegala District (67,411). From Kandy District, 48,353; from Anuradhapura District, 45,261; and from Gampaha District, 41,049 applications for postal votes have been received.

Mohammed, Additional Election Commissioner when he was contacted by the Daily News from Kurunegala yesterday.
