Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera CONDOLENCE MESSAGES

Ven. Sobitha Thera rendered unparalled service towards human freedom
Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera gave the correct leadership and guidance to the Movement to Protect the Motherland when JR tried to implement anti-democratic measures through the Indo - Lanka Accord in league with Rajiv Gandhi. He was courageous enough to take the forefront in the face of shooting by the police against students and the Abhayaramaya to suppress the 1987 May students upheaval, states Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka in a condolence message yesterday.
Ranawaka in his message, said he identified and came to know the late Sobitha Thera during his university days in mid 1980s. The advice given by the late Thero was a great source of strength and support to students who staged student struggles a that time.
He was a great Sangha teacher who rendered an unparalleled service towards human freedom.
The late Thero intervened locally and internationally, to suppress the LTTE after the terrorists launched an attack on the Sri Dalada Maligawa.
He continued his national service even after the defeat of the LTTE, by showing the correct direction to bring about the necessary political and social changes.
At all times he acted in a non violent manner, safeguarding and protecting the honour of the bikkhu robe. He was always able to be on the side of the people without allowing his sasanic and social honour and acceptance to be broken or disgraced due to any politics or political party.

A true ‘Bodhisathva’ who relentlessly searched for social and political justice
The passing away of Ven. Sobitha Thera, Chief Incumbent of Kotte Naga Vihara and Chairman of the National Movement for a Just Society, has deeply saddened me. We Muslims revered him, honored him and loved him. He was a beacon of light that guided us to hope and security. His very presence made us feel safe to be around when our community was under relentless attacks by extremist elements. We looked up to him to guide us and direct us when we the Muslims found ourselves marooned in a sea of hostility. His passing away I fear, may leave a deep vacuum in our national reconciliation efforts.
Ven. SobithaThera made strident attempts to rid the nation of corruption and venality. His audacious enterprise to restore democratic governance and the rule of law, received the support of all religious and ethnic minorities who claim Sri Lanka as their island home.
His selfless and brave leadership helped us dismantle a corrosive regime that held the nation hostage to the machinations of a cabal that preached corrosive nationalism and marched towards a neo fascist autocracy. In this hour of grief, words fail us in expressing the depth of our sorrow.
Whenever I sought his sage advice, he gave it willingly and diligently. He was a leader and a sage. He was a teacher who explained matters in meticulous detail. He was a teacher who demonstrated with example. Above all, he was a teacher who inspired great confidence. He was a true ‘Bodhisathva’ who relentlessly searched for social and political justice for all.
Rauff Hakeem MP, Leader, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress
Thera was an epitome of excellence
The sudden demise of Most Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera has no doubt, gripped the whole nation into unbearable grief and sorrow.
Ven. Sobitha Thera was a firm believer of good governance and was against all form all racism, violence and religious disharmony. He had to face many obstacles in his endeavor to establish a just society. He was an epitome of excellence and Sri Lanka has lost a truly great son of the soil. May this great soul attain Nibbana.

A fearless and straight forward personality
The All Ceylon YMMA Conference is saddened by the news of the demise of Most Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Kotte Naga Vihara at a time when his services are very importantly required by the country.
We reckon him as a fearless, straight forward and principled personality who lived in our country, who steadfastly struck to his principles, just and fair play and was instrumental in installing a government to rule under the principles of Good Governance. He eschewed petty differences and above all, was a front line warrior against hatred towards other races based on ethnicity and religious differences. He raised his vibrant voice against the types of sinister elements that were being molded in the country. He was an eminent Buddhist prelate who gained the respect and honour of all people of our country belonging to all races. In recognition of his services to the country, the All Ceylon YMMA Conference bestowed the coveted Y Personality of the Year 2014 at our last Annual Convention in June 2015. The YMMA Conference takes pride that we were able to present this award on behalf of the Muslim community.
His demise is an irreparable loss to the country and we as countrymen whilst mourning, should resolve more than ever, to continue his cause in establishing the just society that he aspired to create. That would be the biggest honour that we could bestow on him after his demise.
Sidque Saleem, National President, All Ceylon YMMA

The country has lost a great leader
The Moors’ Islamic Cultural Home, the premier Muslim Institution, joins all Sri Lankans and Buddhist around the world in sharing the sad passing away of the Most Venerable Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
Ven. Sobitha Thero rendered yeomen service to the nation and was fondly called by all sectors of the Sri Lankan communities as the People’s Monk. His services to the Buddha Sasana as well as for the harmony and co-existence of all communities in the nation had no parallel in the recent history of the country.

An ode to a great erudite monk
My Obeisance! The beige sky bewails, For your untimely departure Oh! Dear Venerable Sir, “Maduluwawe Sobitha.” Once your word as storms, To redirect whom with Unbalanced and mislead.
Again your words are freezing To whom needed the solace of life.
And you are the treasure of dhamma Poured to heal the suffering minds And conceal all agonies.
Oh! My Dear Venerable Sir, As “Impermanent are all component things,” It had made your journey into a halt.
Before attain the bliss of nibbana, We need your come back. To re-dedicate your esteem service
On behalf of my motherland. Dear Venerable Sir “Sobitha.”

He was a great prelate
We are saddened to hear the unfortunate demise of the Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera.
He will be remembered with gratitude by the people of all sections of this country for the pioneering and pivotal role he played in the interests of the country and his contribution to establish social justice on this land, which was unique. He always voiced for a just governance for the common good of the people.
We were hoping that he would play a noble role and encourage a speedy political solution to the Tamil speaking people most of whom are Hindus. Unfortunately, destiny has decreed otherwise.
Aum Shanthi ! Shanthi ! Shanthi !
