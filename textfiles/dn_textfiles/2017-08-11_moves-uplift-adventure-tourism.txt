Moves to uplift adventure tourism

The government has been working with various stakeholders to uplift adventure tourism services in Sri Lanka by formulating new policies, a release issued by the Policy Development Office said.
The release: "Since April, the government has been working with various stakeholders to uplift the adventure tourism services in Sri Lanka by formulating new policies. They have come up with a new vision to uplift the services and ensure the safety of those activities with an action plan.
"The project will be implemented as a major development strategy to uplift the economy. All the information and all the activities related to the project have been published by the Policy Development Office on Facebook page: www.facebook.com/policydevelopmentoffice.
"While the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) plays the leading role in the process, adventure tourism activities related to water, air and land are governed under the supervision of the Navy, the Air Force and the Army.
"The Sri Lanka Telecommunication Regulatory Commission is responsible for immediate actions regarding communication and rescue processes. The Sri Lanka Standard Institution certifies the standards of adventure activities. Government, non-government and voluntary institutions are associated with the project."
