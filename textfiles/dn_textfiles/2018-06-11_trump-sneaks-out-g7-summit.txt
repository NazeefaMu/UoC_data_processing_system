China, Russia, India in SCO summit
Trump sneaks out of G7 summit

The start of two major geo-political ‘summits’ this past weekend, at the opposite ends of the Earth, dramatically demonstrates how much the global power balance has changed from that of a world dominated by a bloc of Western-led capitalist powers to a world of several power blocs of varying geo-political punch. The ‘Group of 7’ (G7) top capitalist countries of the old Western-led power bloc met in La Malbaie, Canada, while the newer 8-member Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO), the world’s largest regional bloc in terms of population, held its summit in the Chinese port city of Qingdao.
At one time the G7 – briefly ‘G8’ before Russia was booted out for annexing the Crimean Peninsula from neighbour Ukraine – represented the bloc of richest and most powerful economies. Not so any more. When the Shanghai Security Organisation (SCO) was initiated by rising China over a decade ago, the six Asian and Eurasian powers it brought together were relatively small fry. But the SCO’s 18th summit under way in Qingdao now groups eight emerging capitalist powers notable for their huge population, global economic punch and growing military-strategic consensus.
The G7 comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They are seven of the largest advanced economies in the world, representing 62% of the global net wealth (US$ 280 trillion) but just 32% of the global GDP based.
The SCO bloc may not group the world’s richest societies, but, today, is potentially, the single largest, geographically unified, market. It brings together China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, comprising the world’s biggest population concentration, some of biggest armed forces and nuclear military capability and, is led by the world’s second largest economy, China.
US and the other G7 countries
Still, world news media focussed on the gathering of the old Western-led power bloc in Canada expecting fireworks between the US and the other G7 countries. The other G7 leaders are known to be incensed over the US’ recent unilateralist undermining of trade among these same countries (sudden and massive trade tariff hikes on steel and aluminium) and, withdrawal from crucial Western-initiated pacts on climate change and Iran’s nuclear weaponisation.
But Donald Trump, president of the United States of America, the country that, till recently, was regarded as the leader of the G7, left the meeting venue on Saturday, mid-way in the summit, further driving home these changes in global power dynamics. So the US leader missed most of the summit talks on key world issues such as climate change, world economy, security issues. Apparently he had briefly attended a session on Friday on gender equality issues before returning to Washington. Trump interested in gender equality?!!
The White House officially claims that Trump had to leave early ostensibly “to prepare” for tomorrow’s up-coming US-North Korea summit. But most commentators the world over, including American ones, acknowledge that the American president is isolated among the G7 leaders for his confrontational foreign policies much of it subverting close ties with these same G7 partners.
The perception across the world is that Trump cannot face the other G7 leaders due to his shock moves undermining trade within that power bloc itself and leaving key pacts on climate change and Iranian nuclear armaments control. In fact, European news media reported that some of the European leaders attending the G7 summit were already privately discussion a possible ‘G6’ grouping minus the maverick US.
While the old Western power bloc is in disarray, the gathering of forces in the East, in Qingdao, heralds new geo-political power configurations which, in terms of world peace and stability, are most welcome. After all, the G7, at one time, represented the kind of unipolar dominance that has enabled chaotic geo-political management with numerous wars currently under way in various parts of the world largely arising from forceful interventions by this power bloc. Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, are all highly unstable and war torn states today due to such interventions.
The rise of other power blocs, wielding diverse leverage – combining geo-strategic location with military capability, multilateral collaboration, and sheer economic punch – is now clearly modulating the behaviour of the old Western bloc and will do so much more in the future.
Iran nuclear pact
As it is, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Qingdao ahead of the SCO summit for talks with Chinese President Xi Jin-ping, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Iran’s leader, will certainly discuss possibilities of China (and other SCO partners) helping Iran out of a possible new economic quagmire if America’s latest economic and political sanctions offensive against Tehran does result in the collapse of the Iran nuclear pact. Rouhani will also use the SCO summit to negotiate similar support from the other SCO partners.
Hence, the once dominant US’ attempt to bully Iran into geo-political submission may not fully work out the way hoped for by Donald Trump and the Washington hawks such as National Security Adviser John Bolton.
In Qingdao, Russia and China will certainly discuss the disarray in the G7 and the geo-political space opened up for other countries and blocs to strategise to survive and manage global dynamics free of Western bullying. They will also assess the potentials – or, likely, lack of potential – of this week’s expected summit between North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un and the US’ Donald Trump.
Some of the Western news media likes to portray next Tuesday’s Kim-Trump summit in Singapore as a kind of ‘game changer’ vis-à-vis North Korea’s nuclear arsenal. But most analysts across the world do not expect much more than some ‘photo opportunities’ and flamboyant words between these two leaders both of whom are known for bombast.
The impending summit (unless Trump or Kim chooses a dramatic ‘withdrawal’ at the last minute – to hide potential talks failure) is not seen by most analysts as one that will genuinely lead the way to the ‘de-nuclearisation’ of North Korea as the West wishes. Even in the US, the more rational commentators have long given up such a possibility.
It is already recognised by most commentators that Pyongyang moved toward negotiations only after it had achieved its goal of nuclear weaponisation as well as long range warhead delivery capability. It is NOT the result of US or Western sanctions pressure as claimed by Trump and his admirers. As the North Korean leader himself has publicly stated, their offer for talks has been made AFTER Pyongyang had concretely demonstrated its nuclear weaponisation progress with successful atomic tests and rocket test launches.
Even if the Singapore summit does not deliver any firm commitment towards nuclear disarmament, Kim will have achieved much more than what Trump stands to achieve. Trump will ‘make history’ with a first ever meeting between a North Korean and US leader. But Kim will have achieved considerably political legitimacy by this exercise.
Big deal
The Americans, many of whom want to see this summit as an US ‘success’ are missing the point: why should it be a big deal for the world’s most powerful state to hold a meeting with the leader of a minor state, which, in real terms, is hardly a military or economic threat to the US? By making such a big deal over the Kim-Trump summit, America is actually ‘stooping low’ to please a very independent-minded country which continues to thumb its nose at the world’s sole superpower. It is a further dilution of the sway that America holds over the world.
The truth of Trump’s trip to Singapore is entirely to do with his personal vanity and showmanship as well as his Republican Party’s hopes to sustain its core vote banks with a strong dose of American pseudo-triumphalism.
Meanwhile, other ugly truths about the Trump presidency continue to emerge. Trump’s former election campaign chairman Paul Manafort now faces loss of bail and the prospect of FBI detention in the on-going FBI investigation into Russian subversion of the 2016 presidential elections and the possible collusion between Trump’s election campaign team and Moscow. And, yet another Russian is being charged in this massive special probe, biggest ever such investigation in the FBI’s history.
Trump’s histrionics over the G7 summit and the Kim summit are partly to overcome the shame and distract from possible criminality of the Russia scandal, as well as his past sexual intrigues with multiple illicit consorts.
