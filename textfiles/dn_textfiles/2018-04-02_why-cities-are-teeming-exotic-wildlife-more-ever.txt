Why cities are teeming with exotic wildlife more than ever

It’s 463 pages of Danish Gothic script. Furthermore, it’s a mediocre scan on Google Books that I’m trying to access through the shoddy wifi in the intercity train from Leiden to Groningen. Those are my main excuses for failing to find the first-ever reference to urban plants. According to Herbert Sukopp, the Berlin-based patriarch of European urban ecology, buried in Joakim Schouw’s 1823 tome Grundtraek til en almindelig Plantegeographie (Foundations to a General Geography of Plants) should be the very first mention of urban plants.
I will just take Sukopp’s word for it that Schouw, somewhere in this impenetrable text, writes, with inter-letter spaces for extra emphasis: “Plants that occur near cities and towns are called Plantae Urbanae; for example Onopordon Acanthium [cotton thistle], Xanthium strumarium [common cocklebur]. In most cases, an alien origin is the cause by which these plants are found only in the vicinity of cities and towns.”
Exotic species
It’s interesting that two centuries ago, botanists were already recognizing how exotic species form an important contribution to urban biodiversity. In those days, the major avenues that today are bringing exotic plant species into cities did not yet exist: there were no garden centers, scattered bird seed, or globalized agricultural produce.
And the pet trade, as well as the planes, trains, and automobiles on which far-flung fauna nowadays hitch accidental rides, were also not yet as commonplace as they are now. With these activities bringing so many exotic species into cities, it is no surprise that nowadays, much more strongly than in Schouw’s time, urban biodiversity is an eclectic mix of species from all over the world.
In European and North American cities, the wild flora consists of 35 to 40 percent exotic species. And in the city center of Beijing, this figure even is 53 percent. Sometimes, the role that socio-economic factors play in these patterns is all too apparent. In Phoenix, Arizona, botanists measured the plant diversity in more than 200 plots, each 30 by 30 yards, strewn randomly across the city and its surroundings. They discovered that one of the factors most strongly determining how many types of plant they would find in a plot was the affluence of the local neighborhood. The better-off the residents, the greater the diversity of plants. This effect (which they called the “luxury effect”) is a clear sign that travel and trade, and the relentless escapism of exotic plants from well-tended gardens, are responsible for the botanical enrichment of urban centers.
Naturalists encountered
These constantly arriving foreign inhabitants form the first of at least four explanations for the high biodiversity urban naturalists are encountering in their cities. A second explanation is the fact that the places where people like to build their settlements, which then grow into cities, are often biologically rich areas to begin with.
If you open an atlas and look where the world’s biggest cities are, you’ll notice that they are not on mountain plateaus, deserts or other biologically poor regions. Instead, they are in the exact same places where we find biodiversity hotspots: estuaries, flood plains, fertile low-lying areas, and other places where humans and wildlife alike find plenty of food and many different niches are available. In other words, the second reason for the rich biodiversity of a city is that it was already rich before the city was built. Some of this richness will have clung on in the remaining patches of habitat, embedded in the city as it develops.
“With a little poetic license, you could say that weeds, prosecuted and outlawed in the country, had taken up refuge inside the city walls.”
A third source of urban biological richness is, in fact, the loss of good-quality habitat immediately outside the city perimeter. These days, many urban centers are ecological oases compared with the surrounding countryside. - Lit Hub
