Sri Lankan Embassy in Israel celebrates Vesak

The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Israel organized a Vesak Day Programme at the Embassy premises on April 29 with the participation of the Sri Lankan community living in Israel.
At the invitation of the Embassy, Venerable Sukhito Thera and Venerable Pannanando Thera visited the Embassy and invoked the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem on this very special occasion.
The event commenced with the offering of “Buddha Pooja”, and Venerable Sukhito Thera conducted the religious ceremony.
The staff of the Embassy organized a Sanghika Dana (an almsgiving) to the Buddhist Monks.
Ambassadors of Korea, Myanmar, Nepal and Thailand attended the event along with their family members, and paid homage to the Maha Sangha and participated in the offering of Dana.
The Embassy premises was illuminated with colourful lights, which attracted visitors and Israeli public. At the end of the programme, the participants were invited to enjoy a Sri Lankan vegetarian meal prepared by the Embassy staff.
