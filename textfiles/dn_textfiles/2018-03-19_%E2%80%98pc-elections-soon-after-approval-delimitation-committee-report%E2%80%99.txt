‘PC elections soon after approval of Delimitation Committee report’

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said that immediate measures will be taken to hold the Provincial council elections if the Delimitation Committee Report for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils is approved by two thirds majority in Parliament on March 22.
The Minister was addressing the media recently at the Ministry.
He said a full-day debate on the Delimitation Committee Report for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils will be held on March 22 in Parliament.
He noted that the report was presented in Parliament on March 6 and it has to be approved by two thirds majority in Parliament at the end of the debate.
The Minister said that if the report requires changes, another committee will be appointed headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Minister Musthapha said the recent local government election was the most peaceful election held in decades. He said the government was able to get rid of people with violent behaviour under the new electoral system.
"A new electoral system was in place after 39 years.
There could be flaws but that needs to be amended. Change in the electoral system was a promise given to the people and we managed to fulfill it. We will do our best to rectify the prevailing issues as well," he said.
He said some group insist that the old system should be implemented but the new system was implemented for the betterment of the people.
"I am not speaking as a SLFP Minister here, I represent the people. Even some SLFPers will not support the system but the government did the right thing," he said.
