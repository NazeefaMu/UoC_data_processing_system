Rebellion Crushed

Twenty five years after he fell victim to a terrorist bomb attack, the memory of Ranasinghe Premadasa lingers on, his place in post-independence history still not properly delineated. Premadasa was always a divisive figure in Sri Lankan politics but even his harshest critics will agree that he handled Sri Lanka’s worst constitutional crisis- the impeachment motion against him- with characteristic precision and efficiency.
In hindsight, the saga of Premadasa’s impeachment has its roots in the lead up to Premadasa’s elevation to the Presidency in 1989 at time when the country was crippled with twin insurrections: the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the North and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in the South.
Although Premadasa’s predecessor, J. R. Jayewardene briefly toyed with the idea of amending the Constitution and running for a third term of office, saner counsel prevailed: Jayewardene, then 83 years of age, retired.
There were many in the UNP who held the view that two ministers in Jayewardene’s Cabinet, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake, possessed more political and intellectual maturity- as opposed to Premadasa’s gung-ho, street smart style- to succeed Jayewardene as the UNP’s leader.
To his credit, Jayewardene stuck with Premadasa, the man who had toiled long and hard with him as he re-organised and rejuvenated the UNP after Dudley Senanayake’s demise. Premadasa- unlike Athulathmudali and Dissanayake- was no lawyer turned politician born into a reputed family with political connections. His was a hard grind to the top, breaking down the elitist class and caste barriers of the UNP.
Popular leader
Premadasa was immensely proud of what he had achieved. Once he reminded Anura Bandaranaike in Parliament that he, Premadasa, was once the boy who sold ‘lavariya’ in Kehelwatte. As he himself proudly declared on numerous occasions, Premadasa’s political skills were not honed in the halls of academe but from the ‘university of life’.
Even so, despite being a seasoned campaigner and a platform orator voters flocked to hear, the 1988 presidential election was no cakewalk. The JVP had threatened voters with death. Sirima Bandaranaike, with her civic rights now restored, was a formidable opponent. The burden of incumbency from a UNP government that had been in office for twelve years was beginning to take its toll. The Indian Peace Keeping Force was in occupation in the North and East, giving the majority community a siege mentality. Still, Premadasa won, polling just over 50 per cent of the vote.
If Premadasa’s election campaign- spearheaded by the promise of ‘Janasaviya’ and including the ingenious ‘me kawda mokada karanne’ poster campaign- was a spectacular success against all odds, his subsequent choices in deciding his government were equally monumental blunders, culminating in the impeachment motion against him.
It is no secret that, in the aftermath of Premadasa’s ascension to the Presidency, both Athulathmudali and Dissanayake made separate overtures to the President-elect to seek the Prime Minister’s post. Premadasa rebuffed them both. Had he chosen one over the other, his Prime Minister would have been loyal to him at the expense of the other candidate.
Premadasa though was an instinctive, rather than an intellectual politician. He opted for the mild-mannered, soft spoken, silver haired Dingiri Banda Wijetunge as his Prime Minister. Wijetunge had all but retired from active politics and was serving as Governor of the Wayamba Province when he was recalled to Parliament and appointed Premier. It could be argued that Premadasa would have felt insecure had either Athulathmudali or Dissanayake become Prime Minister and would have feared being undermined by them.
Premadasa’s choice of Cabinet posts for his perceived rivals tend to support this view. Athulathmudali was appointed Minister of Agriculture, Food and Co-operatives (and later, Minister of Education and Higher Education) while Dissanayake was assigned the Ministry of Plantation Industries.
Rebellion
Having handled the high-profile Ministries of Mahaveli Development and Trade and Shipping respectively in Jayewardene’s Cabinet and having been overlooked for the Premiership, both Dissanayake and Athulathmudali were livid. It was a rebellion waiting to happen. It was only a matter of time before they pooled their resources to try and oust Premadasa.
That came in the form of the Motion of Impeachment, the first –and only one, so far- of its kind in Sri Lanka, in August 1991. The motion accused Premadasa of treason, violating the Constitution but also included nebulous insults- such as claiming that Premadasa ordered the construction of a gold-painted replica of the throne used by ancient Sri Lankan kings for official functions, that he falsified his personal history by establishing a museum with fake personal effects and that he claimed credit for ghost-written books to portray himself to be an author, poet and an intellectual.
At the outset, it was clear that the entire parliamentary group of the SLFP had signed the motion. There was a guessing game on as to who, if any, from the UNP had signed the motion. Premadasa first learned of the crisis when Speaker M. H. Mohamed informed him that an impeachment motion against the President had been received.
The very next day, Premadasa summoned all 125 MPs of the UNP parliamentary group. Premadasa shook the hand of each MP individually and asked them whether they had signed the motion. All of them said ‘no’. Obviously, that included many who had signed the motion. Later, in an attempt to portray that he still commanded the support of the UNP parliamentary group, Premadasa posed for a photograph with them on the steps of Parliament.
Nevertheless, the issue was snowballing into a crisis. To stall this momentum, Premadasa then took the next option available to him: he prorogued Parliament. The Constitution specified that once an impeachment motion is received, the President cannot dissolve Parliament. Unable to dissolve Parliament, Premadasa used his right to prorogue Parliament, re-summoning Parliament on September 24, 1991.
In that period between late August and September 24, speculation reached a feverish pitch. The rumour mill went into overdrive. The public were regaled with fantasy-like tales of Premadasa resorting to witchcraft to defeat the motion when it was scheduled to be debated in Parliament.
Since Parliament had been prorogued, Premadasa was required to address the ceremonial sitting when it reconvened. He was advised by parliamentary officials that he could be heckled by SLFP MPs who were making the most of the discord in the UNP. However, Premadasa was determined to have his say and be heard.
“Apart from the fact that an impeachment motion is sought to be brought against me, no misconduct on my part has been established. It is the practice in our country that a person is considered innocent until he is found guilty of any offence. We all know that no person is considered guilty of any offence merely because a charge has been levelled against him. It is therefore necessary that the accused has to be considered innocent till he is proved guilty. You all know that I have not been found guilty of any offence.” Premadasa was to tell Parliament that day.
New political party
The heckling came but Premadasa was up to the challenge, not yielding to the invective that came his way but delivering his speech in full, raising his voice from time to time to rise above the din. The session concluded as he left the chamber after his speech.
The next day, on September 25, 1991, the Speaker M. H. Mohamed made a statement at the commencement of proceedings. “I wish to inform the House that I have been given notice of a resolution under Article 38(2) of the Constitution. Having satisfied myself that the resolution is in order I decided to entertain it. Subsequently written and oral representations have been made to me questioning the validity of the signatures on the resolution. I am looking into this matter at present. My decision will be conveyed to the House soon,” Mohamed said.
That was also the same day that Athulathmudali made a personal statement and resigned from the Cabinet. Shortly afterwards, Athulathmudali, Dissanayake and a host of others- G. M. Premachandra and Samaraweera Weerawanni among them- were expelled from the UNP. They went on to form the Democratic United National Front (DUNF), a new political party with the eagle as its symbol.
Speaker Mohamed’s statement to Parliament only added to the speculation. There were suggestions that Mohamed was being influenced and prevailed upon to reject the motion. There were many behind the scenes moves made by the Premadasa camp to canvass support from parliamentarians who were thought to have signed the motion.
Athulathmudali and Dissanayake meanwhile were challenging their expulsion from the UNP in court. The Supreme Court noted that Athulathmudali had not been totally truthful when, asked by Premadasa at a Cabinet meeting whether there were any signatories to the impeachment motion, he did not identify himself. Their expulsions were upheld.
The end of the impeachment saga was somewhat of an anti-climax. It came in the form of another announcement from Speaker M. H. Mohamed to Parliament, on October 8, 1991. “Further to the announcement made by me to the House on Sept. 25, 1991, regarding the notice of a resolution under Article 38(2) of the Constitution, I wish to inform the House that having inquired into the matter, I am now of the view that the resolution does not have the required number of valid signatures, and therefore it cannot be proceeded with,” Mohamed said, shedding very little light on the exact basis for his decision.
Since the Constitution required 150 MPs to endorse an impeachment motion for it to be entertained and since Speaker Mohamed at first announced that he was entertaining the motion, it can only be assumed that the motion submitted to him did have 150 signatures. However, he did say that the veracity of some of the signatures had been called into question.
Mohamed’s subsequent statement in October suggests that he came to the conclusion that some of those signatures were not genuine and that only some of those signatures were considered ‘valid’. It was on that technicality that the attempted impeachment of President Premadasa came to an abrupt end.
Premadasa never made amends with Athulathmudali and Dissanayake again. Ironically, he was assassinated eight days after Athulathmudali was gunned down at an election rally on April 23, 1993. In Premadasa’s last public speech, he defended himself against accusations that he was responsible for Athulathmudali’s death. “Assassinate me if you wish but don’t assassinate my character,” he was to say in words that turned out to be tragically prophetic.
Dissanayake did return to the UNP after Premadasa’s death but he too perished eighteen months later, while campaigning for the Presidency, running against Chandrika Kumaratunga. Ironically, Athulathmudali’s widow Srimani was to later support Kumaratunga and join her Cabinet as a minister.
They key players in the impeachment saga- Premadasa, Athulathmudali, Dissanayake and Mohamed are all no more now, Mohamed having passed away two years ago, in April 2016. The impeachment crisis however did fracture the once solid political monolith that the UNP was in its heyday and there are those who argue that it has not quite recovered fully from that debacle- even to this day.
