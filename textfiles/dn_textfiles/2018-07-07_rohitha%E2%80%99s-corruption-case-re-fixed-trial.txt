Rohitha’s corruption case re-fixed for trial

The corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million was yesterday re-fixed for trial on August 3 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, the court was informed through the Defence Counsel that Rohitha Abeygunawardena was not appearing in court since he was attending Parliament sessions.
On an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled preliminary objections raised by the former Minister against the Bribery Commission’s decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
The Director General further alleged that former Minister had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.
