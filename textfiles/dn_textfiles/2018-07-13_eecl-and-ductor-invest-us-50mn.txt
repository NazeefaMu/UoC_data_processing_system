EECL and Ductor to invest US$ 50mn

Endevour Energy Corporation Limited (EECL) and Ductor Private Limited in Helsinki of Finland, will invest US$ 50 million to build South Asia’s first bio fertilizer and bio energy project in Bigiriya. The construction of the project is now in process and would be opened end of the year.
“We have acquired technology for the project from the Ductor Corporation, is a company with a portfolio of proprietary and patented technology to improve waste management and produce energy and food production.
The main raw material used for the production of fertilizer and energy would be chicken droppings and Chicken litter. “We will also convert municipal waste into energy and fertilizer.”
Chairman of Endevour Energy Corporation Limited (EECL), an Australian based International Corporate Entity floated a limited liability company Kumar Perumal, said that the Plant would produce 10 MW of electricity. “The bio fertilizer produced could be used to fertile the soil to grows paddy, tea, rubber and variety of vegetables.”
The poultry farmers would also feel at ease, being able to move out the piling up of the unwanted chicken waste, a burden on their heads for the past decades.
“Once this Corporation is established with the partnership with the Ductor Private Limited Company, of Finland, we hope to invest in other South Asian countries from 2020 with this concept.”
He said that the project would also help Sri Lanka’s objective to free Sri Lanka, is free from harm caused by the chemical fertilizer. The agreement to build the plant was signed recently at Cinnamon Grand Hotel by the Economic Affairs and Employment Deputy Minister Petri Peltonen of Finland and Ductor Pte President, Marko Karkkainen and Kumar Perumal.
Perumal told Daily News Business that his Company has done a very meticulous study on poultry farms operating in the country, and has identified 698 poultry farms within both Western and North Western Provinces, producing at the rate 130 million broils within an year. “With a view to ensure of unbroken supply of chicken droppings to the 10 MW plant, the company would also sign a MoU with the Poultry Farmers Association soon.”
He said that his Company would be in a position to collect the much needed 130000 tons of chicken litter per annum to operate the plant intended to produce energy and bio fertilizer.
He also went on to say that with the passage of time, his corporation would stretch far and wide and go into other areas including North and East to collect chicken litter/droppings.
“We have also learnt much about the piggeries operating in the country as well. We will venture to do a serious study on piggeries to see the feasibility of obtaining pig waste to manufacture bio fertilizer and energy”, Perumal said.
Speaking about the process of obtaining energy and turning chicken waste into fertilizer, he explained that the ammonia found in the droppings/ waste, was injurious to the soil, and that ammonia content would be separated; add sulfuric acid and turn that into ammonium - salphate.
Statistics show Sri Lanka imports around 65,000 tons of ammonia and Perumal was of the view that the bio-fertilizer plant once installed, would be in a position to produce around 50 percent of the country’s requirement enabling the treasury to save a considerable amount of foreign exchange. “As we will purchase specially manufactured trucks from China on a German design, to ensure that there would be no spillage or obnoxious odor, we assure the public, they need not entertain fear of bad odor when transporting of poultry waste from the farms to the plant.”
