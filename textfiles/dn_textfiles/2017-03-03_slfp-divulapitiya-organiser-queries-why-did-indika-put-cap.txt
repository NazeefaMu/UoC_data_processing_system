SLFP Divulapitiya organiser queries : Why did Indika put the cap on?

 Western Provincial Council member, Divulapitiya SLFP Chief Organiser and Co-Chairman Divulapitiya Regional Co-ordinating Committee Chandana Jayakody commenting on the brawl between Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Parliamentarian Indika Anuruddha at a committee meeting held recently said he was puzzled as to why Parliamentarian Indika Anuruddha put the cap on because not only members of his family but several other businessmen were involved in the illegal mining exercise.
Addressing a press conference held at his Balagalle residence, Jayakody said, whatever it was, it was a shameful incident which occurred at the first meeting held by the committee for 2017. Unfortunately new excavations were included in the agenda of the meeting when it could have been easily taken up on another day.
All these years, politicians in Divulapitiya had engaged in their activities in a peaceful manner but this incident had added an unnecessary blot on the political scene. Jayakody said his intention was to join hands with both Ramanayake and Anuruddha, as well as all other political figures, and do a good job of work for the development of Divulapitiya. Earlier Ramanayake had a confrontation with the Divisional Secretary too regarding this matter. As politicians they should not descend to such low levels. Truly, there was a water scarcity problem in Divulapitiya. It is this problem which led to this incident. Mining of sand, clay and gravel was necessary to facilitate development work in the country. But there was a law in this country. Eventhrough some people had obtained permits they have gone beyond the stipulations to engage in unlawful things.
Some who obtained permits to excavate 100 cubes of gravel had exceeded it and excavated 10,000 cubes. Since the livelihood of a large number of people was dependent on land filling for a livelihood, a grave problem would arise soon unless damage to the environment was not stopped. However mining permits should not have been taken up for discussion that day they since not even an officer from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau was present at the meeting. Jayakody said he did not intend to point the finger of accusation at anyone. The finger of accusation should not be levelled at a single person. Jayakody said his request from the authorities concerned was to implement the law to the letter without any discrimination as to status or position.
