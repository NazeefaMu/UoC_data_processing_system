Cops interdicted over suspects’ escape

Two constables attached to Nittambuwa Police have been interdicted for allowing two suspects, involved in a stabbing incident apprehended by residents in Thihariya and handed over to them, to escape from police custody, a spokesman for the Gampaha SP’s office said.
He said two youths who arrived at a shop selling durian fruits in Thihariya had kicked up a row with the shop owner.
During the row, the shop owner had received a stab injury and he had been dispatched to hospital in a ‘Suwa Sariya’ ambulance. Neighbours had flocked to the scene and caught the two suspect youths and alerted the police on the hotline.
Thereafter, they had handed over the two suspects to two constables who arrived at the spot. But the two suspects had escaped from police custody after using a ruse.
The neighbours had brought the matter to higher police officers. Gampaha ASP Mahinda Udugama, who held an initial inquiry into the matter, has ordered the interdiction of the two constables and intimated the decision to them on June 24.
Disciplinary action is to be taken against the two constables for bringing the police service into disrepute.
