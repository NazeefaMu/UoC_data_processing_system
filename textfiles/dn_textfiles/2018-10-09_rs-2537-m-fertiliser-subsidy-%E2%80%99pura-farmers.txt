Low water levels in tanks
Rs. 2,537 m fertiliser subsidy to A’pura farmers

Anuradhapura District Agrarian Development Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa told the Daily News that the water levels of nearly 3,000 minor irrigation tanks were very low and no water was received to a majority of small tanks yet. As such no decision is taken with regard to the cultivation of 2018/2019 Maha Season, he said.
“It was expected to cultivate 132,000 hectares in the district during the 2018/19 Maha season. Now we have limited it to 121,170 hectares and it may drop depending on the monsoon rainfall.
We are preparing to distribute fertiliser subsidies such as MOPT.S.P. and Urea amounting to 36,384 mt. for nearly 150,000 farmers expected to take up paddy cultivation.
“The commercial value of the fertiliser for the Anuradhapura district is Rs. 2,537 million and farmers are only required to contribute Rs. 364 million on subsidy basis, such as 50 kg bag at Rs. 500,” Somawansa said. Resulting from the long-prevailing drought, a majority of the 73 major tanks coming under the Irrigation Department had reduced water levels, especially in the Anuradhapura district.
However, water in major reservoirs had increased by one percent from the recent rainfall overall, Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Director Wasantha Bandara Palugaswewa said.
He requested the farming community who faced continuous cultivation losses to use every drop of rainwater for preparatory agricultural processes such as land preparation, ploughing etc. without depending on tanks as a water quota of 35 percent out of the tank water is required for such work, which poses a risk concerning seasonal water management for cultivation in Anuradhapura.
Farmers have shown reluctance to start cultivation work as they had lost a few 'Kannas' due to drought although some showers were received in the last few days. The distribution of drought-relief dry food packs worth Rs. 5,000 is continuing. According to the Irrigation Director's office, the water level of Padaviya, which should be 85,000 acre-feet is now one acre-foot (a.f.), Walkada which should be 43,000 a.f. is now four inches, Abayawewa which should be 2,000 a.f. is now 72 a.f., Maha Kanadarawa which should be 36,250 a.f. is now 5,600 a.f., Maha Wilachchiya has become 9,200 a.f. from 33,000 a.f., Tisa wewa now 660 a.f. from 3,500 a.f., and Nuwara wewa is 6,120 a.f. from 36,500 a.f.
