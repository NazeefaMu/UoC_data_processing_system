Wild animals wreak havoc in Ampara

The Ampara district coastal areas have been threatened by wild animals for many years now including in the Akkaraipattu, Addalaichenai, Alayadivembu, Pottuvil, Sammanthurai, Irakkamam, and Thirukkovil DS divisions.
People in the area say wild animals destroy their cultivations day and night causing them many hardships.
Wild elephants invade nearby villagers from the Pallakadu jungle at Oluvil in the Addalaichenai DS division and the Lahugala forest in the Pottuvil division of the Ampara district.
They used to enter inner villages in search of food and water in the night, but now they invade even during the daytime, villagers lamented.
Troupes of monkeys break tiles and asbestos sheets by jumping and running on them.
They enter kitchens through roofs and windows and eat food items. Authorities were informed about the menace but the problems continue still, the villagers said.
