CR-Police, a close game on the card

The hapless CR & FC outfit will have a strong challenge in overcoming the fast improving Police Sports Club in their Dialog ‘A’ Division inter-club league rugby first round match at CR & FC Grounds in Longden Place, Colombo today. Match will commence at 4.00pm.
This year’s CR side is going through a miserable season where they have lost their last four matches in a row after a long time losing out to CH and FC 12-19, Army SC 20-24, Kandy SC 12-24 and Havelock SC by 30-35 last week at Longden Place. CR & FC under the coaching of former Sri Lanka national fifteen-a-side coach Fijian Fereti Verabula displayed a superb running rugby through their three quarter line against Havies in their last game. Former Royal College number eight and present CR hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya who is an excelent player in the lose as well as a tremendous exponent of the rolling maul will be the man to watch from the red shirt camp.
Police in the other hand will be going into this match brimming with confidence after their moral boosting draw against the formidible CH and FC side two weeks back where they held them to a 21 all draw. Ex-Peterite captain and fly half Sandesh Jayawickrema will be their key figure.
CR & FC (Probable XV): Udara Gayan, Supun Warnakulasooriya, Kokila Sammandapperuma, Gayan Jayamanna, Charana Chamikara, Sashika Ashan, Shemal Weerasekara, Omalka Gunaratne, Kavindu De Costha and Tharinda Ratwatte, Sashan Mohamad, Kushan Indunil, Rehan Silva, Kavindu Perera (Captain), Reeza Rafaideen,
Police SC (Probable XV): Yet to select
