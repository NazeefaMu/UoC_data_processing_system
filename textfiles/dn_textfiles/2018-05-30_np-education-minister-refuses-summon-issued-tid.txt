NP Education Minister refuses summon issued by TID

 
N<U+200B>orthern Province Minister of Education Dr K Sarveswaran refused to accept summon issued by the Police Terrorism Investigations Department (TID), today to appear before the TID on June 5th to record a statement.
Sarveswaran said that he refused to accept the summons because his name was addressed wrong on the notification and the reason for his summon was also not mentioned clearly.
The letter wrongly addressed Education Minister Sarveswaren’s name as Parameswaren.
Sarwesvaran said that the letter he received was not signed by any officer in charge and his name was also spelled wrongly.
He said that he refused to accept it as it appeared more like a fake letter.
