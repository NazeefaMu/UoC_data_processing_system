From crisis to sustenance – Part 13
What if you could  consistently create a new business venture

Last week, we briefly enumerated the five paths companies typically follow to reconstruct their market possibilities and open up blue ocean possibilities. Today, we begin with discussing those paths in somewhat detail.
n Look across alternative industries – and determine what products and services have different forms but achieve the same purpose. Customers commonly make trade-offs between alternative industries. The space between these industries may provide some significant opportunities for value innovation.
* Look across the strategic groups within an industry – and understand which factors determine the customer’s decision as to which group they will belong to. By offering the key determining factors from each group and eliminating everything else, a blue ocean can open up.
* Look across the chain of buyers – and combine their differing definitions of value. Purchasers, users and influencers will all have different definitions of good value. If you challenge conventional wisdom about who is the target buyer, blue oceans can open up.
* Look across complementary product and service offerings – and come up with a total solution. If movie theaters did this, they might create a blue ocean by offering a babysitting service so people could go to the movies.
* Look across functional or emotional appeal – and challenge the orientation of your industry. Inject some emotional elements into a product which has traditionally been marketed along functional lines. Or, you might go the opposite direction. Transform your industry from being emotionally driven to being functional and no-nonsense.
Every strategic plan ever written by a corporate planning department starts with a lengthy description of current industry conditions and the competitive environment. Next up is usually an analysis of how to increase market share. In other words, the usual corporate planning process is very much Red Ocean oriented. There are even screeds of spreadsheets attached to back up every aspect of the plan. Little wonder strategic plans never lead to the creation of blue oceans.
Strategy canvas
A strategy canvas is basically a line graph that plots functions/factors against importance for a company or an organization and then overlays competitors or industry benchmarks. In this way, information can be built to help formulate a competitive strategy.The strategy canvas can allow us to communicate a wholly differentiated strategy.
The strategy canvas serves two purposes: (1) To capture the current state of play in the known market space, which allows users to clearly see the factors that the industry competes on and where the competition currently invests. (2) To propel users to action by reorienting their focus from competitors to alternatives and from customers to noncustomers of the industry.
A good strategy canvas:
* Will help everyone visualize accurately your current strategic position in the marketplace.
* Will allow you to chart what your future strategy can and should be.
* Helps everyone focus on the big picture rather than operational details.
* Specifies precisely what the current and future factors that affect competition within your industry.
* Shows where both you and your competitors differ in the investments you’re making for future success.
* Will stimulate dialogue between various business units about where the company should be heading.
* Will foster and enhance the transfer of strategic best practices across units within the firm.
Drawing a strategy canvas is a tiring assignment. Even identifying the key factors of competition is far from straightforward. The final list is usually very different from the first draft. Assessing to what extent your company and its competitors offer the various factors is equally challenging. Most managers have a strong impression of how they and their competitors fare along one or two dimensions within their own scope of responsibility, but very few are able to see the overall dynamics of their industry.
The catering manager of an airline, for instance, will be highly sensitive to how his airline compares in terms of refreshments. But that focus makes consistent measurement difficult; what seems to be a very big difference to the catering manager may not be so important to customers, who look at the complete offering. Some managers will define the competitive factors according to internal benefits. For example, a CIO might prize his company’s IT infrastructure for its data-mining capacity, a feature lost on most customers, who are more concerned with speed and ease of use.
Visual awakening
A common mistake manager make is to discuss changes to strategy before resolving differences of opinion about the current state of play. Another problem is that executives are often slow to accept the need for change; they may have a vested interest in the status quo, or they may feel that time will eventually vindicate their previous choices.
Nintendo Wii
Developing your firm’s own strategy canvas is never easy. For a start, there will be loads of disagreement over what exactly are the various competitive factors. People will have differing levels of sensitivity about how you compare with your competitors in the various areas. And many managers will be tempted to define utility and value from the perspective of internal users rather than using the customer perspective. Despite all this, if you want to find blue ocean opportunities, you’ll have to learn how to develop an effective strategy canvas.

Consider the Nintendo Wii. The Wiiis a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 2006. When Satoru Iwata was selected the first non-family CEO of Nintendo, he did not like what he saw. He saw Nintendo placing a distant third behind Sony and Microsoft in the electronic games business. After researching the market place, and realizing that the typical buyer is a young, antisocial male, he wondered why everyone else didn’t play electronic games. So, he asked older males, girls, families, and retirees why they didn’t play. He got an earful.
The games were too expensive, too complex, too antisocial, and too high tech. So, using four questions from the Blue Ocean Strategy methodology, he challenged his team to get answers never asked before of non-gamers.

* What don’t you like about the electronic games? This question and others helped them decide what factors could be eliminated that the industry has taken for granted.
*What is OK but way over hyped? This helped them decide what factors could be reduced well below the industry’s standard.
* What features are there but you would like to see more of? This helped them decide what factors should be raised well above the industry’s standard.
* What is missing for you? What do we need to offer that would make you really enjoy playing games? What factors can be created that the industry has never before offered? This is the real key to the value.
Result
The result is that the Nintendo Wii has broken all records for sales. Satoru Iwata made difficult decisions, often facing great ridicule, such as when he made the decision not to include a DVD player in the Wii console. That decision dramatically reduced the cost of the Wii and his rationale was that DVD players are available everywhere. Most people didn’t need another one.
So, while Sony and Microsoft were reducing their prices below cost hoping to make profit on the games, Nintendo was selling at full price and couldn’t keep the Wii on the shelves more than few days. Even at end of the year 2016, Nintendo is leading against Sony and Microsoft.

Now let us see how you can develop your firm’s strategy canvas:
(1) Get everyone on the same page first – by developing a visual representation of where you are at present. Compare your business to your competition visually. Get everyone to see the bigger picture and not just their own vested interests. Draw up a proposed strategy canvas and debate it. Compare and contrast your strategy with that of your competitors. Invite everyone to fire up their imaginations and participate.
(2) Send a couple of teams of managers into the field – and get them to talk face-to-face with customers. Find out precisely how people use or don’t use your product or service. Don’t outsource this and rely on second hand reports. Get out and see what’s actually happening for yourself. This is the only way you’ll come up with any strategic insights. If at all possible, spend time with noncustomers and learn why what you offer does not appeal to them.
(3) Hold a visual strategy fair – where each field team presents their suggested strategies plotted on a strategy canvas. Let each team present their proposed strategy in ten minutes or less. Put each strategy canvas on the wall. Give everyone present five sticky notes to vote for their favorites. Tell people they can put all five on a single strategy if they find it compelling. That way whichever strategy is considered best will be immediately obvious. Decide on what your best future strategy can and should be.
(4) Communicate what you decide far and wide – by distributing your before-and-after strategic profiles. Put this on one page for easy comparison. Have management walk employees through the changes. Make this new picture the centerpiece of everything that you do.
