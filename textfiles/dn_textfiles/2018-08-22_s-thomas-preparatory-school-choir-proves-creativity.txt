S. Thomas' Preparatory School choir proves creativity

Displaying a vast array of talents, innovative dynamics, creative arrangements and exploring boundaries of traditional and contemporary music, school choirs have thrilled and amazed audiences for countless years in the past.
The S. Thomas’ Preparatory School Choir is one such choir, home to many talented and energetic youngsters from the ages of 11 to 16 years as it provides a platform for these students to express their creativity through music and arts. The 35+ number of Choristers each dabble in various genres of music from Gospel to Rock to Pop as they are trained to be versatile not only in their music but in their approach to music as a practice for life and its challenges.
This year, S. Thomas’ Preparatory School celebrates 80 years in existence and thus has a year filled with various activities and events to commemorate this momentous occasion. As a part of the year’s celebrations, the Choir will be organizing “I Will Follow, I Will Lead”, a three-day concert held on September 7, 8 and 9 at the Auditorium of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Kollupitiya.
As this concert marks an extremely important celebration in our calendar, we have been working tirelessly to ensure the outcome is as or even greater than any other professional concert out there by bringing in Christopher Prins on Drums, Melissa Pereira on Keyboard, Shalintha Rodrigo on Bass, Julius Mitchell as guest Beatboxer, Professor Sujeewa Ranasinghe as guest Esraj Player and the dynamic duo Ayushka Nugaliyadda and Mihara Jayalath as our Choreographers! The choir will not only be performing songs from western pop charts but has the honor of performing songs from local artists such as Alien Accent, SanukaWickramasinghe, KATCHA, Ridma Weerawardena and Dilan Jayakody, with special tracks created by Ranil Goonawardene and Sachiththa Fernando!
The choir will be led by Berklee College of Music alumnus SanchithaWickremesooriya who has been working with the boys for around 2 1/2 years to date, inspiring the kids to reach international standards by exposing them to a series of workshops conducted in partnership with The Sooriya Village with people such as fellow PrepiteKavichandran Alexander, the first Sri Lankan to record and produce multiple Grammy Award-winning albums, and many others.
