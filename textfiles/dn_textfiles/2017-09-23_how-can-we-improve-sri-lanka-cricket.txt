Lasantha RodrigoFormer Sri Lanka Cricketer
How can we improve Sri Lanka cricket

Developing one’s own skill in cricket comes only at club level (Higher Division cricket) by playing for the club with others who have represented Sri Lanka or played higher level of cricket.
I reached higher level not due to playing school cricket or being coached by school cricket coaches. I was never coached while playing for the school. Those who have the talent learnt fast by playing their own type of cricket and making good scores during the school cricket season.
It is upto Sri Lanka Cricket to select qualified good coaches on a paid basis and send them to various provinces and train those young talented who perform well in club cricket.
Also the National Cricket Selectors must go round, watching club cricket and incentives given through S.L.C. to those who perform and doing well.
It is high time former top Sri Lanka cricketers, what they speak will go out and watch cricket and act whether what they say is done and be in touch often with S.L.C cricket committee.
Even politicians who played cricket should help those who want to improve cricket without speaking out to the media blaming the administration just to gain respect.
I cannot understand why other former Sri Lanka cricketers write to the media just giving out their views.
It is cricket whoever the individual be must be made to improve and not to throw mud at others.
Even the Minister of Sports or the Prime Minister should appoint a top level cricket administrator and former cricketer who has much time at his disposal to advice. May Sri Lanka Cricket develop from good work done and become World Cricket champions.
Those who do good the public will admire.
