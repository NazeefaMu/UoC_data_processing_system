Army opens IT institute in Trincomalee

The Army’s newest Ranaviru Information Technology Training Institute (RITTI), established at the Army Logistic School (ALS) in Trincomalee was vested with the spouses and children of retired and serving Army personnel, brothers and sisters of unmarried Army personnel and underprivileged students, on Friday.
The sixth RITTI, as in other five RITTIs in Panagoda, Anuradhapura, Kokavil, Kuruwita and Kandy, will conduct computer courses for students above 10 years of age. However, the Certificate in Applied Information Technology is only for Army personnel. Expressing his intention to open Army RITTIs shortly in Mullaittivu, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Ampara and other remote areas where such facilities are a ‘luxury’, Army Commander Lieutenant General Senanayake said that sharing of IT knowledge between Army personnel and school students would further cement the existing bonds of goodwill, reconciliation and ethnic harmony in this multiethnic district.
He also told the gathering that this Army-provided facility would help find the most talented IT students who would qualify for advanced courses.
The courses in the Army RITTIs have received recognition by the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) which in turn enables Army personnel to receive a professional NAITA competence certificate after sitting the examinations.
