Colombo Fraud Investigation Bureau questions Bandula

MP Bandula Gunawardena has been questioned by the Colombo Fraud Investigation Bureau over his comments regarding the sale of fake lottery tickets.
The officers of the Bureau had visited the MP’s home in Colombo yesterday to record a statement.
According to the Police, the National Lotteries Board had complained to the IGP to investigate into the statements made by the MP over the lottery tickets.
The Police had informed Gunawardena to report to their offices in Borella, but as the MP had failed to show up, the Bureau had paid a visit to his house.
In early July, the Bureau had filed a B report in the Colombo Fort Magistrate’s Court against the Colombo District MP for claiming at a press conference that there are fake lottery tickets in circulation being sold by agents of the National Lotteries Board.
The Fort Magistrate issued an order directing several television channels that unedited video footage pertaining to the concerned press conference be handed over to the CFIB in order to conduct further investigations.
