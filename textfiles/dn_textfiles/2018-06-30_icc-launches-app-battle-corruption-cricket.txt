ICC launches app to battle corruption in cricket

The ICC’s latest means to battle corruption in the game is an Integrity app that will be available to players, officials and support staff at all levels of the game and across all formats.
The app will “give anyone in the game easy access to information they need to tackle issues relating to anti-corruption and anti-doping”, the ICC said on Friday. While the app will serve as an information source, it will also provide those in the game a secure platform to report any suspicious incidents or behaviour related to corruption or doping.
Players and officials were first made aware of the app at a soft launch during the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand in January. India Under-19 coach Rahul Dravid said he found the app useful, and encouraged all those involved with the game to download it.
“It’s fantastic to see that the ICC has come up with an Integrity App,” Dravid said. “It’s got a lot of information on anti-doping and anti-corruption. You can make a report about anything that you notice that is untoward. I think it’s terrific to have easy access to this information on your fingertips. I would encourage all players, and those involved in cricket, to download the app, to use it and to read up on all the information. It’s something that will keep the game clean, fair and something that we are all proud of.”
