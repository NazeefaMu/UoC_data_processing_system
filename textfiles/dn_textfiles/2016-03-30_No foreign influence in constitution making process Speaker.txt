No foreign influence in constitution making process: Speaker

Parliament will never allow foreign influence in the constitution making exercise, although it welcomes the technical assistance extended by those countries, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
He was addressing the inauguration of the 'Seminar on Constitutionalism' organised by Parliament with the USAID support at the Waters' Edge Hotel in Battaramulla yesterday.
The Speaker who said the government was ready to expand their knowledge on constitution making by learning from the experiences of other democratic countries, assured those present that the final output would be a homegrown one that best fits the country.
He said the USA, Germany, UK, Canada and many other countries have expressed willingness to extend support to Sri Lanka in making the new constitution, and that the UNDP would coordinate the process. "We will not hesitate to take all of their friendly assistance while being careful at the same time," he noted. He also said the constitution making exercise is not limited to one political party. "It is a historic duty and responsibility vested on each and every MP in Parliament. If one is not participating in this task, he is neglecting this duty," he said.
Commenting on the progress achieved over the past 7 months under the present government, the Speaker said many steps have been taken to strengthen democracy in the country. "We were able to appoint independent commissions through the Constitutional Council. The appointments were basically done by the civil society members in the Council without any political interference.
The bodies such as the COPE and Public Accounts Committee are performing their roles with new vigour and enthusiasm unlike before. A new system was facilitated to directly ask questions from the Prime Minister. Oversight Committees have begun work and will complet it soon. The Right to Information Bill was presented in Parliament," the Speaker said.
