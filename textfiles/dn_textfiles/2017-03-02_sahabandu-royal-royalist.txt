Sahabandu -the royal Royalist

There is a secret he knew about Gram! He marked it a point to buy a packet of gram (kadalagottuwa) and instead of munching it, twirls, spins, cuts and seams the gram in his left hand which was his bowling arm walking home after cricket practice every day. That’s how he mastered his three-in-one bowling class. This is a story as recounted by one of his team mates, RajivaWijetunge the former Royal speed merchant and Nomads player.
That was DAYA SAHABANDU, the former Royal College, Sinhalese Sports Club, Nomads and Ceylon’s three way purpose bowler. He spun, seamed and swung many an opposing batsman to his demise with high class left arm bowling. He was the envy of many a bowler of his kind.
Showcasing his magic wares
Sahabandu was a simple and unassuming cricketer. But when he had the ball in his hand he was a destroyer. Sadly he was a bowler who like many brilliant cricketers shone in the pre Test era. He did not have many opportunities like the fortunate cricketers of today to play a surfeit of cricket now that the country is playing in the big leagues.
Before going on to say more about this genial gentleman just read his figures in Sara cricket which was the country's premier game. Played in this league for nearly 20 years - Matches 253 - Overs 6,552 - Maidens 1919 - Runs 14,787 - Wickets 1,048 - Avg 14.11 - 'GUINNESS BOOK' or 'WISDEN' could take.
He was indispensable and was a must in the Ceylon teams of that era. He had only six opportunities -playing in six unofficial Tests and showcasing his magic wares with the new and old ball with his stinging and biting deliveries. Although not having headline making figures which amazed many international visiting batsmen he was as big as life in his day. Captains such as England’s Colin Cowdrey, Tony Lewis, Mike Denness, Australia’s Bill Lawry and one of his ilk Bishen Singh Bedi and AjitWadekar of India spoke highly of ‘Bandu’ as he was popularly known and compared him to that West Indian and England three way purpose bowling greats Garfield Sobers and Derek Underwood.
It is no exaggeration to say that had Sahabandu the fortune to showcase his bowling that he was fortunate to be born with and had the opportunity of paying a lot of international cricket he would have been an "International" of repute. I had the opportunity of facing him playing school cricket - he for Royal College and me for St.Benedict’s College; and later when he donned Nomads colours and the writer for Saracens. I can vouch for his many varieties of deliveries that were more often than not wicket taking ones bemusing and baffling opposing batsmen, including myself.
He was a "three- in -one bowler" in the manner born. A must any captain will yearn to have in his lineup. He was no extrovert or had the pride of a Peacock, but was inexplicably an introvert who spoke little and let the ball in his hands do the wicket taking talking. We would yearn for the likes of a bowler of Sahabandu‘scaliber and class in modern day cricket. In today's cricketing scene he would have been in great demand in every form of cricket locally and internationally and pocketed millions in rupees and dollars.
'Last man' or 'night watchman'
Playing in the local scene and the ‘Sara’ tournament, that was first class cricket for nearly two decades, he captured believe it or not over 1000 wickets. He would have to done a helluva lot of bowling to achieve this success and there is or will not emerge another bowler of his class, perseverance and dedication who could even have a sniff at the record. He had 10 wicket haul in a Gopalan Trophy game and five wickets against England.
Playing first class cricket for the SSC he did not meet with much success. Nomads turned his fortunes and it proved to be his happy hunting ground. He is greatly indebted to that former Ceylon batsman and Nomads captain marvel D.H.De Silva who spotted the uncut gem in Sahabandu. He polished it and with ‘DH’S’ guidance as captain instilled in him that it is sweat and toil that brings success. So he practiced and practiced and then luring batsmen to their demise came naturally for Sahabandu.
Sahabandu also says a very big ‘thank you’ to former NCC, Leicestershire professional, Ceylon and Nomads all rounder Stanley Jayasinghe who taught him the tricks of the bowling trade. Be it bowling on the mat or turf, Sahabandu was unplayable. Oh for a Sahabandu in modern day cricket.
Meeting Sahabandu on his way to the public library where he goes everyday to scan the newspapers for news, the topic of conversation that emerged was cricket. He spoke in glowing terms of the country’s success in the World Cup and the Twenty20 World Cup.
Sahabandu in addition to his excellent bowling, had it in him to come in as 'last man' or 'nightwatchman' and stay put at the wicket. One such incident he remembers most is the unbroken last wicket stand that he was involved in with former Royal speed gun RajivaWijetunge in 1982 in a 'Sara' Trophy game for Nomads against Colts which deprived Colts of entering the final.
The pair stayed put at the wicket facing 36.5 overs with Wijetunge making 39 and Sahabandu 14. Nomads was captained by Patrick Van Dort. Patrick's son the tall left hander Michael has the honour of scoring a century at Lord's.
‘Not out’
When asked what was the most exciting inter-school cricket match he played he promptly said it was the Royal-St.Benedict’s game at Reid Avenue in 1960.That game saw controversial umpiring. The match was won by Royal and the crowd resorted to manhandling umpire Lappen!
Royal was captained by Michael Dias and SBC by the writer. A former Bens cricketer and keen Bens supporter Ben Antony who was involved in the fracas and the games that followed when an appeal was made against a Ben’s batsman Antony would shout ‘what happened to Lappen will happen to you’ too much amusement and the umpire would promptly say ‘not out.’
The Sara Trophy game he remembers is the one between Nomads and Saracens at the ViharaMaha Devi Park. Nomads fielded a side studded with stars while Saracens had cricketers who could upset any side and upset the Nomads they did. That was a peculiar game because a rare incident occurred. With Saracens chasing victory and with Percy Perera and the writer at the wicket, Perera skied a ball off Sahabandu and AmreshRajaratnam who went for the catch had it in his hand but grassed it and kept clutching the ball suffering probably a black out.
We sought permission from umpire Allan Felsinger and ran about 7 singles till the ball was retrieved and in the penultimate over I hit Polonowita for 10 runs to achieve a famous victory and being chaired off the ground by the Saracens supporters. SomasunderamSkandakumar the present High Commissioner in Australia also played in that exciting game.
