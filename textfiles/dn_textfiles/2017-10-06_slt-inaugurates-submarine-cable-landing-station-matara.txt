SLT inaugurates Submarine Cable Landing Station in Matara

Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) inaugurated a Submarine Cable Landing Station (SCLS) in Matara, aiming to become a hub of communication in Asia, SLT Chairman P.G. Kumarasingha said.
In line with the inauguration of the SCLS, SLT laid the foundation stone for a Cable depot in Galle.
The Chairman added that SLT has already completed the cable-laying process as a partnered project. The undersea submarine cable project called 'SEA-ME-WE-5,' will increase the data-transferring speed by tenfold. This is the fifth underwater submarine cable of the SLT.
“The completion of its partnered project, the 'South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 5' (SEA-ME-WE 5), is expected to increase its international bandwidth capacity by tenfold, for the future requirements of the country as well as the South Asian region. With this global initiative, SLT will further strengthen its position as the only ICT solutions provider in the country having multiple global connectivity options with a gigantic bandwidth capacity that is adequate to cater to the requirements for more than 25 years ahead,” the Chairman said.
This futuristic project is in collaboration with the country's vision for the future to empower the ICT super highway towards becoming the digital hub of the region.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 project, already completed with the partnership of 19 global operators, has designed a future-ready network that is capable of delivering a 48 Tbps (48,000 Gbps) global bandwidth capacity to Sri Lanka by facilitating both east and west cables, the Chairman added.
He further pointed out that the landing of this international cable at Matara will be a key milestone as well as a landmark for the telecom industry of the country.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system will further enhance the uninterrupted connectivity to the world since any redundancies of the existing submarine cable systems (SEA-ME-WE 3 and SEA-ME-WE 4) can be routed through SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system. Asked what the direct and the indirect benefits of this project, the Chairman replied that the new cable system will enable Sri Lanka to leverage on its strategic marine geographical location in achieving the country’s strategic goals. Moreover, this global project will have a positive impact on the overall growth of the country’s economy. On the economic front, a high-speed broadband environment will encourage higher GDP, enhanced exports, increased productivity, inward migration and modernizing of other sectors. At all micro, small and macro-economic levels, it will reduce transaction costs, increase market coverage and competitiveness and create significant opportunities for job-creation and income-generation.
In addition, it will foster economic growth and development through affordable, reliable and seamless global communications, he said.
“This initiative will be one of the key enablers in achieving the move towards an inclusive digital economy and a smart Sri Lanka,” he added.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 submarine cable system, spanning approximately 20,000 km, links Singapore, all the way to Europe via France and Italy.
It connects 16 countries altogether, serving as the new platform for future business ICTs.
The SEA-ME-WE 5 cable system is designed to provide upgradeable transmission facilities by adopting the latest state-of-the-art 100 Gbps WDM coherent technology.
Speaking on the Cable Depot in Galle, the Chairman said that this is the first state-of-the-art Submarine Cable Depot the South Asia.
SLT will operate the cable depot in Sri Lanka as a Joint Venture under the name “Galle Submarine Cable Depot Private Limited” (GSCDPL).
The GSCDPL will be a depot service provider under the South East Asia and Indian Ocean Cable Maintenance Agreement (SEAIOCMA) from Jan 1, 2018 onwards.
