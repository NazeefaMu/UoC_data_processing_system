Foreign investors admire development  impact triggered by Grasshoppers Sri Lanka

Aavishkaar, the global venture capital manager, visited Grasshoppers along with a group of investors. They appreciated the beautiful impact made by the company while filling the gap of last mile delivery in Sri Lanka.
The group of investors representing Japan, Netherlands and Germany made a visit to Head Office of the Grasshoppers Pvt Ltd, the start-up company affiliated to Kapruka.com, on October 10. They met with Grasshoppers riders and Hub Bosses (Franchisees) who manage the last mile delivery operations as independent, self-employed business operators.
“We have understood the economics and the impact Grasshoppers have on its stakeholders' right to the grassroots level. That is why we have invested in Grasshoppers,” Vineet Rai, founder of Aavishkaar Frontier Fund said during a Grasshoppers gathering held at Colombo recently.
With the experience of investing into Connect India, the largest last mile fulfilment service in India, which serves biggest e-commerce brands like Amazon and Flipkart, Aavishkaar has found common features in Grasshoppers.
The visionary leadership of Dulith Herath and the scale of business developed through Kapruka.com have added confidence to the investors. “We believe in the design of Grasshoppers' business model, combining development impact as well as commercial success,” Vineet said, appreciating the strong network Grasshoppers have developed connecting rural parts of Sri Lanka with urban parts.
“Delivery in last mile space is very open and interesting in Sri Lanka,” Mathias Dittrich of FMO, Dutch Development Bank, who was among the group said.
“We invest into development and growth in frontier markets. Our interest in Grasshoppers is very much rooted in the impact it makes into local small entrepreneurs." FMO has made investments in Grasshoppers through Aavishkaar.
Aavishkaar is a venture capital investor with a unique vision to combine social impact creation and development. Driven by the belief that an enterprise-based development approach can enhance livelihoods and reduce vulnerabilities for the low-income population, Aavishkaar has made over 55 investments in Asia, since 2001.
With a strategy of investing US$ 1billion fund into 300 start-up companies, they recognise Sri Lanka as a land of promise. Grasshoppers is the second investment after investing into Sri Lankan company MA’s Tropical Food, and are now seeking to expand Aavishkaar’s investment portfolio in Sri Lanka.
