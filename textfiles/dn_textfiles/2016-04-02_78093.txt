Chamari Athapaththu: delivering hope to SL Women's team

She hit her maiden ODI century at the age of 21, which is, till date, the highest individual score in the 50-over format for her country. At 23, in the 2013 Cricket World Cup, her quickfire fifty against England helped her team script one of the most remarkable upsets in the history of Sri Lankan women's cricket. She was 24 when the national selectors chose to name her as the captain of a side that consisted of senior stars like Shashikala Siriwardene and Eshani Lokusuriyage. By 26, she has established herself as a pivot around which the Sri Lankan batting revolves. Despite tasting success at an early age, Chamari Athapaththu, stand-in skipper of the Sri Lankan Women's team at the 2016 ICC World Twenty20, feels her best is yet to come.
Cricket for her started at the tender age of five. Not by choice, though. Pushed into the game by her cricket-crazy father and uncle, Athapaththu didn't enjoy the sport as much as her friends did. Eventually, she did develop an interest and it soon became a part of her daily routine.
A Public Health Inspector, Athapaththu's father motivated his only child to consider a career in cricket. So that his 'lazy' child wouldn't complain, the father religiously dropped her to the training and picked her back up in evenings. That her uncle, Chandra Dissanayaka was a coach helped her get the basics in place in a city where there were not enough facilities for girls back in the day.
Once her performances at the school and district level started to get noticed, Colts Cricket Club signed up the young all-rounder and Athapaththu had to leave her former side Kurunegala Cricket Club, and the city to move to Colombo - a three-hour ride from her home and parents.
When Athapaththu started training in Colombo, her coach Harsha de Silva spotted the aggressive trait in her batting. Instinctively, he promoted the prodigious pupil to bat up in the order instead of her regular No. 7 position. Soon enough, despite the presence of a bunch of established openers in their ranks, young Athapaththu's raw power helped her seal a spot in the club's opening combination.
When the runs started flowing in, the fast bowler in Athapaththu phased out, and the 26-year-old has no regrets.
Years of hard work paid off when Athapaththu found her name amongst the 14-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup at home in 2008. The celebrations at home were short lived, though. A week before her much-anticipated national debut, Athapaththu lost her father to a heart attack. "That was a really tough time for me. He is my hero. He inspired me to take up cricket, but his passing was heartbreaking," Athapaththu told Cricbuzz in an exclusive chat.
All of 18, Athapaththu withdrew her name from the squad and took an indefinite break to be with her mother. A retired nurse, the mother made her choose cricket when Athapaththu decided against leaving her back alone in their home town.
Two months later, backed by her mother's motivation, Athapaththu resumed training in Colombo. Subsequently, she made her international debut at the 2009 ICC Women's World Twenty20 in England, and three days after her return, the Ibbagamuwa Central College student wrote her graduation exams. She is now a commerce graduate.
Even today, as the five-day-a-week practice routine continues for all members of the national team at the Max Cricket Academy in the R Premadasa Stadium premises, Athapathathu can spare only weekends for her mother. "We have a lot of inheritance back home and she looks after it. Also, she doesn't enjoy the city life in Colombo," said Athapaththu. It is 11 in the night usually by the time she makes it home on Friday nights after training.
Since losing her role model her father, Athapaththu's mother has been her pillar of support. So much so that going against the cultural norms, she has shielded her cricketer daughter from the extended family who have wanted Athapaththu to quit the game and settle down. "People don't really encourage cricket as a career, especially for girls. There are pressures to get married and have kids, but she backs me a lot," Athapaththu remarked.
Nuwan Zoysa, the current assistant coach of the Sri Lankan Women's team, likened her to one of the greatest destructive openers Matthew Hayden, but Athapaththu says her idol growing up was Sri Lanka's original maestro, Sanath Jayasuriya. "I loved watching Jayasuriya play. At the start of my career, I used to try copying him, but now, I have my own style of batting."
By her own admission, Athapaththu lost her touch just when the World T20 was around the corner. As a senior batter and vice-captain, the onus has been on her to get the team off to an explosive start in powerplay.
The one week in between their last bilateral fixtures, against India in Ranchi in February, and time they flew out again for the mega event was spent rectifying the mistakes. Her numbers 89 from 3 outings including top scores of 34 and 38 against Ireland and Australia respectively reflect the amount of hard work that went into regaining lost confidence.
Honing her skills alongside Shashikala Siriwardene, current captain and inarguably the best women cricketer to emerge from the island nation, has been a great learning experience for Athapaththu, she admitted. "We grew up playing together, she's been my inspiration, and to a lot of others, I am sure.
"We learn a lot under her. Her captaincy is quite aggressive, but otherwise she is very calm. I have learnt a lot under her (as a vice-captain). She has immense respect for other players and their ideas," Athapaththu, who was handed the reigns of the team after a hamstring injury forced Srirwardene out of the ongoing World T20, added.
"Her absence was a huge loss for us. Losing an experienced player and a captain like her (in the middle of an important tournament) was not easy for my team."
Despite the advantage of knowing the subcontinental conditions better than a majority of the teams at the World T20, Sri Lanka's campaign ended prematurely. But rather than dwelling on the past that can't be changed, Athapaththu is keen to improve on the team's shortcomings before the 2017 ICC Women's World Cup comes knocking.
"Our openers batted very well to give us good starts, but we didn't quite execute as well in the death overs. (When we go back,) we'll work on getting singles, rotating the strike and pacing our innings. Fielding and bowling lapses cost us heavily. We could have saved some 15-20 runs more, I feel."
Since the Sri Lanka Cricket Board took charge, one of the biggest gains for the women's game has been the opportunity to train at the same state-of-the-art academy as the men's side. The coaching sessions from Lasith Malinga and Mahela Jayawardene come as an added bonus.
While the scenario back home is changing for the better from the time she first picked up a bat, Athapaththu admits that this Sri Lankan team has a long way to go before the women attain the same status as the men's side.
"To get (that kind of) fame, we need to win a tournament. We have been good in the shorter formats of the game, but not consistent. We didn't click as a unit in this World Cup, which was our main failure. "We have a good foundation now. School cricket is encouraged, and then there are various age-level tournaments as well as club cricket. Girls are now considering the game as a career option," Athapaththu, who hails from the same city as Rangana Herath, noted.
"We have plenty of potential in our side, but we need game-experience. The likes of Shashikala have some solid international experience behind them. By the time the next 50-over World Cup comes up, we should be able to build a good team, hopefully," she signed off on a positive note.
There could be thousands of Chamari Athapaththus hidden in the wondrous places of Sri Lanka. Athapaththu rose above social stigma and family pressures to lead the Sri Lankan Women's team at the ICC World T20. Here's hoping her story reaches out to many such women and opens doors to the joys of sport.
