‘Government committed to transitional justice’: Harsha at UNHRC

Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva told the 34th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission that Sri Lanka was committed to transitional justice and constructive engagement with all stakeholder.
“This country knows, no country’s human rights record is perfect,” the Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister said. “Although much has been done, much still remains to be done.”
The Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister went onto say that Sri Lanka had co-sponsored Resolution 30/1 because it was committed to upholding human rights, justice and rule of law.
Dr. de Silva did not directly address UNHRC Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein’s appreciation of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms report, which contains the proposal for a ‘hybrid’ court with the participation of international judges, but promised engagement with all stakeholders. 
Sri Lanka has vowed a credible domestic mechanism, saying the inclusion of foreign judges was contrary to the Constitution,  'not feasible', and would not be allowed.
