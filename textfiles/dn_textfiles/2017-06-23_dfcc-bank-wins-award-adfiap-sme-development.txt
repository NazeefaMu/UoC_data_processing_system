The ADFIAP Awards are held to honour members that have contributed significantly to the development of their respective countries.

Commenting on the ADIFAP recognition, Arjun Fernando, CEO, DFCC Bank, said, “DFCC Bank values its membership of ADFIAP, a premier association which has done yeoman service in promoting the cause of small and medium enterprises in the Asia Pacific region.
We take pride in being awarded under the SME Development category for setting up a specialised unit for development of MSMEs.
We have upheld this commitment to our common goals as a member by supporting and developing the small and medium sector in Sri Lanka through financing and technical inputs.
