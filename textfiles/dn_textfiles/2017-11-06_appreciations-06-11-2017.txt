[APPRECIATIONS - (06-11-2017)]

David E. P. A. Senevirathne
He was a beacon of light
Since its inception, the tapestry of the cooperative movement in Sri Lanka has been studded with many a precious gem. The late David Senevirathne was veritably one of them. His dedication and devotion to the cooperative movement is indescribable. The writer is compelled by obligation to pen a few lines in appreciation on this colossus on behalf of his fellow villagers before his third month remembrance. In fact, writing on him is writing about the genesis of the concept of cooperative living in this locality of Baddegama, a few miles away from the city of Galle on the southern tip of Sri Lanka.
For me, the late David Senevirathne, popularly known as 'Senevirathne mahathmaya,' was invariably a father figure and a beacon light in my formative years of emotional development. In the dark years, he was the lighthouse that regulated social navigation. How he commanded this recognition is an exemplary saga for the young prodigies of the village to emulate. My appreciative diction would propel the young generation to tread his path and contribute for the uplift of not only the cooperative movement in the southern province, but also the social fabric in which he thrived and served, I humbly believe.
The late E. P. A. Senevirathne’s lineage itself commands social recognition. His parents hail from Welipenna Copi Watta Walawwa in Matugama. The famous idiom ‘burn midnight oil’ is quite applicable to his long way to success in education. The bottle lamp, now almost a thing of the past, illuminated his life. He had his elementary education at G/Weihena Primary School in Baddegama and later, he entered G/Suduwelipotha Junior School for his secondary education. It was the golden period of national revival and DR. G. G. Malalasekara and other Sinhala veterans had come forward to re-establish the pristine glory of our indigenous culture. The late E. P. A. Senevirathne joined them and started to wear the national dress. The principal of the school who was hell-bent on English education suspended him for one week from attending the school as the punishment. He preferred to learn commerce and his parents were instrumental in giving him a private education to achieve his aim.
He came off with flying colours in his chosen field of study and joined the co-operative union of Baddegama as an account clerk. This is his first step into the sphere of co-operative movement in our country and his greatest desire was to contribute his share for the uplift of the co-operative movement in the locality in particular and in Sri Lanka in general. This promising co-operative worker became an assistant teacher of commerce in 1961 and his first appointment was to G/Wanduramba Central College. Pirivena education was very popular during this period and he passed his G. C. E. (A/L) Examination from Sri Rathnasara Pirivena, Baddegama, under the able guidance of the late Ven. Ganegama Saranankara Thera. He entered the Maharagama Teachers’ College in 1964, where he cut his teeth as a professional teacher. Teaching commerce was his forte. There, he fired another salvo against the tradition of using the fork and spoon at the hostel and made his name as a true patriot.
His life was full of interesting anecdotes and once he had visited Chief Prelate Ven. Bambarende Siri Sivali to invite him to a sermon. He served on the tutorial staff of Richmond College from 1969 to 1972. His next school was G/Wanduramba Central College and while in service, he followed the Higher Education Diploma in Accountancy at the Galle Techincal College. Thus he became better qualified to serve the co-operative movement with confidence.
He was politically victimized in 1978 and was transferred to Mannar. Later, he was able to come to Aluthgama Maha Vidyalaya and he ended his illustrious teaching career at G/Gonapinuwala Maha Vidyalaya in the Galle district. He was later promoted to the second tire of the educational administrative service in recognition of his yeoman service to education and political victimization which was the order of the day before human rights gained its due place in our country.
His co-operative saga began when he joined the Baddegama East Co-operative Credit and Thrift Society in 1960. He climbed up the ladder of the co-operative hierarchy systematically from the post of secretary to the top-most post, the president, within a very short period of time.
The building complex of the Baddegama East Co-operative Credit and Thrift Society that stands at Weihena on the Baddegama - Wanduramba road, bears ample testimony for his dedication and commitment to the community service. The then Vice President late Piyasena Rillagoda was instrumental in his noble service to his hometown. He was the pillar behind his success. The SANASA Co-operative building in Baddegama, the longest of this kind in our country, is the brainchild of this colossus figure of unmatchable stature; it is the living edifice of his soul. The Baddegama tea smallholders co-operative tea factory is another beneficiary of his co-operative service saga. The whole village underwent a revolutionary co-operative revival under his golden touch. In other words, everything he touched turned into gold in co-operative sense. His name goes down in the annals of the co-operative history as the longest-serving president in the sphere of Sri Lanka. To put it in a nutshell, where the word sounds co-operative, Senevirathne is echoed.
He breathed his last on August 16, 2017. He was born on March 16, 1936. The third month remembrance is scheduled to be held in a grand manner on November 17. His widowed wife, Habaraduwa Hewage Gunawathie, is always in praise of his immesurable service to the family and the people in the vicinity. He left his beloved sons Dayanath, Asiri and his only daughter Ganga Tharanganie in lifelong sorrow. Yet, his eldest son has already taken the batton to continue his yeoman service to the country, following his father’s footsteps. His daughters-in-law Manomi Dhammika Chandrasekara and Chamila Suhadini Wiesinghe and his son-in-law Vikum Rudrigu lost their great mentor forever. His grandchildren Naduni Nimasha, Thenuli Thihara, Thavindu Isuranga and Rashini Kavish Rudrigu were deprived of grandparenting in their most crucial period of emotional development.
People of his calibre are rarely born. David E. P. A. Senevirathne was one of them. He possessed both sense and sensibility in serving the people, a rare trait that the modern society is poignantly lacking.
As his third month remembrance is in the offing, I hope, it is quite opportune to pin a great saying from our bard William Shakespeare in recognition of his perseverance to serve the co-operative movement.
Praying what is lost,
Makes the remembrance dear
- William Shakespeare (All’s Well that Ends Well)
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana at the completion of his journey in samsara!

Percy Handy
A beloved friend
Percy Charles Athputharajh Handy was born on August 29, 1925, into an illustrious family of Rev. J. T. N. Handy and Rosie Handy. His father, Rev. J. T. N. Handy MBE, was Private Secretary to the Chief Justice of Singapore during World War 2.
At the height of the war, when the Japanese had overrun Malaya and were about to capture Singapore, Percy, his mother and sisters were sent to Ceylon by his father. The family was received in Colombo by his father's brother Dr. G. R. Handy, who was a leading cardiologist at the General Hospital, Colombo, at that time.
Percy was soon admitted to St. John's College, Jaffna. However, his time at St. John’s came to an end in 1945, when he had to go back to Singapore. He graduated from the University Malaya, Singapore and came back to Ceylon. His father also returned to Ceylon and was appointed as the Secretary of the Anglican Diocese of the Church of Ceylon. Percy started his career with the Bank of Ceylon and was a manager for two decades. Later, he joined the Hatton National Bank as Assistant General Manager and served for 12 years. He was the only boy in the family and his sisters were late Ranee (wife of the late Prof. C. J. Eliezer), late Rathi(wife of the late Rev. A. J. C. Selvaratnam, former Warden of St. Thomas’ College, Mt Lavinia), late Ranji(wife of former Cabinet Minister late Maithiripala Sennanayake), Ria(wife of Dr. M. D. Daniel of USA)and Anto(wife of Joe Samuel, formerly of Samuel and Sons).
Percy married Arunthathy Tissanayagam, who was a teacher at Chundikuli Girls’ College, Jaffna. He and Arunthathy were keen tennis players. They were blessed with two children; Indran and Malawho. Dilhan, Johann and Natalie are his loving grandchildren. Percy always took an active part in church activities. Finally, he settled down in Melbourne, Australia, with his children and grandchildren. In October, last year, he answered the call from his Maker.

L. A. Gunasekera
A noble mother
I write this appreciation with much feelings as the seventh death anniversary of my mother, L. A. Gunasekera, which falls on November 10 nears. Feelings of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of her. Feelings of sadness that she is no longer with us to share life's joys and sorrows. We miss her, but we know that she is free from pain now. We remember her as a loving mother, friend and silent social worker with love and gratitude.
Mother hailed from a distinguished family of Matara. She was a lady par excellence. It could be said that there was a place in her heart for everyone she came into contact with. She was also respected by one and all for her sympathy, affection and compassion. She was also one who walked among the cream of society, but never lost the common touch. Such was her unique calibre.
We loved her in life and we shall not forget her in death. Her passing away came as an irreparable loss to all.
She was married to Dublin de Silva, a businessman of Matara and was blessed with 10 children. Her eldest son, Ivan De Silva, was the Secretary to the Mahaweli Development Ministry in the past government.
I will be failing in my duty if I do not mention her sister-in-law, Anura de Silva, who looked after her as a Florence Nightingale during her long illness, at her ancestral home in Kamburugamuwa, Matara.
May she attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!
Four years ago, on this sad day
The one we loved was called away
God took her home, it was his will
But in our hearts, she lives still.

Ranee Eliezer
She was a dedicated community worker
Ranee Eliezer (nee Handy) was called to rest by her Maker on October 9, 2017. She was the eldest daughter of the late Rev. J. T. N. and late Rose Handy. Ranee, though born in Malaya, moved to Singapore where her father was the Director of Social Services. Her siblings were Rathie, Percy, Ranji, Ria and Anto.
During the Japanese occupation of Singapore in the 1940’s, her family was sent to Ceylon for safety by boat by her father. On their way, their boat was bombed by a Japanese aircraft, but they were picked up by a passing British troop ship and reached Ceylon safely. The family settled down in Kopay, Jaffna.
Soon, Ranee started teaching at St John’s College, Jaffna, where her grandfather, the late Rev. C. C. Handy, had been the first Ceylonese Principal. In 1944, she married Christie Jeyam Eliezer, a lecturer of mathematics at the University of Colombo. Her husband, within a short time, took up the Chair of the Department of Mathematics and later, was made the Dean of the Faculty of Science. Eliezer by this time, had gained many international academic accolades and was recognised as one of world’s leading scientists. Both of them travelled widely as her husband had to attend many international conferences and be resident in some countries on well-earned sabbatical leave.
The family moved to Malaya in 1959 and after ten years or so, in 1969, they settled down in Melbourne, Australia. Ranee gained her Preliminary Masters in Archaeology and Anthropology during this time. Her thesis looked at the history of Tamils in Australia; tracing back to their arrival in the1880’s. Her interest was always on Jaffna and Tamil culture. She was a dedicated community worker.
After the demise of her husband, she wrote the book 'Conquering Scientist.' This book spells out details of her family, as well as many of her husband’s scientific and mathematical equations, his achievements and his fight for justice. Of her siblings, all have gone beyond the veil except Ria and Anto.
The Eliezer’s leave behind five children, seven grandchildren and five great grandchildren May she rest in peace and rise in glory!

Mifraz Namiz
A sportsman par excellence
We were making Dua for his speedy recovery, but Allah's decision reigned supreme. Mifraz Namiz passed away on October 8, 2017.
Mifraz was an athlete of the highest calibre, who excelled in many sports and brought honour for Zahira and a classy batsman who could easily rival his better-known contemporaries Atapatthu, Dharmasena and so forth.
A super century against the star-studded Nalanda at Campbell Place in 1989, prompted the Observer to scream 'Gallant Zahirians Steal the Limelight,' while reporting on that week's schools tournament. Later on in the season, during a knockout cricket match, he scored a power-packed century to beat Thurstan and reach the quarter finals. Unfortunately, the College withdrew from the tournament due to the month of Ramadhan. Players opted to play with fasting, but when the plea was refused, Mifraz and his team respected the management's decision albeit with a heavy heart. He always felt it was a tournament that Zahira could have won.
He lost his teeth while facing the Ananda bowlers, due to an uneven bounce problem in the matting wicket. When Ananda was batting in reply they had to face the barrage of Zahirian pacers, injuring a couple of players including Atapatthu. Fearing further injuries, the Ananda team requested Zahira to call-off play as the big match against Nalanda was around the corner. Mifraz accepted it and as an appreciation, the Zahira team was honoured by Ananda in their big match as special guests. To my knowledge, that was the only occasion where Ananda honoured an entire cricket team in this prestigious annual encounter. Whereas his contemporary schoolboys such as Atapatthu, Jayasuriya, Dharmasena were highly talented cricketers, Namiz was an excellent cricketer, footballer (he captained the College in both), ruggerite, hockey player and a successful athlete as well.
He was also appointed as the College Senior Prefect. These are only some of his on-field exploits. They do, however, reflect the larger accomplishments of Mifraz during his lifetime. Zahira is proud of him.
He was also very fond of getting youngsters to get involved in sports. When schools were closed in late 80's due to the incessant curfews, he got the boys in the neighbourhood to play cricket and kept them busy in a gainful manner. He never stopped grooming youngsters. A gutty person, even on the day before admission to hospital he has been involved in training them. He dedicated a large part of his life to uplift Zahira's education and sports through the BOG, OBA, PPT, G90 and a host of other groups and committees. Overall, he was a helpul human being with fine qualities, dearly loved by his family and friends.
May Allah reward him with the highest felicity in Jennathul Firdause.
