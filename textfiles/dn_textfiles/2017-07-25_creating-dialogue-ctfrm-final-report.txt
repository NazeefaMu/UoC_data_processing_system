Creating dialogue on CTFRM Final Report

Sri Lanka underwent a 30 - year long civil war, during which period democratic processes were hindered by emergency laws and other procedures brought in to ensure security and sovereignty of the nation. Following the end of war in 2009, the 18th amendment was passed in Parliament, abolishing independent commissions, thereby threatening independent and accountable judicial and governing processes.
The post war period up to January 2015 was marked with a period where democracy and human rights were curtailed by the government throughout the country especially in the North and East. During the post war period, the country’s political and social culture transformed into a situation where it was marred with corruption, violence, extremism and thuggery.
There were strong allegations against Sri Lanka, locally and internationally, that both during the long decades of civil war and during the post war period, the Rule of Law was severely threatened leading to a variety of human rights abuses throughout the country, as judiciary and inter related authorities for administration and execution of justice processes were also politically interfered. Freedom and space for expression and freedom for citizen’s movements were severely threatened, therefore the public did not have access to accurate information and news, and media found it an uphill task to access or disseminate accurate information.
New government
With the establishment of the majority party coalition government in Sri Lanka in 2015, one of the main priorities was to expedite and implement a holistic reconciliation process, which will pave the way for a more united and cohabited population within the country, which is essential for Sri Lanka to reach its development agenda’s aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The new government also intended to stabilize and improve Sri Lanka’s relations with the international world, through implementing a consultative deeply examined and analysed evidence based reconciliation process, which will analyse and address root causes for the long civil conflict, introduce a justice and healing process which will examine and address all human rights abuses and issues which took place during the long years of the civil conflict and post conflict eras in the country.
“Examining the painful past, acknowledging it and understanding it, and above all transcending it together, is the best way to guarantee that it does not, and cannot happen again”. Based on this cardinal principle, the Government in 2015 appointed the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms. They recorded testimonies of over 7,000 Sri Lankans from around the country, many of them victims of human rights violations. They officially handed over its Final Report on the island-wide public consultations on the design of the Transitional Justice Mechanisms to the Chairperson of the Task Force on of January 3, 2017 at the Presidential Secretariat.

Although the Task Force was the brainchild of the Prime Minister and its report praised by Human Rights defenders, the government immediately distanced itself from the report as many members of the government expressed unease about it.
This has resulted in the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms (CTFRM) report not being publicized widely and wide public debate on the report not taking place. The report was only circulated among selected Human Rights defenders.
Therefore, the public knowledge on the report and the role of the Task Force is limited to statements and interpretations of third parties.
Centre for Human Rights (CHR) through its long term interaction with diversified stakeholders, on issues during the civil unrest period and longer term human rights abuses in the country, is of the opinion that it is a priority to create awareness and discussion on the Final Report of the CTFRM among the public.
A constructive debate /dialogue on it among diversified elements of society can be used to understand the content which includes challenges, dilemmas and questions for further dialogue and formulate action plans to implement key recommendations from the Final Report in order to address the issues from the past and gather wider public contribution and engagement towards future reconciliation processes in the country.
