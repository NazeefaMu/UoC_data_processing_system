Unity Government achievements

The Unity Government, which was voted into power in 2015, has made several strides in various aspects of governance—from rescuing the economy and restoring people’s confidence in the judiciary to empowering law enforcement agencies.
In his message commemorating three years since coming to power, Prime Minister Ranil
Wickremesinghe noted that while there is still much left for the government to accomplish, it has nonetheless been able to achieve feats that would have been unthinkable under a different regime.
“The Unity Government has implemented the 17th amendment to the Constitution, giving life to the Constitutional Council and Independent Commissions which allow the police, judiciary, and public service at large to act according to their conscience and not the whims of the political masters of the day,” he said.
“We have passed legislation enshrining the right to information for all citizens and the right to assistance and protection for those citizens who are victims of crimes or witnesses before the law.”
Below are some of the notable tangible achievements of the Unity Government since it came in to power.
