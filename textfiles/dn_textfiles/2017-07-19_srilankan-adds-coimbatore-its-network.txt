SriLankan adds Coimbatore to its network

SriLankan Airlines announced the launch of new services from July 16 to Coimbatore, the second largest city in India’s southern state of Tamil Nadu.
The airline will be offering a four-times-a-week service to Coimbatore, connecting the state’s second largest city to the world through its global route network.
Coimbatore is one of three South Indian cities that SriLankan commenced operating to from this week, together with Visakhapatnam on July 8 and Hyderabad July 8.
With these additions, SriLankan now operates 126 flights per week to 14 cities in India, with existing services to Chennai, Trichy, Trivandrum, Mumbai, New Delhi, Gaya, Madurai, Varanasi, Kochi, Bangalore and Kolkata.
SriLankan Airlines’ Chief Commercial Officer Siva Ramachandran said: “We are delighted to extend our services to yet another vibrant city in Tamil Nadu, offering travelers a seamless travel experience from their doorstep to the rest of the world via our global network. The new destination indeed would further strengthen ties between both countries, promoting two way travel for leisure, business, MICE tourism, pilgrimages, health requirements and education.”
The new service would offer travelers from Coimbatore direct travel to Sri Lanka to enjoy its many tourist attractions and experience for themselves the reasons why the island is fast becoming one of the most highly sought after tourism destinations in the world.
The new services by SriLankan would also facilitate the business community in Coimbatore, a major hub in South India for textiles, industries, commerce, education, information technology, healthcare and manufacturing and offer enhanced opportunities for rapid and seamless transport of all types of cargo throughout SriLankan’s network.
The uniqueness of the new service will be that travelers can now enjoy SriLankan award-winning onboard hospitality with the airline’s ultra-modern fleet of Airbus aircraft which possess the most sophisticated in-flight entertainment systems and superior comforts. SriLankan’s brand new A320neo and A321neo aircraft are operating on its routes to South India.
The addition of Visakhapatna, Hyderabad and Coimbatore will expandSriLankan’s global route network to 105 cities in 47 countries.
