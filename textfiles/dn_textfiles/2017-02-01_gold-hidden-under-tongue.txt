Gold hidden under tongue

Two Sri Lankans bound for Trivandrum, India were held at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday morning, after Customs officers found four gold nuggets, weighing 108 grams hidden beneath their tongue. Deputy Customs Director Parakrama Basnayake said the Customs officers had found that the two individuals had difficulty talking when they had stopped the duo for a routine inspection of their hand luggage.
Further inspection revealed that the two were hiding two gold nuggets each beneath their tongue. Basnayake said that the gold seized were worth about Rs. 1 million.
Investigations revealed that the two men in their fifties are brothers.
They had travelled to India on several occasions recently. According to Basnayake, the gold was confiscated and the two were fined Rs. 50,000 each. The raid was conducted by Assistant Customs Superintendents Buddhi Bandara, Sudhira Perera, Hasantha Kaushalya, Mahesh Gunetikele, Buddhi Bandara, Thisarana Gunasekera, and Rahamathullah Razeen.
