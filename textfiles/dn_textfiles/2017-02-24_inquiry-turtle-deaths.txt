Inquiry into turtle deaths

The Tangalle Magistrate and District Judge Mahee Wijeweera ordered the Tangalle Police and the Fisheries Inspector of Tangalle to conduct an investigation into the sudden deaths of turtles.
He ordered them to submit a report on the deaths of the turtles. A large number of turtles were found dead in the coastal belt from Hambantota to Tangalle for reasons unknown. He said the turtles must have got entangled in fishing nets of the fisher folk set up to catch Madu fish and the turtles may have died of suffocation.
