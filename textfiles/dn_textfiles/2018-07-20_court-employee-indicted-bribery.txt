Court employee indicted for bribery

A court employee who accepted a bribe to release the driving licence in court custody has been indicted.
Panadura Provincial High Court Judge Dhamith Thotawatte fixed the case for trial for November 14.
In this case, an employee was indicted by the Attorney General with accepting Rs 7,000 from a driver, B. N. Malinda who was produced before Court by the Panadura North police on September 9, 2011 regarding a traffic offence.
She had accepted Rs 7,000 from the accused driver to hand over his driving licence held under Court custody.
When the accused appeared before Court on July 18 on previous bail her Lawyer Sumedha Perera informed Court that he had not received a certified copy of a complaint made to the CID by B. N. Malinda.
The attorney said without this complaint, he is unable to proceed with the trial.
The judge ordered the State Counsel to provide the certified copy of the first complaint of the complainant to the defence lawyer and postponed trial for November 14.
