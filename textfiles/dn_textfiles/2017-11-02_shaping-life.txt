Shaping up life

The Sri Lankan National Cadet Corps which has a history of more than 100 years has produced youth of sterling character. The cadets develop personalities similar to those of a perfect soldier. They are brave, tough, resilient and resourceful and have been trained to face challenges, obstacles and adversity. They are some of the finest youth emerging in Sri Lanka, and have the fiber and qualities demanded by the 21st century in order to survive and succeed. They are fighters. Indeed the motto of the National Cadet Corps of Sri Lanka is ‘Never be unprepared’
Out of over numerous senior boy cadet platoons in the island, the Centenary Hermann Loos Challenge Trophy, was awarded to the all island overall champion boy cadet platoon of the year 2017 - De Mazoned College Kandana.
The cadet camp in Rantambe had duration of ten days featuring the crème de la crème of talent in Sri Lankan Cadetting. There was a representation of Cadets from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and the Maldives at this momentous occasion.

State Minister of Defence, Ruwan Wijewardene who was the Chief Guest praised the Cadet Corp for molding the future generation of Sri Lanka. The State minister called it a unique experience in a lifetime.
“I wish to congratulate the cadets taking part in this event and extend my warmest wishes to the officers who trained these cadets. One hundred years is a great milestone. No doubt these young cadets will provide the leadership required to take our country forwards. The country is in their hands and the future of our country is secure.
They will take up key leadership positions in this country. The discipline and practical lessons they learn will enable them to function efficiently and swiftly. They will certainly render a great service to the country,” said Wijewardene.
Wijewardene also stated that the Sri Lankan government is every ready to assist the youth of this country which is a great resource. The youth must be disciplined and ever ready to act on behalf of the country. It was the late John. F. Kennedy that said – ‘And so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.’
“The youth must be trained to face hardships with determination and with courage.

They need to be dedicated and disciplined. The government of this country has recognized the importance of the Sri Lankan National Cadet Corps and is keen on its progression. We must be ever ready as Sri Lankans to be victorious and triumphant. We have won a brutal war and no doubt the National Cadet Corps has had a hand in producing competent officers.
This curriculum is comprehensive. We are indebted to these officers,” explained Wijewardene. The Minister used this occasion to thanks all those who fought for the freedom of our country. The minister also said that the education of students must not be limited only to exams, classwork and tuition.
Extra-curricular activities are also needed. We live in a tuition oriented culture where the children are deprived of physical activities that have a detrimental impact on their personality development. Cadetting is an excellent way to develop the mind and body which brings to ones’ mind an old Latin quote: ‘Mens Sana in Corpore sano’ – a Healthy Mind in a Healthy Body’
“The field of sports inculcates life lessons in these students that cannot be taught in the classroom. The development of the mind and the body is essential. The child needs to be exposed to a variety of experiences. The mental health if a child is an investment for the future. Its significance must be understood. The child learns how to overcome problems,” stated Wijewardene.
Finally the Minister pointed out that friendships developed during the camp are priceless and the camp has no doubt been a success. The Minister also addressed the foreign cadets who were present that day and thanked them for being a part of the Centenary Hermann Loos trophy. “I hope this has been a great experience for all of you. Cadetting is about building up the character and leadership of young people. I hope all of you will become fine leaders of the country you represent. Undoubtedly you will shape the future of the country you represent,” Minister added.
Daily News also spoke to Senior Under Officer of the Indian National Cadet Corps Shivi Badyal who called it a great honour to be a cadet. Badyal who was present at the ceremony showed a lot of charisma which is due to her officer training. She has become a confident young woman of the 21st century ready to serve her motherland. She shared her views on what it means to be a cadet.
“Definitely I am thinking of joining the army after I pass out. I am definitely ready to fight if necessary for my country. My mother initially made me join the Cadet Corps and I do not regret the decision. Sri Lanka is such a beautiful country and I am privileged to be here. Since our stay in Sri Lanka we have had a varied cultural experiences. I am proud to be a cadet,” said Badyal.
