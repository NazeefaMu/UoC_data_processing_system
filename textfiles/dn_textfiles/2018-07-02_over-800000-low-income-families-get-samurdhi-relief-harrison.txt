Over 800,000 low income families to get Samurdhi relief: Harrison

The government will grant Samurdhi relief to 800,000 families within the next 18 months. Initially, 200,000 families will be provided Samurdhi dividends, Social Empowerment Minister P. Harison said.
The Minister was participating in a official tour in Anuradhapura, Medawachchiya and Ikirigollewa to look into the problems that Samurdhi recipients are undergoing recently.
He said the Divisional Secretaries, Samurdhi Development Officers and Grama Niladharis are made aware of the revised samurdhi vision mission and of the strategies to implement the project more efficiently and successfully. The basic requirement of Samurdhi recipients will be their monthly income - Rs. 6,000 or less.
“Average national poverty level was 6.7 oer cebt in 2012 and it decreased to 4.1 per cent now as per the survey and progress review reports. The Samurdhi Banks maintain assets worth Rs. 144 billion at present. The investment exceeds Rs. 100 billion. Under the revised Samurdhi programme, steps are taken to save the low income group, especially rural women from micro business racket and companies,” the Minister said.
The Minister said the Samurdhi Bank is a tiny banking institute sans modern facilities.
“It serves only to the low income families. “We will increase the loan limit from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 2.5 million provided for the bank customers. Issues of Samurdhi Managers and Development Officers will be addressed very soon,” the Minister said. The Minister said the Samurdhi banks are poorly maintained. “Samurdhi means prosperity. Samurdhi recipients and the Samurdhi banks must prosper and achieve their goals, Minister Harrison said.
The Minister said the beneficiary families must be empowered socially and monetarily. A drugs and alcohol prevention programme is going on now under Samurdhi Beneficiary Programme. A counseling programme was launched to address alcoholism among rural people, the Minister said.
