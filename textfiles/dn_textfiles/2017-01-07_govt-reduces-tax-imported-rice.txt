Govt reduces tax on imported rice

The government decided to reduce tax on imported rice with effect from midnight yesterday.
This decision was taken by the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living which met at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
The Committee comprises Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Special Task Force Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Badiudin. The soaring price of rice in the current market was discussed at the meeting.
Customs duty of Rs.50, 15 percent VAT, 7.5 percent Port and Airport Levy and two percent Nation Building Tax per kilogram of rice have been removed. However, a special commodity levy of Rs. 15 per kilogram of imported rice will be imposed.
This will be effective from midnight. Taxes have been reduced for rice varieties such as Samba, Nadu and Brown raw rice. However, tax reduction is not applicable to imported Basmati.
The Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living took this decision as a measure to bring relief to the people.
Rice prices have increased due to the prevailing dry weather in the country. This will prevent s traders who hoarded rice stocks and created an artificial shortage in the market to exploit the consumers.
