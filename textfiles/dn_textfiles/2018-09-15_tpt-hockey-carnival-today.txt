TPT Hockey Carnival today

The 4th annual TPT Hockey Carnival organized by the Old Boys of S. Thomas’, St. Peter’s and Trinity College will be held at S. Thomas’ College Grounds, Mount Lavinia on September 15 commencing from 8.30am onwards. The event will be hosted by S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia this year.
The past stickers of Trinity, St.Peter’s and S.Thomas’ colleges (TPT) have put their shoulders together to organize a Seven-a-Side hockey tournament. All three schools have played the game for decades and have produced many who have donned the Sri Lanka jersey.
The TPT hockey carnival is organized for the well being of hockey as a sport and to maintain and strengthen ties between the three schools. Plans are afoot to have this as an annual event as hosted by one of the organizing schools. The inaugural tournament was hosted by S. Thomas’ College in 2015.
The event will be a reunion of past hockey players and also a get-together and they will go down memory lane. Food, beverage and recreational stalls for families and children of the old boys have been organized to make it a fun filled family event.
The tournament will be conducted in six age categories as an under 14, 16, 1st XI teams, 20 to 30, 30 to 40, 40 and over old boys categories. The organizers has decided to conduct the under 14 match from this year.
This will be a very rare occasion where stickers of the three schools who are over forty will be turning the hands of the clock at this carnival.
An opening ceremony will be graced by the Principals of the three schools, school officials and the Old Boys Association President or Secretary.
