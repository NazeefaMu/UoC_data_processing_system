Deen Brothers donates  flyover to Matara Hospital

Deen Brothers, Matara, well-known for their excellence in the field of power tools and machines in the local market, has set off for their welfare voyage of the year by building a flyover which has been an essential requirement in Matara Hospital.
This resolves the issue of moving the patients from the Intensive Care Unit to the operation theatre. Najeeb Deen, the Managing Director of Deen Brothers (Pvt) Ltd opened the flyover on January 3.
The director of the hospital commended their effort by asserting that the cost for anti-bacterial treatment could be largely minimized consequently, thus ensuring the ease and safety of the patients.
This is the second flyover constructed by them for the hospital spending nearly 2 million rupees.
This moment was witnessed by the owner of Deen Brothers (Pvt) Ltd, the director of the hospital, Malkanthi, the assistant director of the hospital, Dr. P. S. Bandara, the staff of Deen Brothers (Pvt) Ltd and several other guests.
Deen Brothers (Pvt) Ltd, celebrating its 25th anniversary is planning to involve in a number of other public welfare programs while they expect to give priority to the particular area of Matara
