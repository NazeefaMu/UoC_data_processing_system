Big Rumble  over a shock  political tumble

his is a script for a teledrama sitcom. The cast includes a family, the father, a leading Colombo lawyer Vijay Gansabhapathi PC, the mother Vimala, a housewife, and son Harin, a university student. A busybody next door neighbour, Rasawathie Ginipella. The Ginipella husband (not in the cast but is often referred to) and wife are portrayed as political opportunists, who sway with any favourable gust of political wind. A smaller cameo role is intended for a Mrs Gutiweera, a battered opposition activist seeking legal help from Mr. Gansabhapathi following a beating. The script, although edited because of space constraints is too long for this regular newspaper column. As such, it will be continued in the same Last Laugh column on Tuesdays.
Script: By Gaston de Rosayro
Continued from last Tuesday:
Vijay: “This is quite a serious matter. If the police are refusing to take action against him then we seem to have a pretty good chance to file a Fundamental Rights Violations case.”
Rasawathie: “That’s why I brought Gutiweera to you. I told her you are a ferocious lawyer. Vijay Gansabhapathi PC. President’s Counsel not Police Constable. You are not afraid of anybody. Ask her? Those are the same words I told her. You are fierce like a lion. Also that you also refused various high posts they told you to come and take even though you did not work for any party. But nothing for my Gini after he is working like a dog. That’s the way with them. Very ungrateful rascals. No guney aney!”
Vijay: “I have already filed two petitions against this man and his cohorts for other clients. I believe this time he has gone too far. I will instruct my juniors to prepare a case in the morning. The TV coverage of the fracas will be used as evidence for the prosecution.”
Vimala: “Yes, this man seems to be going too far. He imagines he is above the law. He has got away with it once too often and now seems to be pushing his luck. Vijay, I think he should be put in his place. Mrs. Kehelmalla told me he is also in cahoots with the underworld.”
Rasawathie: “That’s the right word. Some of his thugs are like real kahuttas, thin like ekels. If you blow pfooh they will fall. But because they only have guns and knives people are keeping quiet and getting hammered.”
Vimala: “Why does everyone tolerate his antics?”
Rasawathie: “You know Vimala, this Maraman Keliya is a real yakka fellow. Real gamaya. No proper education even, no manners. Not even house-trained. Don’t know how to eat with fork and spoon. Can’t speak English even. Pretending he knows, but you can laugh when he opens his big fat mouth. I told Gini, I will entertain anybody but not that idiot in my house! Never, never, never.”
Vimala: “That’s a good thing. You can’t have people of that calibre walking around your home. All your decent, respectable friends and relatives will shudder at the thought of your ever entertaining such a person.”
Harin: “Spot on Amma. People of that calibre know only about the caliber of the weapons they carry.”
Rasawathie: (Ignoring Harin and addressing Vimala) “No Vimala. Never. Never. Never. I will kick his dirty shadow all the way to parliament if he comes near my door again. I told Gini don’t bring him to my house and ask to give whisky and soda and cream crackers and cheese.”
Harin: “Aunty instead of threatening shadow boxing I think you will be doing everyone a favour if you are brave enough to give him a cracker on the ear. He certainly deserves it!”
Vijay: “It’s really all our fault. Many among us expect to get something from these politicians. So we pander to their egos by running after them to secure favourable business deals and seek high postings. It is a malaise of the times. Ours has become a sort of sick system. Sadly, we have lost our sense of values. Frankly, we know that many of them are charlatans and crooks of the highest order milking the state coffers. Yet we make a huge hullabaloo of anointing them and entertaining them in our homes.”
Rasawathie: “Madness! I told you, never, never, never. If he comes again I will show the broomstick.”
Harin: “And you can tell him that it is your usual mode of transportation. I always easily imagine you riding a broomstick!”
Rasawathie: “Cheeky boy. I am sure he is meaning something dirty! Vimala, see he is saying I am riding on a broomstick. Must have learned all these val jokes from those university gamaya kollas no?”
Vimala: “Putha, that’s enough!”
Harin: “I can’t imagine how the sons and daughters of these political chaps face up to the world. How can they go out into decent society when everyone knows what type of person their father is. As for me I might jump into a bus or three-wheeler, but I can still hold my head high, while these politicians’ brats whiz past me in their luxury vehicles. Truly, I am proud of my parents and am grateful for the decent values they have instilled in me.”
Phone rings interrupting the conversation. Harin gets up answers and summons Rasawathie.
Harin: (Calls out to Rasawathie): “Aunty. It’s Uncle Gini. He says that minister Maraman Keliya will be coming over to your home in 45 minutes. He wants you to come immediately and arrange drinks and dinner. Shall I tell him that you will not sight the place and will never entertain a yakka politikka thug?”
Rasawathie: (Excitedly) “Madness! Are you mad chile? Don’t, don’t you tell anything. Maraman Keliya is coming to our house? True ah? All lies, no? What to do. Must run and arrange drinks and everything.
Powerful people, no! How to tell not to come also. Bad for hospitality. Must run now and change my clothes. How to be seen like this, men?” Rasawathie makes a hurried exit to the door. The conversation ceases as the others look on perplexed. Ten seconds pass. Rasawathie returns suddenly, quite agitated. Turns to leave and again faces Mrs Gutiweera.
Rasawathie: (Shamefaced and with hands clasped). “Gutiweera…Aney, please don’t tell anyone I brought you here. Don’t misunderstand, ah. That man Maraman will be very angry with me. You know him, no? Anyway what to do? We must also live. We are poor business people only. Later I will speak to Maraman and see if he is willing to give you some compensation. He is steamrolling in money.”
To be continued next Tuesday
