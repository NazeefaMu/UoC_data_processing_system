IGP calls  for hefty traffic fines

 
Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara yesterday called for hefty fines and penalties to control the surge in driving offences.
Endorsing the government’s decision to impose strict fines and penalties for traffic offences, the IGP said an increase in penalties and fines were mandatory to maintain road discipline and save lives. Addressing officers at the Police Headquarters during an official ceremony to commence work for the New Year, the IGP also urged his subordinates to ensure a corrupt-free and people-friendly service.
“I would like to say an increase in traffic fines is a must. This traffic fine will affect only the ones who do not abide by traffic laws. Others will not be affected by these laws. It is a well known fact that all developed countries strictly implement the law to rein in errant motorists,” he said. IGP Jayasundara also said that high speeding in modernised roads and careless driving have increased road accidents.
“The police alone cannot regulate this situation. A dialogue on traffic issues is already taking place under the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and the minister-in-charge. Police are a key contributor to this dialogue as well. Government officials, intellectuals, experts and the private sector are all in this dialogue as well,” the IGP said.
He said the ‘Parissamen Gihin Enna’ prevention awareness campaign carried out along with Rupavahini Corporation was a major success.
“This term ‘Parissamen Gihin Enna’ prevention awareness campaign, was very popular. It had a cultural value to it. I would like to request our officials of all ranks to adopt this term into their daily conversation with the public. It will infuse a sense of care and positive outlook when you reach the general public. We are planning on continuing with similar prevention campaign programmes together with the private sector as well,” he said.
While noting that the police were responsible for the strict implementation of the law, he added that however, the police officers should remember to professionally deal with the public, speak kindly, use proper wording and be respective.
According to police reports, nearly 3,000 people have died in traffic accidents last year, making Sri Lankan roads among the most dangerous in the world.
The government recently decided to impose a Rs. 25, 000 minimum fine on seven traffic offences which prompted an island wide strike by private bus operators.
