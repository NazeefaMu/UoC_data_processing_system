The root of the matter

The Cancer Care Trust (CCT) and Ramani Fernando Salons together with Lalith Dharmawardena (the only human hair wig manufacturer in Sri Lanka) got together for an agreement to donate wigs made of natural hair to cancer patients. The first chapter of this social service activity was performed at Ramani Fernando Salons, Borella, recently. As a part of this project two custom made wigs will be donated free of charge to cancer patients every month. Ramani Fernando Salons will collect the hair from the donor with a free haircut and dispatch the collection to the manufacturer after blow drying.
