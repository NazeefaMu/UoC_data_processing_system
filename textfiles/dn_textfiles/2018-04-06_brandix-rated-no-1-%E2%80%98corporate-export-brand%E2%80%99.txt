For the fourth consecutive year, leading Apparel Exporter Brandix clinched the number one position under the ‘Corporate Export Brand’ category in the ‘Sri Lanka Brands 2018’ ranking conducted by Brand Finance Lanka.
Brandix has successfully emerged at the forefront in a ranking featuring some of the best Export brands in Sri Lanka across an array of industries such as Apparel, Tea, IT Services, Manufacturing, Printing, Coconut and Rubber.
Significantly, this recognition was bestowed on Brandix at the 15-year celebration of Brand Finance Lanka’s publishing of Sri Lanka’s most valuable and strongest brands.
Brandix attributes its success to the combined effort, relentless passion and positive ‘can do’ spirit of its employees, who are considered the lifeline of the organisation. The company remains committed to delivering ‘Inspired Solutions’ to their customers and communities throughout its entire network of operations, while focusing on strengthening its position in the local and global market landscape, year on year.
The ranking of Sri Lanka’s most valuable and strongest brands was announced by Brand Finance Lanka following detailed analysis of data obtained through an exclusive market research study carried out by an independent market research firm, as well as through publicly available financial information available on companies listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
Brand Finance Lanka, the pioneering brand valuation and strategy firm, is the local representative for Brand Finance Plc, the world’s leading brand valuation consultancy that advises strongly branded organisations on maximising their brand value through effective management of their brands and intangible assets.
