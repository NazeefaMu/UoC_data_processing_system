Judgement deferred in Moratuwa murder case

Panadura High Court (HC) Judge Dammith Thotawatte postponed judgement in a Moratuwa murder case yesterday, as there was no court record that the charge against the accused, had been read out to her in open court.
When the case was taken up, the judge, on perusing case records, found that the former HC judge, who had heard the trial, had not made an entry that he had read out the charge to the accused.In this case, the accused, Thilankathilaka Mudiyanselage Bandara Menika of Moratuwa, is indicted by the Attorney General with committing the murder of her husband Sahabanduge Weerakkody of Moratuwa on April 11, 2009, by slashing his neck with a sharp instrument.
The Judge then inquired from the accused’s lawyer Chanaka Amarasinghe, whether he could remember that the previous judge who heard the case had explained the charge to the accused in open court when the trial began.
The lawyer replied that he could not remember.
The Judge then inquired about this matter from State Counsel Gayani Wegodapola and she had no answer.
The Judge therefore postponed the case to March 7, without delivering the judgement, and remanded the accused till then.
