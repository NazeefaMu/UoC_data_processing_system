Point of view
Equity markets closed at an 18-month high this week, as the benchmark price index gained ~32 points W-o-W to end ~47 points above the key 6700 index level.
Despite an 18 point loss early in the week, the broadshare market index managed to wipe off the losses over the remainder of the week, recovering by ~50 points largely due to active participation by HNI and foreigners.
Tokyo Cement’s strategic transaction (Ube Singapore Holding’s acquired a 10% of stake in TKYO for LKR 769.8Mn) coupled with large parcels in JKH , Hemas , Amana Bank helped drive overall turnover levels, and crossings over the week accounted to 53% of the week’s total turnover of LKR 4.6Bn .
The daily average turnover for the week consequently crossed the LKR 1.0Bn mark for the third consecutive week, averaging LKR 1.15Bn which is ~19% higher than the Y-T-D average turnover of LKR 0.93Bn.
Foreign inflows from equities meanwhile persisted through the week, accounting to LKR 1059.0mn (cf. LKR 408.07mn last week) and helping the net inflow position over June to total LKR 2.76Bn.
The Y-T-D net inflow position to the Colombo bourse consequently remained at LKR 21.56Bn. June inflation figures released on Friday meanwhile, indicated a marginal increase in urban inflation levels (from 6.0% in May to 6.1% Y-o-Y in June) driven primarily by an increase in Food inflation. Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current positive momentum.
World Bank forecasts 2017E GDP at 4.7%
In its semi-annual update on the Sri Lankan economy, the World Bank (WB) projects a ‘relatively favorable’ outlook within the context of policy reforms.
The Group added that the GoSL appears committed to implement its medium-term reform agenda aimed at improving competitiveness, governance and public financial management and that the continuation of reforms along with the IMF program should add to confidence.
The WB also noted that tax policy reforms should help revenue led fiscal consolidation while recent Monetary policy movements have indicated a readiness to take appropriate action to ensure stability resulting in the Group’s more positive outlook on the country.
The WB estimates GDP growth in 2017E to reach 4.7% n 2017E (>5.0 beyond 2017), driven by private consumption and investment.
The Group also noted that the external sector is poised to benefit from the reinstatement of GSP+ to the EU while external buffers are projected to improve, amid the emphasis placed on purchasing foreign exchange, maintaining a flexible FX rate, and the sale of selected government assets.
The WB noted however that its outlook is subject to risks, namely external risks such as disappointing growth in Sri Lanka’s export economies and higher commodity prices, and domestic risks such as delays in passing structural revenue measures and slower than expected improvement in tax administration along with increasing occurrence/impact of natural disasters.
