Another No Confidence Motion against Ravi

 
The Joint Opposition in Parliament is now in the process of collecting signatures for another No-Confidence Motion to be tabled in Parliament next week against
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene.
Addressing a press conference at the Rajagiriya Dr. N. M. Perera memorial Hall yesterday, Gunewardene said the country's foreign exchange reserves had ominously dropped within one year in an unprecedented manner causing a severe devaluation of the rupee. The US Dollar which amounted to Rs 127 in exchange value in 2012, Rs. 129 in 2013 and 131 in 2014 had risen to Rs 147 today.
The petroleum prices in the world market has dropped sharply. One wonders whether the dollar savings made through the issue of sovereign bonds at high interest, Sri Lanka Development Bonds and the Indian loan facility had been gobbled up by some one.
Gunewardene said Sri Lanka was today at a perilous state financially in its entire history.Almost 2 billion dollars invested in Sri Lanka had been withdrawn. It was in the context of the most dangerous financial crisis facing the country that the Prime Minister was trying to change the Budget Proposals by introducing a mini budget.
He said the Common Opposition had asked for a seven day debate on the Mini Budget.
