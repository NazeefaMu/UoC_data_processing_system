‘Gulab  Jamun’  to go on  floors  in 2019?

A lot has been said and written about Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan’s forthcoming film ‘Gulab Jamun’ which reunites the real-life couple after a massive gap of eight years.
Recently, there were reports that the project has been put on the backburner after Phantom Films, the banner bankrolling it, announced its dissolution. However, if fresh reports are to be believed, the project is very much on track and Aish and Junior Bachchan will start shooting for it from January 2019.
Talking about the plotline of Gulab Jamun, the movie revolves around a married couple. The slice-of-life film actually chronicles three generations and will have dollops of emotions, laughter and merriment.
‘Gulab Jamun’ will be produced by Anurag Kashyap who has also written its script. It will be directed by debutant Sarvesh Mewara.
If insiders are to be believed, megastar Amitabh Bachchan, who will shortly be seen in Yash Raj Films’ big-ticket movie ‘Thugs Of Hindostan’, may also play a brief role in the movie.
Meanwhile, Abhishek Bachchan is presently shooting for Anurag Basu’s next which is speculated to be a sequel to the latter’s 2007 urban relationship drama ‘Life In A Metro’.
