Tornado devastates Kannattiya, Ruwangama

A tornado swept across Kannattiya and Ruwangama in the Mihintale Divisional Secretariat Division on Saturday afternoon damaging nearly 150 houses. Several houses had their roofs blown off nearly 100 metres. Uprooted trees and broken branches obstructed the Kannattiya-Mihintale road at several place. Mihintale Divisional Secretary Ruwan Ekanayake took swift action to get the roads cleared assisted by Police, public and Grama Niladaris.
Roofs with asbestos sheets were damaged the most. Minister P. Harrison's Co-ordinating Secretary toured the area and provided relief to the affected. A report was being compiled of the total cost of the damage under the Anuradhapura Government Agent to be forwarded to the Disaster Management Ministry, he said.
