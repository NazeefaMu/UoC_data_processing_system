India’s Presidential poll results out on July 20

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to vote for electing the next President of India, in New Delhi on Monday. Voting began at 10 am and ended at 5 pm. Polling stations were set up in the Parliament House and State Assemblies, officials said.
The electorate, comprising Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha members and members of Assemblies, is tilted in favour of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), but the Opposition is working to seek support of some regional parties in favour of its candidate.
The NDA nominee is former Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind and a combination of 14 Opposition parties have declared former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar as their Presidential candidate. The Election Commission had appointed 33 observers to oversee the conduct of the election.
While two observers were present in the Parliament House, one each was deployed in the respective Assemblies. - THE HINDU
