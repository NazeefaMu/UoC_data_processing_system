Frontline Socialist Party May Day Rally at Fort private bus station

Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) May Day Rally themed at “Working Masses, Arise against the Neo-Liberal Imperialist Program” will be held at the Fort private bus station from 2.00 p.m, FSP Member Chameera Koswatte said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said the May Day Rally would be followed by two vehicle parades on April 29 from 9.00 a.m. The two vehicle parades will arrive in Colombo from Kandy and Galle, Koswatte said. He said FSP May Day Rally will be based on slogans to ensure the rights of the public. “Absorbing manpower workers into the permanent work force, abolishing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and other institutions which treat education as a commodity, abolishing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and other repressive laws, forbidding the slave trade to the Middle East, withdrawing the projects that cause environmental destruction and bringing an end to the violation of the pension rights will be focused on the May Day Rally,” Koswatte said.
