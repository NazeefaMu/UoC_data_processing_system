Health Promotion Bureau Director and prominent Epidemiologist Dr. Paba Palihawadana has outlined several measures which should be adopted by the school authorities.
<U+200B>* The class teachers should give instructions to the students in their class room on Influenza prevention and protection. When the class teachers identify a student/ students with symptoms of possible influenza condition, they should inform the student's parents and let the child/children rest in a separate place (separate from the other students).
* Once the class teacher finds out that the student is suffering from fever, a Paracetamol tablet can be given to the student to control fever. Fifteen (15) Milligram of Paracetamol should be given for one kilogram of the weight of the specific child. The calculation should be done accordingly and carefully.
* If the child shows signs of serious illness (sever symptoms), the child should be hospitalized and then the parents should be informed.
* The parents of Influenza infected children should be instructed to feed their child/children with nutritious food.
* The parents should be instructed not to send the child/children to the school, tution classes and sports activities until the child fully recovers from the sickness and become normal and healthy again. Until then, the child should rest at home.
* Since there is a threat from Dengue fever during these days, all symptoms of the Influenza infected children should take extra care and be alert of symptoms.
* All information about Influenza can be obtained by dialing the hot line 0710107107. The service is free of charge and available during 24 hours. Well qualified doctors and Consultants will reply for all inquiries.

(1) To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a handkerchief or tissue when coughing and sneezing.
* In absence of such an item, at least they should cover their face with the help of their elbow.
(2) Smoking raises the risk of contracting influenza, as well as producing more severe disease symptoms. The people should refrain from smoking.
(3) Should not touch eyes, nose or mouth, especially while traveling and in public places.
(4) Everyone should avoid spitting in public.
(5) Wash hands regularly with soap and water or a clean hand with alcohol-based hand rubs is essential.
(6) The used tissues should be disposed carefully and the used handkerchiefs should be washed carefully with germ killer soap/liquid etc before re-using.
(7) Surface sanitizing may help prevent some infections at home, school and office. Alcohol is an effective sanitizer against influenza viruses.

According to various scientific researchers in the world, both influenza A and B viruses survive for 24-48 hours on hard, nonporous surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic but survive for less than 8-12 hours on cloth, paper, and tissues.
The transmission of virus from patients could occur for 2-8 hours via stainless steel surfaces and for a few minutes via paper tissues.
The influenza virus can survive up to 2 to 3 hours in a droplet. Coughing spreads droplets as far as 6 metres, and sneezing as much as 8 metres.
These droplets stay suspended in the air for up to 10 minutes. People with flu can spread it to others up to about 6 feet away.
