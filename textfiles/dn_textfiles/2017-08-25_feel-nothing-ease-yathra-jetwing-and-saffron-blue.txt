Feel nothing but ease!- YATHRA BY JETWING AND SAFFRON & BLUE

Taking the form of a houseboat, Yathra by Jetwing in Bentota allows its guests to transcend into a world of tranquility passing through the scenic views along the Bentara River. The boat sets sail at four in the evening towards the sunset promising breathtaking views with the pastel skies outlining the mangrove forests and little islets on the way. Guests can experience the journey in the comfort of their cabin with a balcony inclusive of minimalistic modern amenities. Feel nothing but ease in the two air-conditioned cabins with attached bathrooms as you float across the river while seated in the turquoise chairs set in the room balcony adding a private moment to the guests.
Come nightfall, dinner will be served at the front deck or under the mesmerizing stars on the top deck. The chef on board specializes in serving only the finest in Sri Lankan cuisine that will only leave you asking for more. The breakfast cruise commences at seven in the morning allowing you to laze into the day in the comfort of the lounges on the top deck. Yathra by Jetwing allows you to embark on a memorable journey with friends, family or significant other in a mysterious yet beautiful setting. The bamboo walls and thatch roof rustling in the wind as you cruise through the river adds to the soothing experience of a personal voyage.
From the serenity of the river waters to the glistening sandy beaches, not too far away is Saffron & Blue in Kosgoda, a four roomed luxury villa by the beach allowing you to have an extended private holiday with friends and family. A spacious contemporary home open to the tropical garden with a pool and sun beds to spend a blissful summer holiday. With plenty of vibrant cushions and lounges in each and every corner of this private villa allows you two dwell in peace. The arty collections displayed around add a feel of aesthetic beauty to your holiday here.
While all rooms come with fine furnishings and luxurious bathrooms with their own colour theme, the Champagne and Green rooms have Jacuzzis in view of the beach. The meals are made to the guests liking and they can also opt to choose from either a pool dining or BBQ dining experience which the team at the villas will be happy to arrange with a smile.
