Group of MPs led by Speaker to visit Kandy

A group of Parliamentarians of all parties headed by the Speaker Karu Jayasuriya would visit Kandy and other areas on Saturday where the recent clashes took place.
The Party Leaders’ Meeting in Parliament yesterday had decided to arrange a visit to find probable solutions to build up reconciliation between the communities that clashed. The group planned to return the same day.
