Total of 2,500 ‘Uda Gammana’ within 40 months

The Housing and Construction Ministry plans to establish 2,500 Uda Gammana within the next 40 months before the end of the Yahapalana Government’s term, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
“Providing shelter to every citizen by 2025 is a key objective of the Yahapalana government. Various programmes including ‘Uda Gammana’, ‘Uda Kala Gammana’, ‘Wisiri’ Housing Loan Programme and housing aid for kidney patients have been implemented by the ministry to meet this goal,” said the minister.
He said around 2.5 million families in the country have various housing issues and the government is dedicated to solve all these issues.
President Maithripala Sirisena has declared 2017 as the year of eliminating poverty.
The Grama Shakthi People’s Movement has been implemented as the main project to free the country from poverty in 2017. In line with this programme, the Housing and Construction Ministry plans to launch a programme, ‘Gramashakthi Uda Gammana’, said the minister.
