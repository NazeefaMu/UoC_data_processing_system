PepsiCo launch sting in Sri Lanka

PepsiCo announced the launch of ‘Sting’ in Sri Lanka. The launch marks the introduction of yet another global PepsiCo trademark in Sri Lanka.
Sting enters Sri Lanka with the proposition of ‘Electrify the Moment’. PepsiCo will be introducing the product in refreshing new packaging in both Glass and PET format-a first ever for the formulated caffeinated beverage category.
This is set to unlock the potential of the category by driving affordability and help meet the demands of a larger group of Sri Lankan consumers. The product will be bottled and distributed by Varun Beverages Limited, PepsiCo’s bottling partner in Sri Lanka.
PepsiCo continues to transform its portfolio to offer healthier options and meet consumers’ increasing interest in health and wellness. The company is prioritizing reduced calorie, reduced sugar offerings as a way to address consumer, business and regulatory needs.
