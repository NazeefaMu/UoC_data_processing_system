Plenty of jobs but shortage of qualified persons: President

The government is taking steps to provide ample resources and guidance in building the future generation of the country, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
He made these remarks participating at a ceremony to vest the newly built Sri Jinarathana Vocational and Higher Education Training Institute in Hikkaduwa, Seenigama, with the students on Wednesday. The new Training Institute was vested with the students to mark the birthday of Hunupitiya Gangarama Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera.
President Sirisena said the main problem today is the country lacking qualified persons for existing jobs and it is not a case of shortage of jobs. The President said even though a large number of job opportunities is available at state and private sectors, the lack of skilled workers with technical knowledge is a serious issue confronting Sri Lanka.
He said the country should build a skilled workforce that has modern and updated knowledge to deal with new job opportunities in the job market. President Sirisena appreciated the service of Venerable Galaboda Gnanissara Thera centering the Hunupitiya Gangarama Temple in Colombo, for the development of vocational training.He said the Vocational Training Institute would provide immense strength not only to the youth in the area, but also to the economy.
