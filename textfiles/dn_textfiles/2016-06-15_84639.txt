Chamil - Yashika win double titles

At the 16th President’s Cup Carrom Championship conducted by the Carrom Federation of Sri Lanka (CFSL), Chamil Cooray defeated world singles champion Nishantha Fernando by 2 frames to 1 (25/23, 24/25, 25/5) in the men’s singles final after a stiff competition and went on to share the men’s doubles title with Brindley Wickramasinghe. In-form Yashika Rahubadda defeated Sri Lanka’s No.1 women slicer Joseph Roshita 2/1 (25/7, 11/25, 25/11) to clinch the women’s singles title after a tough final battle.
She also snatched the women’s doubles title partnering Chalani Lakmali. The month-long tournament worked off at the CFSL headquarters in Kohuwala saw over 300 slicers from all parts of the country participate. During the tournament seven players recorded 10 ‘Slams’ and it is a clear indication of the high standard of the local players. Double title holder Chamil Cooray recorded two ‘White Slams’ and Mohamed Shaheed returned two ‘Black Slams’. Also joining the elite club were Promod Mendis (two White Slams), Nuwan Chathuranga, Y.M.P. Udayanga, Dushantha Nadeeshan (all one White Slam each) and K.K. Prakash (one Black Slam).
