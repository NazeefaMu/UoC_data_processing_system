Probe into vandalism

The Kurunegala Municipal Council and the Criminal Investigations Department launched two separate investigations to apprehend those responsible for destroying the cutouts of President Maithripala Sirisena and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, which were placed in front of the Kurunegala clock tower on Monday night.
Mayor Thushara Sanjeewa Vitharana said a special police team including the SSP attached to the Kurunegala Police would conduct investigations into the incident.
