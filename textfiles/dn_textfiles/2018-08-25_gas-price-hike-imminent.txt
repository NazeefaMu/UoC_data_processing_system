Gas price hike imminent

A hike in domestic gas prices is mooted after it was revealed that a decision has been taken to implement a formula for domestic LPG gas.
It was reported that the Industry and Commerce Ministry would hold discussions with the relevant stakeholders including representatives of these gas companies next week on the way forward.
Gas companies have been agitating for an increase in prices, particularly of the 12.5 kg cyclinder by at least Rs.394 and others by a suitable percentage.
