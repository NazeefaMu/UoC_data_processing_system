Dengue cases soaring in Matale

Dengue cases have sharply increased with the onset of rains in the Matale district.
Medical Offices of Akuwela, Matale, Rattota, Yatawatta, and Dambulla have made the people in vulnerable areas aware of soaring dengue cases.
Health officials in the district had informed them to destroy mosquito breeding grounds by cleaning their environments.
They said that infants and elders are vulnerable to the disease.
However, health authorities said the number of patients visiting government hospitals in the district had increased due to a viral flu as well.
