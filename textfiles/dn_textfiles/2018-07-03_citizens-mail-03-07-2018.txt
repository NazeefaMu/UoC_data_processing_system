WORLDVIEW AND THE FREEDOM FROM SUFFERING
Joe Perera in his article “On Life and Suffering” rejects the cause of suffering as Karmic Retribution via Rebirth. He says, he wants to find the “Unknown cause” for human suffering.
May I suggest that he gets his “Naadi Vakyam” read. Just on the basis of your thumbprint, through the relevant palm leaf, they will tell all the intimate details of your life including your name, age, details of your family members etc. In a stunning revelation, a girl was told the exact path from her house to her boy friend’s home!! They even mentioned the names of two buildings on the way. They told where she will be born again and what her name will be. These revelations were recorded long, long time ago and kept in archives in South India.
On Joe Perera’s comments on innocent girls being raped and murdered and culprits roaming with full freedom, I gave my analysis in an article which was published in the Daily News titled “Thoughts on Seya and Vidya”.
In this connection may I mention a remarkable statement made by Ramana Maharishi on an everyday incident. Apparently, a foreign lady came to see the Maharishi in His Ashram in Arunachala. She said, “I am now in India”.
Maharishi smiled and asked, “Are you in India or is India in you?”!! Space does not allow me to state the enormous implications of Maharishi’s simple question. It provides a stunning worldview which to my knowledge has not been mentioned anywhere by anyone.
If I can end this article on a personal note to Joe Perera, it is to say that you have endured a terrible ordeal of mental anguish and sorrow. You know all too well what mental suffering is and I know what physical suffering is.
The solace to either form of suffering does not lie in the external world but within you. “First you find the Kingdom of Heaven within you…” The key word is “Within you”. Ramana Maharishi has found this location as a pinpoint on the right side of the chest. I have confirmed it in my meditation. It is through this point that “one” gains access to the Universal Consciousness (Sat-Chit-Ananda) with the consequence dissolution of the Individuality which is the root cause of all suffering.
