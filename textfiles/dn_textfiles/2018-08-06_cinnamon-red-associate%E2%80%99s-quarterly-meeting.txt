Cinnamon Red Associate’s Quarterly meeting

Cinnamon Red held its Associates’ Quarterly Meeting for the first quarter of 2018/19 at the hotel’s Flavoured restaurant recently. The meeting was held to reward and recognise individuals who have gone beyond the call of duty.
Gayan Sanjeewa from F&B won the Associate of the Quarter, Front of House award, while Nuwan Gunarathne from Engineering won the Associate of the Quarter, Back of House award. They received their awards from General Manager, Mr. Terrence Fernando. The nominees for Employee of the Quarter were Champika Pahala Gamage from Kitchen and Manoj Premakumara from Kitchen Stewarding.
In addition, a movie trivia activity was organized by the Finance department where Associates watched clips of movies and TV shows and had the opportunity to answer some fun questions.
