Arrest of Aloysius, Weeratunga, a drama: Anura Kumara

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday attributed the arrest of Arjun Aloysius and Udayanga Weeratunga to a drama. He said the script for the drama was written several months earlier.
The government one time said that Weeratunga had gone missing, but he had met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the latter visited Japan, he said.
Dissanayake added that these arrests are aimed at upcoming Local Government election
He said the JVP is confident of a major victory at the elections.
“The UNP obtained five milion votes at the last election while the UPFA polling 4.8 million votes. Both parties will suffer setback at the election,” he said. Dissanayake said the people have lost confidence in the SLFP, SLFP dissidents and the UNP.
“A vast gap exists between the expectations of the party members and the party leaders,” he said.
