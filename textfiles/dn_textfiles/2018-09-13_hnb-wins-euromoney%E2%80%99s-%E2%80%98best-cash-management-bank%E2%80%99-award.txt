HNB wins Euromoney’s ‘best Cash  Management Bank’ award

HNB, Sri Lanka’s leading private sector bank, further strengthened its market leadership in Corporate Cash Management with the Euromoney Magazine awarding HNB the ‘Market Leader in Cash Management’ and ‘Best Service in Cash Management’ in Sri Lanka for the year 2018.
These awards from Euromoney to HNB is a first for a local bank in Sri Lanka in cash management.
Euromoney Magazine is recognised globally as the most influential financial magazine and a leading authority on finance, banking, investment, and treasury and is read and trusted by the world leading companies, bankers, brokers, investors, regulators and policy makers.
Euromoney magazine ranks providers of cash management services on a global, regional and country level based on an annual survey of over 25,000 corporate cash managers, treasurers and finance officers worldwide.
The Cash Management award is based on an independent survey whereby corporates are given the opportunity to rate the quality of the service provided by their local and multinational relationship banks across products and services.
HNB is the first local bank to offer a Web-based, fully integrated Payments and Cash Management (PCM) platform – HNB Online.
The Bank, leveraging on this state of the art platform along with a dedicated business team that is considered the best in the industry, has within a short period of time achieved significant success in securing a leadership position in cash management, which was previously a captive business of the multinational banks
HNB, Deputy General Manager, Corporate Banking, Ruwan Manatunga said, “Winning these two prestigious awards from Euromoney is a proud moment for the Bank.
These awards from Euromoney along with the awards won earlier in the year from Asian Banker and Asiamoney for Best Cash Management are the results of the hard work put in by HNB’s PCM team not only to develop a platform that is best in the market but also to provide its corporate customers solutions that create significant value that is world class. We believe in partnering with our customers to provide well-thought through PCM solutions that covers the full spectrum of cash management i.e. receivable reconciliation, cheque outsourcing, distributor financing, etc.
We are proud of our cash management business and will continue to innovate to keep abreast with the ever-changing demands of the local and global financial markets to support our customers in the years ahead”
Reflecting on HNB’s strength and dominant influence in Sri Lanka’s financial landscape as the preferred corporate banking partner of choice, Manatunga concluded by saying that the confidence placed by corporates in HNB further encourages and supports the Bank to continue to invest in new technologies and teams.
He also stressed that the Bank will continue to give leadership to the market and will further roll out world class innovative and customised solutions to its clients.
HNB today stands as the most profitable private banking group in the country, maintaining a strong and growing presence across retail, corporate and Micro and SME sectors, extending cutting edge banking and financial services to a wide range of clients.
