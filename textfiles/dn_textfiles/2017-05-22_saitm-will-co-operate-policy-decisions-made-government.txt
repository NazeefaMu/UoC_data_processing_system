SAITM will co-operate with the policy decisions made by the government

The Management of SAITM will be co-operating with the policy decisions presented by the Government and the suggestions made by President Maithripala Sirisena. Primarily among these is the recommendation to broad-base the institute’s ownership by listing it on the Colombo Stock Exchange, the SAITM in a statement said.
“Regarding the suggestion to suspend the enrolment of new students, SAITM is willing to co-operate with the Government in order to facilitate the implementation of the said proposals expeditiously, subject to the court case which is now awaiting a Supreme Court decision.
The Chairman and management is confident that the Government will at all times protect the freedom for education in the country.
SAITM will extend its fullest support to the Government's efforts in maintaining quality and standards in medical education in Sri Lanka, across all medical faculties, state and non-state, sans discrimination,” the statement said.
