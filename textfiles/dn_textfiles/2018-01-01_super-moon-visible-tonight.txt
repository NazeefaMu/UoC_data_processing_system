Super moon visible tonight

A super moon, which would be 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons Earth has witnessed before will be visible in today’s night sky, Prof. Chandana Jayaratne said.
The Astronomy and Space Unit Director of the Physics Department of the Colombo University said that high tides are a possibility due to the super moon as well.
“The best time to see the January 1 supermoon from Sri Lanka is right after moonrise on hanuary 1 evening or just before the moonset on January 2 morning, when the moon is above the horizon.” Prof Jayaratne said.
He also states that no natural disasters will be eminent due to the supermoon as some rumours claim.
