Two Lankans held in passport racket

A fake passport racket, which helped Sri Lankan nationals fly abroad from Chennai as Indian citizens, has been busted in Tamil Nadu. Two Sri Lankans, including a 38-year-old woman, suspected to be part of the racket, have been arrested.
The crime branch had earlier arrested 11people, including a travel agent, for allegedly preparing fake passports by collecting up to Indian Rs 10 lakh from Sri Lankan nationals. The travel agent allegedly collected expired passports from the poor and sold them to Sri Lankans as valid Indian passports.
