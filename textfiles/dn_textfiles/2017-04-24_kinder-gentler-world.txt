A kinder, gentler World!

In today’s world there are various types of problems. The destructive attitude of the people is due to their being unkind to others. Countries wage war against each other just to show their power by the usage of deadly weapons to destroy valuable heritage. Thus we see lot of terrorists everywhere in the world who cause lot of damage to world peace. Due to the ongoing wars and conflicts with Nations, thousands of people are made refugees and are displaced.
The solution for all these disturbances is that people must start realising the Human Values in them. If they try to understand and start practising them, then there will be only PEACE. Human Values are virtues that guides us. They have the effect of bonding, comforting, reassuring, and procuring serenity.
Human Values are universal and important consideration should be taken when interacting with other people of different Nations. These values help to create bonding between people of different Nationalities, race, religion, beliefs and culture. All the different religions in the World contain the value- LOVE for a good peaceful life. The value of LOVE is the undercurrent of all the other values. LOVE in THOUGHT is TRUTH ( honesty). LOVE in ACTION is RIGHT CONDUCT( right behaviour). It is a known fact that the correct thing done will be appreciated. LOVE in FEELING is PEACE and LOVE in UNDERSTANDING is NON-VIOLENCE. If we practice non-violence, there will be peace. Wars are raging in every direction. The Earth becomes an enormous battle-field. Innocent people, animals and plants are dying. Forests are being burnt down making an imbalance in the nature. The result is earthquakes, tsunami , excess heat, floods etc.
Values are generally regarded as the moral standards of human behaviour in the society. They play a vital role , for they are said to be the basis for the cultural development and preservation of cultural heritage. Hence everyone should follow the human values. These attributes include honesty, trustworthiness, diligence, discipline, fairness, love, peace, justice, care for one another and being mindful of the environment. It is absolutely compulsory and will make the place we live a better place with mutual understanding , happiness and peace. Generally, human values are highly encouraged in Society. These values are passed from one generation to another. People with excellent human values
are usually held in high esteem, admired and rewarded. The traits are important especially in leaders and people in influential positions.
Now lots of countries are introducing value based education with the school curriculum. When it is introduced in the tender age it will definitely be practised by the children as a part of their life. It is the education for LIFE. This education not only compliments but also completes academics guiding students to serve society with morality and integrity.

If there is BEAUTY in CHARACTER,
There will be harmony in the HOME.

There will be ORDER in the NATION.
When there is ORDER in the NATION
