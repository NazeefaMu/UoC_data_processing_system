Outstanding jurist and a peacemaker

Judge Weeramantry is no longer with us. He passed away in the eve of January 5. Perhaps, he felt the 90th year of his birth, after serving humanity for so long, was the right time to bid farewell. But those of us who knew him dearly and cherished every second with him, know that it was not enough. But the world order is given and this is the reality. His departure to the heavens will be guided by angels with soothing songs. Let us say goodbye to the greatest man of peace in our time, by recollecting some of his great work for humanity.
Judge Weeramantry was, undoubtedly, one of the most distinguished and outstanding jurists in the world. His judgments and opinions, international publications and lectures, and keynote addresses given at eminent foray, in Sri Lanka and overseas, stand testament to his erudite scholarship and his extraordinary ability to interpret the underlying philosophy of legal principles, congruent with the teachings of global religious and cultural wisdoms. He was the first Judge to bring religious principles and teachings into judgements of the International Court.
Further, Judge Weeramantry, in many of his publications, argued that this notion needed to widen for the peaceful co-existence of all religious and cultural groups. This was important in the Sri Lankan context where all major religions are vibrantly practiced.
At the International Court of Justice, Judge Weeramantry derived obligations and legal principles from religious and cultural wisdoms from throughout the world, and advocated that international adjudication needs to be more aligned globally.
Therefore, he extracted and interpreted these cultural notions in his judgements. In many of his opinions, Judge Weeramantry not only quoted from the rich repositories of Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, but also highlighted the traditions and customs of aborigines such as Maoris and Incas.
International Justice
His outstanding contribution to International Justice was recognised by the City of the Hague in 1998, when the City of The Hague celebrated its 750th anniversary. Eighteen areas in which the City excelled over the 750 years were chosen and individuals in these areas were recognised.
Judge Weeramantry was selected as the most Outstanding Person who contributed to International Justice. A booklet was produced on the 18 selected personalities. Judge Weeramantry’s works along with others’ were exhibited for a month at the City Hall. Judge Weeramantry always had a fear and expressed in all his conversations that should a war take place, there will be a rain of nuclear bombs. Needless to say that the world is not strong enough to undergo such devastation and God forbid should that day come!
When the UN General Assembly requested the International Court of Justice for an opinion on the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, he gave the outstanding dissenting opinion, drawing on major religions and traditions from across the world to condemn nuclear weapons outright, and totally illegal in all circumstances.
His opinion is regarded as a leading exposition of the illegality of nuclear weapons, and its resultant environmental damage to current and future generations for thousands of years to come. It is his authority which is often cited when the illegality and environmental damage caused by nuclear weapons comes up for discussion.
In August 2016, a special session was held in Japan where he was invited to be the chief guest to commemorate the judgement on the use of nuclear weapons; a rare honour indeed.
Modern environmental law
With regards to the environment, Judge Weeramantry has done more than any other jurist to highlight the importance of environmental law as a rapidly developing branch of international law. In the words of Professor Philippe Sands, Global Professor of Law, New York University School of Law: “Judge Christopher Weeramantry has made a singular contribution to the development of modern environmental law… if international environmental law has been ‘mainstreamed’ then much of the credit must go to Judge Weeramantry.”
Judge Weeramantry has also done outstanding pioneering work on the teachings regarding environment and Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam in the book ‘Tread Lightly on the Earth: Religion, The Environment and the Human Future’. In May 2016, he was chosen to deliver the keynote address on the occasion of the 800th year of Magna Cartar - yet another honour. He was also Emeritus Professor of several universities in the world.
Judge Weeramantry has inspired people through religious teachings. He used the deep knowledge he acquired through his judgements and wrote extensively as well. He did two pioneering works on the legal content of Islam and Christianity, referring to the specific teachings relating to trusteeship of the environment, created by the Almighty for human use, on the basis of trusteeship for future generations.
The books: “Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective” and “The Lord’s Prayer: Bridge to a Better World”, are a tribute to this.
US Constitution
He was appointed Chairman of a committee of judges from across the world by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to draft a manual of International Environmental Law for the world’s judges.
This was necessitated by the fact that many judges are now called upon in their domestic jurisdictions to decide matters in the developing area of Environmental Law and often do so without knowledge of the latest developments in International Environmental Law.
The draft has been made available to judges all over the world by UNEP and has greatly advanced in the application of modern Environmental Law in many jurisdictions.
When the United States was celebrating its 200th Anniversary in 1976, a major world congress was held on Equality and Freedom - the underlying themes of the US Constitution.
Three major presentations on equality and freedom were arranged from the stand point of the Western World, The Communist World and the Third World. Out of all the jurists of the Third World, it was Judge Weeramantry who was invited to make the presentation for the Third World.
His speech was serialised in various journals such as The Asiaweek and the Christian Science Monitor, and was described by a reader of Asiaweek of April 15, 1977 as “A Magna Carta for the Third World.”
Judge Weeramantry has been a pioneer in seeking to prevent the enormous powers of modern science and technology from damaging the environment, now and for generations to come.
Sir Arthur C. Clarke - the outstanding futurist - often described him as ‘the prophet of the space age’. In his Foreword to Judge Weeramantry’s work on ‘Protecting Human rights in the Age of Technology’, he observed: “this monumental work deserves a wide readership, because it is concerned with nothing less than the survival of humanity and the necessity of making the right use of the awesome new powers that science and technology has given us...
So I am happy to see that Judge Weeramantry outlines many of the steps that must be taken if we are not to follow the dinosaurs into oblivion.”
No more needs to be said to highlight the calibre of this man, (although he had many more achievements), or to establish Judge Weeramantry’s pre-eminence as a scholar and jurist.
He is a man who has done his utmost for the sustainable development and protection of the environment for many future generations. Sadly, the world has lost a guiding light.
