Cabinet nod to recruit doctors to NTMI

Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday that the Cabinet approval has been obtained for the urgent recruitment of M.B.B.S doctors to fill vacancies in the National Transport Medical Institute (NTMI) to issue medical certificates and reports.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the opening of the third floor of the National Transport Medical Institute in Nugegoda, modernized with more facilities.
The minister said 50 M.B.B.S doctors will be recruited by next month.
“Facilities at the institute have been improved to cater to hundreds of people who turn up every day. This will not be limited to Colombo and steps will be taken to upgrade facilities of island-wide branches of the National Transport Medical Institute,” he said.
