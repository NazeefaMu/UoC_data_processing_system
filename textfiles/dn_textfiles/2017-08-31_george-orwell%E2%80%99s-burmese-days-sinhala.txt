George Orwell’s  Burmese  Days in Sinhala

The Burmese Days novel written by British writer George Orwell has been translated into Sinhala by writer, poet and translator Ananda Sellahewa.
Burmese Days was first published in the UK in 1934. It is a tale from the waning days of British colonialism, when Burma was ruled from Delhi as a part of British India.
The novel is based on Orwell’s experience in Burma. Orwell spent five years from 1922 to 1927 as a police officer in the Indian Imperial Police force in Burma, (now Myanmar). Burma had become part of the British Empire during the 19th century.
Burmese Days is set in 1920s imperial Burma, in the fictional district of Kyauktada. The translator attempts to give true picture of the colonial era to the Sinhala readers. Burma is a country similar to Sri Lanka with rich Buddhist civilization and with majority Buddhist population. Orwell describes how the British colonial exploit resources of Burma while denouncing the local people and how the selfish local people please the British colonials for their personal gain.
Since the situation in contemporary Sri Lanka is similar to the situation in Burma as described by Orwell, this book gives familiar experience to the readers.
The translator Ananda Sellahewa is an Engineer by profession and has been working in the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment. Presently he is working as the Project Director of the Dam Safety and Water Resource Planning Projects.
Sellahewa has translated many important novels for Sinhala readers who are interested in advanced international literature. The Land that Time Forgot – Edgar Rice Boroughs, People that Time Forgot and Out of Time Abyss - Edgar Rice Boroughs, Avenger – Frederick Forsyth, Cobra-Frederick Forsyth, Afghan- Frederick Forsyth, The Icon- Frederick Forsyth, The Deceiver- Frederick Forsyth, Kill List-Frederick Forsyth, Devil’s Alternative - Frederick Forsyth and Veteran- Frederick Forsyth are some of the other books translated by Sellahewa.
