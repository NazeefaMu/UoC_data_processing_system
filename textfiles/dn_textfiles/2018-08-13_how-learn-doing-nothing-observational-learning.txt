How to learn by doing nothing: observational learning!

“Monkey see, monkey do” has been a pejorative American idiom for ages, most often deployed by parents when scolding children for emulating a friend’s naughty behavior. Now, courtesy of the internet and streaming video, the phrase takes on a new, positive meaning.
Recently, the Wall Street Journal reported on a growing new trend in which students are studying by watching videos of other students studying online. Some of these videos have been viewed over half a million times; the number of sites offering these so-called study-with-me videos trebled between 2017 and 2016; and one of the sites has more than a quarter of a million subscribers.
Mind you, these videos are not tutorials, they are simply long (one of them runs two and a half hours) static images of students poring over their textbooks and their notes.
Artistic endeavor
Reading the article brought to mind Andy Warhol’s 1964 film, Empire, which consisted of a single static shot of the Empire State Building that ran for eight hours!
The rationale for Warhol’s film, being an artistic endeavor, is open to interpretation, but there are some very substantial reasons for why students passively watching other students studying, can be effective.
The first is scientific. In 1992, a team of Italian neuroscientists working with laboratory monkeys found that the monkeys were mimicking the researchers’ physical actions. They attributed this behavior to a set of nerve cells in the brain called mirror neurons, dubbed “Monkey see, monkey do.” Mirror neurons became, as Psychology Today called them, “The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience,” prompting countless articles and books. Prominent among them was Daniel Goleman’s bestselling Social Intelligence, in which he proclaimed that humans are “wired to connect.” Clearly, those hundreds of thousands of students who are watching feel quite connected to the students who are studying. Although the observers are not studying themselves, the videos provide them with an opportunity to take a break and yet remain in the study zone. The WSJ article quotes a professor of educational psychology and learning sciences who said, “… the people making these videos are tapping into a need where you want to be social without being disrupted from your study goals.” And let’s not forget that, for the current generation of students, connecting virtually is their preferred mode of communication.
One-on-one session
In personal support of the value of passive observation, I offer my own work as a presentation coach. I am frequently asked to coach an executive in a one-on-one session. In response I ask that the individual bring one or two other participants, be they peers or aides, to the session. The reason is that people learn more when they watch others being coached than when they are being coached directly. This dynamic has long been well-known in educational circles as observational learning.
Now we know why, when we were students, we had study buddies: they fire up those mirror neurons and improve our learning. - Forbes
