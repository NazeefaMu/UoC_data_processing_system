From one book to another

“Reading makes a full man, conference a ready man and writing an exact man,” said English philosopher Sir Francis Bacon and no truer words said than these. Reading nourishes the intellect and nurtures the imagination. Considering these facts about reading, October has been declared as a month of reading by the National Library and Documentation Services Board under an apt theme: “Reading is the threshold of Knowledge”.
A book fair is held every year in order to put more weight on reading. There are several other days also declared by the United Nations for education and scientific research. These days have been reserved to encourage and make awareness about reading among the mass. In this modern and sophisticated world, people cannot afford time for reading as the young generation are often distracted by the modern technological devices like the Internet, smartphones and instantaneous thought-sharing on social media. We rarely get to see people with a book on their hands or anyone with the habit of reading. Some people have commenced reading e-papers. All these modern devices cannot replace reading a book with its physical look. Reading on a computer screen comparatively has a less retention power than reading a manual book.
There are numerous benefits a reader can gain from reading. When someone reads, the very benefit is updating his knowledge and he will have exposure to multi-cultural view about the word community. The reading certainly paves the way to increase and extend our memory power. If we do not increase our memory power, we might lose our memory while our brain may become inactive. The reading keeps your brain active and thoughtful.
Reading, a worthy companion
The reading also expands one’s word power. If someone is an avid reader, he will read various books on different fields that will enrich his vocabulary through which he will learn to use appropriate words in his daily communication. It also increases our power of understanding, empathy, the degree of tolerance to a greater extent and our self-esteem. It is a lifelong learning tool which satisfies our curiosity. It helps in achieving our goals and makes us complete. It makes us wiser, smarter and more powerful. Even the well-learned people used reading as a strategy to become experts in the respective fields. So reading is a worthy companion that will provide us with physical and mental relaxation.
The reading will also create a fresh opportunity to gain new knowledge and make us feel confident. Nobody can claim the sole right to knowledge. It is said that only the knowledgeable people can become the pillars of good governance and democracy. They are the foundation of the revolutionary knowledge society. Mahatma Gandhi said: “Library is the storehouse of knowledge and is like a small window to the dark room.” His verses encourage us to read more to gain knowledge.
In this fast-moving world, people cannot allocate time for reading or visiting the library. They also fail to realise that they can obtain real pleasure from reading and reading is the best way to release their stresses and relax their minds. The advancement of technology is also one of the vital contributory factors to make the reading habits extinct. A research carried out in the United States of America reveals that 50 percent of Americans do not read newspapers. So do Sri Lankans? Of course, our situation is far more below this percentage.
Reading habits
The working class today start their day with the computer and finishing their day’s transaction with the computer. This is, of course, a monotonous machinery life which does not yield any pleasure or peace of mind for us. On the other hand, when we consider the students’ reading habits it is almost nil. We are not supposed to expect the intellectual and spiritual development from the students with the current educational curricula or the overall educational system in the country because the curriculum has been designed to memorize the subject matter for the sake of passing examinations.
As parents and teachers, we have a prominent duty to cultivate the reading habit in our children’s minds in order to build a healthy society or rather a healthy nation who will respect the country’s traditional values, virtues and norms.
A Tamil adage says: “An immoral education is like a house without a roof and aimless life is like a ship without a rudder.” Today’s students are tomorrow’s leaders. Let us all determine ourselves to sow the seed of this useful habit of reading among our students from October which has been declared a month of reading to remind and encourage the reading habit across the island.
We are now living in the era of technology or information technology. Despite the technological development we just cannot ignore the precious reading habit. As far as reading is concerned, the books are given a prominent place in the realm of reading. Reading books shape our life and direct us along the right path. That’s why Plato said: “Books give soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and life to everything.” Thus we must always take an excess interest in reading because reading changes everything, for adopting this habit one should reserve time to absorb the verses of experts who have advised us according to their research findings. Those who do not have this habit get help from the experienced readers to recommend you some selective books for you to kick-start this habit.
Mini library at home
The best idea is to start a reading corner in the classroom or at home for you to extend your reading habits. The genius says it is better to establish a mini library at home so as to spread this rare habit among your immediate family members and friends. One should also take a resolution from this reading month of October that I am going to read a certain number of books this year.
While you read or make a visit to the libraries do not forget to bring a notebook and a pen with you to jot down important information, wise sayings, statistics and useful quotations that you come across in the libraries. Having noted down these important, useful, pieces of information, train yourself to look back at the verses at a regular interval in order to instill that information in your minds and use it in your daily practical life. Besides, always have a book list that is currently famous and dominated minds of readers all over the world and make frequent visits to bookshops book fair and old bookshops to those books.
Hence, let us all take a firm resolution to cultivate this rare reading habits in our nation especially in the minds of young people in order to foster and nurture the strong, healthy, intellectual and dynamic future Sri Lankans who will rule and lead the country towards prosperity and peace.
