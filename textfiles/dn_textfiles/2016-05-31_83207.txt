Hyderabad beat Bangalore for maiden IPL win

BANGALORE, SUNDAY: Skipper David Warner’s sparkling half century helped Sunrisers Hyderabad survive a punishing blitz by Chris Gayle to edge out Royal Challengers Bangalore by eight runs in the Indian Premier League final on Sunday.
Defending 208 to claim their maiden IPL title, Hyderabad restricted Virat Kohli’s Bangalore to 200 for seven at the M Chinnaswamy stadium with Gayle’s 38-ball 76 in vain.

With 18 runs required off the final over, pace spearhead Bhuvneshwar Kumar -- the leading wicket taker of the season with 23 scalps -- gave away just nine as the Hyderabad players celebrated amid fireworks.
Electing to bat first, Hyderabad rode on entertaining knocks from Australia’s Warner and Ben Cutting to post a mammoth 208 for seven in 20 overs.
“Fantastic team achievement. To lead this side and the support from the players, me pulling my weight with the runs, it has been a hard journey. It’s a team effort,” a delighted Warner said after the triumph.
If Warner laid a solid foundation with his ninth fifty of this IPL season then fellow Aussie Cutting finished it off with an unbeaten 39 off 15 deliveries.
Left-handed Warner (69), who accumulated 848 runs in 17 matches, gave the team a rollicking 63-run start with opener Shikhar Dhawan (28).
Warner smashed the ball to all parts of the ground and took a special liking to Shane Watson whose opening over -- the fifth of the innings -- cost 18 runs.
Leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, who remained the team’s top wicket taker of the season with 21, got the first breakthrough in Dhawan who mistimed a slog sweep to deep square leg.
Warner, whose 38-ball knock was laced with eight fours and three sixes, kept up the run rate, forcing Kohli to juggle with his bowling options.
England medium-pacer Chris Jordan (3-45) replaced left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdullah in the 10th over to send Australia’s Moises Henriques trudging back to the dug out.
Aravind got the prized scalp of Warner, who threw away his wicket while trying to slash at a widish delivery and got caught at short third man.
Veteran India batsman Yuvraj Singh took over from where Warner left off, smacking 38 runs from 23 balls to keep the momentum going.
The Bangalore bowlers kept coming back to get wickets in between but could never arrest the flow of runs.
