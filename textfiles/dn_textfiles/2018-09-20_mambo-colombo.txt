Mambo to Colombo

The sultry sounds of South America will bring alive the swinging traditions of one of Asia’s most iconic properties with the opening of ‘King of the Mambo’ at the Galle Face Hotel in October. Sri Lanka’s revered oceanfront luxury heritage hotel will play host to a new era of fun, refinement and entertainment by bringing back the “mambo” as the dance movement is set to once again shake the city and its hotel guests. Launched in partnership with Dubai-based management company Infini Concepts, the Latino lounge-restaurant concept will be styled in 50s décor and introduce classic cocktails, creative culinary specialities and a roster of entertainment as the relaxed, sunset-facing space invites guests to dress up, and dance the Mambo to the songs of legends such as Pérez Prado and Tito Puente.
“The Galle Face Hotel has been in my family for generations and it gives me great pleasure to delve into our illustrious past and connect with the spirit of the hotel.
We have had many famous guests and it is in honour of those who stayed with us in the 50s when the mambo was at its height of popularity. We are excited to introduce this concept,” said Galle Face Hotel Chairman, Sanjeev Gardiner.
