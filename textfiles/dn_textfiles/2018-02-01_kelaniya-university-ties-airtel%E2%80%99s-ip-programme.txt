Kelaniya University ties up  with Airtel’s IP programme

 The industry partnership (IP) program is a joint academic cum industry work exposure programme that helps undergraduates understand the essence of business at large.
Airtel has now opened its doors to the undergraduates of the Department of Marketing Management, Faculty of Commerce and Management Studies, University of Kelaniya under the Airtel Industry Partnership Programme. The programme offers undergraduates of the University of Kelaniya a cohesive working experience that encompasses the opportunity to hone their soft skills and business acumen through a series of experimental learning and team projects.
“With the rising demand for market-ready graduates which has become a vital need in Sri Lanka, by partnering with the Department of Marketing Management at University of Kelaniya, we hope to bridge the skill gap between fresh graduates and market-ready graduates.” said Jinesh Hegde, CEO of Bharti Airtel Lanka. “After all, a country’s future depends on the quality of education it provides, and our responsibility is to support the education by giving this education a holistic approach.”
The University of Kelaniya stands among Sri Lanka’s leading higher education institutions, providing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in numerous fields of study.
Bharti Airtel Lanka, a subsidiary of Bharti Airtel—the world’s third largest mobile operator by subscribers, across 17 countries—was the fastest network to reach the one million customers mark and continues to sustain its growth momentum in the youth segment
