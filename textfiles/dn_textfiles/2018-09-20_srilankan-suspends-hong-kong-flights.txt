SriLankan suspends Hong Kong flights

SriLankan Airlines has decided to suspend its Hong Kong flights from next month.
Having re-evaluated its presence in the Far East, the Airline is suspending operations to Hong Kong from October 27, 2018.
This decision has been taken following careful assessment of commercial results over a significant period of time, SriLankan Airlines said yesterday.
The Airline is also expanding its capacity on the Colombo-Singapore-Colombo route from October 29, 2018 with the introduction of wide bodied Airbus A330 aircraft that are equipped to provide modern inflight comforts with the latest inflight entertainment systems, luxurious seating and on-board cuisine that is among the finest. The Airlines’ weekly frequencies will be increased to 21 flights per week from the current schedule of 17 flights per week, the release said.
In keeping with its strategy of optimizing and rationalizing market opportunities throughout its route network, the carrier will be introducing a range of significant changes to its winter schedule.
It will be deploying state-of-the-art A330-300 aircraft on its daily Melbourne operations from October 28, 2018.
