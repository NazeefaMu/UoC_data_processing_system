British woman stranded in Sri Lanka after husband killed

 
A fifty-nine-year-old British woman has been left stranded in Sri Lanka after selling her home and marrying a twenty-six-year-old local who was shot dead.
The British woman, Diane De Zoysa says she gave £100,000 to husband Priyanjana De Zoysa when she moved to live with him in Ahungalla, in the south west of the country, last year. 
She met her husband who works in a hotel when she was on holiday in Sri Lanka six years ago, before returning seven months later to marry him. 
However, her husband was tragically killed last month after being shot three times at a friend's house.
Diane De Zoysa says her husband was killed by men trying to blackmail him for money.
She said 'They thought he was a rich man as he had a nice house, a minibus and a three-wheeler. He paid them but they wanted more.'
The widow explained that she sold her home in Edinburgh to live with her husband in Sri Lanka last year. 
She then bought a house in Sri Lanka under her husband's family's name, as well as helping him set up a minibus service.
Diane De Zoysa said: 'My husband and his family are very poor, so I have helped them. I gave up everything to join my husband here.
'I never imagined that I would be at my husband’s funeral. I thought that I would die first, seeing as I’m a lot older than him.'
She says she is now desperate to return to Scotland, but is unable to do so due to her financial situation. 
The police investigation into the death of Priyanjana De Zoysa is still underway.
