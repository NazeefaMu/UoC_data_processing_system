Gifts of Dhamma for Ananda and Nalanda through Peoples Bank Sulohitha Sansdaya

‘Sulohitha Sansadaya’ is an initiative by old Anandians and Nalandians currently employed at People's Bank to display banners containing words of Dhamma in both schools. With the aim of further uplifting the long existing brotherhood between Anandians and Nalandians, especially to inspire present students about that strong bond shared between the two schools, many projects were carried out by old Anandians and Nalandians currently employed at Peoples Bank, throughout the past years.
Since 2013, the newly-admitted children for Grade 1 of both schools were granted with Sisu Udana Pass books under this initiative by their own contributions. Recently, banners depicting the proper management of money for a blessed lifestyle as preached by the Buddha were displayed in both schools. The Principal of Ananda College, the deputy principal of Nalanda College, other deputy and assistant principals, teachers in charge of Sisu Udana and old Anandians and Nalandians employed in Peoples Bank, along with other executives of the Bank, graced the occasion of revealing the banners.
In correspondence to this, the launch of the Sulohitha Sansada Facebook page also took place at the Ananda College Centenary hall.
