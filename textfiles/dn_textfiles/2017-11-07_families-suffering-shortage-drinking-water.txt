Families suffering from shortage of drinking water

Drinking water cannot be supplied to 17,000 families in Ambalantota and Tangalle D.S. areas from next week. District Engineer Hambantota Water Supply and Drainage Board, J. P. G. Jayasuriya told the media.
He said that the drinking water was supplied to these families from Kattakaduwa tank at Ranna and its water level was very low and it was sufficient only for several days. So the Water Board has curtailed the supply of water.
The residents said that the drinking water was supplied by this tank from Hungama to Tangalle for more than 20 years. But it did not have a source of water. The tank is fed by the excess water supplied to Mahaweli paddy fields. The request from the politicians to construct a canal to get water for this tank had fallen in deaf ears.
Udawalawa Zone of Mahawel Authority Residential Manager, I. G. Amarasekara told that water could not be provided to Kattakaduwa tank as the maintenance work of the main canal was being done, as supplying of water to Eraminiyaya tank in Angunukolapelessa is essential for the cultivation of this Maha season.
Amarasekara said that he discussed the problem with Hambantota District Secretary and the best solution was to get water from Muruthawela reservoir.
