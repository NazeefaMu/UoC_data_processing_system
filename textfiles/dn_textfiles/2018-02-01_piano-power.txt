Piano power

The South Bank Centre was turned into a most sublime piano haven when pianists from around the world gathered to display their mastery at the piano and celebrate the music of their favourite composers.
You name them; they were all there in a weeklong celebration.
What matters most is how they stretch the piano's technique in every direction. The walls vibrated in tumultuous figurations of earthy sounds brought together. The refined sensibilities may differ from one player to player to another but they are all masters at the game. One person who caught my imagination was Cedric Tiberghien, the young French-Canadian virtuoso whose blend of boldness was of reasoning and inspiration at such a young age. There was also the young Russian pianist considered potentially as one of the greatest pianist of the 21st century. These two among all others play with unaffected gusto and powerful lyrical impulse. The clarity of texture and the sense of momentum grips each and every pianist each evening as they perform one by one.
The Royal Festival Hall has been on my agenda each time I visit UK and every visit to this citadel of classical music excites me.
I watched and listened to the distinguished pianist, Andreas Haefliger who has come all the way from Switzerland to join in the series. His is a welcome return and auditorium is packed with no seat left. His programme contrasts with the heady Wagner with the classical ethos of Mozart's beautiful sonatas.
They are balanced against the transcendent music of Schubert's Piano Sonata in B flat major. It is described as beautiful, fluent music-making unimpeded by the physical.'
I find Haefliger to be one of music's great communicators because of his richly coloured interpretations of the Romantic repertoire from 19th century. Gentle on the keyboard as Mozart was, the great Master's work flow in languid liquidity through his fingers on to the keyboard. He provides a fresh insight into Mozart's creative genius as well as a romantic air to Schubert's sublime piano music.
Tonight, he is playing Mozart's piano sonatas, Schubert's sonata, and Wagner's sonata. I am wondering why Haefliger opted for Wagner's Isolde's Liebestod when the composer has a tremendous amount of spectacular scores to select from.
RICHARD WAGNER (1813-1883) No composer has had so much written about him, no one man has had an influence on the course of his art before or since. He was genius, philosopher, a man of letters and a first class conductor apart from being a key composer in history. But Wagner was arrogant and treated his contemporaries with utter contempt. They included great Masters like Verdi and Bach. Wagner's TRISTAN UND ISOLDE (1856-1859) is played tonight. This is a psychological music drama of great importance. ISOLDE'S LIEBESTOD from TRISTAN means (love-death) and is the final name given to Isolda's last and ecstatic declaration of love. On piano, S.447.
FRANZ SCHUBERT (1797 - 1828) Gentle and mild just like his composing, this great of orchestral, chamber and piano music and wrote about twenty sonatas. His symphonies were well received on strings as well and popular in all concert halls with a multitude of sonatas and piano works, Haefliger settled for Piano sonata in B flat, D 960 (1825).
This sonata and other were written in quick succession in the last weeks of Schubert's life. Composed in less than four weeks, they are among the greatest of his works and today, The Royal Festival Hall is paying tribute to this wondrous Master.
WOLFGANG AMADEUS MOZART (1756-1791) There has never been a child prodigy to match Mozart who died very young at thirty five years of age. Had he lived more, one will not be able to count his music or pack them into a single book or for that matter, a multitude of CDs.
A prolific writer of Romantic music, he became the greatest composer of his day, the finest conductor, pianist, organist, and violinist in Europe. A walking encyclopedia of musicology, no one can match his genius.
Every one adores his music and he is priority on their lists. I need an ocean full of ink and a create of pens to write about his works and no wonder I waited patiently for Haefliger to take on Mozart's Piano Sonata in C.K. 330 and in A.K. 331/00.
They are precious jewels, sparkling and radiantly played. There is hush; I can feel the breathing of those around me. Such is the silence and when it was over, there was a thunderous applause, calling Haefliger to play more Mozart and he did. I think the audience is still not satisfied.
As I rose from my seat to mingle with the crowd streaming out, I was thinking of having Mozart for dinner. He was so full in my mind.
DAY No. 3. If I had Mozart for dinner last night, there were more waiting on the keyboard next day. Chopin had been celebrated over the bicentenary few weeks before by one of UK's nest interpreters, Krystian Zimerman and sad I missed the Chopin series.
The cool breeze outside reminded me of the advent of summer. Little buds swaying upon the bough created the magic of classical music that waited within the portals of the South Bank Centre as the strain of music brush passed all who made their way in. As I took my seat, it was Paul Lewis at the keyboard. His profound interpretation of the Viennese classics stood at awesome range and testified by his award-wining Schubert Sonata series.
He also played Schumann's FANTASLE in C and Liszt's Vellee d'obermann. That was Paul Lewis the celebrated British pianist.
In the next couple of hours, Haydn took centre stage followed by Mozart, Debussy and Mussorgsky among them what I loved most was Chopin's two NOCTURNES Op 48. As the last note faded off, came down the early showers with raindrops making their own classical melodies. The atmosphere was so vibrant and spectacular that people paused in the foyer braving the winds.
