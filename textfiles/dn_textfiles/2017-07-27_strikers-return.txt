Strikers return

Talks with President Successful :
Distribution declared essential:
Workers take over distribution from military
Striking Trade Unions attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) temporarily called off their strike after discussions with President Maithripala Sirisena late last evening.
The Unions said the suspension was temporary and would extend until next Tuesday (01).
CPC TU Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna told Daily News that they have taken the decision considering the difficulties encountered by the public due to the island wide strike.
Rajakaruna also said the CPC TU is to have another meeting with the President and three more ministers who hold responsibilities regarding this matter.
Rajakaruna also said that President Sirisena told them that there may be a possibility to introduce more amendments to the initial agreements on the Trincomalee oil tank farm and Hambantota refinery, though the government has already introduced amendments to the said agreements on an earlier occasion.
Meanwhile, the Military which took over distribution duties following the declaration of distribution as an “Essential Service”, have ceased duties at the refineries.
“Instead they are only maintaining a presence at the Kollonnawa and the Muthurajawela refineries,” Military Spokesman Brigadier Roshan Senevirathne said.
The spokesman said that the strikers had come to an agreement late last evening to resume services.
Earlier, Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily News that 16 workers who were engaged in the strike were arrested by the Welikada Police and were subsequently bailed out, after recording their statements. He said the arrested will be released on police bail after recording statements.
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Trade Unions launched a strike action from Monday midnight (24) based on three demands including the acquisition of the Trincomalee Petroleum tanks complex to the CPC, acquisition of Hambantota Port Tanks Complex to CPC and modernisation of the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery.
Considering the inconvenience faced by the people, the government issued a gazette on Tuesday (25) declaring the Supply or Distribution of Fuel including Petroleum Products and Gas as an essential service.
The government also announced that all CPC staff involved in petroleum distribution must report to work with immediate effect and those who fail to report to work will be considered as having vacated their posts.
By 3.00 pm last evening, 15 fuel bowsers were secured from the Kolonnawa refinery and were sent out islandwide under military protection, together with the cooperation of non-striking Petroleum Corporation drivers.
Military forces entered the Kolonnawa and Muthurajawela fuel storage terminals last morning to ensure the security of the tanks and to guide fuel distribution.
Meanwhile, a tense situation prevailed at the Kolonnawa Petroleum Storage Complex by mid-noon, during an attempt made by Security Forces and Police to remove the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) workers.
The Police closed the Kolonnawa-Dematagoda road and the Police Riot Control Unit was called as the CPC workers extended their demonstration to the main road.
At around the same time, a meeting held between the CPC TU representatives and the Kolonnawa refinery board of directors failed. However, the CPC TU workers said they will carry out essential services unless military personal within the refinery premises were to leave.
Meanwhile, the Police arrested several protesters due to their unruly behaviour. The brawl took place when the police attempted to remove a group of workers who were located near the Kolonnawa refinery premises.
Among the arrested were the CPC TU media spokesman Bandula Saman Kumara and the CPC General Employees Trade Union President Asoka Ranwala.
The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) workers announced that they will return to work from yesterday.
