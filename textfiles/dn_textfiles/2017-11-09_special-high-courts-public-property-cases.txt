Special High Courts for public property cases

Cabinet this week granted approval to establish Special High Courts under Article 105 (1) (c) of the Constitution to try cases against the misuse of public property.
The courts will try; crimes against public property, money laundering, financing of terrorism, cases of breach of trust, misuse of public property, organised crime and to speed up cases involving complex white collar crime. These High Courts will consist of three bench tribunals nominated by the Chief Justice and their judgements may be directly appealed to the Supreme Court.
The Chief Justice will hold the discretion to direct new cases to these courts on the request of the Attorney General.
The Legal Draftsman’s Department has been directed to draft necessary legislation for the above.
