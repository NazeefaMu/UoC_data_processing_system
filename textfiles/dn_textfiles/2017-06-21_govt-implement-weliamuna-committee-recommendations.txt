The Government yesterday decided to implement the recommendations of the J.C. Weliamuna Committee that investigated the alleged corruption and financial malpractices at SriLankan Airlines, a Cabinet minister said.

“The meeting had been held following the weekly meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers,”sources said.
Meanwhile,State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne said recently that several international airlines, including Emirates have shown interest in partnering with SriLankan Airlines for its development under a Private Public Partnership (PPP) model.
Speaking to the media at UNP headquarters ‘Sirikotha’,Wickremaratne had said informal talks with several parties interested in investing with the national carrier had taken place.
He had also noted that officials were in contact with the Dubai based Emirates airlines currently and added that talks will be held with a few other airlines which have shown interest.SriLankan Airlines has been on the lookout for a foreign investor for some time to revive and develop the loss-making national carrier.
