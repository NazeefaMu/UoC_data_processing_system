Arrest warrants, dismissals and constitutional concerns

It is now almost one week since Qatar was cut off diplomatically by several Gulf States including Saudi Arabia and our Foreign Ministry was in regular contact with the Ambassador A.S.P. Liyanage to ascertain whether the crisis would in any way affect the 125,000 plus Lankans living and working there. It has now become apparent that there is no danger of food supplies running out per se, because several other Gulf States have come to Qatar’s aid and assured a continued supply of goods. This means that there is no immediate danger of a major effect on the Qatari economy and hence, on the jobs of Sri Lankans. With that concern out of the way, attention was focused once again on local political developments, although Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake will no doubt keep an eye on developments in UK and France, both of which had polls.
Dismissal of four Ministers in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC)

The Northern Province is in the news again due to several developments there. When the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) was first appointed, many politicians in the North as well as the South praised the composition of the NPC, saying it was an example for other Provincial Councils and even local bodies to follow.
However, over a period of time, it seems that the NPC has fallen prey to the same temptations that bedevil many other political bodies in the country. In the latest development, parties in the Tamil National Alliance including EPRLF, TELO and PLOTE have demanded the dismissal of four Ministers in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) charged with mass scale corruption. A special committee appointed by the Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran has recommended to remove Agriculture Minister Ponnuthurai Ayngaranesan and Education Minister Thambyrajah Gurukularajah.
EPRLF, PLOTE and TELO parties in the alliance have expressed in one voice the importance of removing these provincial ministers who were accused of corruption. EPRLF leader Suresh Premachandran has stressed that there is no point of dismissing provincial ministers one by one, adding that his party is of the view that all four provincial ministers should be removed, as charges of corruptions are leveled at them. Sixteen members in the Northern Provincial Council have handed over a letter to the Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran demanding the removal of four ministers.
Education Minister Thambyrajah Gurukularajah has already submitted his resignation to pave the way for what he called “a complete investigation”. The NPC will hold a debate on the corruption issue this week and more action on this matter is awaited.
There have been many allegations against the NPC that it was not properly utilizing the funds made available by the central Government as well as its own funds for Northern developments. While the details of corruption allegations are not exactly clear, this is not a good omen for the NPC.
The latest happenings at the NPC coincided with a (totally unrelated and pre-planned) visit to the peninsula by President Maithripala Sirisena, though what he said at subsequent meetings there has a bearing on the NPC. The President said that public representatives and public officials should have a proper plan to spend the money allocated by the government annually for the development of the Northern Province.
The President pointed out that it was the duty of public representatives and public officers to use the money allocated by the government in a given year for the benefit of the people in any given province. The President reviewed the progress of development activities in the Northern Province and discussed about future development programmes. Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, who had previously not attended many Government functions, was seated next to the President.
The President directed the officials to fulfill the essential requirements of the people in the Jaffna district, such as health, education and drinking water. Following the discussion, President Sirisena met a group of parents of disappeared children at the Governor’s Office where they handed over a letter to the President. This was an emotional moment that showed the President’s fullest commitment to the process of reconciliation. The Government has already initiated a Missing Persons Office, a mechanism that seeks to address their concerns. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are known as advocates of lasting peace and reconciliation.
PM returns
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe returned to the island on Saturday afternoon after a visit to the US, where he also addressed the World Ocean Summit that coincided with World Ocean Day (June 8). Although the Opposition initially criticized the premier’s visit, they fell silent after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too went abroad (to Japan) on a private visit. Ministers and officials regularly briefed the Premier via phone on the flood situation and other developments and the Prime Minister chaired an extensive meeting on flood relief hours before his departure to the US. A number of Ministers and officials were at the Bandaranaike International Airport to greet him on arrival. The Premier immediately went to work upon his return.
Bodu Bala Sena and religious disharmony
One of his first priorities was to call for tougher action on communal rabble rousers. There has been a spate of incidents targeting both Muslims and Christians in the last few months, which go against the very concept of reconciliation. The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) which was very active during the previous regime has been linked to a campaign against Muslim places of worship and followers.
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was again absent in Court for the hearing of the alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrate’s Court case, citing that he has received death threats. The Court of Appeal observed that the Court will have to issue warrant against the accused if he failed to appear in Court on next inquiry date.
President's Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda with Counsel Sasika Mithunaarachchi appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera told Court that their client was not appearing in Courts since he has received death threats. However, on a previous occasion, Counsel who appeared on behalf of Gnanasara Thera tendered a medical certificate to Court informing that Gnanasara Thera was being treated at hospital for an illness.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appearing for the Attorney General moved Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of accused for not appearing in Court on several occasions citing various reasons. The Court of Appeal Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Devika Tennakoon observed that they would not issue a warrant against accused but Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on July 18, 19 and 20.
On January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant. Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Court’s Jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Court’s jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
Since the Thera did not turn up in court for several court days in a row, many have expressed the fear that powerful persons could be giving him refuge. In fact, Cabinet Spokesman Rajitha Senaratne expressed a similar sentiment at the Cabinet news briefing. The Rupahavini news bulletin on Monday night had a special segment titled “Sodisi” (Investigation) on this aspect of the drama, where civil society representatives decried any attempt to shield the Ven. Thera from the law. Police, on the other hand, say there is no deliberate “going slow” to nab the Ven. Thera whose trail four Police teams are already following. Any attempt to provide a safe haven to the Ven. Thera is misguided and may end up damaging the good name of the Government among the minority communities, the civil society leaders said.
Meanwhile, the outspoken Minister S.B. Dissanayake has once again pointed the finger at former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa who the minister said “formed, bred and maintained” the BBS. “Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had communal and extremist ideas, and I always detested his brand of politics,” Minister Dissanayake said at a meeting in Kandy. “If the BSS is behind communal and religious tensions at present, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa may be aiding and abetting it,” he said. It is widely believed that Gotabhaya is planning to enter politics big-time since his brother Mahinda Rajapaksa will be unable to stand for a third term as a Presidential candidate in 2020 under the terms of the 19th Amendment.
Responding to criticism that the Government has been slow to deal with extremists, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera said the government will never let any extremists spoil the religious and racial harmony of the country. The Minister said several groups now attempt to create ethnic and religious conflicts by spreading false information via Facebook and other websites to disrupt the progressive journey of the government. (It was reported in foreign media that UK and French Government are considering a plan to fine YouTube and Facebook if they carry any extremists’ propaganda).
An organised group of members numbering about 40 are conducting mudslinging campaigns using separate websites against government parliamentarians, Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella told the media last week. They are led by a Joint Opposition MP, he said. The Minister said: “We will conduct a formal investigation into this and take legal action against this group. This is a well-organised attempt to tarnish the unity between the two major parties as well as to sabotage the process of providing long-term solutions for unresolved problems.” The problem of fake news seems to have raised its ugly head in Sri Lanka too.
Minister John Amaratunga and Media!
Minister John Amaratunga’s run-in with some members of the media last week naturally got a lot of coverage in both print and electronic media, though the minister later regretted his behaviour.
The Minister is known for causing controversy, but the incident will no doubt be a black mark for him. Politicians from all parties must conduct themselves with dignity and decorum at all times, not just in Parliament (whose proceedings are now telecast live). They also have to remember that smartphones with video capability are everywhere and any incident could be on Facebook and gossip sites in next to no time.
Gazette notification
These sites and newspaper columnists argued endlessly over the subjects of ministers and the gazette was finally published last week. It ended weeks of speculation over the National Lotteries Board and Development Lotteries Board, with Foreign Minister Karunanayake known to have made overtures to the effect that he wanted to retain them. This wish has been granted in the gazette and along with the NLB and DLB, several other institutions have been gazetted under the Foreign Ministry. Newspaper cartoonists had a field day over this, but several ministers from both sides were of the view that the two lotteries boards are more or less autonomous and the supervising ministry really does not matter.
According to the Gazette notification, the Department of Government Printing, National Film Corporation and State Printing Corporations are under the Minister of Public Administration and Management under Minister Vajira Abeywardena. The Ministry of Development Assignments, a new ministry, headed by Minister Tilak Marapana has been entrusted with the Department of Project Management and Monitoring, Employees’ Trust Fund and Academy of Financial Studies (Miloda). There were no other surprises.
Constitutional reforms
A lot of attention has been drawn to the process of constitutional reform with emphasis on whether the Executive Presidency should be retained or scrapped. It is common knowledge that a section of MPs in both the UNP and the SLFP want the Executive Presidency retained. Indeed, many of them have publicly said so. Another point of contention is whether Sri Lanka should be known as a “unitary” or a “united” country. The parties represented in the constitution making process are divided over this issue. The Joint Opposition and the Jathika Hela Urumaya seek to retain the unitary nature of the country while the SLMC, Tamil Progressive Alliance, All Ceylon Makkal Katchi and the EPDP prefer the wording “united republic of Sri Lanka”. The JO says this would make Sri Lanka virtually a federal state, bringing the f-word to the debate.
A prolonged discussion is now expected on nine different areas — the introductory chapters of the present constitution including Nature of State, Sovereignty and Religion, Principles of Devolution including land, Central Legislation on Provincial List Subjects, the Capital Territory, Second Chamber, Electoral System, the Executive, Constitutional Council and Law & Order. Changes and amendments will be accommodated as the process moves forward but there seems to be a general consensus to avoid any amendments that would require the people’s approval at a referendum.
There is also no consensus yet on the method of picking the Prime Minister yet, though three scenarios are available: Direct election, pre-nomination and the present Westminster system. The most favoured system seems to be pre-nomination where each party can nominate a prime ministerial candidate either from their party or another one. According to this draft proposal, after declaration of results, the Election Commission will determine whether or not a candidate for PM has received pre-commitments from a majority of all elected MPs. The candidate receiving the majority of pre-commitments will be declared elected as PM.
The draft Constitution will have clauses that prevent separation by any of the nine provinces and a proposal to establish a second chamber (with around 55 members), a feature found in many other countries. The Parliament will have around 233 members, a marginal increase from the present 225, which now includes 29 National List MPs. The electoral system is certain to be changed, with the Mixed Member Proportional Representation system in the lead. That is one thing that all parties agree on.
