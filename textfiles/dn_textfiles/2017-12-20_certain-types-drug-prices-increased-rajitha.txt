Certain types of drug prices increased - Rajitha

Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne stated that the prices of 48 types of drugs have been raised only by five percent to prevent local importers from incurring losses due to the continuously rising prices of medicine in the global market.
According to Minister Senaratne, the prices were raised in accordance with a request made by local pharmaceutical companies that import drugs.
The importers are incurring loss due to the price increase of drugs in the global market.
The price increase will be valid for a year and hereafter there will be no price increase again even the prices of drugs in the global market. The prices of 48 drugs reduced significantly on October 21 in 2016 (one year and two months ago), he said.
Earlier, the price of a paracetamol tablet was Rs. 1.30 and now it is only Rs. 1.37 (only seven cents increased). All pharmacies should sell the drugs according to the prices stipulated in the Special Gazette Notification 2049/31 of December 14. “The National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) will conduct raids to nab pharmacy owners which sell drugs at higher prices than gazetted,” he added.
