National diabetes prevention campaign ends

The diabetes screening camp on the final day of the `Walk for diabetes - Run for life’ campaign was held at Diyatha Uyana, Battaramulla, recently. More than 600 people were tested for diabetes, while Vision Care provided free eye check-ups.
Leaflets and booklets provided by SLDC were distributed, while Hemas Private Hospital provided free dietary and foot care advice for diabetes patients.
All who were screened were provided consultation by doctors from National Hospital, Sri Lanka, Homagama Base Hospital and Koswatta Base Hospital.
More than 3,500 people, including Lions, joined for the ‘Walk for diabetes’ campaign from Kaduwela junction to Diyatha Uyana, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. Health Miniser Dr. Rajitha Senaratne also participated.
Parallel to the walk, the general public were made aware of diabetes and other non-communicable disease prevention using leaflets developed by SLDC.
