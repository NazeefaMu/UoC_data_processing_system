Australian businessman gives evidence against Gammanpila

Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, a key witness in the alleged financial fraud case filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila, yesterday informed Colombo High Court that he learned from the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that Udaya Gammanpila had sold the shares which he had invested in the Pan Asia Bank through a fake Power of Attorney.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were present before the Colombo High Court yesterday, in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 20 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction that had taken place in 2000.
Witness Shaddick said that he never had signed a document executing a power of attorney to Gammanpila and therefore his signature had been fraudulently used as an authentic one in order to initiate the above mentined transaction.
In reply to a question raised by Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, the witness said he had never given power of attorney to Udaya Gammanpila. “I launched a metal recycling business in Sri Lanka in the early 90s with Sri Lankan businessman Sydney Jayasinghe. Gammanpila served as one of the employees of our company named Metal Recycle Colombo. Subsequently, my wife and I decided to invest shares of Digital Nominees another company belonging to us in the Pan Asia Bank,” the witness added. The witness said he has invested a sum of Australian Dollars (AUD) 100,000 in the Pan Asia Bank and further said he had constantly contacted with the Bank officials.
The witness said that he met Udaya Gammanpila as a young student at the Monash University in the early 90s and Gammanpila had won his wife’s trust as a genuine Buddhist.
“I had a fall out with Sydney Jayasinghe and it led to the collapse of my businesses in Sri Lanka. At that time, Udaya Gammanpila told me that there was a conspiracy to assassinate me by the youngest son of Sydney Jayasinghe. He advised me to be cautious,” he further added. Shaddick said that he had left the country 20 years ago and that he was able to lodge a formal complaint with the SIU in 2015. Further trial was fixed for March 14. The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling the shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick. The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.
