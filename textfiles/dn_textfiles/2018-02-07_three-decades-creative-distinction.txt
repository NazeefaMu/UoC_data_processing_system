Three decades  of creative  distinction

President Maithripala Sirisena visited veteran journalist, award-winning television producer, director and renowned author, Sunil Ratnayake, to congratulate him on completing 30 years in Sri Lanka’s television industry. President Sirisena joined Rathnayake’s friends and family at his residence.
Ratnayake’s three decades of illustrious career in television and film media introduced landmark productions which turned out to be successfully both artistically and commercially, President Sirisena noted.
The President added that Ratnayake was instrumental in taking Sri Lanka to greater heights of the international platform.
President Sirisena added that he would continue his effort of supporting the local production companies in building creative and profitable international co-production partnerships.
While extolling the notable efforts of Rathnayake, President Sirisena assured that a framework of formal co-production rebates on international productions will be introduced to secure greater in-bound production to help grow foreign investment, employment pathways for many talented and acknowledged production personnel and export opportunities.
