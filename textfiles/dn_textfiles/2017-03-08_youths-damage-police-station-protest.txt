Youths damage police station in protest

Two officers of the Bingiriya police station were injured and the police station was damaged to the value of nearly Rs. 200,000 when a group of youths behaved violently opposite the police station protesting against the action taken by police over a vehicle accident that killed a youth on March 6.
A youth died in a collision of a motorcycle and a van at Prasannagama on the Weerapokune-Bowatta road in Bingiriya on March 5. The van and its driver were taken into custody by the Bingiriya Police and the driver was produced before the Hettipola Magistrate and released on bail the following day.
The youths in the area protested and behaved violently opposite the police station alleging that police inaction led to the release of the van driver on bail who was under the influence of liquor at the time of the accident.
The protestors blocked the Chilaw-Kurunegala road for nearly four hours burning tyres and hurling stones at the police station.
Windows, the name board of the police station and a jeep were damaged during the violence.
The crowd was dispersed later after arresting a suspect and seizing 35 motorcycles, a lorry and two three wheelers used by the protestors to arrive at the station. Police said 35 suspects are to be arrested. Investigations are continuing.
