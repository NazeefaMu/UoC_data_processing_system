Usha Uthup: Let there be music

India and Sri Lanka share a timeless bond that encompasses religion, culture, language and of course, music. When the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka contemplated the best way to celebrate the 71st Freedom day, it opted for the latter. India has many world-class musicians, but none could have fitted the occasion like Usha Uthup, a big fan of Radio Ceylon which helped mould her career in the initial stages. With her ability in to sing in Sinhala, Tamil and English, she is the ideal cultural ambassador from India.
Her Freedom Day concert at the BMICH, Colombo was appropriately titled “Symphony of Freedom.” And what a symphony it turned out to be for the 1,600 people who flocked to the BMICH. The main hall was overflowing and there were many who watched the concert standing. The concert was dedicated to the youth – who were the majority in the audience anyway.
The audience got a glimpse of her truly global outlook when she started off with a perfect rendition of the Bee Gees/Boyzone love song “Words”. She worked the audience on this one, giving them the microphone to complete the chorus – “It’s only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away.” And she did take our hearts away with her words.
In fact, Usha or Didi as she is affectionately known, gave every possible chance for the audience to sing and clap along with her regardless of the song being performed. It was a wonderful audience that knew almost every song by heart.
Didi got things moving, recalling how she met James Bond in 1969, an experience that apparently left her “Shaken and Stirred” (“Didi, My name is Bond, James Bond”). This could have been a reference to the real-life Sean Connery, who had acted in “You Only Live Twice” in 1967 and whose next outing as Bond would come in 1971 in “Diamonds are Forever”. Bond, of course, had complimented her on her good looks (Didi is still youthful despite her advancing years). All this talk of James Bond led to her next song “Skyfall”, which was first performed by Adele for the Bond film of the same title starring Daniel Craig. This was a remarkable performance, made all the more entertaining by visuals from Skyfall projected on to the screen on the stage.
Next up was the immortal love song “Stand by Me” originally performed by Ben E King. It is always nice to hear a woman singing this melodious song – “When the night has come And the land is dark, And the moon is the only light we’ll see, No I won’t be afraid, no I won’t be afraid, Just as long as you stand, stand by me”.
The audience was eager to listen to the song that started it all – “Hare Krishna Hare Rama”, her very first movie songs shared with the legendary Asha Bhosle. This she delivered straight from the heart, accompanied by visuals from the 1971 Dev Anand film of the same name co-starring Mumtaz and Zeenat Aman. This stirred many audience members to clap and virtually dance in their seats. There was an equally rapturous reception to her next number,Mera Laung Gawacha, the Punjabi hit song originally sung by Musarrat Nazir and made even more popular by DJ Bally Sagoo through a remix.
One of the best moments of the concert came when out of the blue, she began to sing the evergreen Sinhala Baila Hit “Kandy Lamissi” followed by the world famous Indo-pop party song “Bombay Meri Hai” which was originally sung by Didi’s elder sister Uma Pocha who passed away recently. The song was penned by the legendary musician Mina Kava on a request by the recording company HMV to write a song about his city Bombay, now called Mumbai. Incidentally, Pocha herself had performed this very song in Colombo with the group Spitfires in 1970, just one year after its debut.
The song, which shared the same beat as Sri Lankan Baila, had already become a hit by then in Sri Lanka thanks to the Lankan pop group Jetliners, who were the house band at the discothèque of the iconic Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai in the 1970s. They even recorded two albums when they were in the city: The Jetliners Go Go at Blow Up and The Jetliners at the Taj Mahal Bombay. There is also a Sinhalese version of the song called “Ran Ran Ran (Gold Gold Gold). Usha’s performance of Bombay Meri Hai was nothing less than pure gold.
Then, without missing a beat, she went onto another Sinhala Baila hit – “Yaman Bando Vesak Balanna” (Banda, let’s go see Vesak) originally sung by the inimitable Desmond de Silva. Again, she let the audience sing the song along with her and at one point mildly chided the audience for getting the lyrics wrong. “I am going to teach you” she said laughing and sang it brilliantly and perfectly. Didi told the audience that it is the one Sinhala song that she regularly performs worldwide, which of course resulted in a thunderous clap.
Didi would have left a huge vacuum if she did not perform a Tamil song and what a song it was – the enormously popular worldwide hit “Kolaveri Kolaveri” also known as “Why This Kolaveri Di” (why this murderous rage, girl) originally performed by South Indian artist Dhanush in 2012 for the movie “3”. Sung in a light-hearted mixture of Tamil and English called Tanglish, the song about a young man’s failed love affair virtually crashed the Internet. Didi then performed a popular Malayalam song, after asking the Malayalam speakers in the audience to raise their hands. There were only a few, but no matter, the song captured the hearts of everyone.
That was the very essence of her show – it was an arrow that pierced every music lover’s heart. She was helped in this endeavor in no small measure by her four-man backup band. When the time came for the curtains to come down after nearly two hours, she asked the audience to light up their smartphones and sway along to the music, which they did. It was a magical moment – the darkness of the hall, the pinpoints of light and Didi’s mellifluous voice all coming together for one final assault on the senses.

Usha Uthup was born on November 7, 1947 in Bombay, India as Usha Vaidyanath Someshwar Sami. Her first public singing occurred when she was nine. Her sisters who were already exploring a music career, took her to the most popular radio announcer in India that time called Ameen Sawani who gave her an opportunity to sing on the Ovaltine Music Hour in Radio Ceylon. She sang a number called “Mockingbird Hill”. After that, several appearances followed through her teenage years.
Usha Uthup affectionately called Didi started singing in a small nightclub in Chennai called as Nine Gems in the basement of the erstwhile Safire theatre complex on Mount Road, when she was 20, wearing a saree and leg calipers. Her performance was so well received that the owner of the nightclub asked her to stay on for a week. Her next engagement took her to Delhi where she sang at the Oberoi hotels. A film crew belonging to Navketan unit and Shashi Kapoor visited the nightclub and they offered her a chance to sing movie playback. As a result, she started her Bollywood career with Ivory-Merchant’s Bombay Talkies (1970) in which she sang an English number under Shanker-Jaikishan and then the famous hit Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Then her career took off.
She sings in more than 16 Indian languages including Tamil and more than 10 world languages including English and Sinhala. She has held concerts around the world including in Sri Lanka. She has performed songs for hundreds of Hindi and other movies and also acted in several movies. She has also appeared in numerous TV and radio shows. An unofficial ambassador for India and Indian values, Usha speaks the Universal Language of Music and continues to amaze audiences around the world. As recognized by the Government of Kenya for her contribution to Swahili music, she is a true Citizen of the World.
