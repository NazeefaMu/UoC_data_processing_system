Tips for choosing organic food

Organic food is a great choice for our health and the health of the environment. The following tips can help you build your organic food pantry at home:
1. Find a farm, farmers market
Purchasing food that is both local and organic is ideal. Ask friends, family members, and co-workers for referrals to green markets in your area. You can
2. Ask Questions
Whether you are buying your food directly from the farmer or at your supermarket, do not be afraid to ask questions. Inquiring about whether products are certified organic, grown using organic methods, or produced locally shows farmers and store managers that these issues are important to you.
3. Read food labels
When seeking out organic food, read food labels. Packaged foods are often clearly marked with a certified organic seal. Fruits and vegetables typically contain stickers that contain a product look up (PLU) code to help identify how the food was produced. Organic produce has a 5-digit code that begins with a 9, conventional produce has a 4-digit code that begins with a 3 or 4, and genetically modified produce has a 5-digit code that begins with an 8.
4. Purchase organic food within your budget
Many individuals are working with limited food budgets. Buying food in season, buying in bulk, and splitting shares in your local CSA are all ways to buy quality organic food on a budget. In some cases, you may be able to save a few dollars by purchasing a mix of organic and conventional produce.
5. Find balance
While seeking out and purchasing organic and local food may sound ideal, it may not be practical for every person in every location. Some individuals simply do not have access to farmers markets or supermarkets that offer many organic options. Do not let that be a deterrent to eating more fruits and vegetables. Consuming more plant-based foods overall-organic or not-benefits everyone’s health. Simply do the best you can and buy the freshest and best quality fruits and vegetables you can afford.
