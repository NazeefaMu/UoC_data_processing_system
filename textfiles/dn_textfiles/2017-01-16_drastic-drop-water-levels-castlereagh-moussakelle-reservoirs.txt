Drastic drop in water levels at Castlereagh, Moussakelle reservoirs

The water level of Castlereagh and Moussakelle reservoirs, which feed the hydro electric plants at Laxapana, new Laxapana, Canyon Polpitiya and Upper Kotmale has been reduced to nearly 40 percent of full capacity due to the prolonged drought.
Since there is a possible danger to the existing water supplies the National Water Supply and Drainage Board requested the public to utilise water sparingly.
A large number of people visit Moussakelle to witness the ruins of the old Maskeliya Town which has reemerged due to the reduction of the reservoir’s water level.
Water cascading from Devon Falls and St. Clair Falls have also reduced to almost a trickle due to the existing dry weather.
