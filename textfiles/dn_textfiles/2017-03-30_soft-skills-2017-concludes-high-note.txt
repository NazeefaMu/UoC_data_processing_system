Soft Skills+ 2017 concludes on high note

The Faculty of Business at SLIIT recently conducted its annual Interschool Quiz Competition and Workshop on Soft Skills for the fifth consecutive year.
The workshop was targeted towards the grade11 to 13 Commerce stream students in State, Private and International schools with the aim to spark the interest on Soft Skills; team work, problem solving, creativity and thinking out of the box etc., whilst improving the business knowledge among school children. Even though these Soft Skills are increasingly becoming the hard skills of today's work force the school curriculum had ignored this vital aspect and this Softskills+ programme tries to bridge this gap.
Initially the preliminary rounds for the competition was held in Kandy, Malabe, Kurunegala and Jaffna with a participation of 73 school teams from 42 schools representing the whole country. From these teams, 32 teams qualified for the Grand Finale. This was a highly competitive interschool quiz which covered current developments in local and international business, globalization, international trade and business communications. St. Bridget's Convent team emerged Champions while two teams from VisakhaVidyalaya were adjudged First and Second Runners-up.
