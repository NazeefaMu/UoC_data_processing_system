Doi, Wickmayer crash out of Japan Open

TOKYO, TUESDAY: Top seed Misaki Doi and defending champion Yanina Wickmayer tumbled out of the Japan Women’s Open tennis tournament at the first hurdle on Tuesday.
Local favourite Doi, the world number 35, was stunned 7-5, 6-3 by Aliaksandra Sasnovich while Belgian Wickmayer also failed to win a set as she went down 6-1, 7-6 to Switzerland’s Viktorija Golubic in Tokyo.
“It’s a real pity to let it slip as I don’t get to play in Japan much,” said Doi. AFP
