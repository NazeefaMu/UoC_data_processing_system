Aphrodisiac selling racket busted

Schoolchildren targetted:
A racket involving the sale of aphrodisiac pills to schoolchildren in Mahiyangana at inflated prices close to Mahiyangana Police, was busted by Badulla excise officials and regional health officials when they jointly raided a pharmacy on Wednesday.
Investigations revealed that the pills sold to schoolchildren and youth at exorbitant prizes were heavy pain killers given to cancer patients and mentally unstable persons, which cannot be issued without a doctor's prescription. Each pill valued at Rs. 35 had been sold to schoolchildren and youth at Rs. 400.
The pharmacy owner was arrested on charges of running a pharmacy without a permit and sale of drugs without prescriptions.
He was released on an excise bond. He was ordered to appear before the Mahiyangana Magistrate on May 18.
