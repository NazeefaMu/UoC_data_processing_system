Speaker orders special inquiry into Harin’s alleged use of foul language

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that he ordered a special inquiry into the alleged use of foul language by Minister Harin Fernando in Parliament last Wednesday.
He made this observation in reply to a Point of Order raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
MP Gunawardena bringing the attention of the House towards the matter said the conduct of Minister Fernando was a clear violation of the Standing Orders. “Minister Fernando used lewd words to insult MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
This is type of behaviour is very obnoxious. The minister used un-Parliamentary language. The Speaker or any other MP can check the video footage and see for themselves. The Speaker should take some action on this minister. Recently, even the Australian Prime Minister was ordered out of the Chamber by the Speaker,” he said. The Speaker said that he had already paid attention towards the matter.
