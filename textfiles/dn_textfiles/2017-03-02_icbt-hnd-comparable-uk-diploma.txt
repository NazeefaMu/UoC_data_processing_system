ICBT HND comparable with UK Diploma

ICBT Campus Higher National Diplomas moderated by Cardi Metropolitan University UK is widely recognized by higher education institutions and employers around the world as evidence of academic achievement.
The National Recognition Information Centre for the United Kingdom (UK NARIC), the national agency in the UK for the recognition and comparison of international qualifications and skills, has carried out an independent benchmarking study of ICBT Campus Higher National Diplomas in Business Management, Information Technology, Psychology, Construction and Engineering.
The study found the ICBT HNDs to be comparable to the Diploma of Higher Education standard, UK Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ) Level 5. It provides an independent benchmark, supporting wider understanding of ICBT HND qualifications and recognition of their comparable educational level by universities, higher education institutions worldwide.
The UK NARIC benchmarking process is based on a well-established method for credential evaluation, including consideration of entry requirements, duration, content and structure, learning outcomes, modes of learning and assessment, and associated outcomes.
Each of these core qualification components was reviewed in comparison with recognized standards for UK higher education qualifications. Consideration is also given to the associated quality assurance processes and procedures in place for development, delivery and assessment of the awards.
The overall aim and purpose of the ICBT HND programmes correspond broadly with that of Diplomas of Higher Education, in that ICBT intends to develop a mixture of academic and practical skills combined with transferable “employability” skills to enable transition to the workplace.
As with the UK Diplomas of Higher Education, the ICBT HND programmes allow access to the third year of Bachelor programmes at leading British universities in similarly related subjects.
