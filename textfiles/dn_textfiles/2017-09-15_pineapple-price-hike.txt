Pineapple price hike

The price of pineapple has sky-rocketed at present and as a result, a medium-sized pineapple fruit is now sold at Rs. 200.
A large fruit is sold at Rs. 300 upwards. When asked from a fruit seller, he said that the major reason for this price increase is due to exporting them excessively.
