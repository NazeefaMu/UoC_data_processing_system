Container drivers, assistant drivers’ strike to continue

 
The strike launched by container drivers and assistant drivers will continue, All Ceylon Private Contract Services Employees Union Secretary B.I.  Abdeen said.
The Union secretary said that the decision was made since officials failed to provide an adequate solution to their demands at the meeting held last morning.
He warned to carry out the strike more intensely if their demands are not met soon.
