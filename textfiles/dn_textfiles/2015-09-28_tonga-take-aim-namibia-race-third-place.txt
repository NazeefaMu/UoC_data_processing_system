Tonga take aim at Namibia in race for third place

Tonga face Namibia on Tuesday with their aim reset on finishing third in Pool C to seal automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup while the southern Africans will simply be after a first-ever win.
Tonga went down to a shock 17-10 defeat by Georgia in their opening match, throwing the scrap for third place wide open behind heavyweights New Zealand and Argentina.
While Tonga mathematically remain in the hunt for second place, they have still to play the All Blacks and the Pumas, who finish up their pool campaign against Namibia.
Namibia have made eight changes to the starting line-up that lost 58-14 to New Zealand last week.
Indefatigable Saracens flanker Jacques Burger will captain the side coached by Welshman Phil Davies to make his 10th World Cup appearance, which leaves him one shy of the team record of 11 held by Hugo Horn.
Tonga, an ever-present at the World Cup bar one absence in 1991, have nine changes, coach Mana Otai explaining that decision by pointing to the short timespan between the next games.
