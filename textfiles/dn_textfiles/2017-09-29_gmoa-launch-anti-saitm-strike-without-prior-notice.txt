GMOA to launch Anti- SAITM strike without prior notice

 
The Government Medical Officer’s Association (GMOA) warned today it would launch a continuous strike without prior notice if the SAITM issue was not offered a permanent solution by the government.
The GMOA demands the closure of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
