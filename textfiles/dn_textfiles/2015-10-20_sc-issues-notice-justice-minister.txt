FR petitions filed by prisoners
SC issues notice on Justice Minister

The Supreme Court yesterday issued notice on Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe to appear in Court on November 12 in connection with 11 Fundamental Rights petitions filed by prisoners who are allegedly serving illegal jail sentence imposed by Magistrates exceeding their jurisdiction.
Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justices Rohini Marasinghe, Priyantha Jayawadena and Upali Abeyratne issued notice on the Justice Minister to inquire about the facts in this regard.
The petitioners stated that under Section 14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, a
Magistrate's Court can impose only a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years unless there are special powers of punishment given by some enactments.
Senior Counsel Kalyananda Tiranagama with Sandamalee Ekanayake instructed by Shyama Gamaarachchi appearing for the petitioners stated that one petitioner had been kept in illegal custody in prison since May 2010 after he has completed serving all sentences lawfully enforced on him. Counsel further submitted to Court that the petitioner was serving an illegal jail sentence of 72 years.
Tiranagama further informed that a woman prisoner has been sentenced to 66 years imprisonment, including a jail sentence of 22 years.
They had cited the Attorney General, the Commissioner General of Prisons, the Superintendent of the Mahara Prison and the Minister of Justice as respondents in the petitions.
The petitioner N. P. A.. P. Anura Saman Kumara of Bokalagama stated that he was sentenced to 116 months imprisonment by the Attanagalla Magistrate's Court in 2013 exceeding its jurisdiction for default of payment of arrears of maintenance in a case.
The petitioner stated that according to the Prisons' Department, the government is spending about Rs. 300 a day for the maintenance of a prisoner in custody and the public funds amounting to over Rs. 1,044,000 (300 x 30 x 116) will be wasted to maintain the petitioner till he completes serving this illegal jail sentence imposed by the Attanagalla Magistrate's Court exceeding its jurisdiction.
