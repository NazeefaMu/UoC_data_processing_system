Katrina  too wants  a ‘ZNMD’ sequel!

Okay, we know this topic has been done and dusted and we exclusively brought you Reema Kagti’s version saying that ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ (ZNMD) sequel is not happening. But let us just admit, we so want a sequel to ‘ZNMD’. And so does Katrina Kaif!
Recently, when we met the actress over a conversation while she was promoting ‘Zero’, the actress spoke at length about the characters she played that are her personal favourite. No points for guessing - Laila from ‘ZNMD’ topped the list. Kat even said that every time she meets Zoya Akhtar, she tells her that she should write a sequel. We so resonate with the thought.
Katrina’s other favourite characters from her filmography are Zoya from ‘Ek Tha Tiger’ and Indu from ‘Rajneeti’. On playing Babita in ‘Zero’, Kat said that her role was difficult and emotionally tiring.
Is there one role on Katrina’s wishlist? Well, she’d like to play a mythological character in a fantasy drama. We hope to see that soon!
