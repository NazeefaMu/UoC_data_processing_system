Dishonest jailer in hot water

A woman jailer attached to the Welikada Prison has been detected after she had drawn allowances and wages for the days that she had not reported for duty.
The jailer had engaged in this act for the past few months. A probe into this had been launched by officials attached to the Welikada Prison. It has come to light that the particular woman jailer had given instructions to her colleagues over the phone to sign on her behalf in the log book for her to draw the night duty attendance allowance.
All Welikada Prison jailers should be engaged in three night shifts a week for which they are paid an additional allowance which she had been drawing by signing fraudulently.
Investigations are continuing.
