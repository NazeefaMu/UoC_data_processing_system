NTC approves 6.56% bus fare hike

The Cabinet has yesterday approved a proposal to increase bus fares by 6.56% in view of the fuel price hike.
National Transport Commission (NTC) Chairman M.A.P. Hemachandra told the Daily News that the annual bus fare revision would take place every year in July and bus fares are revised based on a special formula.
They take into account various factors such as the rate of inflation, the price of a litre of diesel, electricity charges, maintenance costs and the price of tyres and spare parts.
The Committee of experts who convened on May 14 to discuss the revision of bus fares has decided to increase the bus fare by 6.56% considering the twelve factors related to the industry.
The minimum fare will however remain at Rs.10 and this revision will apply for both SLTB and private buses with affect from today. He further said all private bus unions summoned at a meeting held in NTC yesterday agreed to this bus fare hike. This increase will be in accordance with the annual bus fares revision taking place in June or July each year, in keeping with a so called Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the State transport authorities and the Private bus operators.
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne told the Daily News that all private bus associations have rejected the 6.56% increase in view of the fact that they asked for a minimum 10 percent increase.
“There will be private bus strike from midnight today to compel the authorities to grant a 10 percent increase. In addition to the diesel price hike, several other factors such as overhead costs for service and repair, crew salaries, tyres and tubes and other maintenance costs need to be considered when formulating the bus fare revision. “But, the NTC has totally neglected these facts. So private bus unions have been looking forward to a bus fare hike for the one year. It is the Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva who should be held responsible for the inconvenience faced by commuters due to the bus strike form midnight today,” he added.
