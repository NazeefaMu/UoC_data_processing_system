LRH to begin bone marrow transplants

Bone marrow transplant surgeries for children will commence within the next three months at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Dr. Senaratne, at the moment bone marrow transplant surgeries take place at the Maharagama Cancer Hospital. Further, bone marrow transplant surgeries for Thalassemia patients will commence shortly at the Kandy General Hospital soon. One bone marrow transplant surgery for a child costs Rs. 5 million and most parents cannot afford it.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the sale of cigarettes has gone down by 47 percent as a result of increasing the tax on tobacco. More steps will be taken to control smoking. Sale of cigarettes will be banned around a radius of 500 metres from a school and cultivating tobacco will be banned from 2020. The tobacco cultivators will be directed to other cultivations.
Developing rural hospitals is very important and Emergency treatment Units should be set up at all rural hospitals. Even the WHO accepted the fact that this Government made a change in the health sector. The people received a lot of benefits from the Government’s decisions such as reducing prices of 47 drugs, giving lenses and stents free of charge etc, he added.
