Citizens' Mail

Chaos in the calm
The particular is a convenient alternative connection to Malabe from Talahena Junction (cemetery point). It is a 30 ft wide road but in a very bad state of repair for the past several years.
This road is only 1.5 km and the damages are due to unauthorised pipe water connections carried out by residents through private contractors. The private contractors dig up the road and after completion of the work the earth is just pushed back in a heap without any levelling and motorists and other road users find it extremely difficult to use the road and the situation is chaotic during rainy days.
Also, these unauthorised connections are carried out during the night without any warning boards displayed and the contractors are said to be ex-Water Board workers. To make matters worse, the unauthorised structures have encroached on to the road blocking the storm water drains and privately owned three-wheelers are parked at crazy angles adding to this inconvenience. Young motorcyclists without helmets are frequently speeding on this road and illicit hooch is freely available in this area. Complaints so far have fallen on deaf ears. If authorities are concerned they should pay a visit to this place and check for proof of this exposure.
Also, road widening plans are in place but influential affected parties are preventing this from happening.
