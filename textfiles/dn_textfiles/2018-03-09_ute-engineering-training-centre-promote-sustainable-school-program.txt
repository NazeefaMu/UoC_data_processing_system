UTE Engineering Training Centre to promote sustainable school program

UTE Engineering Training Centre of United Tractor & Equipment (Pvt) Ltd (UTE) decided to provide opportunities for students to develop technical skills and enhance career prospects by partnering with the Western Province Education Department.With the guidance and advice of Vimal Gunarathna, Director Education, Western Province and aligned under the ‘Child Protection’ theme of the Sustainable School Programme, UTE Engineering recently hosted educators at its state-of-the-art training centre, demonstrating its own concept and capabilities in offering free full-day workshops to create awareness of the value of its Training Facility, to all G. C. E. A/L students studying ‘Engineering Technology’ as a subject.
Commenting on this initiative Prasan Fernando, Chairman, UTE said, “As knowledge gained by students tends to be primarily theoretical and with little access to practical concepts applicable to real-world scenarios, our sophisticated Training Centre is the ideal venue for students to gain a balanced understanding on the engineering technology field. Collaborating with the Western Provincial Department of Education, UTEEngineering Training Centre is now a partner in helping future generations build their skills.”
Aravinda Jayasekera, General Manager, Product Support Services,UTE, officially welcomed the participants on behalf of the company in the presence of senior management and other personnel.
Attending the awareness programme were representatives of more than 50 schools in the Western province and senior officials of the Education Department. UTE staff conducted several presentations during the eventto showcase the structure and value of the proposed programme and modules to be covered.
All participants were also provided an opportunity to view and tour UTE’s sophisticated equipment for engine performance monitoring, failure analysis and modern facilities including its Engine Workstations, a Dozer, the Computer Room and Hydraulic Laboratory.
Previously, UTE Engineering has on its own initiative invited a few schools from the Western Province on field visits to its Training Centre and the benefits to over 120 students who attended these sessions were also demonstrated to the educators present.
Key architect of the programme, Gayan Maldeniya, Head of Training, UTE noted, “As industry pioneers it is our duty to help the future generation understand the industry and pursue career prospects.”
Schools in the Western Province which offer ‘Engineering Technology’ as a subject and are keen for students to attend the free workshops are requested to contact UTE Officials for additional information or any queries about the programme.
