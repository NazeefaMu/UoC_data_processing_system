SRI LANKA – A MOMENT OF RECKONING

Had those in the Good Governance Coalition given serious thought to the contradictions they were experiencing and the difficulties encountered in running the country’s democratic administration, their tragedy would not have happened. The Good Governance government should have known better how to conduct its affairs in patience and wisdom realizing that parties in coalition are multiple and that there needs to be cooperation and collaboration in all fronts to keep their governance stable. Coalitions always run the risk of breakdowns unless the parties involved are ready to keep steady despite difficulties and differences they might eventually encounter in running a government together.
This is evident given the fact that parties in coalition are always from different political persuasions and they need to some extent compromise and find common course of action in the interest of the common good of the people whom they are striving to serve thus creating an even field. Politics is no game for politicians only to play as they want with scant attention to the sorry plight of the people. They are elected representatives to care to their interests.
Political leadership
Sovereignty rests in the people: the country belongs to the people. Politicians represent the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the people. It is them that they represent in the august chambers of democracy: the parliament and the Cabinet on the national level. One must argue convincingly about their commitment to work for the common good of the citizens, irrespective of all differences.
Sri Lanka has seen diverse vicissitudes of politics of all hue and colour for the last seven decades of her national life. It has taken stock of the turnings and twisting of political leadership that often times left the people in utter confusion and anger on the one hand, and on the other, insincerity, lack of authenticity, bribery, lying, cheating and corruption kept deranging the nation’s march towards prosperity and progress. Those who wielded power at the expense of the people’s vote must render an account for this national disaster.
Many lament the shocking speed at which Sri Lanka had deteriorated in the last few decades in comparison with other Asian countries who have prospered by leaps and bounds. Once in the dust of ashes, they have now risen to be economic giants in the continent. Their forward-march will indeed impact the international scene in the decades to come.
We have had serious problems during this post-independence period. The most crucial was the ethnic tensions that conflagarated in violence many a time. These were “black” events. One remembers the ethnic riots of the late fifties that eventually led, little by little to an armed conflict that struck this poor country which could not afford dumping its little resources on heavy arms. We are not a country trained for war or a war-type culture or ethic. Our religions abhor violence and destruction of life and property. It is the “dhamma-deepa” of non-violence and metta, this august historical seat of Theravada Buddhism that we are so proud of. How come, it has turned to be a land of cheating, lying, fraud, violence and confrontation many a time? How come our politicians have grown to be a breed of irresponsible leaders who dare squander the assets of this beautiful country graced with so much of natural resources and an impeccable culture of our noble people? How come that politics in this country had gone in the wrong direction of party-politics that confuses our people even today?
When they read our newspapers, the common man in the village and in the fields will go into tantrums of confusion not knowing what is happening to their dear motherland! May be those in the cities and those in high ranks of the social class will conveniently overlook this plethora of media reports and just turn a blind eye to the events that have overtaken us.
Unstable governments
This country has had serious set-backs from the time of the short-lived SWRD epoch that despite its seductive socialism was rocked by a number of hartals and strikes destabilizing the normal functioning of a “peoples’ government”. Then came a period of lull but yet with unstable governments. Finally came the “poor era” of the 1970’s to be quickly overturned by one of open economy, free-trade zones and accelerated hydro schemes. While there were no multiple mega-projects, the Premadasa-era brought economic projects and awakening to the villages to be matched with a fitting educational programme to the rural youth. In the meanwhile, the ethnic conflict raised its head once again and devoured this country for three-decades. It was a time of utter disaster and catastrophe to the island nation.
It brewed through a terribly misguided ethnic and language policy.
Our good name was scarred in the inter-national scene and the war-crimes charge was hailed at us, an issue over which we are still battling for clearing our name.
With people unsteady with their choice at the ballot, two major parties decided to form a national government in order to wrest the country of the economic crisis, political instability and work hard to regain the lost name in the international scene. This succeeded to some extent. But much of the bribery and corruption within the country could not be tackled and ideological differences within the leaders of the national government became so intense that radical changes were carried out in the seats of power.
The normal affairs of the government in maintaining peace and order in public life have to be secured. The political leaders at the helm must act with restraint and with immense wisdom and foresight so that the country does not plunge into a worse state of disaster. As soon as possible, the confusion had to be taken head-on and with great humility on the part of everyone. This is not the time to fish in troubled waters. Many pundits will come out with a plethora of opinions presuming to solve the riddle. At this moment, common sense and love for the country must take primacy among all: politicians and the masses at large. Both these sectors are responsible to bring back peace, order, harmony and prosperity to the motherland.
All right-thinking citizens must become aware and understand the serious nature of the crisis that has overtaken us. While the political leaders have to cease playing games, the civil organisations and the religious leadership of the country must intervene to indicate the proper path to tackle the crisis.
Nothing can be achieved with political instability and an ailing economy. A sound economy cannot be built with a status-quo experiencing constant political instability. One depends on the other. This is the twin-challenge that politicians and people at large face today.
The choice is ours to patiently and wisely tackle this phenomenon.
The hour has come for a serious reckoning. Beyond all petty vested interests and greed for power, this is the moment to act with a sense of responsibility inspired by a true patriotic love and concern for the good of the motherland.
If all act tactfully and prudently, the constitutional crisis can be transformed into a moment of opportunity.
