JR’s birth anniversary commemorated in Tokyo

The 112th birth anniversary of the late President and UNP leader J. R. Jayewardene was commemorated in a temple in Hachiji-shi, Tokyo, Japan, recently.
Sri Lankans in Japan and Japanese nationals took part in the event organised by the UNP branch in Japan. Floral tributes were laid to the statue of the late J. R. Jayewardene in Yamada Unriyoji temple, which had been erected in appreciation of his speech defending Japan at the Peace Treaty of San Francisco on September 4, 1951.
The event was organised for the fifth time. The messages of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Sri Lankan Ambassador to Japan Prof. Dhammika Ganganath Dissanayake were read out at the event.
