Sketching the greeny giants

Charmaine Mendis and Minha Mahushukeen, together with their guest artist Karunasiri Wijesinghe will hold their exhibition ‘For the love of Trees’ from January 19 – 22 at the Lionel Wendt Art gallery from 9.30 am – 7 pm daily.
The paintings and drawings created by Charmaine in this exhibition she say are “an expression of myself, my feelings, my experiences, my escape; they are my meditations, my relaxation, and the meanderings of my mind, whilst my body is firmly rooted in the mundane present”.
According to Charmaine, her only employment of technique is in the tree drawings. “They are the result of my mentor, Karunasiri Wijesinghe’s inspiration, encouragement and training, although in my own estimation I fall far short of the perfection he requires. For me these drawings have been a giant step in my progress. The black and white designs are the creative wanderings of my pen, done mostly on long airline flights. My mind just follows the meanderings of my hand, and I get lost in their creation. The colour pencil work tries to capture the unseen nuances of colour in Nature. The colour washes are experimental. I just go with the flow,” she said.
When it came to Art, Charmaine was always keen on sketching and drawing, mostly landscapes of sorts, which always had trees. “They were always leafless as I was unsure just how to draw leaves. I never succeeded in conquering perspective and was always aware of this. Somehow I managed to sneak in a painting or two, into the annual art show of St Bridget’s Convent, and surprisingly, even won the prize one year,” she said.
The turning point in Charmaine’s artistic life came in 2005 when she went to see an exhibition of black and white tree drawings by Karunasiri Wijesinghe. “I was absolutely enthralled, and it was then that I knew beyond a doubt that this was how I wanted to draw trees. I immediately enrolled at the Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts, where he was teaching, and began really learning to draw, from the basic cube upwards. I soon moved on to real life trees, learning all the subtleties of light and shade, texture and grain and so much more,” she explained.
When Karunasiri’s contract was over, he agreed to start a class at home, where two or three of them began working together. “We sketched always from life, going out of Colombo on sketching trips, even to Yala for a whole five days of serious work, not animal viewing. The results of those trips and our weekly classes, was Vruksha, an exhibition of black and white drawings of the trees of Sri Lanka. This was in 2011. Then came Svayam, which is a Sanskrit word with many meanings. I have used it in the context of “self”. On January19 we have ‘For the love of Trees’ and I hope that the many lovers of nature in Sri Lanka will visit our exhibition,” Mendis added.
Meanwhile Minha traces her identity as an artist to two sources. The first a deep appreciation of natures wondrous forms and the second is the passion for drawing. “From these two wellsprings has flown a stream of inspiration that has guided my development from a young age,” Minha said. She is most appreciative of her mother’s encouragement of her early creative efforts and she is also fondly referred to as the ‘tree woman’ by her friends.
