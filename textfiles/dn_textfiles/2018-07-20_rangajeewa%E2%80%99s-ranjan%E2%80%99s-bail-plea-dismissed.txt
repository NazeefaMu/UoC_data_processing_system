Rangajeewa’s, Ranjan’s bail plea dismissed

A revision application filed by Police Narcotics Bureau IP Neomal Rangajeewa and former Prisons Department Commissioner Emil Ranjan Lamahewa seeking bail over a magisterial inquiry was yesterday dismissed by the Colombo High Court.
The duo were remanded for allegedly being involved in killing of 27 prisoners during the prison riots which took place at the Welikada prison in 2012.
High Court Judge Champa Janaki Rajaratne rejected the revision petition citing that ongoing investigations into the incident could be hampered if court granted bail on the suspects at this time.
Through the revision application, two suspects sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrate’s refusal to enlarge them on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
Court was informed that IP Neomal Rangajeewa had entered the prison and gathered prisoners by name prior to the killings.
