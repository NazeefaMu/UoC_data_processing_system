Empty lobby

It is almost passing midnight. The lobby is nearly deserted by now. Though it’s dark, through the railing I could see the white waves of the sea. The humming of the waves never ceases. My untangled hair is dancing with the sea winds. I closed my eyes and listened. I feel as if my very soul is filled with the perpetual buzz of the sea.
Though imprisoned at the dark depth of my heart, the never fading face of him, flashed upon my inward eye, like a thunder bolt striking through the infinite sky. I remembered the moments spent together. Holding our hands we walked along the wet beaches under the starry sky, letting the unruly waves to cleanse our feet. Remembering the soft kisses placed upon my forehead and yearning lips, I woke up from the trance I was drowned in.
The lobby is entirely empty by now. I felt my blood being warm amidst the salty sea winds. A fiery sensation was over powering the frozen memories hidden at the corner of my heart. Once again after years, I longed to see his blank face with speaking eyes, to feel the warmth of his finger tips on my bare skin and to sense his gentle breath, wrapping me all over.
I heard the clock striking. It is midnight. The lobby is completely isolated. I walked up to the railing and climbed the stairs down to the beach. I could feel the moist of the sand beneath my feet. I let my feet to be soaked in the coldness of the waves, while by body was aching with the warmth of the cherished memories.
