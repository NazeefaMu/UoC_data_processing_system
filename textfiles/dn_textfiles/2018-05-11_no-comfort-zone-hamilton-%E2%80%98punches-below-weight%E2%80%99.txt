No comfort zone as Hamilton ‘punches below weight’

Barcelona, Thursday: Lewis Hamilton has admitted that he is punching below his weight as he struggles to understand how his Mercedes car reacts to this year’s tyres.
The world championship leader and defending four-time champion told reporters on Thursday that he has not given any thought to his position after his lucky win at last month’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
“That is the last thing on my mind right now because I am more concerned that we can get on top of all the issues,” he said.
“I have zero comfort and, since the last race, I have not thought for one second that I am leading the world championship. - AFP
