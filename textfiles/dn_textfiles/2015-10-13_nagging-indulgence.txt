A nagging indulgence

A Master’s for creative writing? That’s hardly possible, you would guess. But the reality is that creative writing is no longer a job done purely in your imaginative realm. It requires researching. Like it or not, creative writing has turned out to be a competitive industry. Madhubhashini Disanayaka Ratnayake read Creative Writing for her Master’s. That aside, she finds a vociferous (possibly addictive) reader within herself. So to say, this litchat could be quite a comfort zone for her.
Q: Why do you write?
A: Because that is what makes me feel most myself. Because I am angry about some things and do not know how to put things right except to put it into words. (I have this bad habit of trying to fix things!) Because - outside of my family - that is what I feel gives my life most meaning.
Q: What is your muse?
A: Good books. Every time I read something breathtaking, I want to try and write something as good. Because I read some of the best writers around, I am probably never going to do that, but at least I am trying to get to some point ahead. At least a small step forward on a very very long road is better than not moving at all. Complacency is a very dangerous thing.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most?
A: Serious stuff, I guess. Something that teaches me something about life, about people, about another way of looking at things. We are very limited in our personal lives - there is only a particular range of feelings and emotions that we can go through - though admittedly that can get pretty broad sometimes too! But books give access to an unlimited number of emotions. Then you become bigger, greater. That said, I really loved the Harry Potter series too - that would probably not come under serious stuff but pure entertainment.
Q: What are your favourite books?
A: Too many to list. But I will tell you some of my favourite authors - Tony Morrison, Alice Walker, Nadine Gordimer, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Magaret Atwood, Alice Munroe, Jeannette Winterson, Nadeem Aslam, Amitav Ghosh, Caryl Philips, Marquez, Ben Okri and others I have forgotten to name here. I like almost all the books that these writers have written.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours?
A: Thank you.
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book?
A: Of course. It is actually very hard to read what you have written some time back. Very often you have to try and not cringe.
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards?
A: Being human, when I get an award, I think it is good. When I don’t, I think it’s bad. So I love the Gratiaen. And don’t think much of the State Literary Award. This is said just to show how fallible and human writers can be. There is nothing objective about what we say.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most?
A: Award winning, I guess. It depends very much on who the judges are - and what the award is. When I choose books at the British Council for example, when I don’t know the author, I check in the cover to see if it has got any award. That is how I discover great writers I hadn’t heard of, like Pat Baker for example. But then the genres such as Fantasy like Harry Potter and Detective like Agatha Christie are very appealing to me too. Those belong to the popular, I guess. Goes to show that really good writing is simply really good writing: award winning books are popular as well and vice versa.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating?
A: I read mostly when I wait for something to happen. Since I am a mother who drives children for many of their activities, I get a lot of that - possibly my vociferous reading is thanks to this fact. I read guiltlessly at those times. At home, when I read, there is this nagging feeling that there are many others things that have to be done. One of these days I will get rid of that, probably, but when the kids are young, putting your feet up and reading seems an indulgence even though my heart and brain tells me it is not.
