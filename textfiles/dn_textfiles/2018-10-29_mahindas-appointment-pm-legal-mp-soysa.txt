Mahinda's appointment as PM legal - MP Soysa

Parliamentarian Ranjith Soysa said there is no issue with the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister of the country when he has the majority. He said that in 2015, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who did not have the majority in Parliament, was appointed as the Prime Minister after replacing then Prime Minister D.M.Jayaratne, who had over 130 seats and a majority. The new Prime Minister was appointed under the provisions of the Constitution and therefore the United National Party is leveling baseless allegations to mislead the people.However, the people of the country are wise enough to understand the correct picture of this situation.He said that if Parliament is summoned tomorrow, they are ready to show the majority in Parliament.
