Professionalism vital for law and order

First and foremost, we must understand that our country has undergone tremendous hardships. People were subject to suffering. A large number of valuable lives were lost due to terrorism, insurgency and communal riots in the recent past.
Looking back at history, it is important to examine the root cause. Why did we have to pay with a large number of valuable lives to come out of this situation? Where did we go wrong? It is the responsibility of the people in power to identify the root cause and make sure that we do not experience this unfortunate situation once more.
The security personnel, who came forward voluntarily to protect the nation, have all the right to discuss this matter with the public. As a part of the security personnel, we believe that human life is the most important aspect of the world. The 1971 insurgency, the 1980 northern terrorism, the 1988-89 southern insurgency shall not re-emerge.
A country that has suffered a brutal war for over two decades shall now realize the importance of Law and Order Ministry as well as Defence Ministry. The ministries should be under professionals with knowledge and experience who could produce results. If you look at a country like Israel, surrounded by the Arab World, it survives purely owing to the professional and dedicated leadership of intelligence and security apparatus.
Political leadership
Having a politically matured and a balanced personality in charge of Law and Order Ministry is not a bad move at this juncture. The incumbent minister is a reliable and experienced politician well positioned to offer leadership to the ministry. The minister’s role will be to strengthen the departments under him and with all resources. Plus, the Ministry Secretary is a key figure who should be able to win the confidence of professionals under him. He should be able to offer genuine political leadership. One may wonder, at the same time, how a civilian secretary will fit into guide the police and military.
When you look at the history of this country, you may reflect on why we had to face insurgency and terrorism at a high level. We had to pay a huge penalty by sacrificing valuable lives including leaders and high ranking officials.
How did we lose the grip to protect our leaders and efficient officials? Why could not we identify the threat at the correct time and counter the same with an effective security system? It is true that we had excellent civil servants in the calibre of G V P Samarasinghe, D B I Siriwardena, Lionel Fernando and W T Jayasinghe. With due respect to all, it is very clear that the commodity of quality state officers are rare today.
On the same line, look at officers like General Sepala Attigala and Cyril Herath. They were highly qualified professionals who held the positions with respect. They won the confidence of the political leadership and the public. We must also realize that they were all civilians before they joined the specialized units. They underwent training, became professional officers, earned reputation and rendered yeoman service to the country.
A country that suffered for 30 long years under brutal terrorism should not drop the guard at any stage. We have to maintain a high standard of intelligence, policing, defence, protection of territory and stable economy in order to take our country to the next level.
Eradicating terrorism
The biggest achievement in our time is eradicating terrorism. Yet since it was a human problem, we have to reach the next stage. That is strengthening the life of people who suffered for over three decades. If you do not realize the importance of this situation and have real professionals to handle the present situation, you have to remember the historical evidence: “at the end of a conflict, it will lead to another.” We must realize the same and take a harder look. To earn peace, we had to pay a huge price for sacrificing young lives and we should not face a similar situation again.
Police, armed services, military, intelligence units have done their part. People have sacrificed a lot and suffered enough. They should feel they have a future and their children have a future.
It is worth to turn back and see, after sacrificing so much. It is up to the political leaders to map out the revival strategy and the plan to take our country to the next level. Having said that, what has happened after the war? The politicians should stop and look over the shoulder and see where they have gone. Have they done their part to the country? It is up to the political leaders to strengthen the economy of this country, which should be the top priority. With the eradication of terrorism, the path has been cleared to implement the national development plan. They can learn from the forces who achieved the challenge of terrorism by having effective goal-oriented officers to produce results and got the better of the most brutal terrorist organisation in the world. It was purely owing to the commitment, vision, strategy and the determination and the leadership displayed at ground level. This proved that you should have correct people to the correct slot and you cannot be sentimental.
If you miss this opportunity, by not having professionals to launch the future productive plan for the country, the future generation is going to suffer. By the time the professionals who rendered a yeoman service to the country is gone, it will be a new start for the younger generation. When the Constitution was changed, they accommodated the option of having a national list to the Parliament. It is purely in the interest of the country and not in the interest of the party or to get personal friends accommodated.
National security
They must realize that the professionals should be roped into the political leadership chain. I strongly believe that police and defence officials, who have sacrificed a lot, earned high reputation and won the confidence of the people, should get an opportunity to enter the Parliament from the national list and contribute to the national security. The national security is the topmost priority. There are no shortcuts. The basics have to be implemented with the help of experienced and knowledgeable professionals. The Law and Order Ministry is not the place for a novice. The country’s future and progress depend on the security and safety of the people who will contribute to a stable economy.
We must realize that we are going through a transitional period after a long-drawn war. It is the professionals who should guide the government at this juncture to cross this difficult path. See the number of crimes reported for a day and the brutal manner in which they are engaged in. This clearly shows the mentality of the criminals. It needs immediate remedial action and strategy to arrest this situation.
Countries like Malaysia have gone through similar changes in the past. It is not a bad idea for us to do a study and see whether we could implement a similar strategy to overcome this grave situation.
