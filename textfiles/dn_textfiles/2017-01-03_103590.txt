The Colombo Chief Magistrate’s Court yesterday fixed for March 3 the corruption case filed against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama for allegedly causing unlawful loss to the government after appointing an individual as a Deputy Chairman of the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB).

The High Court is yet to deliver a verdict in this regard.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against Welgama under section 70 of the Bribery Act on four charges.
