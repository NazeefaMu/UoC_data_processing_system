‘VEVO 17’

The CMB Volunteers of ADIC (Alcohol and Drug Information Centre) have organised a talent show of music, song and beat boxing with the objective of making the youth of this country understand that alcohol is an impediment rather than a driving factor towards happiness.
Titled VEVO 17, the show’s theme is “Who said Alcohol is Fun?” and takes place on July 1 at 6.30 pm at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort Auditorium in Colombo.
“The preliminary round was held on May 27 and 28, and the response from the youth of this country was very encouraging. We have 12 very talented contestants at the finals in the categories of solo singing, beat boxing and bands, and this promises to be a great evening”, the organisers said commenting on a press release.
Supporting this project are the Seylan Bank, Commercial Credit, Pulse, Vevra, Shan Studios and Sun FM.
