Easy ways to minimize your phone addiction

Funny thing: Your phone is designed to make you addicted. So we consulted with experts—a neuroscientist and a monk—for practical advice on Zen-ing out your phone.
Here’s an embarrassing story: The other day, I was heading out from my apartment to pick up some food. It was so nice out that I thought: I’ll just leave my phone and enjoy the walk. But then, as I opened my door: Wait. What if I get stuck in the elevator? Who would I call? HOW would I call? What would I DO waiting for the cops to arrive—just sit there? Do the police even show up for stuck elevators? So I took my phone. I did not get stuck in the elevator.
Chances are that even if you’re not as hopeless as me, you’d likely still own up to using your phone more than you’d like to—and yet you’d probably just as readily agree that the idea of parting with our phones for an extended period of time (say, like, a work day) is not just anxiety-inducing; it’s wildly impractical. Completely unplugging—going on a phone-free retreat, for instance—can be a healthy, productive experience, but at some point, you’re going to return to the world of outlets. Or, as Sensei Ron Hogen Green, a monk and one of the teachers at the Zen Center of New York City, puts it: “If the Buddha were alive now, don’t you think he’d have a phone? Of course he would.”
Okay, but what would the Buddha’s iPhone look like? Can you Zen out your phone? How do you maximize productivity and minimize distracting black holes? Where’s the happy medium between touching your iPhone 80 times a day and not touching it at all? Ultimately, that answer is highly personal, and will depend on what you want to get out of your phone (hopefully it’s probably not 116 weeks deep in your ex-girlfriend’s Instagram). But we did get a monk and a neuroscientist to offer helpful insights, which we then used to derive what we hope are equally helpful tips.
Let yourself off the hook: Your dependency is not (entirely) your fault.
Ramsay Brown, a neuroscientist who’s on the Dopamine Labs team that created the app Space, which delays the time between opening an app and receiving the stimulus that delivers an addictive hit of dopamine (a like; a notification; a text), says that the reason you like being on your phone so much is by design.
"The people who get to call the shots about your social-media stream and your attention span don't have your best interests in mind. You are not the customer of these things. You are the thing being sold. They know you can't leave the home without it. And they know they can move ad units off of that,” he says. “You have robots being given directives about brand preference and then, behind the scenes, subtly tuning frequencies and ratios and schedules of when you should be shown ads or high-fives or notifications, blindly optimizing you for some consumptive funnel for the highest bidder. That is not a sci-fi dystopia. That is Tuesday.”
Pretty dark, huh? So what to do?
Put it on "Do Not Disturb"—even during the day.
We don't just like our dopamine. We like it fast. And these days, we get it fast. Too fast, says Brown: "Your brain was wired for: I better go out and forage—this is gonna take me a while. Okay, I found the food. The food is tasty. Great. Nothing about our built environment today has any bearing on the way we were wired evolutionarily, especially when it comes to the digital context. The same computing performance pressures that made your phone better, your TV flatter, and the porn in more HD are making your phone quicker. Inadvertently, we've taken the delay between when your soul itches a little bit—that moment of boredom or frustration or loneliness—and getting to scratch it with that little hit: Let me open Facebook for a sec. And we are not wired for that speed."- www.gq.com
