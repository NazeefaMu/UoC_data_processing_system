Healthy performance across its logistics sector resulted in Expolanka Holdings PLC posting a revenue of Rs. 17.1 billion during the third quarter of 2016, reflecting a 21% improvement in comparison to the same quarter of the previous financial year in the face of exchange rate fluctuations and a challenging external environment.
Despite improved turnover, the company recorded a profit before tax of Rs. 433 million reducing 23% in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year.
Growth in turnover was led by the group’s logistics division which posted a healthy quarterly increase of 24%in revenue to reach Rs. 14.8 billion at the end of the quarter in review despite reduced demand and increased pressure on margins.The company saw increases in the US trade lane as a result of Thanksgiving and year end retail sales.
