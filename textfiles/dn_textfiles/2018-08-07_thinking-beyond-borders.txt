Thinking beyond borders

Polonnaruwa is dazzling with Presidential blessings. Not one or two but 180 development projects were commissioned by President Maithripala Sirisena within two days writing a glorious chapter in its history. We are happy. So is he.
This would ease the lives of Polonnaruwa residents as well as visitors to the historic city. Almost all projects are infrastructure developments. The fact that none would generate new employment opportunities or increase production capacities should not be harped at this happy moment. Infrastructure projects take long to pay dividends and hence they won’t be immediately benefitted by the residents of Polonnaruwa. However, they have a high showpiece value and are sure vote attractors at elections.
The benefits of Hambantota development of a similar nature during the last regime was not felt by the ordinary public. The poor peasant there continues to be poor and embroiled in a death trap. Carpeted wide roads, magnificent new buildings and conference halls, cricket grounds etc., have not brought any tangible relief. We are yet to produce a Sangakkara from Angunukolapelassa or a Muralitharan from Dambulla.
People-friendly approach
Developed land in Hambantota has been grabbed by the rich outside the region. The same fate awaits Polonnaruwa.
Look at the disparities.
While the Western Province contributes 44 per cent to the country’s GDP, North Central Province contributes only five per cent, according to a UNESCO report in 2011. Uva and the Northern Province contribute four per cent each. That means the development there is only one-tenth or only a decimal of the development witnessed in the Western Province. The contribution of Sabaragamuwa and the Eastern Province is 6 per cent each.
The Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016 shows the disparities in mean household income. For example, it varies from Rs. 32, 631 in the Eastern Province to Rs. 57,514 in the Western Province.
The same survey revealed that the mean household per capita income ranges from Rs. 11,259 in the Eastern Province to Rs. 21,665 in the Western Province, the latter being almost double the former.
It would have been much better and better appreciated by peasants in Polonnaruwa and elsewhere if the Government - instead of the 180 development projects - increased the guaranteed purchase price of paddy by a Rupee or two, a measure justified by the high depreciation of the Rupee. Keeping the sale price of bulk rice unaltered, it could also compensate mill owners and traders by giving fuel at subsidized rates for the transport of paddy/rice so that market prices do not rise. What is missing is a people-friendly approach.
The Government seems to rely on several easy paths to offset its financial difficulties such as increasing indirect taxation (custom duties, VAT etc), taxing public servants and mandatory price increases. The IMF-blessed crude oil adjustment formula is also applied for the same purpose. Whales and sharks evading taxes enjoy privileges while small and medium tax-payers are allegedly harassed with vengeance.
No genuine effort is made to reduce public expenses that could be easily dispensed with.
For example, the Government spends millions to place full-page advertisements in the print media and costly commercials in the electronic media to disseminate common knowledge that could be dispensed with a press release at no extra cost.
No effort is taken to reduce wastage and corruption in public services or rectify obvious defects and shortcomings. Abhorrent ostentation is rampant in high places. To make matters worse new proposals are sought to increase salaries of legislators.
Manpower issues in agriculture
The only sphere in the national economy which has any hope of early recovery is agriculture. A lot of the peasantry has to be improved and problems of agriculture such as manpower shortage, low productivity, low productivity of land and low technological base have to be addressed soon. For example, one-third of production is wasted or lost in transport.
A significant portion of the agricultural harvest is consumed by animals. Lack of adequate storage facilities is another urgent problem. These issues are never discussed in the Legislature or sufficiently brought up by the mass media and are not the subject matter of urgent development agendas. Building amusement parks reclaiming the sea and providing entertainment to white-skinned visitors take precedence over food security for the frequent natural and population.
Labour shortage threatens all sectors of the economy – agriculture, industry and services. Meanwhile, nearly a million workers have emigrated overseas for employment. Brain drain also continues.
At present, it is imperative that development of human capital, an increase of productivity, enhancement of technology and preventing wasteful expenditure should receive priority attention. In view of frequent natural manmade disasters ensuring food security of the population also becomes a priority.
Economic development must be based on national planning with a holistic approach. It should be conducted within a democratic framework with popular participation.
Wherever possible, masses should be mobilized for economic activities. For example, there are such areas as rainwater harvesting, urban gardening and home gardening that could be developed on such lines.
Planning has become a taboo with the political authorities and certain officials embracing the worn-out neo-liberal credo on the free play of market forces. As long as the objective is to look for successful foreign recipes to make Sri Lanka a second Singapore or China, it would elude us. It is a homemade realistic plan that is realizable. To do so we must give up our servility to international financial agencies whose prescriptions may not always benefit us.
