Lanka can make most from its mineral resources with PPP - Wijesinghe

Sri Lanka has several rich resources but the county is not utilizing them, said Thilan Wijesinghe Chairman and Acting CEO of the newly established Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic Summit 2017 which kicked off yesterday. Wijesinghe said although Sri Lanka has a variety of mineral resources, such as dolomite, feldspar, graphite, limestone, mica, mineral sands (including limonite, rutile, and zirconium), phosphate rock, quartzite the country have not utilized them to their full potential.
“With the resources we have like Phosphate Sri Lanka can be made self sufficient in fertilizer and also export it as well. Similarly value addition could be done for several other mineral resources enabling Sri Lanka to earn high foreign exchange form these exports.”
Wijesinghe said that he will look for Private Public Partnerships that would utilize the full potential from these minerals. He said that PPP’s should also focus on the agriculture sector to see more value addition and have more forex generated from agriculture.
Recalling the past era where he headed both Board of Investments and other government bodies he said that during that time Sri Lana Telecom was privatized which transformed the IT sector of the country. For the first time I initiated the Board of Investment to give Rs. 30 million as seed capital to start the SLITT campus.
He also said that there are several sleeping government institutions that need to be turned around soon and these too would be revived under PPP. He said that PPP model works well and the best example is the SAGT terminal which is now a great success.
