Good governance with a real meaning

The JVP has proposed a 20th Amendment to the constitution which will centre on the abolition of the executive presidency. In effect to remove the residual power assumed by the president after the 19th Amendment. This follows on the crisis in the government that appeared after the fall of the no-confidence motion in parliament against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The background to this was the open manifestation of a power struggle between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe on the basis of different ideologies followed by each of them. This clear difference highlighted the problem of having dual centres of executive power. On the one hand, the president who is directly elected by the people enjoys the position of head of state and head of government. On the other hand, the prime minister who has the support of the substantial majority in parliament is also vested with executive powers.
When President Maithripala Sirisena came out of Mahinda regime, pro-democracy masses believed he came out of communal politics to support non-racist non-communal politics of the UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe. The possibility of conflict between the president and the prime minister increased when President Sirisena assumed the leadership of the SLFP without condemning the politics of Mahinda era. Thus they are from different political ideologies, as at present. The previous occasion such a situation arose was during the period 2001 to 2004 when President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe were compelled to enter into a cohabitation arrangement due to people’s mandates being received by them at two separate elections. However, in the beginning, both of them had somewhat a common position on the Tamil national problem. This changed and Chandrika agreed to a coalition with the JVP that opposed any discussions on power sharing! On that occasion too, the relationship was never smooth and finally conflictual and culminated in the sudden dismissal of the Wickremesinghe government in 2004 by the President. On this occasion, President Sirisena was prevented from sacking Prime Minister Wickremesinghe due to the 19th Amendment which took away this presidential power.
Previous regime
Increasingly many are looking for what’s the worst thing this Government has done? With glittering eyes, one could make a long list and shake it many times, until getting the attention of the fascistic political centre led by Rajapaksa. One could also do a compare-and-contrast exercise with the first three years of the previous regime and play that familiar game of suppressing the good done by the Yahapalanaya, inflating the bad and expect attention of newly promoted great leader Gotabhaya. It would be hard to deny, however, that among the good things this Government has done the best is to turn ‘Good Governance’ into a popular word with a real meaning. People saw with their eyes how fascistic attacks on Muslims were contained and rapidly confidence was build among communities. Muslims were critical at the beginning but supported Ranil Wickremesinghe in that moment of challenge.
In ten years time, ‘how Yahapalanaya became a word in popular culture’ would be an excellent thesis topic for a political science postgraduate in any university. That unwritten thesis is known! The results of the recently concluded local government election proved that unlike in 83, this time, in spite of more organised Maha Sohon activities, Pohottuwa of Mahinda lost the racist credibility. The verdict was clear: ‘not only are you people not serious about coming back, you are also utterly incompetent fascistic jokers’. What happened next was a negative vote of no confidence if ever there was one. The incompetence, nepotism, corruption, abuse of state resources and buttressing of the system of political patronage of Mahinda regime, again became the popular topic and new anti-corruption laws were accepted by popular masses with cheers. This is all too evident. It has come to a point where it is utterly hilarious when diehard racists attack the regime of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Some talk about the dark days of the previous regime, knowing very well that many in this government were part of that regime or that some were part of regimes as bad or worse. However, all those bad things cannot be compared to racist fascistic actions of the Mahinda regime; which were condemned by the entire civilized world.
Peace agreement
It is also natural when some of those who take issue with the way things were before January 2015 were quite supportive of Ranil Wickremesinghe for making a peace agreement with Velupillai Prabhakaran and even wanted to let the latter to rule Tamil homeland in a regional government appointed by the Lankan government. Only an idiot can say that is allowing ‘bunch of terrorists to rule one-third of the island and control two-thirds of the coastline.’
It is certainly not funny when Ranil Wickremesinghe supporters take umbrage at certain ministers supporting the vote of no confidence against the Prime Minister and invoke the notion of collective responsibility. It is serious that is why President Maithripala Sirisena made them resign and avoided further embarrassment.
If the majority party in the parliament has not got an overall majority in the parliament, there is a problem. It is natural to seek a combination with others, who are close in ideology. It is the tradition now for the new party to demand portfolios and this is the reality the Prime Minister has to face. They could put it all down to ‘political culture’, but they would be hard-pressed to deny that it was deliberate, to script a clause into the 19th Amendment to get around the limit to Cabinet size promised in manifesto and preamble in the amendment itself. Pragmatic actions cannot in any way cut across the faith and commitment to good governance.
