GSP+ will up demand for cables - ACL Cables Chairman

An increase in FDI due to GSP+ and the general increase projected for GDP growth by the Government of Sri Lanka would lead to an increase in demand for cables and electrical items in the years to come, ACL Cables Chairman UG Madanayake said in the comapny’s latest annual report.
A continued upward trend in interest rates will have a direct negative impact on consumer spending and construction-related activities. This may also lead to a decline in demand for cables and an increase in competition in the dealer market which caters to house builders, Chairman Madanayake told company shareholders.However according to Madanayake, the pressure on the exchange rate will continue to be a challenge to the company’s cost structures.
“We have been experiencing an increase in wage structures due to increase in demand for labour from the construction and service sectors.
Therefore, it is imperative that we invest in new technologies to improve productivity and efficiency.”
Changing weather patterns would have a negative impact on the investment climate since many more resources would be spent on reconstruction and damage control rather than on new development projects, he said.
“Since 2008, we have not seen an impressive economic growth - either in the Western world or in the Asian countries. This is one reason why our exports have not shown an impressive growth. Therefore, the challenge facing Sri Lankan exporters is to look for niche markets while maximising the benefits of GSP+.”
To cater to the upcoming demand for cables in the years to come, the group has planned to increase production capacity keeping in mind efficiencies, productivity and latest technological developments, ACL cables Managing Director Suren Madanayake said.Moreover, the growth in the local construction sector helped ACL to record an increase in turnover. Increased purchases by government organizations and the private sector contractors and investors boosted company turnover.
Favorable metal prices at the London Metal Exchange (LME) during the first half of the financial year significantly helped ACL to improve its profit margins. “Metal prices have shown an upward trend and we may see volatility of prices in the coming year. This will have a direct impact on our margins. The demand for cables is likely to remain at a satisfactorily level due to positive growth momentum in the construction sector.”
However, this growth momentum can be disturbed by adverse weather conditions which disrupt normal life and economic activities of people.”
He further added that regaining of GSP Plus facility from the European Union may fuel economic activity of the country due to increased Exports and inflow of FDI and will have a very positive impact on the localdemand for Cables.(IH)
