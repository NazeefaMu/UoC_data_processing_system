Resolve against corruption bearing fruit - Ravi

A new political culture should be established and the efforts of the Unity Government is beginning to bear fruit, UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake said.
He said he wholeheartedly agrees with the President’s sentiments expressed during his Independence Day speech that, “the fight against corruption is the self-defence of a nation.
Strengthening the attitude for anti-corruption and implementing it is the self-defence of the nation to ensure its progress.”
MP Karunanayake expressed these views during the parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and the PRECIFAC report in parliament yesterday.
He expressed satisfaction at the implementation of the fundamentals of good governance. “During the past, corruption, wastefulness and brutality were the norms accepted in society.
The reason economic development could not be achieved in the country was due to the petty political agendas of a few. However, we laid the foundation needed in establishing good governance on January 8, 2015. But we must prove our good intentions through our deeds,” he added.
He urged everyone to join in establishing true good governance in the country sans petty political desires.
Karunanayake said today, those who don’t even know how many zeros are there in a million or billion are talking about the losses in the bond issue. The bond issue is not just an issue of the previous government or this one, but corruption has become a culture in this country, he said adding that it is regretful that this issue is hampering the progress of the country and stagnating it. Instead he said what we need today is a constructive political approach.
He went on to explain how the Bond issue incident had affected him as a parliamentarian and an individual. “During the recent past there were elements who were trying to portray me as the biggest sinner and culprit. This sinister move is still taking place. But no matter how much mudslinging or humiliation I am made to undergo, I can still be content with the fact that the efforts we made to establish good governance in this country is bearing fruit,” he said.
