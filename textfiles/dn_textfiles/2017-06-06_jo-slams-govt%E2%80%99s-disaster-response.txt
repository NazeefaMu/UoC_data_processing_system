JO slams govt’s disaster response

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday slammed the government’s relief efforts in the disaster-hit areas noting that it lacked direction and transparency.
Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the JO will launch a street campaign demanding the government to provide adequate relief to the affected without any discrimination.
“Although the government promised a series of measures, including building the damaged houses at a cost of Rs.2.5 million, compensation for businesses and damaged goods, they have failed even to pay the Rs.10,000 monthly allowance promised to the victims,” Nanayakkara said.
Meanwhile, Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunewardene said lack of preparations by the government to face natural disasters aggravated the suffering of the people.
He said if a mechanism had been in place in disaster preparedness, a large number of lives could have been saved.
Gunewardene said flood and landslide mitigation plans and a mechanism to face natural disasters will be implemented under a future JO government.
