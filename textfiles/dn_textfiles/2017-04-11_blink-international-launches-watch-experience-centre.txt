Blink International launches watch experience centre

The current duty structure which offers almost zero duty for import of watches and electronic items are very encouraging and due to this some products are even cheap are than UK and other countries, Blink International Director Muhammed Mansoor said .
He said that this move had helped Sri Lanka to be projected as a country to buy high quality luxury items at a cheaper price for tourists helping to bring in more foreign exchange to Sri Lanka.
“Sri Lanka is developing at an increasingly rapid pace, and with this development, we see young people become more discerning in their taste, but still demanding performance and durability out of their watches. Today, Blink maintains a portfolio of some of the most sought after watch brands in Sri Lanka. We are very optimistic that we will be able to carry our momentum into 2017, and substantially expand our distribution island-wide,” he Blink said at the launch of a dedicated multi-brand watch Experience and Service Centre at the Iceland Building in Colombo 03.
The center showcases a variety of versatile and stylish timepieces from internationally renowned brands such as Casio, Puma, Esprit, Elle, Cross, and Sevenfriday, offering visitors to the centre a first-hand feel for Blink’s selection of high quality watches designed to offer affordable luxury to fit any budget.
Included in Blink’s ample collection of watches are all time favourites such as the stylishly durable G-Shock Range, from the entry-level G-Shock Classic, to the brand’s Premium MTG watch, which is being showcased in Sri Lanka for the very first time.
Established in 2015, Blink International is the sole authorized distributor and service agent for the brands displayed at its Customer Experience Centre. The service centre is the only facility in Sri Lanka with access to genuine spare parts sourced directly from Casio Computers, Japan.
Speaking at the opening, Group CEO Faris Fausz outlined how Blink International was an important strategic move for the group in order to bring affordable, original timepieces to Sri Lanka backed by the highest warranty and service standards.
In addition to carrying the brands’ complete offering, the experience and service center will operate as the service outlet for all repairs and services for all watches included within the Blink International portfolio of brands.
Notably all watches imported by Blink come with an official warranty and are guaranteed to be provided at the best possible rates. The authenticity of Casio watches purchased can be ascertained via the Casio website.
