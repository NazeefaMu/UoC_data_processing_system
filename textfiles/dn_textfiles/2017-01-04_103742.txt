Government trying to scuttle free education: CTSU General Secretary

Ceylon Teachers’ Services Union (CTSU) General Secretary Mahinda Jayasinghe said yesterday this government is trying to scuttle the free education in a very subtle manner.
These attempts should be defeated to save free education. We are carrying out awareness programme to apprise the people in this threat to free education.
The government tries to privatise education system. Some Education ministry officials said schools will be turned into profit making centers. This is the first step of ending free education.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday , he said profit making means a business and this is how the government that promised to uplift free education is working.
We will protest on the streets with the people to defeat the conspiracy of destroying the free education,” he said. As the first step to this, We will distribute leaflets among the parents to create awareness on this issue. We will also collect signatures from parents for a petition against the destruction of free education.
The government has placed an additional burden on the parents by collecting money for the various school projects.
Already at the beginning of this year, money is being collected from parents for painting schools.
Although the government initially promised to reserve 6 percent of the GDP for education, this has actually come down to two percent this year from 2.7 percent last year.
Commenting on the issue that around 300 children have been admitted to grade one classes in the Western Province schools by the Chief Minister, he said grade one classes in 26 schools have newly been started last year for admitting politicians’ children and their cronies’.
We would like to ask the government the way these children were admitted to schools.
