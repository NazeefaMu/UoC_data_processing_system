Hong Kong, criminal city that knows no night

Hong Kong—the “Fragrant Harbor” or the “Barren Rock”? The Cantonese named it the former; the early British colonialists in the mid-19th century the latter. Captured by the Royal Navy after the First Opium War (1839-1842) and politically cauterized from the mainland of China by a most unequal treaty signed in the face of British gunboats.
Hong Kong Island was to be England’s in perpetuity, with Kowloon and the New Territories (that are essentially part of the Chinese mainland) leased for 99 years. In 1997 those 99 years came to an end, Britain surrendered the territory in the “Handover,” and Hong Kong reverted to Chinese control becoming a “Special Administrative Region” of the People’s Republic.
Wealthiest tycoons
One of the most densely populated cities in the world, stunning banks of high rises surround a harbor above which rises the Peak, once home to only the most senior of Colonial officials and now only the wealthiest of tycoons. Across Victoria Harbor, Kowloon is raucous, always busy and thanks to the city’s obsession with neon, never dark as you pass through Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok and Kowloon’s other districts. Away from the hustle and bustle the islands of Lantau, Lamma and dozens of smaller oases have beaches and coves to explore, while the more sparsely populated New Territories extend to the border with mainland China at Lo Wu.
The quintessential Hong Kong of densely packed streets and the rhythmic cacophony of Cantonese contrasting with verdant islands and unexpected countryside is perhaps best captured in John le Carré’s sole Asian outing, The Honourable Schoolboy (1977). The Hong Kong weather “burns hot and clear and breathless” as Jerry Westerby wanders from the legendary Foreign Correspondents’ Club to his safe house on Cloudview Road in down-at-heel North Point. Le Carré, as ever, hits all the marks—the FCC, the American Club, snobby cocktail parties, the “Peak Mafia” of HSBC bankers, the Governor, senior military commanders, ruddy-faced club stewards and the odd resident OBEs and CBEs of the British community trading on past glories.
Then down to noodles in the backstreets of Kennedy Town and compromising indiscretions in the Girly Bars of Wan Chai. The novel still stands as perhaps the most intricate description of post-war colonial Hong Kong in literature.
Doorstoppers
Others have delved into Hong Kong’s past and there are some old time bestselling blockbusters, notably James Clavell’s twin doorstoppers Tai-Pan (1966), where Hong Kong’s foundation as a colony is a story with plenty of crimes, and later Cold War thriller Noble House (1981). Perhaps most people thinking of Hong Kong-set novels capturing the 1950s and 1960s will recall Han Suyin’s Love is a Many-Splendored Thing (1952) and Richard Mason’s The World of Suzie Wong (1957).
However, none of these, strictly speaking, are crime novels—though you might count stealing other people’s territory, their secrets, creating an opium-selling empire, being forced to be an illegal immigrant and working as a prostitute as minor infractions of the law! But we’ll stick with genre and go with the rather lesser known A Coffin From Hong Kong (1962) by James Hadley Chase.
When a Hong Kong girl turns up dead in Nelson Ryan’s office, the Pasadena P.I. is in the frame and gets himself on a plane to Hong Kong to prove his innocence.
