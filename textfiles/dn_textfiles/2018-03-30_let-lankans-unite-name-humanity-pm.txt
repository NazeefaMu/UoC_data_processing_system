Good Friday message:
Let Lankans unite in the name of humanity: PM

On Good Friday, Christians respectfully commemorate the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who died for the sake of all mankind, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his message marking Good Friday and Easter.
The message states: “From the early days of Christianity, Good Friday was observed as a day of sorrow, penance, and fasting to remember the suffering and death of Jesus. On Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the Resurrection, when Jesus rose from his tomb.
“Jesus sacrificed himself for the good of humanity and bore his pain in great silence. His life shows that the whole world could be brought together through love, unity and equality.
“Let Sri Lankans be united in the name of humanity and the Holy Spirit on earth as shown by Jesus Christ. “May all Christians around the world have a Holy Friday and a Blessed Easter in His love and mercy!”
