Marketing high  value compounds of   tea polyphenols

The consumer habits have changed all over the world, with the evolving generations such as Gen Y and the millennials. This has affected many beverages already. The usual question asked by the Gen Y is ‘why’ he/she should drink a particular beverage. This generation is identified as a smarter generation and we have to provide a lot of valuable and useful information to these emerging consumer groups such as the details of the ingredients, packaging, if they were produced without ‘guilt”, their impact on the health and price. The noun guilt is used to mean if the methods used to manufacture the beverage concerned is involved in destroying the environment and exploiting the labor engaged in production. Lot more beverage companies use multiple methods to convince the consumer on the brand and product attributes in addition to the commitment of the manufacturers on sustainability.
Lack of thoughts in this direction could be a single most reason for the slow growth in value addition to tea in Sri Lanka. As a result of this failure, poor prices realized has affected attracting high caliber personal that can sustain the industry on one hand and deprived the industry of getting required agricultural inputs on the other hand. This process makes a complete vicious cycle for which the industry has now become immune. Instead of correcting the causal factors for low ‘Net Sale Averages’ for ages, the general perception of the management is that the cost of production of tea is somewhat beyond the control of the management due to certain level of political interference, climate change, degraded soils highly paid workforce etc. This psychology is usually known as the blame culture which is an outcome of poor quality of the leadership.
If any tea estate can increase the NSA beyond Rs. 2000, then none of the said issues will remain to exist. We need a true paradigm shift. Neither the World Bank nor any other could offer help to us for the simple fact that no one could advise the Planter managing an industry older than a century, unless we ourselves challenge the issue and solve it by ourselves. If undertaken wisely, this will give the industry the opportunity of moving from their current stand of being price takers to price makers.
The market research indicates that there is a growing demand and higher price for Polyphenols that can be extracted from tea. Emerging new trends of tea marketing are based on its health benefits. The focus is on the polyphenols in tea. “Polyphenols, the major chemical compounds present in tea flush constitute 25-30% of dry weight. Among the polyphenols, catechins (flavan?3?ols) have the least complex chemical structures and function as precursors in the formation of complex polyphenols. Catechins in tea have been reported to be the major source of antioxidants, which have a variety of physiological functions of the body. The main tea catechins recorded are (?) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), (?) epicatechin gallate (ECg), (?) epigallocatechin (EGC), (+) gallocatechol (GC), (?) epicatechin (EC) and (+) catechin (C). EGCg is the most abundant catechin in tea and has proven anti-cancer activity, anti-obesity action, anti-diabetic activity, prevention of cardio vascular diseases, combined effect with theanine and vitamin C to enhance immunity against viral infection and effects on aging and dementia.
Theobromine and caffeine are two major alkaloids present in tea. Caffeine, the most important alkaloid in tea, contributes to the bitterness of the brew through complexation with the flavanols, and stimulate the nervous system of human beings, anti-obesity action, cardiac stimulant and diuretic, protection against Parkinson’s disease, reduce brain damage and Improve neurotransmission efficiency of neurons. For black teas, caffeine content is in the range of 3.4-3.9% which is responsible for briskness of tea.
The major flavonols present in tea leaves make up 2-3% of the water-soluble solids in tea and Flavonols Glycosides in tea leaves have been quantified as aglycones, Quercetin, Myricetin and Kaempferol. Flavonols play an important role in reducing the risk of cardio vascular disease, cancer, neurodegradative and other degenerative diseases.
Tea contains large number of free amino acids and the theanine (5-N-ethylglutamine) is the most abundant amino acid in tea and constitutes usually between 0.2 and 2% of the dry weight accounting for up to 50% of all free amino acids in tea samples. Theanine has a calming effect on the mental state by lowering blood pressure and is known to be a neurotransmitter in the brain and Imparts mind relaxation-inducing effect in humans. It improves memory and learning ability, suppress cell death, suppress oxidative damage, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral depression under psychosocial stress.

The global polyphenol market in 2015 has exceeded 700 million USD.(grand view research, San Francisco, 2015) The prediction is to exceed 900 million USD in 2024. So it is obvious that we need a new product sold on the value of polyphenols in tea. The presence of higher level of polyphenols is in the correctly matured shoot. According to TRI ( SL ), some tea cultivars in Sri Lanka are more suitable to manufacture green tea using either the Chinese or Japanese methods. Green tea appears to have more polyphenols than black tea. The TRI also seem to be engaged in a process of developing a method to determine polyphenol levels in green leaf using ‘Near Infrared Technology’. This can lead to new pricing mechanism for green leaf too.
Polyphenol based product development will lead to changes in the manner in which we grow tea as a commercial crop. Similarly, there is a potential to extract other compounds such as theanine (amino acid), protein flavors and aroma from green leaves of tea., Further, the Spinning Cone Column technology and Supercritical Fluid Extraction technology could be used to extract these compounds and produce teas with improved flavors, medicinal and functional properties. Also, these purified compounds could be used in developing high value pharmaceuticals and cosmetics in the future.
SL being a small economy, it will be a waste of time to think of doing everything alone without partnering with global giants especially in the areas of joint research, distribution and marketing. Therefore it is advisable to consider linking with distribution giants such as Ali-Baba hailing from a similar culture.
Like in any other product the polyphenols alone will not get the producers to achieve higher NSA, but with complete downstream value addition. The current situation of tea could well be compared with the virgin coconut oil (VCO) market. The producers were just producing VCO with lesser focus on Medium Chain Tri-glycerides which is a derivative of VCO. As a result of not focusing on downstream value addition, the country lost a great deal of wealth that was hidden in MCT oil based products. This situation has got aggravated further because we don’t have even established standards for these products. Such inaction make us paralyzed when faced with fierce competition globally. The same experiences can be avoided in tea if proactive decisions are initiated in advance with the change of the products.
Investing in research and development in a small economy like Sri Lanka may have limitations due to economies of scale. However such interventions do remain as priority needs in future as well. The research institutes have undertaken adequate research on health benefits of tea. They also have researched and come out with diversified products of tea. Tea is known for its medicinal properties responsible for reducing cholesterol, reducing blood clotting, improve immunity, reduce blood glucose levels, improves intestinal bacteria and many more. Certain chemicals found in tea are now used in the cosmetics industry which has a huge business potential. These cosmetic products are already sold in Sri Lanka. The irony of this issue is that these products are manufactured in countries who don’t manufacture even an ounce of tea. So the need to leave the commodity market is a conscious decision we have to make.
Therefore as growers and producers we have a great opportunity to exploit this situation and develop new products catering to the health conscious consumers. Whilst we are suggesting equipping all crop research institutes with an all-inclusive marketing department and obtaining services of food technologists that will be of great advantage to the industry. All scientists in crop research institutions must be compensated adequately and trained in the areas of specialties keeping in line with the global standards. If the NSA can be raised beyond Rs.2000 per Kg, and help the factory owners to develop a high value basket of products, then we will not have to stick to outdated production processes and contribute to massive financial loses. Some say that we use more energy to manufacture a Kg of black tea that making a Kg of iron out of ore. Therefore quick action to transform the suggestion made above into a reality cannot be delayed any more.
The agronomy of Tea.
The concept of (QQCD) (Quality, Quantity, Cost and Delivery) in improving processes can be used to improve agronomical practices If we are deciding in favor of polyphenol based products. The first Q denotes the quality of tea means the level of polyphenols in shoots of correct maturity. This will lead to an opportunity to obtain a better price for the green leaf based on the amount of polyphenols available in leaf. I understand that the TRI is in the process of developing a quick method to ascertain the useful properties in green leaf supplied by the small holders. This will lead to whole heap of changes in the process such as timing and type of organic and inorganic fertilizers used, maintaining of nutrient rich soils, ensuring the growth of soil microbes and zero usage of harmful chemicals. In brief, producing tea without guilt.
Quantity will be referred to the bush density per unit area of land and yield per bush. Cost aspect will be the cost of a shoot/ Kg (green leaf) at correct maturity. Speed of delivery should be addressed to achieve the results within a reasonable time frame. These factors are helpful in achieving both effectiveness and efficiency. This will also give the Planters an opportunity to manage tea gardens more strategically. The emerging volumes of big data and near time information will prompt engaging IT/ICT professionals to make use of standard such as Agriculture 4.0. We can learn a lot from countries such as Israel in this direction.
To stimulate the process of thinking of the experienced Tea Planters the following key agricultural aspects are proposed to be studied deeply. (Deeper analysis of the factors will pave the way for a detailed Agri manual for tea in RPC management) The following framework is only to facilitate the thinking process or a session on brain storming. We do agree that the environmental factors and the factors affecting under HRM practices are not discussed adequately in this article.
There is a saying that the ‘Right People Drive businesses’. Absenteeism of harvesters is a big draw back in the industry. Attraction and retention has become an impossible task. We have failed (in most instances) to address these issues in a smarter manner although some other countries have overcome these issues successfully.
The job redesign advocated in the knowledge domain of HRM is one of such options. We have failed to understand that the period of slavery is now over. Employees are looking for meaningful and smart work. The want to be heard, consulted, appreciated with regular feedbacks. When compared with real life experiences on a tea estate, it is not difficult to understand how much behind we are to these naked realities of work life.
In addition to attributes affecting job redesign, having to work all seven days of the week is another aspect contributing to absenteeism. Quite apart from physical fatigue due to continuous work in relation to some others who are entitled to paid leave during a work week, the monotonous nature of the work is also a demotivating factor pressing them to be absent.
Therefore it is appropriate to look at different work systems. In the event if a harvester can bring the total quantity of green leaf, estimated for the month even on the 25th day, he or she must be given paid leave for the rest of the days of that month. This is because the harvester has already achieved the target for the month. Depending on the quality of supervision of work, this system will lead to developing better skilled in plucking and ensure guaranteed income as well. However, if the workman is desirous of working even during paid leave then the estates will not be short of work.
The industry will wither away without employees which have already begun to happen. Doing same thing we did for generations over and over again and expecting miracles to happen is simply called as insanity. We need different types of teas to continue with the mystic nature of tea, but more importantly we have a choice to decide survival & growth or else fast track the journey to the graveyard. In the event the choice is the former, then it is time to use options such as BPR or business process re-engineering etc. The total solution is a combination of factors such as manufacturing of powerful product basket, digital marketing, linking up with global giants, sticking to BMPs of agronomy and investing on a near time monitoring / implementation system. In order to achieve all above the employees have to be managed professionally using HRM concepts.
