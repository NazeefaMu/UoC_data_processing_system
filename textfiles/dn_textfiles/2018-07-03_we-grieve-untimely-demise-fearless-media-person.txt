Chamara Lakshan Kumara
We grieve untimely demise of fearless media person

The untimely demise of youthful media person Chamara Lakshan who succeeded in opening a new vista of a long journey in the Sri Lankan media field within a short period, will bring grief to the heart of every person in this country who had cherished hopes for the future.
Mangala Samaraweera, Finance and Media Minister  
The manner in which this youth, with determination, used his service stations as a school to fashion and polish his vision and virtues of life after joining the Lakbima, Irudina and Rivira newspapers is evident from his use of the media in later life.
Chamara Lakshan who was among the handful of journalists who bravely came forward to oppose the dreadful administration of the misguided pre-2015 regime used his pen fearlessly to achieve his objective with a vision.
He acted with great responsibility not only to bring about the yahapalana government, but also to plot it on the right direction.
Lakshan, who stepped into the leading newspaper publishing house (Pattara Mahagedara) as a Senior Associate Editor of the Dinamina worked with great effort and dedication to turn a new leaf in the path of Lake House within a short period.
The Resa newspaper was launched purely due to the results of his dedicated efforts. It is no secret that the Resa newspaper edited by Lakshan earned popularity among the country’s youth within a short time.
Chamara Lakshan, who became the youngest editor of the Silumina newspaper, was able to add his name to the list of senior media greats of the past due to his dedicated effort.
The manner in which he tried to add novelty to the Silumina newspaper without harming its endemic social, cultural and political values and layout is most praiseworthy.
The sudden demise of Chamara Lakshan who was a political commentator and a veteran media person, is a great loss not only to the media sector but the entire nation.
I wish to convey my condolences to the bereaved family of this energetic and fearless media person and his relatives and friends grieving over his untimely demise.
I salute you Chamara, who made ‘a journey of several thousand miles start with just a single step’, his watchword.
