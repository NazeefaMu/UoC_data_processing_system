Shafraz and Sam joint winners of Mahindra-MRA Rally

Leading rally drivers Shafraz Junaid and Sam Chandrasoma became joint winners of the Mahindra-MRA Rally 2015 in a unique manner with six debit points each when the motor rally in Colombo.
Shafraz with his co-driver Akhry Ameer (Nissan Datsun cab) and Sam with his co-driver Sarindu Gamage (Nissan Patrol) drove to an identical style achieving the same debits at the same checkpoints in both the stages. The performance was unique as the two competitors beat all the rally rules for resolution of a tie leaving the organizers no option but to announce them as joint winners.
The rally saw 15 competitors driving approximately 400km from Colombo to Galle and back through a tarmac and gravel terrain which was made challenging with the onset of rains through the night. The TSD (Time, Speed and Duration) or regularity rally requires the competitors to traverse a specified and grueling route sticking to a specific timing and avoid accruing debit points.
Nalaka Gunawardena, Javidh Wahab and rally veteran Cassim Wahab topped the rally prepared class and the overall championships with third to fifth places respectively.
Kasun Perera co-driven by Ramesh Ubhayaratna won the non-rally prepared class with a total 54 debit points. Rain posed a challenge to the drivers from the starting line itself with the organizers having to end the first stage about 30 km from the scheduled finish in Galle owing to some of the roads being non-motorable. However, in the second stage from Galle to Colombo the drivers were pleased to experience some water crossings with culverts and causeways reaching their brim.
The Mahindra-MRA Rally 2015 was organized by the Motor Racing Association (MRA) supported by Ideal Motors agents for Mahindra vehicles.
