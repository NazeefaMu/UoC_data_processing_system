Massive demand for Ron Kaufman live in SL

The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing is urging corporates and marketers to take speedy action in availing themselves of the foremost global service expertise that will be available to Sri Lanka when Ron Kaufman conducts a couple of programmes on July 18 and 19.
With very limited seats available given the massive demand from the private sector for the CEO Breakfast Forum and the Knowledge Forum, missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to interact and engage with the world’s No 1 Service Guru would be a significant fall out for companies forging their way through to success in a service oriented culture.
Over 700 tickets have been sold for the Knowledge Forum and 200 for the CEO Forum making it vital that Sri Lanka takes advantage of Ron Kaufman’s reputation and stature as a transformer and revolutionary in service excellence.
With SLIM always in the forefront in nurturing, developing and uplifting the marketing fraternity and thereby the business milieu overall by infusing the latest in best practices, learnings and innovations via practical perspectives, Vice President of SLIM Pradeep Edward reiterates that the demand for the Ron Kaufman events have been unprecedented. “With this kind of demand, I believe we will see a palpable change in Sri Lanka’s service leadership culture and I urge those corporates who haven’t yet made up their minds, to do so immediately. This is an opportunity, which cannot be passed up as Ron has a proven track record of being the best in service culture. He brings with him a wealth of knowledge of the latest international services best practices highly relevant to the dynamic globalised economy that would give Sri Lanka the competitive edge in industry and business.”
This has seen companies like EFL (Expolanka Freight) and Classic Travel confirm separate sessions with Ron Kaufman for which the Managing Director of both corporate entities, Saif Yusoof is grateful to SLIM for. “We are looking forward to a cutting edge training session, with insights into new tricks of the trade. For us, the idea of a learning culture is deeply imbedded in everything that we do. In a way, that’s what defines us, and our love for the fast paced and ever evolving world of supply chain, logistics and travel. We look to inspire and get inspired by the things that make an impact around us. In this regard, Kaufman’s unparalleled knowledge on gaining sustainable competitive advantage through service, is certainly ought to be optimised.”
Describing Ron Kaufman Live in Sri Lanka as a ground-breaking event that will surely be a life-changing experience for corporates and business professionals alike, Project Chairman Ranga Perera goes a step further and urges entrepreneurs, the public sector and even university academics to take advantage of the knowledge pool Kaufman brings to Sri Lanka.
“Kaufman’s expertise is so universally applicable that it shouldn’t be confined to just the private sector, as I believe a service culture should be instilled in everyone. In any vocation or career we undertake, service remains key to success and sustainability. This therefore enables everyone to inculcate that service leadership culture for which Ron Kauffman has gained a worldwide reputation for.”
