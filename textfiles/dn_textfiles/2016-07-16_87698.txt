PCB buys bulletproof buses

The PCB has bought four bulletproof buses as part of its effort to provide the “best possible arrangements” for players visiting the country. The board hopes the additional security measure, first proposed during the chairmanship of Zaka Ashraf in 2012 and sanctioned last year, will help in convincing overseas players and teams to tour Pakistan.
Barring Zimbabwe’s limited-overs tour in May 2015, Pakistan have not hosted an international game since the attacks on a touring Sri Lankan team in Lahore in March 2009.
In that incident, gunmen shot at the team bus near Gaddafi Stadium, injuring five cricketers and killing six security personnel and two civilians.
Pakistan have since struggled to convince teams to tour the country and have instead had to play their “home” matches at neutral venues, mostly in the UAE, which has been their base for the past several years.
“We have bought these four Coaster buses as part of our efforts to revive international cricket in the country,” a PCB spokesman said.
“There will be high expectations from teams willing to visit Pakistan and we want to ensure that we provide them with the best possible arrangements. Having these bulletproof vehicles would play a major part in convincing teams [about security arrangements].”
The PCB relies heavily on the government for security arrangements for visiting teams. The bulletproof buses will be an additional safety measure for teams travelling within the city. The buses were initially sanctioned at a PCB governing board meeting in 2012, but with the change of leadership in the PCB the purchase was delayed. The matter was taken up again by PCB executive committee head Najam Sethi last year.
“We are actually planning to host the PSL final in Lahore, but this requires us to convince overseas players to come,” the spokesman said. “We have to have discussions with the players about their safety and security and I think this new addition in our security facilities will definitely give us an edge. Our ultimate goal is to revive international cricket, and we are doing our best to make sure we can.”
The PCB has suffered financially from having to arrange matches in the UAE and from missing out on bilateral series against India. This prompted PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan to suggest that the Pakistan board should receive a “higher percentage of the income” from matches against India at ICC events.
