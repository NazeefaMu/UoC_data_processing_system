Disciplinary action against Vision 2020 Programme Coordinator

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has informed the Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama to take disciplinary action against the Coordinating Officer of the Vision 2020 Programme for providing information to media, according to the Health Ministry Media Secretary.
The Minister had stated that the doctor who coordinated the Vision 2020 programme was not an ophthalmologist but an ordinary doctor.
Senaratne pointed out that some officials think that the positions received by them are their own private properties and do not like to let go. The Vision 2020 Programme has not abolished and the programme is continuing by the College of Ophthalmologists in Sri Lanka.
Minister Senaratne also stated that in the past surgeries carried out by the Vision 2020 programme were not done by its officials but were done by qualified Ophthalmologists.
However, later the Health Ministry had
taken over the programme and did not offer patient high quality eye lenses. Instead it provided low cost lenses, he said.
