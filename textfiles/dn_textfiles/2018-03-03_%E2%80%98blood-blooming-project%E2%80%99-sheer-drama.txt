‘Blood blooming project,’ a sheer drama

This is the story of Pohottuwa, the ‘bud’. A bud should become something different and complete; because it is the party symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), ‘the bud will bloom,’ they said with much conviction and expectation of the second coming of Sinhala only of Bandaranaike. Other parties predicted it will wither and negate the expectations. Like a giant in Maha Wanse, Sambanthan exposed the reality.
Speaking in Parliament, the veteran Tamil liberation fighter attacked former fascistic President Mahinda Rajapaksa for creating condition for Elam. He made a sharp point, the veteran democrat, Sambanthan, said that Mahinda, as President had talked of ‘maximum possible devolution,’ when he inaugurated the All Party Representative Committee (APRC). Latter mentioned, also the ‘Experts Committee’ appointed by him and led by Prof Tissa Vitharana. Mahinda noted that the report of this committee recommended reforms that went beyond the 13th Amendment; thus creating hope of ‘Thirteen Plus.’
Interestingly, Sambanthan mentioned that all the members of the Joint Opposition had unanimously supported the Resolution to turn Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly and had participated in the proceedings of the Steering Committee appointed thereof. Neither Mahinda nor anyone else talked of Eelam, either in the Constituent Assembly or in the Steering Committee, he firmly pointed out.
All this reality he weighed against fascistic jabbering of Mahinda, made during the course of the election campaign. Mahinda screamed idiotically that Tamil Eelam could bloom after the election if the people choose poorly. It was not only Mahinda who said it. Many of the key spokespersons for the SLPP issued that warning. It is obvious, appointing a committee to come up with solutions to Tamil national problem, does not mean that one is preparing for a separate Eelam. Voting for turning Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly does not mean that Mahinda or anyone else was voting for Sampanthan’s outcome preference. There was more than one report, which came out of the deliberations of the Steering Committee. Nothing finalized has come out of it.
Political solution
Actually contradiction came from the ‘thirteen plus’ statement and from the ‘maximum devolution’ pledge made by Mahinda to hoodwink Tamils and international democratic community. Only he would know really why he made such ambiguous statements. He did make them, and that’s what counts. And that’s why Sambanthan is absolutely right in chastising Mahinda for what is clearly double-talk and therefore irresponsible. Such irresponsibility on the part of ‘The lotus bud’ as Sambanthan puts it, results in ‘Eelam blooming,’ is a clever prediction. The notion is interesting. What it implies is that there is a germ of Eelam bud already in the lotus bud.
Sambanthan describes their campaign, ‘I want to put on record that my Party at this Election, in our manifesto, talked of a political solution within the framework of an undivided, indivisible, single country. There was no campaign carried on, anyway, in the North and East which talked of division of the country. We only talked of a solution that is acceptable to our people that are reasonable substantial power-sharing within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible single country.’
While Tamil leaders campaign for a single country lotus bud bearers shout “The Eelam bud that is. What is power-sharing if not Federalism? What is Power-sharing without talking of history, demography and geography if not devious machinations for land theft based on a myth-model? What is ‘substantial’ in this context if it is not a legitimating of a lie in its extrapolation?”
Sambanthan however, introduced the real deal. He’s not playing politics-of-the-moment. He is not indulging in conveniences. He is speaking the truth of the Eelam bud. Mahinda uses phrases such as ‘substantial devolution’ or ‘maximum devolution’ in a context where Tamils have identified the territory of ‘historical homeland’ on lines drawn by the history of Jaffna kingdom and bitter struggles since 13th century. Such words are tossed around in ridicule, in a context of a painfully identified legitimate history; a refusal to peruse real evidence to back claims, blood spilled, tears shed. In addition fascistic mockery says:
“Let’s get this straight. Sambanthan and the Eelamists, now in defence mode and in reduced circumstances following the military rout of the LTTE, are indulging in federalist talk. Federalism is about territories with distinct peoples voluntarily coming together. It naturally implies that having come together, any of the entities thus ‘united’ (another problematic word used by Sambanthan and his ilk) can voluntarily choose to go it alone. This is bud. This is the rub. This is the bud that the federalists in the business of constitutional reform are carefully and surreptitiously watering and fertilizing. Rajapaksa, because of his careless of ill-advised uttering, has no moral authority to cry foul over Eelam-budding, but that does not mean people need not be concerned about it. After all, when G.G. Ponnambalam was spouting communalism, few would have thought that the 50-50 bud would bloom into a rabid terrorist outfit like the LTTE which would reduce people like Sambanthan into choirboys and cheerleaders.
Rajapaksa camp
“The Rajapaksa camp, then, does not have the moral right to raise fears over an Eelam-bud, but it does not follow that the fears expressed are without basis.
He cannot talk, but others can and must. They must because Sambanthan has clearly reiterated that there is an Eelam bud and because the entire constitutional reform project is run by lackeys of the bud-blooming project. Most importantly, they have demonstrated their utter lack of integrity in ‘processes’ by refusing to enumerate grievances and by refusing to consider undeniable historical, demographic and geographical factors. It has been reduced to a process of predetermining telos and constructing conditions and modeling myths to obtain that end point.
As long as the Eelam-bud exists, then it will be named as such, Sambanthan should understand this. Just because someone doesn’t have a moral right to call it such does not mean it does not exist. Sure, various people can nurture it, but the principal gardener is the federalist. Sambanthan, if you want to put a name to it.’’
Fascistic clowns in the robes of pundits will inevitably end up in the dustbin of history.
