Cargills bank announces 10 year  fixed rate for home loans

In response to a prevailing demand of long term consumer borrowings, Cargills Bank has newly introduced a 10-Year Fixed Interest Rate option for its housing loan product.
This product was offered with the intension of providing customers the convenience of having an option to fix their monthly instalment throughout the borrowing period. This also avoids any future impact to monthly commitments that may occur due to interest volatility in the market. In addition to offering an affordable interest rate with a 10 year fixed option, the loans are granted for a period up to 20 years and up to 80% of BOQ or property value.

Cargills Bank Deputy General Manager – Retail Banking Mr.Darshana Ratnayake said, “our aim is to provide affordable, tailor-made and hassle free financial solutions to our customers across all income groups. Building a house or buying a property marks a key milestone in life, thus housing loans have become an essential product in the banking industry. It is vital that we direct our customers towards right financial solutions with affordable fees and charges that would support their investment decisions. We are steered by a dedicated sales force equipped with skills and expertise to provide our customers an unmatchable service from the initial application filling to disbursement of the loan. We have also streamlined our internal processes to create a hassle free environment to our customers.”
“The bank saw an opportunity for long term asset growth with the prevailing economic conditions. Our strong capital structure and funding we receive through Fixed Term Deposits have enabled us to competitively grant this fixed rate option. Our rationale is to initiate products and services that add true value to our customers, whereby reinforcing the ethos of banking on the human spirit,” he further added.
In addition to the aforesaid benefits, the bank also provides a grace period at the start of the facility enabling customers to repay a lower instalment initially and gradually fixing it to their income levels as income grows in time.
