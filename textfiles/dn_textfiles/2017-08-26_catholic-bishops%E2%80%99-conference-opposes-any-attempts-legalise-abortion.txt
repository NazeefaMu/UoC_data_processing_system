Catholic Bishops’ Conference opposes any attempts to legalise abortion

While vehemently condemning the government’s efforts to legalise abortions on two counts, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Sri Lanka (CBCSL)yesterday stressed that they do not condone any form of abortion in the country. The Catholic Bishop Conference in a released issued under the signatures of its President Rt. Rev. Dr. J. Winston S. Fernando and Secretary General Rt. Rev. Dr. Valance Mendis said that they oppose the governemnt’s decision to legalise two forms of abortion in the country.
“No one has the right to tamper with human life even by way of an exception,” a Catholic Bishops’ Conference said.
The statement: the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Sri Lanka, gathered in its plenary meeting is deeply concerned at the news that a Cabinet decision has been made to legalize abortion on two counts and is to be presented to the Parliament
The Conference strongly condemns any effort to legalise abortion in any form whatsoever. The Catholic Church believes that life begins at the very moment of conception and is sacred and no one has the right to tamper with human life even by way of an exception.
“Jutice should not be compromised on any account especially when it is the question of safeguarding the right to life of the unborn child. One cannot safeguard one’s rights at the expense of violating another’s right”, the message said Earlier in the week, the Cabinet approved papers to be sent to Parliament which would legalise abortion if a woman was raped, and if a foetus was diagnosed with Lethal Congenital Malformation.
“Once the law is enacted, the mothers will receive the opportunity to decide whether to abort the fetus or go ahead with the pregnancy,” Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said at the time.
The Catholic Church opposes abortion worldwide.
