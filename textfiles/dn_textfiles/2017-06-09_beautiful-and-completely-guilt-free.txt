Beautiful, and completely guilt-free!

Everyone, at least once in a while, eats a depressing homemade salad, whether at their desk in work or from the confines of their own kitchen.
But a new cafe, in Naygowa, Japan, hopes that people would find a plate filled with wilting rocket and tomato slightly less depressing if it looked like a beautiful cake.
Food stylist Misuki Moriyasu first came up with the idea for so-called salad cakes (which are basically salads that look like cakes), and her idea has been so popular that a cafe selling them, The VegieDeco Cafe, is slated to open this month.
How a salad cake works is that basically in lieu of traditional icing, the cakes are glazed with either tofu or cream cheese, before they are blended with vegetables to make them look like frosting.
The cakes may look devilish, but they are in fact extremely healthy - simply speaking, they are nutritious salads disguised as tasty cakes.
The cakes contain whole vegetables in them, while the ‘sponge’ part of the lunch is created using natural ingredients like soybean flour.
The so-healthy-it-hurts cafe is set to open on April 5, and it will feature a number of superfoods, including low carbohydrate ingredients and gluten-free items.
Little or no sugar is added to each salad and there is a focus on health and beauty, with roots and peels also thrown into the mix to maximise the health benefits of each dish.
While they are certainly beautiful, and there is an intricate level of attention to detail in every single salad available, these cakes may fall short of your regular sweet batter, if you’re expecting them to deliver a typical cake-y sugar rush.
However, they are a new, and nutritious way of pepping up your normally boring midday meal.
And best of all, unlike their chocolate counterparts, they come guilt free.
Following a seasonal menu, the VegieDeco cafe is sure to become a favourite haunt of the health-conscious in Japan in days to come.
