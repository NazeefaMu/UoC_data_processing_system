Why we need Queen’s lingo
A monthly journal fully dedicated to enhancing the faculty of imagination of the budding writers would revolutionize the thinking pattern of the young generation. The affective domain of the young could be channeled into self-satisfaction and self-fulfillment thus arresting the casual heartlessness of the children in doing harmful pranks on adults and the aged.
Reading is the panacea for all the diseases. There is no elixir such as reading. Children’s capabilities could be diverted to productive channels through reading. A literary journal for the school community would be of immense value in many an aspect. For a kick start we could begin with a monthly literary publication exclusively for the schoolgoers. There would be competitive atmosphere if we could begin at the regional level. Depending on the success the concept could be propagated to the island level.
The writer expects constructive suggestions from both the teaching fraternity and the concerned parties for a further discussion. I earnestly hope that this piece of writing would catch the eye of the president and the minister of education.
Let’s guide our prodigies to a brave new world.
