Cabinet approval to amend CIABOC

Cabinet this week granted approval to amend legislation and other laws relating to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC).
The memorandum presented to Cabinet by President Maithripala Sirisena noted that “there were many shortcomings and omissions in the existing laws” and that amendments needed to be introduced to allow the Commission meet contemporary requirements and to avoid certain confusions in the existing law.
“Amendment to the laws is a matter of urgency and of crucial importance,”the memorandum further noted.
Accordingly,the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption and related acts will soon be subjected to several amendments.
CIABOC Director General Sarath Jayamanne has been reported to have said the current Act was too archaic to deal with issues like money laundering and other white collar crimes.
He had asked that amendments be introduced to look into corruption within the private sector as well.
A Parliamentary Oversight Committee consisting of Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana, the Attorney General’s Department and CIABOC has prepared report on the amendments.
