Great October Revolution:
Lesson on common man’s fighting spirit: President

The Great October Revolution gives us a valuable lesson about the common man’s fighting spirit, said President Maithripala Sirisena, addressing the special ceremony organized by the Sri Lanka Communist Party to mark the 100th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, at Nelum Pokuna Theatre.
The October Revolution, officially known in Soviet literature as the Great October Socialist Revolution, was a revolution in Russia led by the Bolsheviks and Vladimir Lenin that was instrumental in the larger Russian Revolution of 1917. It took place with an armed insurrection in Petrograd on October 7, 1917.
“Even today, the people are ready for a revolution for freedom and democracy, but there is a deficiency of people who could provide the leadership for it,” he said.
The President said, at present, there is a strong foundation for bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Russia. He added that the economic and commercial relationship between the two countries have extended and strengthened due to his visit to Russia. He said he was the leader who made a state visit to Russia on invitation after 44 years.
