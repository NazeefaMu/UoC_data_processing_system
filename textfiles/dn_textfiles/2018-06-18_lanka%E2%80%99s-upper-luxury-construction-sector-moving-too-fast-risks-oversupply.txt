“We launced our latest housing project in Rajagriyia targeting the mid-market and the response is very good.”

Profile:
Jayantha Dharmadasa, is the son of Deshamanya Hewa Komanage Dharmadasa (17 June 1920 – 10 August 2011), known as Navaloka Mudalali, who was a business magnate, philanthropist and founder Chairman of the Navaloka Group of companies.
Jayantha is a business personality with over 35 years experience in Executive Business Management and 25 years in Health Care Industry.
He also serves as the Chairman of Nawaloka Holdings, Nawaloka Hospitals PLC, New Ashford International (Pvt) Ltd, Concord Ventures Export Lanka Ltd., Sasiri Polysacks (Pvt) Ltd, Nawakrama (Pvt) Ltd, Nawaloka Metropolis Clinical Laboratories (Pvt) Ltd, Nawaloka Medical Centers (Pvt) Ltd, Nawaloka Construction Co.

He served as independent non executive Director of Sri Lanka Telecom PLC since May 26, 2010. He completed Secondary Education at St. Thomas’ College and is a fellow Member of the Institute of Certified Professional Managers (FCPM).
Jayantha served as Chairman National Film Corporation, Sri Lanka Cricket and also has been President of Asian Cricket Council. 

He said that in addition to the high construction and labour cost the land prices in Colombo too are very expensive. “As a solution to the labour issue we are also forced to import labour from the region.”
Commenting on the cost of production he said that this too is accelerating very fast. Asked why there are major housing projects in the rural areas built by the private sector he said it may be because lack of infrastructure.
He said that the Sri Lankan expatriate community who have links to the North and East too prefer to invest in housing options in Colombo due to long travel time needed to North- East.”
In contrast the South which is well connected by the Highway has apartment projects and there is more business for developers in the South.
“Commenting on their overseas operations he said that Nawaloka Constriction successfully built a mega 4 star hotel project in the Maldives that they won through an international tender. “We completed the project ahead of time.”
Overseas opportunities
“We are fishing out for similar international tenders and are currently negotiating from project in Egypt and Myanmar.” Talking about the Nawaloka hospital which changed Sri Lanka’s private sector health care industry, setting benchmarks he said it was a major success. “We are happy that we could create a path to open up a quality world class Sri Lankan private health care industry which also helped to raise the bar of this area.”
He recalled that his farther H. K. Dharmadasa saw this demand and build Nawaloka hospital to serve the masses.
“The entry of Nawaloka Hospitals into the state dominated healthcare sector in 1985 saw the private health care system take root in Sri Lanka. The launch of the hospital and the overwhelming response it received from the people demonstrated a long felt need for superior healthcare in a pleasant environment,” he said.
“Today Nawaloka Hospital is considered by patients as a home and not a hospital due to the homely atmosphere we offer for patients.” Due to the demand we also expanded by building a new 16 floor wing which was opened recently. Nawaloka hospital also is in consultation with a leading health care company in South Korea for the last four months to introduce more international health care practices and technology to the hospital.
No to Jaffna yet
Commenting on their health care expansions he said that currently their plans are on hold. “The hospital wanted to expand to Jaffna but folded up the idea due to issues in the industry.” We observe that today there are issues with consultants and the reduction of drug prices too is eating to our profit margins. We want a clear and long term policy by the government for the health care sector.”
The strikes launched by Government Medical Officers Association and university students is also creating issue for the industry. Dharmadasa also said that while they pay VAT and several other taxes the small time private hospitals also offer similar services but don’t pay their taxes. “This has created an unfair platform of competition.” Asked to comment on getting involved in the Stock market he said the Nawaloka Hospital has offer 30% and would not move further than that.
“As for other companies we would like to keep them as family entities.”
He said that today he has given over some of the businesses to his Children who are successfully taking it to the next level moving with the modern global trends.
Cricketing standards dropped
Commenting on Cricket where as one time head of the Cricket Board (BCCSL) Dharmadasa said that the team’s standard has dropped.
“A free hand should be given to the coach and I think if the current coach Chandika Hathurusinghe too could do a major change to the team which lost the first ‘Test’ to a ‘B’ team in West Indies last week.”
During my time as the President of BCCSL I hired a top international coach Tom Moody and he made the Sri Lanka team a winning unit. I Also I think the Cricket administration should not have temporary interim boards but a full time interim Board until such time the game improves. Giving future direction to up and coming entrepreneurs he said they must remember that failures are the pillars of success and never give up after starting a business. “There are ups and downs and one should not get discouraged and fold up.”
