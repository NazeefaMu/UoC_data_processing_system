Hallmark of the present moment

What is happening? What would happen next? Where are we heading for?
These are questions that crop up today even during a casual conversation among friends and acquaintances. A certain uncertainty is in the atmosphere. Of course it is related to the Government and political developments of the day. The clarity and coherence in the objectives and actions of governance displayed at the time of taking over the reins of government are disappearing.
Our attempt here is to enumerate a few instances of such uncertainty that have become major concerns of the public. First and foremost is the fate of Constitutional changes. Going by media reports and utterances of several ministers and political parties in the Government there is no unified view on the matter.
The SLFP has decided to retain the executive presidency and not to go beyond the 13th Amendment in devolving power. Nay, it wants to abolish certain provisions in the 13th Amendment such as police and land powers granted to the Provincial Councils. Even ministers who are for devolution of power are practically taking over powers and institutions of the Provincial Councils under the central government. It was quite recently the Health Minister declared his intention to take over all base hospitals under the central government. Some of the better provincial roads and schools were taken over similarly during a former regime.
Though the President has not so far indicated any change in the electoral promises made loud mouthed ministers with a history of controversy such as S B Dissanayake as well as new-comers such as his namesake holding the post of General Secretary of the SLFP are implicating the President too in their statements. For instance, they have openly declared that the President would contest the next Presidential election though he has pledged to retire after the current term. Incidentally in opposing a new Constitution the language used by these gentlemen is the same as that used by the chauvinist forces opposed to national unity which gives rise to a justified suspicion whether they are acting as a Fifth Column of the so-called Joint Opposition.
New Constitution
Meanwhile spokesmen of the UNP say that a new Constitution will be introduced, as promised during the elections. Adding insult to injury there is no certainty about the promises made at the elections too. The irony of the situation is that those who opposed President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe at the election are now interpreting their election manifestos. One could only say that the devil may quote scriptures to his purpose.
There is also a lot of uncertainty regarding the SAITM issue and the government’s policy on free education. Minister of Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella and once again our friend former Higher Education Minister S B Dissanayake has taken up the position that the Court verdict is final. They belligerently oppose any other way out ignoring the sentiments of almost the entire University student body and a substantial number of academics and professionals. Meanwhile several political parties including some in the Government take a different position.
Differences of opinion are apparent in the sphere of foreign policy too. Doubts have arisen among concerned circles whether Sri Lanka is deviating from the non-aligned foreign policy. The lukewarm attitude shown towards it at the last Summit and the downgrading of our representation to it is a sign of such deviation, it is argued. The President, on the other hand has tried to allay these fears. Though the President and the Prime Minister have been visiting few dozen countries there has been no visit to the Gulf region where substantial number of Sri Lankans are employed.
Former regime
Uncertainty also relates to the fate of the investigations and legal proceedings against bigwigs of the former regime who were alleged to be involved in bribery, corruption and misuse of public property. No serious attempt has been made to expedite these inquiries or to ensure that undue influence is not being brought on officers of State conducting them. Some of the alleged offenders have not been touched at all despite wide accusations against them giving the impression that they are enjoying some sort of impunity.
Added to the confusion is the attitude of certain ministers to the FCID, which has been constituted legally. Their attitude does not differ in any way from that of many who are indicted in Courts for misdeeds while in public office. Is it a case of “birds of a feather flocking together”?
There is hardly any attempt to formulate national policies on education, health etc. as envisaged in the Memorandum of Understanding reached by the UNP and the SLFP in forming the Consensus Government. What is witnessed is the same old acrimony among considerable segments of the two parties.
Uncertainty has given rise to confusion and loss of confidence in the Government on the part of the public including those who voted it into power. Confusion is a breeding ground for indiscipline. Hence, uncertainty, confusion and indiscipline seem to be the hallmarks of the present moment. The sooner they are eradicated the better for the country.
