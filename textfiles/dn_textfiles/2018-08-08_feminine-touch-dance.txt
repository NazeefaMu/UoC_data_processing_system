Feminine touch of dance

In almost all the Indian classical and folk dances females play an important role in the cultural life of the people. In any country, culture reveals the pattern of lifestyle, customs and traditions relating to regional and religious practices and historical background of the society.
Earlier practically females were the dominating figures in the fields of fine arts, especially in the fields of dance, music, sculpture and paintings. From the very beginning, female temple dancers and female court dancers enjoyed a prestigious position in society. Earlier temple dancers were called Devar Adiyarkal, Devadasis, Sathirkaaris or Pathiyeayalar.
Architectural sculptures
In Vaishnava temples, the dancers were called Sri Vaishnava Manikam. The females made their contribution to the dance in different forms. Their contribution is mainly depicted in temple mandapa sculptures, temple pillar sculptures and temple gopura sculptures. Even dancing female figures were depicted in the general architectural sculptures. Similarly, even in the paintings, we could see the female contribution to the dance, mainly in temple walls and roof paintings, temple pillar paintings, dancehall curtain paintings, in stage decoration and cut-out paintings.
In some dances in the past males dominated the scene but now females play an important role. It could be seen in Indian classical dances such as Odissi and Kuchipudi. Meanwhile, Mohini Attam is practised by females alone and Kathakali is still practised by males only.
Stone plate inscriptions
Even the names of the female dancers could be seen in several inscriptions. This could be seen in the copper and stone plate inscriptions. These inscriptions give the names of numerous female dancers and their awards. The titles conferred on them and the details of the awards. The titles were well defined. Even earlier, as well as today, in the field of classical and folk dances, the most attractive and the most outstanding performing artistes are females.
Even the decorations adopted by female dancers such as hairdressing and facial makeup are more elaborate than those of the male counterparts. The female dancers wore differently designed costumes than their male counterparts.
Certain classical items such as Meenakshi Talaadu, Andal Thirukalyanam and Kurathi are only performed by female dancers. They adopt the costumes, makeup and hairdressing, according to the role of the selective dances. Female folk dancers are generally called Koothukaris or Koothier in Tamil and by different names in diverse states.
The colourful and glittering costumes are selected by the females. Simple beautiful makeup was always adopted by female folk dancers and the majority of them wore colourful shawls over the heads. Most of the dancers danced with decorated sticks or pots or holding decorated shawls or lamps in the hands. The folk dances are mainly performed by groups with a variety of colourful costumes. Some folk dances are only performed by female dancers and some are performed by females and males together and some are performed by males alone. In both classical and folk dances, beautiful, graceful movements, stands, curving and bending positions could be seen more among female dancers than male dancers.
The contribution and the role of female dancers in the practical dance field, as well as in the dance research field, are much better than those of the male dancers.
