Toshiba keen to seal $18 b  chips sale, wrestles with  last-minute delays

Japan's Toshiba is locked in last minute discussions over “key issues” with the would-be buyers of its $18 (roughly Rs. 1,14,817 crores) billion memory chip business led by US private equity firm Bain, potentially delaying a formal agreement on the sale.
Toshiba said on Wednesday it had agreed to sell the prized unit to the Bain consortium, and had been expected to formalise the sale on Thursday.
Instead, South Korea's SK Hynix, part of the winning consortium, said talks were still ongoing. Sources familiar with the matter confirmed consortium members were still wrangling over details of their agreement and said commitment letters from all participants were still needed before the sale could be signed formally.
“There are some key issues still to be agreed upon in the content approved by Toshiba's board,” the South Korean chipmaker said in a statement, adding that it would continue talks. (Gadgets)
