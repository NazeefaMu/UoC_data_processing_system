Maestros in harmony

An Evening of Russian Masterpieces will be held at the Lionel Wendt Theater on May 2 at 7.30 pm. Performed by Russian pianist Maxim Puryzhinskiy and Sri Lanka’s Ananda Dabare and Dushyanthi Perera, this evening promises a rare musical treat to discerning music lovers.
Maxim Puryzhinskiy thrilled audiences, last November, when he gave an exhilarating performance of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2. Maxim’s technical skills were clearly evident with his powerful but emotive rendition of this beloved concerto.
He will commence this evening’s program by playing one of Rachmaninoff’s most famous compositions - the Prelude in C sharp Minor. Maxim will, thereafter, accompany Ananda Dabare (violin) and Dushyanthi Perera (Cello) in their performances of Tchaikovsky’s Meditation and Rachmaninoff’s Vocalise respectively.
The highlight of the evening will be when these three master musicians combine to perform Tchaikovsky’s Piano Trio in A minor, regarded as one of the greatest pieces for this combination of instruments.
Along with Russia’s Maxim Puryzhinskiy, Sri Lanka’s foremost violinist, Ananda Dabare and Sri Lanka’s foremost Cellist, Dushyanthi Perera will showcase their virtuoso skills as they take on the challenge of performing this masterpiece in the repertoire. Do not miss out on this unique opportunity to hear these master musicians in concert. Presented by the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, an Evening of Russian Music, is part of the ongoing Earle de Fonseka Trust Chamber Music Concert series.
