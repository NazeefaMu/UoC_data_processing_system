Future of fiction

Bret Easton Ellis is dogged in defending his positions: he is for aesthetics over ideology; freedom of expression, and art that disrupts and disturbs. He asserts that a culture built on the need to be liked – driven in no small part by the approval mechanisms of social media – has created a cultural rot. When I first interviewed Ellis for VICE in 2014, he and I discussed his term “Generation Wuss” (which he coined on Twitter to refer to those largely falling into the millennial bracket). That conversation caught the public’s attention as a clash of the generations. Now, and in light of the Trump election and the #MeToo movement, I wanted to know how his ideas had shifted.
Nathalie Olah: You’ve recently finished editing your first book in eight years. Can you tell us a bit more about it?
Bret Easton Ellis: It’s actually something that my publisher and my agent have wanted me to do for a long time, and that’s a non-fiction book. Initially they wanted a collection of whatever essays I’ve published – I don’t think I’m an essayist, so I did not want to do that – then they talked about publishing some of my podcast rants. Those are not really written, those are kind of based on notes. But if I could take some of the podcast rants and their themes and sort of do this pseudo-memoir that is primarily about cultural things that influenced me growing up – what it was like living in New York in the 1980s, and then skipping all over the place, there’s a chapter about horror movies in the 1970s, there’s a long chapter about Richard Gere, a strange confluence of things that led to writing, say, Less Than Zero or American Psycho, then that could work. I write about how 9/11 made Lunar Park come into clarity for me (that summer I was living in New York), after two years of not knowing how to do that book, and I also write about the election, and how that affected a disillusioned Gen X-er like myself. It’s sort of a lament from a disillusioned Gen X-er. And I know a lot of disillusioned Gen X-ers, who feel kind of lost because, well, they’re a tiny generation compared with the massive boomers and massive millennials. It might be very niche, I don’t know. But it happened really quickly. In December I started putting it together and then I finished it like a week ago and now my editor is going through and we’ll see what happens. We don’t even have a publishing date for it. Yet.
NO: Would it be fair to say that you’ve abandoned fiction?
BEE: I was reading something just today, just before you came here asking why there isn’t a Great Millennial Novel. Or The Great Millennial Novelist or The Great Millennial Short Story Writer. Sure, there are things like the Cat Person story in the New Yorker, which sort of captured the zeitgeist for a minute. But it was something that I’ve been increasingly aware of in my own life and in conversation with people. No one really talks about novels anymore. I know a couple of people who published novels in the last year and they did nothing and the contracts were cancelled.
I love writing fiction. The love of writing is definitely there. But Lunar Park and definitely Imperial Bedrooms were kind of meta-novels anyway. The last fully-fledged one I wrote was Glamorama, which was an eight-year process of really making up this crazy, surrealistic, epic, ambitious novel that I thought was going to make this huge connection, and it didn’t. I mean, there are fans of it, but Knopf would love to see that book break even and it hasn’t, not yet. It was an exhausting experience, but one that was pleasurably exhausting I guess. Imperial Bedrooms, on the other hand, started out as a commentary on Less Than Zero and was written at a time in my life when I was having a terrible midlife crisis, much like the character in the book. It became a gory noir, but that was 100 per cent accurate in terms of where I was. Three years of my life compressed into a 160-page novel that was a complete pain to write, absolutely hellish. This is all a very long answer to a simple question. I love fiction and I love reading novels. I always have one or two going at all times. I just finished reading The House of Mirth, which I had tried reading as an eighteen- year-old college boy and just didn’t get. Now at fifty-four, it’s crushing. Absolutely crushing. And the writing is just stupendous. I also love Age of Innocence and The Custom of the County. Just going to Edith Wharton every morning was fantastic and blew away any television or movie that I could find online. I looked forward to it the night before. I’d get excited to make my coffee, wake up in the morning and just start reading. And even with a book I didn’t expect to like, which was George Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo, which I’m reading now, it’s kind of magical. It’s poetry in a way. But I love reading fiction. Very few people I know now do. And I’m talking about writers. I was at a dinner with two very well-known writers about a year ago . . .
NO: Can you say who?
BEE: [Jay] McInerney and Mark Danielewski, who wrote House of Leaves. I asked them if they’d read the recent Pulitzer Prize-winner, The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead, which I had read because it had won the Pulitzer Prize and that’s something I would do. I’m interested in whatever wins the prize. And they hadn’t read it. When I asked them why, they said they weren’t really interested. Now regardless of the idea that they believed it won for reasons that were ideological and not aesthetic, and kind of resented it for that reason, I still found it interesting that they wouldn’t want to read the Pulitzer Prize-winner, because after all, it’s part of the narrative of where we’re at with books, and with the novel.
But that trend has rapidly dissipated in my crew and I don’t find I have conversations with anyone who reads novels anymore. Is there a correlation between that and me not really wanting to write long-form fiction? I don’t know. There’s a book I’ve been working on, on and off, set in the years before Less than Zero is set. Sometimes I get excited looking over the pages, and then other times, I feel more inclined to want to direct, focus on my podcast and create television. I don’t agree with them, but many people argue that the television series is the new novel. I’m talking about educated people in their fifties, sixties, seventies, who are watching television as if it’s a novel.
NO: Your novels may well serve as vehicles for social commentary, but would you agree with the assessment that entertainment was always the primary objective?
BEE: I do agree that it is masked heavily, but there is social criticism that’s very earnest in American Psycho, Less Than Zero and Rules of Attraction. Which I try to avoid, but you just can’t get away from the fact that Patrick Bateman is this sort of symbol of greed. But actually I say that because that’s how it’s been taken, when really it was a very personal novel. I was going to nail myself there, but it’s true. And certainly, how do you get away from the title of earnest satirist when you’re attacking the media, the fashion world, how silly and vacuous it is, how soulless Wall Street is, how soulless American teens are in Beverley Hills? I sort of look back on it and think: God, you were quite the little moralist. But also in a way that was very dark.
