David Pieris organizes ‘Big Cleaning Day’  at Minneriya National Park

‘Big Cleaning Day,’ is a program organized by David Pieris Group’s Social Welfare Committee, at Minneriya National Park together with the Department of Wildlife Conservation and participation of volunteers.
At the conclusion of this program, the volunteers had collected more than ten tractors of polythene, plastic and other non-recyclable waste within the national park borders from Habarana to Minneriya.
Each volunteer was presented with a coconut sapling as a token of thanks. David Pieris Group also sponsored the renovation of sign boards around the park on the importance of conserving and protecting our natural resources.
Officials from David Pieris Motor Company (Private) Limited, including Deputy General Manager (Vehicle Sales) Mahesh de Silva, DPMC dealers in Polonnaruwa District, members of Sri Lanka Army, Women’s Three Wheeler Association in Polonnaruwa, Minneriya Safari Jeep Owners’ Association and people in the Polonnaruwa area were involved in this program.
Commenting on the success of this program, DPMC Deputy General Manager (Vehicle Sales)  Mahesh De Silva said, “We are happy to be associated with the dynamic team at the Department who are making a great effort to protect and maintain the national parks, its inhabitants and the flora and fauna. DP Group will continue to support the Department of Wildlife Conservation in its efforts towards preserving these natural habitats for future generations.”
In addition to environmental protection programs, David Pieris Group’s Social Welfare Committee recently donated fully equipped houses for low income families, computer laboratories and buildings for schools, medical equipment to hospitals, etc.
“As a Group that is in the business of inter alia providing mobility to the masses, we strive to uplift the lives of communities we do business in. It is our firm belief that giving back to society enriches all. We believe that we are trustees of good fortune and shall continue to share that good fortune with the society that has contributed to our success” De Silva said.
