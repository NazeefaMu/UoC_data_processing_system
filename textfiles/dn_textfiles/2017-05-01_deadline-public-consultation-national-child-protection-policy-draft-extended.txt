The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) has extended the time period for public input regarding the draft of the National Child Protection Policy to May 15, 2017.
The deadline was previously April 30, but due to appeals from various parties the National Child Protection Authority has decided to extend the time period till mid-May.
The complete draft of the National Child Protection Policy can be accessed through www.childprotection.gov.lk and by making a request to the NCPA situated at No. 330, Thalawathogoda Road, Madiwela, Sri Jayewardenepura, Kotte.
The Chairperson of NCPA Marini de Livera requested the public to forward their views and suggestions regarding the relevant draft to the above postal address or to the e-mail address [email protected].
The draft of the National Child Protection Policy is a result of extensive consultations at national, provincial, and local levels held over a period of more than a year.
