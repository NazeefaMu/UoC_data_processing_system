Ryan to be produced before HC regarding revision bail petition

The Colombo High Court yesterday issued an order directing the Superintendent of Welikada Prison that Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath be produced in the High Court on October 23 regarding his revision bail application.
Accordingly, High Court Judge A. A. R. Heiyanthuduwa deferred for October 23 to consider the revision bail application filed by Ryan Jayalath.
Medical Faculty Students’ Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath arrested on charges of causing damages to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest had been ordered to be further remanded by the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court.
Through this revision application, the petitioner Ryan Jayalath sought an order against the Maligakanda Magistrate’s Court’s refusal to grant bail. The petitioner is seeking an order to release him on bail.
