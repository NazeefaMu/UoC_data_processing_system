[Children]-12.11.2015

To squirrels with love
Dear children,
Our hobbies and preferences are different. Each of you may have different hobbies. How many of you enjoy maintaining a feeding table in your garden for squirrels and birds? I have written to you earlier too about the importance of being kind to animals.
Some of you who reside in urban areas may not have enough space for these animals to move around freely. Anyway maintaining a feeding table is surely an interesting hobby from which you can gain a great deal of satisfaction.
You can get your parents' or guardians' help to make a suitable and safe place for these animals to feed on. You can get a discarded margarine or ice cream container or even coconut shells and have them hanging from wires tied to branches of a tree in your garden. Then you can put rice or bread crumbs and anything else that is edible into the container.
Do not hang around this area until they get used to your presence. During the first few days squirrels will look a little scared when reaching the feeding table, but once they understand that the place is safe they will make it a habit to come there when they feel hungry.
As days pass by birds too will start to visit the feeding table. It is indeed a pleasure to watch how squirrels nibble their meals. They will always consider the birds as intruders, but will accept the birds on the table just the same. I am sure all of you will enjoy the sight.
Trees are being cut down to build houses and other buildings. As a result animals too have to undergo difficulties when finding their daily meals and safe habitats. We have to help them survive as each living being has a right to live on this earth.
Bye for now,

A visit to the zoo
Last Sunday it was cloudy. I along with my friends visited the zoo. As we reached near the main gate of the zoo, we saw a huge crowd. Some were buying entrance tickets, some were gossiping and chatting other were relaxing under the shady trees.
We entered to zoo and came across a beautiful lake in which some water-birds like ducks were swimming. Seeing the white ducks on the smooth surface of water is a charming sight. As we moved, we came to the enclosure in which flying birds (fowls) were kept. They ranged from sparrows, eagles and parrots to pigeons of various colours. The birds were chirping. It was an enchanting music. We enjoyed it very much.
In the next enclosure were kept-lions and leopards tigers and tigresses, whose roars were deafening. When we approached the net, a lion rushed towards us and we were frightened. Their fierce looks were frightening.
Then we came across a garden in which smart and beautiful stags were kept. In one of the corners monkeys were jumping. Their tricks and pranks were very pleasing. Some people threw food to them and they immediately jumped down the trees to eat them. Some children were making faces at them.
Our next stop was the aquarium. A large number of the fish were kept there. There were fish of many species and colours. They made a delightful spectacle. There were many other aquatic animals.
After visiting many places we relaxed for some time in a cool and beautiful garden inside the zoo. The fragrance of the flowers was tremendously soothing. Then we had some snacks and drinks which refreshed us. It was evening and the sun was setting. We came out of the zoo like many other visitors. We were a happy lot when we boarded the bus.

My first day at school
My mother accompanied me to school on my first day at school. Other parents accompanied their children as well. We all waited in front of the school office.
Soon a teacher came and led us to some classrooms. There we were put into four separate classes. This was when some children began to cry as the parents were not allowed into the classrooms. I did not cry because I had been to kindergarten before. My mother went home soon after because she knew I would be all right.
It was an enjoyable time for me as I got to know my new classmates. The teacher was very busy writing down our particulars so we had plenty of time to ourselves.
Meantime some children continued to sob while their parents looked in anxiously through the windows.
Soon recess came. Some of us headed for the tuck-shop while the rest headed for their parents. I bought a drink with the money my mother gave me. Getting to know my new friends had made me thirsty.
After recess we went back to out classroom and my new friends and I managed to coax two boys to stop crying. Soon we were laughing and playing together. Once in a while the teacher had to tell us to keep quiet as we were making too much noise.
Finally the bell rang for us to go home. Some of us were relieved to be reunited with our parents. I too was glad to see my mother waiting for me at the school gate. I had made many friends. It had been a wonderful first day at school.

My grandmother
My grandfather passed away before I was born but my grandmother is still alive. She is seventy-two. She is tall and healthy. She hardly looks sixty. She has preserved her health in a wonderful manner. She is still energetic and works the whole day, I have never seen her idle.
She still has all her teeth and normal eye sight. She is an early riser. She gets up at 4am and never misses her bath with fresh water.
She is very pious and religious-minded. She prays during the morning and evening. She is very sparing in her diet. She takes only two meals a day. At night she takes only a glass of cow's milk. She is a strict vegetarian. She washes her clothes herself. She is very simple in her dress. She hates modern fashions. She goes to the temple every Poya to observe sil. She gives away some money to charity every day. She is very good at knitting. Show her a sweater or a blouse with even the most difficult design and she will prepare an exact model of it. She is a genius. She spins tales of the finest quality. She is a very good cook.
My grandmother loves hard work. She cooks food and serves it to all the members of the household. She is the last to take her meals. She takes the simplest food. She is very economical in everything. She manages all the household affairs most efficiently. Her word is law for us all. We dare not go against her wishes. I love my grandmother with all her virtues. She is my idol. I wish I may live up to her expectations so that she may one day feel proud of me.

Our school library
Even since I was admitted to school, I was very keen to see the spacious hall, where only the students of the higher classes were allowed to go during the lunch hour. We can only go there with prior permission from the class teachers. Bu since I am in grade 11, I did not have to face that difficulty any more.
After entering the big hall I peeped through the glass-panes of the big almirahs. I found out that there are some heavy volumes. It was difficult for me to even move them. Then there were some very small volumes as well. Most of the other books were of an average size.
There was a gentleman who appeared to be very busy. I could read from his name-plate that he was the librarian. He was having heaps of books on all sides of his table and in the shelves near him. It looked as if he was drowning in a sea of books.
The newspaper section was nearby. About 20 newspapers of various languages were displayed on newsstands. There were about 60 magazines also on sports, science, current-affairs, commerce, management and computer science.
This library had a reference section for teachers too. There were about 6,000 books on various subjects there. I was happy that I saw the library that day.
