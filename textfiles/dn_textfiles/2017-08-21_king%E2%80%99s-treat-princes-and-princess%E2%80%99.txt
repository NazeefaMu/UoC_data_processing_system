Celebrating important milestones of family members particularly children can leave lasting memories that will be carried throughout their lives. “If an unforgettable celebration is what you hope to give your little prince and princess, you should definitely consider the ‘celebration central’ of Colombo - The Kingsbury,” states The Kingsbury in a press release.
The Kingsbury is renowned for its awe inspiring banquet venues and scintillating cuisine which has made it a go to choice when it comes to weddings and corporate events. And now to the delight of their junior guests 3 new kiddies’ party packages have been introduced.
Having the space to run around and have bouncy castles and other play items set up is best suited for an outdoor venue. The Kingsbury has not one but two of such venues; The Oval (front lawn) and Honey Beach Club (pool side).
Located right in front of the hotel and overlooking the lotus roundabout is a The Kingsbury’s lush meadow- The Oval. This spacious patch of greenery is ideal for a garden themed party for kids to run and play to their hearts content. The soft grass is safest option for those concerned about their hyperactive and accident prone little ones. Add a bouncy castle and some other activities and a fun filled celebration is guaranteed.

The sandy area is spacious and ideal for play items to be set up and the real plus point of this venue is the free usage of the pool! Kids can splash round and have whale of a time they will never forget. The Balmoral, The Victorian and The Winchester can be used as indoor venues to host these celebrations. Give your little prince and princes the unforgettable celebration they deserve at The Kingsbury! Planning your kiddie’s party has never been so simple, so decide on the theme and the guest list and set up a meeting with one of the banquet team members today.
