SL On course to eradicate Child Labour

According to the recent Child Activity Survey 2016, launched by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), incidents of child labour have shown a significant decrease over the years.
Department of Census and Statistics Director General, Dr A.J. Satharasinghe said Sri Lanka reports a very low level of child labour which has been estimated at one percent of the total child population.

Dr Satharasinghe said this phenomenon is common to all three sectors urban, rural and estate sector.
“The fact that not only child labour, but working children and hazardous forms of child labour also has shown a significant decline.”
He highlighted that the hazardous form of child labour has reached a very low level of 0.9 percent adding that the government’s policy on making education compulsory for children up to 16 years and the equal opportunity provided for children on education has been a contributory factor.
The survey revealed that the total number of children in the age group of 5-17 years in Sri Lanka in 2016 is 4.6 million. The survey estimates that 90.1 percent of the children were attending school during the survey period. Among the children not attending school, the majority (84.2%) are in the 15-17 year age group and about half of them are awaiting G.C.E (O/L) results. A small 6.8 percent have not yet enrolled due to being below the age of 5 years by January.
The survey further revealed that only about 2.3 percent of children aged 5-17 years are engaged in some kind of economic activity. This is a decline of 10.6 percentage points from the 12.9 percent reported in 2008/2009. The total child labour is only one percent of the total child population and hazardous forms of child labour is as low as 0.9 percent.
Dr. Satharasinghe said child labour and hazardous forms of child labour are subsets of working children and are defined considering national legislations and guidelines of ILO.
“Labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives them of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful,” he said.
He further said that many other related statistics on working children, child labour, hazardous forms of child labour, health conditions of working children, parents’ perception of working conditions and living conditions of children are available in the report which will be of value to policy makers, researchers and especially those who are working for the welfare of children in Sri Lanka.

The Child Activity survey was conducted at the request of the Ministry of Labour and Trade Union relations. International Labour Organization (ILO) provided all assistance to conduct this country wide household survey in 2016. This is the third in the series of Child Activity Surveys (CAS) conducted by the DCS. The previous rounds were conducted in 1999 and 2008/2009 with the assistance of the ILO.
The data collected in the CAs- 2016 includes demographic characteristics, school attendance, economic activities, health and safety, housing, household characteristics and perception of parents/guardians on working children and other characteristics pertaining to the children aged 5-17 years. This is a household survey and covered all children aged 5-17 years who are usually living in households, but some information was collected on children who are living away from the households as well. This field of the survey was carried out from January to May 2016.
“Not all children’s work is bad. Many children work. They do household chores around the house and help in shops or farms. Such work can help children learn new skills, develop responsibility, manage their resources and gain experience which might be helpful in their future social responsibilities. However, not all work has a positive effect on children’s lives. Some forms of child labour can damage children’s health, hinder their education and have major psychological effects,” said Dr. Satharasinghe.
Challenges in making informed decisions
President Maithripala Sirisena adhering to the United Nations Conventions signed the Convention for ending Child Labour developed by the International Labour Organisation with the aim to completely eliminate child labour from the country, in July Last year. The government took greater efforts to combat issues related to child labour in the recent years. However, Secretary to the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, M.I.M. Rafeek highlighted the challenges in making informed policy decisions and the importance of reliable evidence.
According to Rafeek, as a government which pays great concern in providing social welfare to its people, it has to implement policies to uplift the living standards of the people.
“At a time where much emphasis is made on good governance, transparency and accountability, policy makers should have access to reliable data in order to justify the reasons behind the policies formulated by them,” he said.
He further said that the statistics pave the way for a scientific approach to investigate all available evidences in formulating policies which will result in achieving the desired outcome.
Rafeek emphasised the necessity of accurate data on formulating policies which will result in the development of the country.
“Accurate and timely data plays a major role in formulating policies in order to make need based demand driven interventions to bring about rapid developments in the country. Evidence- based policy has been defined as an approach which helps to make well informed decisions about policies, programmes and projects by using the best available evidence,” he added.
Rafeek claimed that it will help the planners to make better informed decisions by putting the best available evidence at the centre of the policy process.
However, he was of the opinion that this approach stands in contrast to opinion-based policy, which is mostly based on selective use of evidence or on the untested views of individuals or views.
“These views may not provide a better picture, since they can often depict the ideas of the designer rather than the actual evidence. The present world is moving from opinion based policy towards evidence based policy which enhances achieving the long term, middle term and short term goals of a country,” he explained.
Speaking about the Child Activity Report 2016 he said that this report provides evidence to formulate effective policies for the welfare of the children in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, he emphasised that as a developing country, Sri Lanka has to pay much concern over the overall development of children.
Dr. Satharasinghe said Political commitment, through the adoption of coherent policies in the areas of poverty reduction, basic education and human rights, eradication of child labour can be considered to have enabled the progress that had been achieved in eliminating child labour in Sri Lanka.
“Particularly such policies and countrywide awareness programmes have helped to create a new generation of more educated parents less inclined to send their children to work,” he said.
According to Dr. Satharasinghe, it seems that a future without child labour is within our grasp.
“For Sri Lanka to eradicate child labour completely, policies need to take into consideration, the fact that of the estimated 4,571,000 children aged between 5-17 years covered in the survey, an estimated 103,700 (2.3%) worked at least one hour during the seven days before the interview; 43,700 (0.1%) were involved in child labour while 39,000 (0.9%) were engaged in hazardous forms of child labour,” he said.
