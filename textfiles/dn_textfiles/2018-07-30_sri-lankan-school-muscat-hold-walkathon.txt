Sri Lankan School Muscat to hold walkathon

The arrival of a newborn baby is a ‘dream come true’ experience to all parents. Filled with hope, they begin to build their whole world in and around their child. However, there are hundreds of children born into the world with heart diseases.
Therefore, in order to raise awareness on the matter, the Sri Lankan School Muscat in Oman, had made preparations to hold a walkathon on July 31, at 3.00 pm, from Independence Square to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children. The programme is also aimed at supporting the Little Hearts Fund.
