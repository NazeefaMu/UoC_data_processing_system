New Anchor Newdale Mango Blast launched

Fonterra Brands Lanka, the company behind Anchor, has launched its latest range of flavoured milk and yoghurts to bring families an exciting, all-new flavour profile that tastes great and provides all the goodness of high quality dairy nutrition.
The new Anchor Newdale Mango Blast range not only presents Sri Lankans with the choice of another much-loved fruity flavour for their dairy nutrition, it also offers a healthier option with the lowest added sugar of major yoghurt and flavoured milk brands. The mango yoghurts contain just 6 per cent added sugar and the mango flavoured milk just 4 per cent, both of which have no sweeteners of any kind.
Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka and the Indian Subcontinent, Sunil Sethi said, “Fonterra is committed to creating a healthier and happier Sri Lanka by focusing on developing innovations that meet the nutritional needs of the nation. Our research tells us that when it comes to dairy nutrition, Sri Lankans prize taste over anything else. Kids also want variety and excitement with new flavours and formats to quench their thirst and satisfy their hunger.”
“By delivering on both taste and nutrition, new flavours like Anchor Newdale Mango Blast help support Sri Lankan farmers by driving demand for locally produced dairy products, while providing families attractive and nutritious choices.”
Anchor Newdale Mango Blast is the latest in a range of Fonterra innovations in local dairy, produced from fresh milk. These innovations are part of Fonterra’s commitment to support Sri Lanka’s dairy farmers by creating demand for local dairy and increase the volume of local milk collected by Fonterra, estimated at 10 per cent growth annually.
In 2017 Fonterra relaunched its strawberry flavoured range and immediately saw a double-digit growth in demand for yoghurt post-launch, in comparison to the previous three months.
Earlier this year, Fonterra launched its low-fat Anchor Drinking Yoghurt in two highly popular flavours, Vanilla and Mango Passion.
For 40 years, Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka has provided Sri Lankans with high quality dairy nutrition through a range of products, including Anchor. As a dairy cooperative owned by over 10,500 New Zealand farmers, we are also focused on sharing our expertise locally with dairy farmers to help create a thriving local dairy industry. Today we work indirectly with 100,000 people across the country through our network of business partners to help make Sri Lanka a healthier, happier nation.
