Avant Garde Operations Manager refused anticipatory bail

Galle Chief Magistrate A. Nishantha Peiris refused to grant anticipatory bail for Operations Manager of the vessel MV Avant Garde Vessel considering an application made for the purpose.
The ship MV Avant Garde was seized by Sri Lanka Navy on October 13, 2015 for allegedly keeping a floating armoury on board and handed it over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for subsequent investigations. In his bail claim made to the Galle Magistrate Court on April 17, Millaniyage Sumudu Nilupul Costa, Operation Manager of MV Avant Garde had cited Director of Criminal Investigation Department and Attorney General as respondents.
In his submissions he had stated that he had received reliable information to the effect that the Criminal Investigation Department is looking for evidence for his apprehension and had reasonable doubt that he would be arrested and produced in courts with trumped up criminal charges on mere grounds that he was employed in the above capacity attached to the disputed ship.
The lawyers for the applicant further told court that that the claimant was an ex-major of Sri Lanka Army and had become incapacitated in the war and alleged that the Criminal Investigation Department was planning to act arbitrarily and with malicious intentions for political reasons.
Rakna Lanka Ltd which is alleged for maintaining a floating Arms Depot on MV Avant Garde is a state owned institution and it was operated on an agreement with the government and the firm was ready to further cooperate with the subsequent investigations, the applicant’s lawyers further argued.
The prosecution raising preliminary objections had contested that the charge of illegal possession and transportation of firearm was a criminal offence subject to life imprisonment and according to the Bail Act it was an offence bailable only by a High court.
The State Counsel who told the court that Criminal Investigation Department had made the corresponding submissions under the Firearms Ordinance and pleaded the court to consider over the possibility of granting bail on the matter at the Magistrate court and entreated an order regarding same.
Subsequently the magistrate retained the order for yesterday and pronouncing the same he declined to grant anticipatory bail for the applicant saying that the alleged charges were bailable offences only by a High Court.
Ajith Pathirana, Harith Hettiarachchi and Buddhi Jayawardana , Attorneys at law appeared for the petitioner and IP Lasantha Rathnayake appeared on behalf of the Criminal Investigation Department while Janaka Bandara state Counsel represented Attorney General.
