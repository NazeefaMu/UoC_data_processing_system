Hungry jumbos cause fear

The people who travel on the Kataragama-Buttala road in vehicles are being inconvenienced due to wild elephants that stop them for food.
Elephants had increased as travelers are in the habit of feeding these elephants. Some elephants had gone to the extent of attacking vehicles if they are not fed.
Wildlife officials are urged to take steps in this regard.
