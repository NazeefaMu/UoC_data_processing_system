Kantar Worldpanel names Munchee as ‘SL’s number one FMCG Brand’

The Kantar Worldpanel’s ‘Global Brand Footprint Report’, have yet again named Munchee as ‘Sri Lanka’s Number One FMCG Brand’ for 2017.
This survey was conducted in Sri Lanka by the UK based International research company and Munchee was able to secure its position as Sri Lanka's No. 1 brand for the year 2016.
The flagship brand of CBL (Ceylon Biscuits Limited), Munchee, has been consistently rated the leader in the FMCG market in Sri Lanka.
Every year, Kantar Worldpanel conducts an exhaustive study of FMCG brands across the globe and selects the strongest FMCG brands from each country. Rankings of Kantar Brand Foot Print 2017, reveals the strength of brands in 43 countries around the world, across the Food, Beverage, Health & Beauty and Home Care categories. The report is the largest of its type, covering 15,300 brands, 200 categories, 43 countries and five continents, representing 73% of the global population. The Brand Footprint Report further states that household consumption drives the majority of sales in the FMCG segment due in large part to long-term trends such as a growing urban middle class with rising disposable incomes and changing consumer preferences for traditionally Western products.
Reflecting this trend, Munchee remains a household name in Sri Lanka, supported strongly by a strong distribution network, high quality and innovative products suited to the local palate.
On receiving this accolade, the Marketing Team at Munchee commented, “We are grateful to the people of Sri Lanka for having given us their seal of approval! Universal approval from the nation is the ultimate endorsement of our brand quality and this gives us immense pride.”
In the global survey, to select a country's number one brand, key consideration was the consumer reach points, which is based on the number of households in the country (population); percentage of households buying the brand (penetration); and number of interactions with the brand across categories in a year (occasions).
Munchee’s secret to success has been its scientific and well informed brand decision-making; agility in evolving to suit the macro environment; leveraging on advanced technology; and resonating with an increasingly divergent buyer base, not just in terms of positioning but also format, pricing and promotions.
