President Sirisena will never sweep PRECIFAC Report under carpet: Minister Samarasinghe

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna supporters are not extending their support to President Maithripala Sirisena as he would never sweep the PRECIFAC Report under the rug, said Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
Minister Samarasinghe was referring to a speech delivered by President Sirisena at a rally held in Ratnapura recently, where he said that he was ready to form a SLFP government if all 96 SLFP members stood with him as one party.
Samarasinghe made this observation at a media brief held at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday afternoon.
While pointing out that several MPs supporting the SLPP had their names in the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources, and Privileges (PRECIFAC) Report, Minister Samarasinghe expressed his confidence that President Sirisena would never go easy on corrupt politicians whether he received their support or not. He observed that not all SLPP supporters are corrupt politicians, but only several of them.
“SLFP MPs supporting the SLPP are trying to dodge President Sirisena’s invitation by saying that it is only a sweetener for the election, but in truth, they are not supporting President because he would never cut any slack for MPs involved in corruption,” Minister Samarasinghe pointed out.
“President Sirisena would never fix deals with corrupt politicians to win them over,” Minister Samarasinghe further said.
He also pointed out that President Sirisena had practically proven that he would take action against corrupt politicians, disregarding their political affiliations.
“If you look at the case of the Uva Province Chief Minister, President Sirisena made sure that a proper investigation be conducted on the matter. The President also appointed a Presidential Commission to investigate into the Treasury bond issue to make sure justice was meted out,” Minister Samarasinghe said.
Minister Samarasinghe requested grass root level politicians to get together and strive for a United People’s Freedom Alliance Government, even though some politicians prefer otherwise.
Questioned on matters raised on former President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s civic rights, Minister Samarasinghe said the PRECIFAC Report included a recommendation to strip off the civic rights of public representatives if they were to serve a jail period more than six months. Minister Samarasinghe pointed out that the former President has not yet been found guilty on any such matter. He also said that legal advice had been sought out from the Attorney General’s Department and the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption on the matter of Rs.115 million loss suffered by the State-owned Television Station ITN for telecasting the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s advertisements, which had not been paid for.
