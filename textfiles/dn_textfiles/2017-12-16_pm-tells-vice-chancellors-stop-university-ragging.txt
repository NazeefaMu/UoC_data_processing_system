PM tells Vice Chancellors to stop university ragging

Kurunegala District UNP parliamentarian and Minister of Education Akila Viraj Kariyawasam told the Daily News today (15) in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed all Vice Chancellors of state Universities yesterday (14) at a meeting held at Temple Trees, that all possible steps should be taken by the university administration to stop senior students’ ragging junior undergraduates at universities countrywide.
The Prime Minister instructed the Vice Chancellors to recruit new staff to carry out the task of stopping ragging at universities if necessary. When compared to the past, state universities seem to have faced a certain decline at present internationally and hence, all authorities concerned must plan meaningful programmes to maintain the quality standard and good recognition of Sri Lankan universities at international level in the future. Minister AkilaViraj Kariyawasam said the Prime Minister had thus instructed the Vice Chancellors who met the Premier yesterday at Temple Trees.
