‘Degree not needed to work for masses’

The UDA has to cater to more than 22,000 houses and 25,000 families numbering over 100,000 people. So it needs men and material to undertake the required work. A person need not have a degree to work with the people. What is needed is the will and dedication to render service to the people, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The Minister was speaking in reply to a statement made by Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila questioning the qualifications and credentials of project directors, advisors and coordinating officers of the UDA.
Minister Ranawaka said the last regime ran the UDA by appointing military officers to its posts. Today, the Ministry needed more employees to render a proper service through the UDA. A degree was not essential to work with the masses. For that matter, neither did Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike nor Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake have degrees, but they rendered colossal service to the people.
The two people mentioned by Gammanpila served under him when he was provincial minister, but their educational qualifications did not bother Gammanpila at that time, he said.
Even Dinesh Gunawardene was aware that Architect Prasanna Silva who was Director General of the UDA during the previous regime, was jailed for one-and-a-half years because of false charges made against him. Another person called Gnanapala was chased out for disrespecting the Director General by talking to him with his hands in his pockets, Minister Ranawaka said.
“Perhaps Gammanpila feels jealous to see UDA work progressing smoothly without strikes and protests to make such wild accusations,” he said.
