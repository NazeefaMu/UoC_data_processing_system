Memories of Colonial Living

The 'City of Light' is a fascinating destination indeed. At first glance, the perfect recreation of a quaint English village in the countryside, complete with a pink brick Victorian style Post Office, colonial homes and mansions and perfectly landscaped gardens. Delve deeper and discover a world renowned golf course, a variety of tea plantations, horse racing and misty mountains. This is the town known as Nuwara Eliya and the Cottage by Jetwing is one's base from which to explore.
Thanks to the cool climate, Nuwara Eliya is the escape for many from the heat prevalent around other parts of Sri Lanka. Accessible through road and rail, both forms of travel are scenic - with rolling fields of green and occasional waterfalls in between. The city itself boasts a rich history, having been discovered by Dr. John Davy in 1818 and founded by Samuel Baker, discoverer of Lake Albert and an explorer of the Nile. Formerly the retreat of British civil servants and tea planters, Nuwara Eliya is now a town of history, culture, and adventure; with much to see and do.
Centrally located in the town itself and just over 6000ft above sea level, The Cottage is a lovingly restored colonial bungalow featuring three rooms - two suites and a deluxe room. Complete with amenities such as individual heating, hot and cold water, parking for two vehicles, it also features a well appointed kitchen and dining room, with Jetwing St. Andrew's only a short walk away as well. This excellent location is in close vicinity to a variety of attractions in the area, such as the historic St. Xavier's Church, the Nuwara Eliya Golf Club (one of the oldest in Asia) and Lake Gregory. The best of highland living, in an intimate and private atmosphere is yours to experience at The Cottage by Jetwing.

The Villa Collection by Jetwing is all about intimate comfort and privacy featuring the largest selection of small luxury experiences in Sri Lanka. From lovingly restored century-old colonial bungalows to sprawling beach-side homes, Jetwing brings world renowned hospitality in a uniquely personal setting - perfect for families, couples, and groups of friends.
