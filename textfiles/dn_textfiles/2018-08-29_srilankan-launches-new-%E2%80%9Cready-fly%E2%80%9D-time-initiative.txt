SriLankan launches new “Ready to Fly” on-time initiative

SriLankan Airlines yesterday announced the launch of its new ‘Ready to Fly!’ programme to enhance its customer service by providing increased punctuality levels of its flights around the world.
Issuing a press release, SriLankan Airlines requested the co-operation from passengers for its new on-time initiative by boarding flights promptly.
“SriLankan Airlines asks all our customers to ‘help us to help you’ and be ‘Ready to Fly’ by arriving at the departure gate at least 40 minutes prior to the scheduled time of departure. Our new ‘Ready to Fly!’ initiative is the result of feedback from a wide circle of customers. Not surprisingly, an on-time departure is one of the most important expectations of all our guests,” the press statement stated.
“In order for an aircraft to depart on time, the airline’s team works hard on all aspects of pre-flight preparation - this includes closing the doors in advance of scheduled departure time and making sure that the aircraft is ‘Ready to Fly’. To achieve our ‘Ready to Fly’ target, the departure gates will be strictly closed 20 minutes prior to the time of departure. Any guest arriving after this time will not be permitted to board the aircraft and their checked-in baggage will be removed from the flight. The best rule of thumb is to arrive early to ensure adequate time for pre-flight processing and any other personal needs such as shopping or dining,” the statement added.
