Everyone loves stories, specially if they come with pictures. Not just any pictures but pictures created by legendary artist Sybil Wettasinghe. I am no exception. I felt I was given a rare treat when I came across Sybil Nanda’s drawings in a journal of short stories, non-fiction, and poetry, several decades after I read her beloved ‘Suttara Puncha’ series and forgotten most but not all of the lines in, ‘Magul Gedara Bath Natho.’
Volume 21-2015, of ‘Channels’, The Journal of the English Writers Cooperative, comes with these rare gems – one-line drawings by Sybil Wettasinghe, enhancing each story and poem, making you realize this year the journal differs considerably from the usual volumes you are familiar with, which tended to have a simple pattern on the cover and was 6”x9” in size.
But ‘Channels 2015’, edited by Sybil Wettasinghe is not a wholly familiar affair. You can tell this at a glance, from the size of the book and the cover photo of the nib of a fountain pen, in a background made with the letters of the Enlgish alphabet, as well as from the editor’s note. “To me the art of creative writing is synonymous with the art of painting...
A painter selects harmonizing colors before starting to paint. In the same way, the writer should select ‘harmonizing’ words that create pleasing sounds in the mind,” writes Sybil Wettasinghe, and adds that throwing in a few one-line sketches is tempting, so far as it would not be at the “cost of the main content, which is writing.”
Credit should go to Adith Publishers too, for their excellent page layout and high quality printing which add a new flavor to this year’s publication.
There are 26 short stories, non-fiction and poetry here, (with three contributions from another legendary writer, Vijita Fernando: a tribute to Jean Arasanayagam, a review of ‘Write to Reconcile II,’ and a short story, ‘The Prize’). Naturally, this means there are 26 different points of view and 26 creative descriptions which make it hard to describe or review them all. So, forgive me, if I fail to mention some of them in this review. As this is a collection, understandably, I might feel some stories and poems are not my cup of tea, but there is no doubt that, each piece presented here, has merit of its own. In other words, here are different arrows to pierce different hearts.
Among the stories that made indelible impressions on me was Ananda Devapriya’s ‘The Meanest Battle’, which so poignantly describes how the protagonist watches his wife’s battle with cancer, “I was prepared to do anything, cleaning her was a part of my routine. “When shall I pay you back for everything you have done for me” once she told me hanging onto my shoulder”, and which, in spite of the sorrow, ends in a positive note, “Death is certainly a reality. However, she defeated her fear of death.”
Shazla G. Hussain’s poem, ‘A Special Performance’ too was beautifully crafted leaving the reader in suspense till the very end, thereby making the blow, when it comes, harder to bear. For those who might find some of the poems and stories are too tragic, or too cynical as I did, D.L Sirimanne’s ‘Flossy the Fly’ and Sybil Wettasinghe’s ‘Great Lover of Cats’ will ease the tension and bring a welcome dose of good-natured laughter.
Nobel literature laureate Alice Munro, mistress of the short form, describes a story as “a world seen in a quick glancing light”. Staying true to this description, from a cargo vessel on a voyage to Singapore to a grandma in Sydney recollecting her brother’s marriage in Belfast, to a vegetarian dog called Billy, each of the stories collected here gives the readers a glimpse of worlds far different from their own. And just as the characters roam across the globe, so they travel in time, from mid twentieth century to contemporary Colombo. From the ‘backs of books, smeared with tidbits of time’, to the mysterious revelation of Kalu Manike on her deathbed, these stories and poems depict an abundance of creativity.
The protagonists include teenagers and ninety year olds, teachers and widows. Wars won (Stephanie Nugera’s ‘Back to Where I Belong’) and loves lost (‘A Profound Gesture’ by Nanda P. Wanasundera), relationships splinter and rekindle, (‘Stephanie
Peries’ ‘Coming Home’). Whether it is the rape of the para-medical student in India ((‘Daughter’ by Sakuntala Schithanandan) or one woman’s lone battle with her brutal husband ((‘The Storm’ by Jassica Gunawardena), they deal with battles big and small. Everyday triumphs and tragedies are briefly illuminated, the secret places of relationships laid bare. Melancholy or mischievous, elegant or experimental – together these short stories and poems showcase the variety and vibrancy of contemporary English writing in Sri Lanka.
At a time when most publishers give short fiction step-motherly treatment, ‘Channels 2015’, with previously unpublished poems and short stories by some of the best writers working today, as well as by newcomers with great promise, is the fire that keeps the torches burning for creative writers in English, in Sri Lanka. Here is a valuable journal that reinforces the breadth and brilliance of Sri Lankan English Literature in the 21st century.
