Fisheries Ministry extends support to prevent dengue

 
The Fisheries Ministry has decided to extend their support to the dengue prevention programme launched by President Maithripala Sirisena.
Accordingly, Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has directed the Director General of Fisheries Christy Lal Fernando to direct relevant authorities take measures to dispose potential dengue breeding grounds such as unused boats and equipment to collect rainwater from the coastal line.
The Minister has also directed to implement a Mosquito Prevention Day during the month to raise awareness.
