The former Rajapaksa government which levels allegations against the present government over the Treasury Bond issue, had fulfilled its financial needs through issuing Treasury Bonds, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
He said that 85 per cent of the financial needs of the Rajapaksa’s government had been fulfilled through Treasury Bonds. However, under the present government the Central Bank has issued Treasury Bonds to receive funds only for 7 to 8 per cent of financial needs.
