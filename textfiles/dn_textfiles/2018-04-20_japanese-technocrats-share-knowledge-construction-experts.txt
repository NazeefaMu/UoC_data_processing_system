Japanese technocrats share knowledge  with construction experts

Tokyo Cement recently hosted a select group of industry top brass to a knowledge sharing seminar, titled ‘New Trends in Concreting Technologies’ conducted by Japanese experts from UBE INDUSTRIES LTD, at the Anantara Resort, Kalutara.
The event was organized by TOKYO SUPERMIX (PVT) LTD, the newly incorporated fully owned subsidiary of Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC, operating its Ready Mixed Concrete and Value-Added Products business.
Three Japanese Civil Engineers and Professors were flown in from UBE Industries, the technology partner of Tokyo Cement, conducted the seminar to a group of seventy-five practicing structural engineers and concrete manufacturing professionals.
The objective of the event was to provide a platform to discuss new technologies developed in the Japanese construction industry and the use of cement-based value-added products,with a view to enrich Sri Lanka’s construction industry that is on a striking growth trajectory at the moment.
The seminar created the atmosphere for a high-level peer group meeting coupled with panel discussions for senior decision makers, engineering consultants and project managers from both public and private sectors, alongside the senior management of Tokyo Cement and Tokyo Supermix.
Dr. Keisuke Takahashi, Engr. Tomoaki Ito and Dr. Hirokatsu Mori of UBE Industries, Japan presented on their specialty subjects, engaging our Engineering experts who used the opportunity to hash out new ideas based on their rich local experience and practical knowledge.The sessions were moderated by Dr. M.G.M.U. Ismail – Director Research & Development of Tokyo Cement, and Engr. Janaka Perera – General Manager of Tokyo Supermix (Pvt) Ltd.
Dr. Keisuke Takahashi, Senior Researcher at UBE Industries delivered the opening session centered on “Hot Weather Concreting”, a topic of great relevance in the Sri Lankan context where many high-rise structures are being constructed in major of the country. Dr. Takahashi is a member of the group of researchers currently engaged in a study on this subject in selected Asian countries headed by Saitama University of Japan. From Sri Lanka, the Civil Engineering Departments of Moratuwa and Ruhuna Universities are collaborating in this research.
Tokyo Supermix as a concrete solutions provider was able to cater to the paradigm shift of quality requirements in the Sri Lankan construction industry that happened over the last 5 years.
Tokyo Supermix, Sri Lanka’s largest concrete manufacturer with the widest network of batching plants spread across the island, was the first to develop mix designs to meet the complex specifications required for durable and high-performance concretes for some of the sophisticated projects such as, the Southern and Outer-circular Highways done by Taisei Corporation of Japan and the Altair project, all of which were completed under tropical hot weather conditions.
The second session on “High Strength Concrete” was conducted by Engr. Tomoaki Ito -Group Manager of the Concrete Development Group at UBE Industries, a professional Civil Engineer and an expert on specialized construction materials development. His session focused on the importance of using specially formulated high-strength cement that can derive high performing concrete for high-rises and super structures.
