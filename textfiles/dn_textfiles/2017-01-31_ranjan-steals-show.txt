Ranjan steals the show?

The Yahapalanaya government has this penchant for walking from one crisis to another, scoring own goals and providing ammunition to its critics to haul it over the coals. Recently it was the Director Agriculture who recommended croton and Jak leaves to the people as an alternative diet to overcome the crop failure due to the drought. The Joint Opposition lost no time in seizing on the opportunity to ridicule the government. Prior to that it was the UNP’s muscle bound Palitha Thevarapperuma who, most said, had taken over the mantle from Mervyn Silva, clowning himself in front of the TV cameras. When it appeared that the Deputy Minister had been duly chastised and was at last behaving himself without causing further embarrassment to the government we have another macho man from the same party flexing his muscles being violently uncivil to a lady Divisional Secretary serving in his own constituency.
Film star turned politician and Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake by no stretch of the imagination would fall into the category of a Mervyn Silva or a Thevarapperuma. The flamboyant actor, though often in the news for his unorthodox ways in dealing with issues confronting the public, nevertheless, is a temperate individual not given to flying off the handle. But what the public witnessed on television the other day would have shocked even the ardent film fans of Ramanayake, not to mention his party supporters.
True, the ebullient politician is well known for his no nonsense attitude in dealing with matters that impinge on the interest of the public. He is commended in many quarters for his crusade against the hardships confronting the Lankan housemaids in the Middle East. He has also won laurels for his hard line stance against corruption even in government and openly expressed his views on the alleged Central Bank bond scam.
On this occasion too, the Deputy Minister was fighting on the side of the public against the large scale destruction to the environment as a result of indiscriminate and illegal sand mining carried out under political patronage in his Divulapitiya constituency. Television showed the Deputy Minister, surrounded by his supporters, arriving at the scene to view the scale of destruction and to ascertain the facts. In the melee a call was taken to the lady Divisional Secretary, who, obviously was the villain of the piece, for allegedly aiding and abetting the illegal operation, in the opinion of Ramanayake. Hot words were exchanged by both parties with the Deputy Minister going slightly overboard in a threatening vein.
The whole issue was obviously painted as a David and Goliath affair with a cornered and highly vulnerable lady state official at the receiving end of a bullying government minister. The bulging pectorals of the Deputy Minister did not help matters either. It is not clear if the lady Divisional Secretary had indeed been in cahoots with the culprits. But a bit of circumspection on the part of Ramanayake would have been in order given the fact that he was addressing a lady, known to be the weaker sex, though this assumption would be contested in this day and age.
All public servants in the Gampaha district, in solidarity with the lady DS, staged a walk out yesterday demanding an apology from the Deputy Minister. Ramanayake for his part is unrepentant insisting that no apology would be forthcoming from him unless steps are taken to halt the ongoing destruction. Whether such an incident would have a fall out on his political fortunes is too early yet to say. But Ramanayake, it is certain, would carry on his crusade against injustice, corruption and environmental destruction, come what may.
To begin with, the Deputy Minister need not have to depend on a political career for his financial stability, being in the film industry now for over three decades. He is also the first MP who declined the Rs. 100,000 special allowance granted to all parliamentarians. Some would even venture out to say that Ramanayake would be the ideal person to even keep the present government on its toes as regards corrupt deals. He has never held back on revelations against his fellow Ministers in the UNP and has taken to task a minister in the east for forest destruction, publicly.
Be that as it may, Ramanayake, a committed member of the UNP, should learn restraint without giving into precipitate action. Being a marked man of the Opposition, from the very inception, he would do well not to give ammunition to his opponents to cast himself as a bully, muscling his way through things. There are of course different schools of thought as regards the action taken by politicians of the kind Ramanayake took the other day. Some would say it is such action, unhampered officialdom, that would get work expedited and serve the well being of the people or as in the Divulapitiya case effectively prevent harm and destruction to the environment that would take a heavy toll on the people.
