Request  for medical faculty

Youth in Uva Wellassa request the authorities concerned to set up a medical faculty affiliated to the Uva Welassa University. They say in 2017 a large number of students from Badulla and Moneragala Districts qualified to enter the medical faculty and they were sent to the medical faculty at Karapitiya because there is no medical faculty affiliated to the Uva Welllassa University.
