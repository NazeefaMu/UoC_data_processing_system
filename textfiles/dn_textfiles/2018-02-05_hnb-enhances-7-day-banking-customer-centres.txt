HNB enhances 7-day Banking Customer Centres

Bringing greater convenience to their weekend banking customers, one of Sri Lanka’s private sector commercial bank, HNB PLC, added Personal Financial Services to their already existing 7-Day Banking Customer Centres.
Customers across 12 townships in Sri Lanka could avail themselves of loans even during weekends, in addition to the usual banking services from these fully-fledged centres.
Such centres will manage all ‘over-the counter’ banking needs plus provide advisory assistance to customers on HNB’s unique financial products including personal and housing loans, leasing and credit cards – at an easier, relaxed, weekend pace.
HNB envisages that the Saturday and Sunday offering will be a boon to their customers, most of whom have very tight work schedules during the week. Such customers who have no time to visit the Bank could now visit the closest 7-day Centre during a weekend to discuss all their banking needs from loans to leasing.
HNB’s Deputy General Manager, Retail Banking, Sanjay Wijemanne, speaking on the rationale behind the additional services, said, “HNB has taken a pragmatic decision to transform our existing 7-Day banking centres to include value added services, such as Personal Financial Services. Now, customers can meet a dedicated Staffer during the weekend for advice and assistance, collect applications, hand-over documents etc, without being rushed”.
The Centres are located in Wellawatte, Rajagiriya, Maharagama, Negombo, Anuradhapura, Kiribathgoda, Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle, Ratnapura, Trincomalee and Jaffna will see a further 40 such customer centres, convert into fully-fledged weekend units. Adding to providing exceptional customer service, HNB will also introduce a door-to-door service for customers who have applied for a personal or housing loan.
A dedicated banking agent will visit the residence or business premises to complete necessary documentation.
