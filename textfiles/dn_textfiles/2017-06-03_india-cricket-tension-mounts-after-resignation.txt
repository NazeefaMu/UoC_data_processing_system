India cricket tension mounts after resignation

NEW DELHI, Friday – Tension over the future of India's head coach Anil Kumble grew Friday after a top cricket administrator resigned slamming the Indian board for its handling of the controversy.
Amid a reported battle between team captain Virat Kohli and Kumble, a deadline for applications to become head coach passed this week without any announcement by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Top names like Virender Sehwag and Australia's Tom Moody have reportedly applied for the job which comes vacant when Kumble's one-year term expires after the Champions Trophy. Kumble is also in the running.
Ramachandra Guha, who quit a Supreme Court-appointed four-member committee overseeing the BCCI, backed Kumble to be given an extension.
Guha, in a letter written to the committee of administrators (COA) chairman Vinod Rai, criticised the BCCI as he gave reasons for quitting the post that he only took on January 30.
Guha confirmed to AFP the contents of the letter published by Indian website Scroll.in.
"The Indian team's record this past season has been excellent; and even if the players garner the bulk of the credit, surely the head coach and his support staff also get some," Guha wrote. AFP
