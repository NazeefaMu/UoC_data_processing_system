Sheeran takes early lead for 2017’s singles and albums race

He’s said he wants to the biggest pop star of the year, and it looks like Ed Sheeran may well get his wish as new figures unveiled by the Official Charts Company today show Ed dominates the Official Top 40 biggest singles and albums of the year to date.
With the first quarter of the year cleared, invincible Ed is officially smashing it on both the singles and albums front, with his broad appeal translating to commercial success across every release format – physical records, downloads and streams.
Ed’s double single release at the beginning of 2017 has paid off, kick-starting his incredible ÷ album campaign and a double-header domination of the biggest tracks of the year so far.
Shape Of You leads the way on the year-to-date Official Singles Chart with a massive 1.8 million combined copies shifted across all formats, while the Suffolk singer-songwriter’s Castle On The Hill secures the second biggest song of the year so far, with 1.1 million equivalent units sold.
Ed’s huge popularity on streaming services such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music, has seen Shape Of You streamed a staggering 121 million times since release, but with 604,000 downloads also under its belt, the reigning chart-topper bags the accolade of the most downloaded track of 2017 so far too.
A total of seven songs by Ed Sheeran appear in the Top 40 list off the back of his hugely successful ÷ album. Galway Girl is proving a hit with the British public, placing seventh (445,000 combined copies), while the seven featured songs from ÷ have collectively amassed 1.2 million individual track downloads as fans cherry-pick their favourites from the collection.
A month after release, Ed’s third album ÷ is also way out in front in the biggest records of the year list, shifting an impressive 1.4 million equivalent units across all formats. The album’s runaway success is driven by physical sales with nearly 886,000 copies purchased on CD and vinyl so far, with 280,000 opting to download the album, and the remainder made up of streams.
