No service extension for SriLankan Airlines Security Chief

The Public Enterprise Development Ministry will take steps as per recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry not to give a service extension to a Head of Security at SriLankan Airlines, Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.
The security chief in question is a retired Army Major General who was appointed by the previous government. He is on his third service extension,” Airlines sources said.
The Commission has observed that the officer concerned has allegedly harassed and threatened SriLankan Airlines’ officers who had come before them to give evidence into alleged fraud and corruption that had taken place at SriLankan Airlines.
Minister Kabir Hashim said the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) had issued a letter to his ministry on Friday with recommendations to remove the Airlines’ Security Chief.
“The letter was with my ministry secretary. I’ve got it in my hands just today (yesterday),” he said.
“Accordingly, to go along with the Commission’s recommendation, the Public Enterprise Development Ministry Secretary has referred it for action from the board of directors of SriLankan Airlines.”
“The Airlines had yet to report it back to the Ministry,” he said.
