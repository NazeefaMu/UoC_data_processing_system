PS members boycott meeting

Ten government and opposition members of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabah walked away from its meeting held on Wednesday in protest of not taking disciplinary actions against a management assistant of the Sabah who has worked drunk.
Sixteen PS members had requested in writing in August to take action against the officer but no action was taken against him so far, they said.
Six UNP members, two SLFP, one JVP and one SLPP walked away from the sitting.
