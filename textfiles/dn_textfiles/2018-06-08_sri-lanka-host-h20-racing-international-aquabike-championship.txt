The Lanka Powerboat Association has successfully won the rights to host the opening round of the H20 racing International Aquabike Championship in March 2019. For the first time ever -

Each round of the Aquabike World Championship is four days of breathtaking action, entertainment and spectacular night shows.
It is an event that combines speed, skill, artistry and sheer raw power producing adrenalin-fuelled non-stop action, edge-of the-seat racing and improbable feats of artistry and acrobatics.
