‘Ranil should graciously step down’

Since President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa are humane leaders who are lenient in executing their powers, the best thing Ranil Wickremesinghe should do at this moment was to graciously move out from Temple Trees and take up the Opposition Leader’s post, said Western Provincial Council SLPP member Jagath Kumara. He was addressing a press briefing held at the Battaramulla Samurdhi Union office on October 31.
Jagath Kumara said he was making a request from Wickremesinghe to act according to the law without inciting people to get on to the streets in the future.
He recalled that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa left Temple Trees official residence the moment he lost the Presidential Election and it was this law-abiding gesture on his part which enabled the SLPP to gain victory at the last Local Government elections. He said President Sirisena had taken a wise decision to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister to resurrect the economy which had crashed and people were closely observing Ranil Wickremesinghe’s response to it. There seemed to be a division within the UNP ranks today and many UNPers were waiting to crossover to the government.
SLPP members of the Kaduwela UC, Nilantha Pushpakumara, Ranjith Kaluhapuge and Sriyani Liyanage were also present.
