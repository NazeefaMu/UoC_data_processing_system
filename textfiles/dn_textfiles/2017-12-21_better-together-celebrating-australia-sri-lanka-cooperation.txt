Better together:  celebrating Australia -  Sri Lanka cooperation

The Australian High Commissioner, Bryce Hutchesson, held a photographic exhibition at the Hall de Galle recently celebrating 70 years of development cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka.
Australia has long supported Sri Lanka’s development. The exhibition highlights how Sri Lankans have benefited from the humanitarian, health, education and employment projects delivered byAustralian aid.
“Partnerships with all levels of government, civil society, the private sector and NGOs have been central to the success of these programmes” said Hutchesson.
The exhibition also captured the future of Australia’s development cooperation in Sri Lanka.
“Many of our new programmes focus on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more and better jobs and opportunities for all Sri Lankans, especially women” Hutchesson added.
The exhibition also had a series of selected portraits of the significant contribution Sri Lankans have made to Australian society. “These portraits showcase just a small representation of the large and vibrant Sri Lankan community that has contributed significantly and positively to Australia’s multicultural life.” High Commissioner said.
