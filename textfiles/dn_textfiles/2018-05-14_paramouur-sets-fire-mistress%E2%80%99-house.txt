Paramouur sets fire to mistress’ house

A man had set fire to his mistress' house over a midnight dispute, Polpithigama police said.
The 35-year-old woman had separated from her husband recently and had started an affair with the suspect. The day of the incident, the woman had invited the suspect to her house.
Consequently, the man had set fire to her house over a dispute and fled.
Neighbours had doused the fire but not before it destroyed her furniture and a refrigerator.
The estimated value of the destroyed items amounts to Rs 800,000, police said.
Polpithigama police are investigating.
