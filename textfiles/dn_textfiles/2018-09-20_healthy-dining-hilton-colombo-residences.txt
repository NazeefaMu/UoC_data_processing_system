Healthy dining at Hilton Colombo Residences

Hilton Colombo Residences announced its seasonal produce for the months of September to November as Lemongrass, Coconut, and Ginger at all of its dining outlets as a part of its #EatDrinkHilton campaign.
The objective of this initiative is to look at the health aspect of each seasonal produce and how it can be used in daily dishes. The high tea at FLOW will feature a range of speciality seasonal produce for both sweet and savoury variations which will be paired with a range of tea. The high tea will be made available every Thursday and Friday, from 4–6pm at BASICO.
The buffet will feature fusions like pea and coconut mousse on rye sourdough, egg and lemon grass mayonnaise brioche, Ginger-infused chicken liver pate, crispy waffle with coconut and ginger ice cream, and lemongrass profiteroles.
Speaking of the seasonal specialty produce, Hilton Colombo Residences, Food and Beverage Manager Priyal Wijesuriya said this promotion will help to connect with cultural relevance in South East Asia. “This month we will introduce lemongrass in our dining experiences to emphasizes on its benefits to health with sweet and savoury offerings,” said Wijesuriya.
