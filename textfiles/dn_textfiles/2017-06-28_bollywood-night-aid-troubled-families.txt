Bollywood Night in aid of troubled families

The Asylum at the Independence Arcade will come brilliantly, glamorously, sensuously alive on July 7 when the Zonta Club 11 of Colombo presents Bollywood Night.
It’s a not-to-be-missed event for couples and singles looking around for a spectacular way to spend a Friday night. They can learn dance steps from an expert. Girls are invited to bring the men in their lives, and don their glamorous Ghagras and Lehengas; and everybody will dazzle and sizzle the night with some great food and wine and music and atmosphere to match. Plus there will be gifts for the one with the best moves and the most interesting outfit.
The best news of all is that Bollywood Night is a fund raiser for the Zonta Club’s Mithuru Piyasa Counseling Centres. These are two highly specialized Centres attached to the Kethumathie women’s hospital in Panadura and to the General Hospitals in Kalutara and Embilipitiya.
The principal objective of the Counseling Centres is prevention of violence in homes. And because of the devoted work that has gone into the setting up and staffing of these Centres, and the imaginative ways they attract families with troubles, there is real awareness and wonderful heartwarming progress. Women and their men and their families are drawn to them and seek help with very positive and comforting results.
So everybody can feel good about having a great time at Bollywood Night. It’s likely to be very popular because of the real interest in Bollywood dance steps at gyms and among fitness enthusiasts. Fun loving men and women of any age can dance with abandon and have an extravagant theme night, knowing that they will also have contributed to an excellent cause.
