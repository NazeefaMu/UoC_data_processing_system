Politics that transcend No Confidence moves

The recent communal clashes in Ampara and areas of the Kandy district did have harsh echoes in Geneva at the current sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Council, where the United States and the United Kingdom raised related matters. The US expressed concern on ‘ongoing reports’ of human rights violations and abuses by members of the security services, and recent attacks targeting members of religious minority communities in Sri Lanka. The UK expressed serious concern about inter-communal violence and hate speech against minorities, and exacerbated by recent developments, including violence against Muslims in the Kandy district that led to the proclamation of a State of Emergency for 12 days.
On the wider issues relating to the current situation on Human Rights in Sri Lanka, Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana informed the UNHRC that the country’s judiciary and law enforcement mechanisms are fully capable of and committed to the processes of advancing justice to all concerned. The Foreign Minister emphasized that “The legacy of conflict in Sri Lanka is heavy, and it permeates our society to this day. Extremists constantly strive to take advantage of this situation to achieve political gain. This realization only makes us even more determined to ensure that we never return to the violent days of the past. It is our intention to ensure the fulfillment of our commitments to all our people and bring closure to a sad and disturbing period of our recent history,”
Sri Lanka does have to face international criticism for any violations of Human Rights, especially minority rights, which it carries out. However, it is necessary to note that both the US and UK are not countries that have any squeaky clean record on treatment of minorities. In the US, President Donald Trump has made it clear about the government’s complete disregard and even contempt for the rights of the Muslim minority, especially in the immigration bans that have been introduced on citizens from several majority Muslim countries, and the President’s own comments on attacks on protesters from the black minority. There is plenty of evidence that his Keep America Great slogan has much to do with Keep America White. In the UK, which certainly has a better legal record on the treatment of minorities, there is considerable evidence to show that the broader picture of equality shown to the world does not apply to the minorities in many areas of community relations that affect these communities most.
Internal politics
While the Sri Lankan delegation at the UNHCR Sessions will certainly have to carry on a tough fight due to delays on implementing the issues in the Resolution of Sri Lanka, it has the benefit of being able to announce the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons, and the progress it is likely to make. The larger issue facing the country is that of internal politics that has little regard for international relations, and in fact keeps pushing the country into tougher situations with the international community, forgetting the near isolation the country was pushed into by the previous government of the Rajapaksas, in complete disregard of the need for a good judicial process in the country.
While the recent Kandy violence rings in Geneva, Police reports now confirm that of the 314 persons arrested with regard to the violence, are five members of the SLPP - the Pohottuwa breakaway from the SLFP, and unofficially led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is reported that of those arrested, 205 are from the Kandy District and 109 from other areas, the latter showing an organized move in carrying out this violence. What is necessary is speedy legal action against those arrested in this regard, bringing the necessary punishment under the law to prevent such violence in the future.
The situation that took place in Ampara and Kandy also calls for necessary steps to be taken to prevent the use and spread of Hate Speech in the country, as well as its use in social media in a manner that spreads the hatred much faster than hitherto possible. This should certainly not be looked at as a means of controlling or silencing social media; but as a means of educating social media users of their responsibility to society, especially in the building of peace and understanding through quick and good communication.
The government could benefit from the huge international criticism of Facebook over the wrongful use of user information, amounting to at least 50 million, by Cambridge Analytica to benefit Donald Trump in the 2016 Presidential poll, and elections in other countries, too. Acting with the necessary respect for the Right to Information and Media Freedom, the government should quickly move to a public discussion on the role and content of social media in the context of an expanding democracy, and aware of the role of social media, especially Facebook, in our own future elections. The matter is already the subject of a major debate in Indian politics – involving both the BJP and the Congress Party.
No Confidence
As Geneva diplomacy and the post-violence in Kandy remains situations of importance for the government, the theatre of local politics has now moved on to the No Confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is the leader of the UNP. Much of the boasting by the Joint Opposition (JO) has quietened with the 55 members who have signed the motion handed over to the Speaker, including only 4 members of the SLFP in government. Another disadvantage, possibly tactical, was former President and SLFP leader, and now MP from Kurunegala, Mahinda Rajapaksa too not having signed the motion.
The UNP group in Parliament has already passed a resolution to support Premier Wickremesinghe on this issue. They are 104 members in a House of 225. The Prime Minister has already had a meeting with President Sirisena on both the politics and the government aspects of this motion. With the motion to be taken up for debate on April 4, the government and JO are certainly moving to a period of hectic political activity, which will in conclusion point to the future structure of the Unity Government.
President Sirisena who has gone to Pakistan for the Independence Day celebrations there, has not yet carried out the second half of the Cabinet shake-up, regarding the SLFP members of the government. There is little doubt that despite all the noise of the JO and Mahinda Rajapaksa, there is a considerable agitation within the SLFP, with regard to its future position as a political party. The JO will be expecting the SLFP members in government to come out in support of the Pohottuwa by the time of the coming Provincial Council polls. The SLFP members in government will also have to come to a firm decision on this, as they would otherwise not get SLPP-Pohottuwa nominations at the next General Election, come 2020.
SLFP divisions
This is the whirligig of politics within the SLFP, driven by the uncertainty of its own position within government and the unofficial opposition of the JO. There are signals that if the No Confidence issue moves to a division within the SLFP, beyond the four members who have already signed it, some key members would extend their support to the Prime Minister, with better assurances for the next General Election than with the Pohottuwa.
The SLPP and Rajapaksa also face a problem of public support for this No Confidence move, as it has excluded the failure of the government to act against the corruption of the previous government - the Rajapaksa Regime - which was the pledge given to the people in August 2015. The Central Bank Bond issue although being hugely corrupt, many do not consider it to be a corruption that should cover up all the corruption that led to the Rajapaksa defeat in 2015.
These are certainly matters that President Sirisena, the formal leader of the SLFP, should give serious consideration to, with or without any plans to contest the next Presidential Election in 2020. The Politics of Numbers, in the context of Parliamentary seats certainly stand in favour of PM Ranil Wickremesinghe, today but, the Politics of Figuring is certainly an area of vast uncertainty on the future of the Unity Government. It is necessary to take note that sections of civil society that played a key role in electing the Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena in Jansury 2015 and the UNP majority coalition in August 2015, have already begun organising their own plans for the future of both electoral and politics and future changes in the political structure.
In this context, the JVP’s idea of the abolition of the Executive Presidency may have much greater resonance among the public, than many political parties may now accept.
Irony of time
Mahinda Rajapaksa must be pleased that he may have given Chinese President Xi Jinping, the idea of running for life as President of his country, and displeased about what he did here for himself with the 18th Amendment, being taken away by the forces of democracy.
