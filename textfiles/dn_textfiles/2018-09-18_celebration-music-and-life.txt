Celebration of music and life

With 30 years of experience in music and a record number of audience turnout in their concert held last year ‘Country Roads’ South Asia’s longest running concert series for children is set to hold their show for this year at Mount Lavinia Hotel on October 20 at 6.30 pm.
Cutting the 30th anniversary cake 
With an unprecedented audience turnout, leading to Rs. 1.27 Mln being raised for children’s causes last year, ‘Country Roads’ continues its journey in enthralling music enthusiasts as well as rasising funds for a good cause by touching the lives of the poor and needy.
The 2018 show will be headlined by the Mavericks from Germany as well as UK’s Astrid Brook. The Mavericks will comprise a five-piece band including a fiddler to enhance their country sound. Local favorites like Cosmic Rays, Anno Domini and the Country Revival Band with Feizal and Jury will also be featured.
Another highlight of this year’s event will be the release of a special edition 30th anniversary Country Roads Music CD, which comprises 20 songs from musicians based in six countries including Germany, China, UK and USA. 13 songs out of the 20 are originals. A limited run of only 300 copies will be produced and anyone who donates in excess of Rs 1, 000 to Country Road for this year’s charities will be given a copy as a gift.
Speaking to the media at the announcement of ‘Country Roads’ 2018 concert Country Roads Music Foundation President and Country Roads concert series organizer Feizal Samath said that this year’s event is reflective of the many years of good work done by the Country Music concert series.
“We have reached a countless number of needy children and helped them on this journey of ours. Volunteerism has played a key role in the series’ success. It has been an amazing experience organizing this event annually and getting the feedback,” he said.
Donating all its proceedings to children related charity causes, the event looks forward to continue its acts of goodwill by raising a mammoth sum for this year as well. Proceeds from the 2017 concert, amounting to Rs. 1.27 million, were contributed to Nildiyawara Prajamula Society (a village society) in Mahawilachchiya, Gamini Public School in Mahawilachchiya, Kiula Kiyawana Gunaya Free Classical and Folk Music Class in Hambantota, Give2Lanka Batticaloa, Horizon Lanka in Mahavillachiya, PREDO, a community service NGO in Hatton, ESCO Batticaloa, and Pimbura Primary School in Agalawatte.
