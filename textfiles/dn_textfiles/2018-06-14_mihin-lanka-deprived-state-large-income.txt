Mihin Lanka deprived state of large income

Mihin Lanka Airline Company has deprived the state of a large portion of its income by importing large stocks of foreign liquor including whisky, watches, jewellery and other items duty free.
This was disclosed before the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged fraud corruption and misuse of state funds and other assets at the hearing held on June 11.
It was also disclosed that these items had been brought into the country along with aircraft spare parts which were imported duty free breaching conditions laid down by the Bureau of Investment.
Asked by Commissioner, retired Appeal Court Judge A. G. R. Amarasekara as to why this situation which prevailed since 2009 was not monitored by the BOI, witness BOI Director Gamini Jayatilleke said the BOI had a special monitoring unit to handle this matter.
It was also disclosed that goods valued at Rs. 334.6 million had been imported and bought locally without import duty from March 7, 2007 to September 21, 2012.
More goods to the value of Rs. 154.3 million had been imported duty free directly from September 21, 2012 to December 31, 2016.
Witness Gamini Jayatilleke made this disclosure before the Commission under cross examination by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe.
