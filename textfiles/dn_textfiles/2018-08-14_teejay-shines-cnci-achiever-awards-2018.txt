Teejay shines at CNCI Achiever Awards 2018

Teejay Lanka’s Deputy General Manager – Internal Audit, Hemantha Mannaperuma and Manager Operations – HR & Admin, Tharindu Dissanayaka receive the Top 10 Achiever award from Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Silver Award in the Extra Large Category of the Manufacturing Sector from State Minister of National Policies and Economic Affairs Dr. Harsha de Silva.    
Teejay Lanka PLC, Sri Lanka’s only multinational textile mill and the region’s largest textile manufacturer, recently won a Top 10 Achiever Award and the Silver award in its category, at the CNCI Achiever Awards presented by the Ceylon National Chambers of Industries (CNCI).
This is the second consecutive year that Teejay was recognised for industrial excellence at this prestigious awards event. The Company received the Silver Award at National Level in the Extra Large Category of the Manufacturing Sector, besides securing a place among the Top 10 Corporates honoured. Teejay Lanka won the National Level Bronze Award in the same category, last year.
These awards underline Teejay’s standing as one of Sri Lanka’s leading manufacturing entities, and acknowledge continual achievements and contributions to its sector and the national economy.
The recent expansion of Teejay India, leading to doubling of production capacity in India and increasing the overall manufacturing capacity of the Group to US Dollars 210 million, and the Company’s initiatives in lean manufacturing contributed towards winning these accolades.
Teejay’s Quality Circle Award presented by Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement of Quality and Productivity; being bestowed the Compliance Certificate at JASTECA Awards 2017; and being recognised at the Taiki Akimoto 5S Awards Competition 2017 were also contributory factors, the Company said.
Commenting on the awards won, Teejay Lanka Deputy CEO, Pubudu De Silva said: “Teejay has established its dedication to not just being a renowned knit fabric solutions provider, but also an innovative and ever-evolving manufacturing brand focused on quality, being socially responsible and highly efficient.”
One of the region’s largest textile manufacturers, Teejay supplies fabric to some of the best international brands across the world. Teejay Lanka PLC is a public quoted company with 39 per cent public ownership.
