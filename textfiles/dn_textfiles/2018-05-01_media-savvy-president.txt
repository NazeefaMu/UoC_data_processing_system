Media-savvy President

The Seventh SAARC summit held in Dhaka in April 1993 over, Bangladesh President Abdul Rahman Biswas hosted a state banquet in his official residence in honour of the outgoing chair of the SAARC, Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The media corps from Sri Lanka who were in Dhaka to cover the important event too were invited to this state banquet as the guests of President Premadasa.
Observing a traditional protocol germane to the occasion, at the inception, the Bangladesh President introduced his guests to our President and presently it was President Premadasa’s turn to introduce his guests to the Bangladesh President and that country’s Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.
Amazing memory
Addressing the Silumina Poetry Awards ceremony audience
There were over 30 media personnel from Sri Lanka representing electronic and print media invited to the event and this writer was among them as the Daily News representative.
We all queued up to be introduced to the Bangladesh President and the Prime Minister and President Premadasa began doing the honours.
My friend Suresh Perera from The Island was ahead of me in the queue and President Premadasa introducing him to the Bangladesh President and the Prime Minister said: “Meet Mr. Suresh Perera, an outstanding journalist from Sri Lanka!”
Then it was my turn to be introduced to the Bangladesh President and the PM. Our President introduced me by name adding a similar complimentary comment about me.
What amazed us all on this occasion was President Premadasa’s uncanny ability to remember the names of all media personnel who accounted for most of his guests and add some appropriate complimentary remark when introducing each of them!
Journalist friends
The late President knew practically all leading journalists in print and electronic media so closely he used to address them by their first name. Some of such journalists were longstanding friends of his.
Premadasa was not a leader who had a meteoric rise to the highest office in the country under fortuitous circumstances. He started his public career as a social worker at Sri Sucharitha Vyaparaya, he himself founded was the vehicle he used for carrying forward the activity of his movement. During the initial stage of his career as a moral rearmament activist he closely moved with poets, writers, and artistes and years later as a powerful authority, he extended his ready patronage to them by taking concrete steps to serve their causes.
It appears that the late President began cultivating good relations with the Press and the journalists after making his debut into politics as a member of the Colombo Municipal Council. Maybe that he did not go out of the way to befriend journalists, but chance meetings with them over the years as the Deputy City Mayor, an MP, a Minister, Prime Minister and finally as the country’s Head of State, no doubt, led him to win their affection and goodwill.
“I wanted to be a journalist like you!”
As the Daily News reporter assigned to cover the late President Premadasa from the time he was appointed Prime Minister up to the day of his tragic demise, opportunities came in the way of this writer to know always something new about his cherished aspirations in life.
Most journalists who had occasion to maintain a close rapport with the late President may endorse this writer’s view that the great man had some kindred feeling towards journalists and media in general. This writer recalls in this context something the late President told him during an informal brief chat he and a colleague of his, Saman Chandranath Weerasinghe, had with the great man at his private residence at Dias Place, Colombo where he lived even after becoming the President. Asked what kind of a career would he have taken to if he did not become a politician, he replied after a moment’s reflection, “Someone like you! A journalist! I had a hankering to write poetry and features on various topics from my young days. But that’s as a hobby. A career is different. I would have been happy if I could become a journalist like you!”
Soft corner for journalists

By the way, Premadasa had brought out in print several books in prose and verse as a social worker and he had written his better-known work, ‘Peramaga Lakunu’ in 1976 after entering active politics. This work embodies the great man’s vision of national development.
It is a well-known fact that President Premadasa took a personal interest to help journalists who sought his help. And many journalists took advantage of his soft corner for them by obtaining apartments in urban housing schemes he himself took the initiative to set up.
He had gone out of the way to offer a flat in the city to even a newspaper cartoonist who had been caricaturing him day in and day out to give weight to critical comments being made about him as a matter of editorial policy of that newspaper.
He seldom missed the funeral of a journalist or that of a family member of a journalist. This writer still remembers well that the late President took the trouble, despite being on a tight election campaign schedule, to attend the funeral of his Dinamina colleague Piyaratne Colombage who was killed in a road accident at Padukka in 1988. This incident occurred at the height of JVP insurgency and many of Colombage’s colleagues could not attend the funeral due to the difficulties that resulted from the highly tense situation.
Janatha column
Perhaps, the late President’s first significant tie with print media goes back to the days when he built up a rapport with the rate-payers in the city by answering queries raised by them as the Deputy Mayor through a popular column run in the Lake House Evening Daily, Janatha.
Perhaps, there had been no political leader in the country’s recent history who made use of the media so much to build his own image and to communicate with the masses as the late President Premadasa.
Media rapport
Says the late President’s Press Secretary S.J. Anthony Fernando in a commemorative article carried in a national English Weekly a few years ago: “Premadasa knew the importance of media in communicating with people. He always maintained a healthy rapport with the media…”
The late President had also realised the value of media not only as a medium through he could communicate with people and share their pulse but also as a source which could provide him with important information about various glaring shortcomings in his administration. Whenever he spotted a news story highlighting a shortcoming in his administration or a serious problem that the people in some part of the country was facing, he got his aides to send the cuttings of such stories to Ministry secretaries and departmental heads concerned for immediate remedial action.
First to read newspapers
Anthony Fernando also says in his commemorative articles: “…Evans’ and my work was made easier because it was President Premadasa himself who was the first to read the newspapers at 4 in the morning.” He adds: “very often he would chide us saying, ‘I say, I have become the Press Officer too.’”
So, it was the first citizen in the country who was the first to read the day’s newspapers as a general reader!
It is a well-known thing that the late President, a regular early riser, would wake up political and administrative authorities in the wee hours to discuss important issues highlighted in the newspapers.
President Premadasa would very often contact the newspaper Editors and News Editors himself to compliment about a news story or a news feature he was pleased with or to make a clarification of a matter referred to in a news story.
Premadasa here!
Here, this writer recalls how an incident where a telephone call from President Premadasa received at the News Desk of the Daily News one day gave rise to a humorous situation.
The time on the day in question was about 7.30 in the morning and I had just walked into the editorial. By this time only one or two editorial staffers had turned up at the News Desk. Staff photographer Roland Perera who was pacing up and down, on seeing me nodded to me by way of greeting.
“You are to go out on an assignment, Roland?” I asked him.
“Yes, AS. I am supposed to go with Wijesekera. I am waiting for him. We are already late. I can’t understand why the hell is he getting late!” Roland sounded exasperated.
Meanwhile, the telephone on Deputy Editor N R J Aaron’s table started shrilling.
“Ah! That must be him!” said Roland and took the receiver and was answering the call.
“Good morning, thama! Mama mehe thamuse ei kiyala kochchara Welabalagena unnada! Den wedeta parakkuth wediy!” (How long had I been waiting for you here. Now we are almost late for the assignment!)
Roland’s angry tone suddenly changed into a meek and humble tenor.
“Ane, Sir, mata samawanna! Mama hituwe ape Premadasa Wijesekera kiyala!” (I beg your pardon, Sir. I thought I was speaking to our Premadasa Wijesekera.)
When Roland turned to me, there were beads of sweat on his forehead and he was a picture of utter shock and dismay.
It was with the greatest difficulty that we later got out of him the cause behind his flabbergasted look.
The caller had been none other than President Premadasa and as usual, he had said: “Good morning. Premadasa here!” And Roland was in such an angry and impatient mood that he immediately mistook him for his colleague Premadasa Wijesekera.
The late President had immediately recognized Roland’ s voice and had explained that he wanted to speak to the New Editor or some other responsible executive.
Two-pronged strategy
The late President Premadasa followed a two-pronged strategy in building a close rapport with the masses of the country: by meeting the people in their villages in person and at public functions and addressing them through the mass media. In fact, he would proudly declare very often: “There is no village in this country which I have not set my foot on.”
Media attraction
However, he depended more on media to familiarize and educate the masses on his pet development and good governance programs.
As the Prime Minister and the President of the country, practically every day he was out at some public function somewhere in the country. It could be the opening of a Udagama model village or a new garment factory. At the public rallies held to mark such events, the late President would be the last speaker to address the gathering. It this writer’s personal experience that the peasant crowds would patiently wait rooted to the spot until late hours in the night to listen to their leader’s speech.
He knew that the print media expected him to come out during his address with some sensational or news-making statement which would make either a good page one lead or a page one story. And Premadasa seldom disappointed them.
Administration at the doorstep
This writer remembers President Premadasa depended much on media to create an awareness among the people about the Pradeshiya Sabha and the Divisional Secretariat systems which could be described as his brainchild, on the eve of their introduction to the country.
He made pithy comments at public rallies to send home to the people the importance of these new changes.
Referring to the Pradeshiya Sabha system, he told the people that they would soon get their own Gramarajayas.
Explaining the merits of the Divisional Secretariat system he would say: “We are going to bring the administration to your doorstep.”
Peerless politician
The former top civil servant K H J Wijayadasa who was closely associated with the late President Premadasa as his secretary and even when he was the Prime Minister describes the late great man as an extraordinary man, philosopher, a thinker and a patriot.
As a journalist, this writer wishes to say that with the tragic and untimely death of the late President Premadasa the media in the country lost a peerless great friend.
