Lakmini, First Lankan Entrepreneur Panelist at Ernst and Young Conference

Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of IronOne Technologies and BoardPAC, Lakmini Wijesundera brought prestige to the nation as the first local entrepreneur to be a panelist at the EY Entrepreneurial Winning Women (EWW) 2018 event held in Tokyo recently.
The EY Entrepreneurial Winning Women™ Asian-Pacific programme is an exciting leadership platform for selected dynamic female entrepreneurs who are founders of the region’s leading high-growth companies helping them to sustain and accelerate their potential.
In recognition of her status as a leading regional woman entrepreneur, and contributing architect in tech disruption, Lakmini had also created history previously as the first Sri Lankan to attend the Ernst Young Top Women Entrepreneur 2017 Programme and Conference.
This year Lakmini attended the EY EWW 2018 conference as a panelist and once again earned the mantle of being the first local entrepreneur to represent the nation at such a panel.
Participating in a vibrant session titled ‘Business Transformation through the Power of Digital’, three outstanding business leaders including Lakmini share their insights on creating a digital strategy today to be effective tomorrow.
Participating at the panel were Sakie Akiyama, CEO and founder of Saki Corporation, Phyllis W. Newhouse Founder CEO of Xtreme Solutions, Inc., and Annette Kimmitt, Asia-Pacific Program Executive, Global Growth Markets Leader, EY who served as the moderator.
Contributing her view point, Lakmini spoke on how organizations embrace digital transformation and its success in relation to human adoption. Lakmini pointed out that the success of any digital transformation comes down to human adoption, human interface and how humans interact with technology, while senior executives need to be educated on the importance of embracing technology paying attention to the requirements of stakeholders.
“As the first Sri Lankan entrepreneur to participate in this prestigious event and showcase Sri Lanka has been a true honour. I firmly believe this will open doors for many other local women entrepreneurs to become a driving force in national development,” Lakmini said.
As a pioneering digital entrepreneur having built unique and high impact businesses, Lakmini successfully drives both BoardPAC and IronOne Technologies. To-date, these companies operate across 20 countries across the globe.
BoardPAC is a globally commended multinational providing board meeting automation solutions to over 20,000 users across the globe. The company is recognised as the preferred choice for Board meeting automation among a multitude of fortune 500 companies.
Lakmini’s other accolades include winning the national award for Woman Entrepreneur of the Year, and recognition for her contribution to exports in Sri Lanka. She is also a Board member of Give2Lanka, a non-profit organization creating awareness amongst corporates and individuals about donating to impactful and well managed charitable projects.
