We will develop Matara city - JVP mayoral candidate

Matara Municipal Council JVP Mayoral candidate Nishantha Wickramarathne said past mayors who governed the Matara municipal council had not given priority to the city's important issues "They had failed to give first place to citizens' healthcare requirements,"he said.
He said the mosquito menace has got into critical proportions due to water clogging in the drainage systems. Home gardens are filled with rain water due to roads that have been developed without proper planning.
Modern technology is not used to clear drainage and sewage systems as well as human waste from the city areas. So far the previous mayors have only provided temporary solutions to burning issues in Matara.
"We are urging you not to think about the individual person but to vote us with five years experience to accomplish the programmes we have in store to solve burning issues of Matara citizens.
''We hope that based on the social and economic pressure the public in Matara are faced with now, those who governed the city thus far will be rejected and the power to rule will be handed over to the JVP this time. We pledge to work towards building a healthy and developed city," Wickramarathne said..
