National Shrine of Our Lady of Matara: Feast from September 8 to 10

The National Shrine of Our Lady of Matara celebrates the Feast from September 8 to 10.
Thousands of pilgrims will gather to celebrate the Feast. Mgr. Ned Alles has remarked in 1949 that this shrine will turn out to be a miraculous Shrine in time to come.
Rev Fr Michael Colin assumed duties as the new Administrator and Parish priest of the Miraculous Shrine assisted by Rev. Fr Lasantha Fonseka. The Parish family will see to all arrangements for the convenience of the pilgrims.
The Shrine of Our Lady of Matara is located on the Southern tip of Sri Lanka. The original shrine was the Church of Our Lady of Mahature as Matara was once known. For the past one hundred years, the Miraculous Statue of Our Lady of Matara has rested at St. Mary’s Church Matara. Today, this church stands as a beacon of light to visitors and pilgrims.
The Statue is eighteen inches in height and is of the Madonna and Child. Mary is standing with the Child Jesus upon a pedestal featuring three ocean waves. Three times the Statue of Our Lady has been taken by the sea and each time She returned to Matara. The last time was as a result of the Tsunami. The statue was found three days later.
The statue belongs to the Portuguese type of sculpture of the early 17th century. It is a mystery as to who brought the statue to Sri Lanka, but we are aware that it was in Sri Lanka when the Portuguese occupied the area almost 400 years ago.
According to the story that has been passed down through generations, a huge wooden crate was pulled up by fishermen off the coast of Weligama, near Matara early in the 17th century. When the crate was opened, the statue was found inside untouched by the sea water. The fishermen handed over the statue to the Parish Priest and then placed in the original church of Matara. This was the first time that Statue returned from the sea. Sometime after, the statue had to be hidden due to the religious sanctions imposed by the Dutch, but again it returned to Matara.
Later a cholera epidemic swept through the entire southern district and claimed hundreds of lives. The people of Matara rallied around the statue and prayed for an end to the epidemic. The statue was taken in a solemn procession through the streets of Matara. People of all religions participated. After a few days the area was declared safe by the health authorities. There were no fresh cases and no further deaths. Since then the people has viewed the statue as miraculous.
In the early 1990’s, the First Bishop of Galle, Rt. Rev. Dr. Joseph Van Reith, a Belgian had the statue send to Europe to be restored by a famous sculptor Zeus of Gehent. After restoration, the sculptor placed the statue on the ship “Beachy” to be sent to Matara. The ship was caught in a storm in the North Sea and nearly wrecked. Most of the cargo was destroyed or thrown overboard. The ship made it to Middlesborough before continuing on to Colombo, but not before yet another rough path at sea on part of the remaining cargo was also thrown overboard.
Finally, the ship arrived in Colombo without the statue. The Bishop of Galle wrote to friends in Belgium to try to retrieve the priceless item. The statue was traced to a man in Middlesborough, who demanded money in exchange for the sculptor. When the sum was refused, he damaged the face of the statue and threw it away. The figure was recovered and returned once again to Zeus for repair. The sculptor spends a great amount of energy and time restoring it to its original beauty.
The Holy Hour followed by the Eucharistic procession and Benediction will be held on September 8 at 4.30 pm. On September 9 at 3.30 pm His Lordship Most Rev. Dr Justin Gnanapragasan the Bishop of the Diocese of Jaffna together with the Bishop of Galle will be welcomed. September 10 is the Feast Day. Holy Masses will be held at 4 am, 5 am and 6 am. The Festive High will be at 8am.
Masses will be held at 11.30am, 4 pm and 6 pm for late comers. Thousands of Catholics and non Catholics are expected to gather at the feet of Our Heavenly Mother, seeking her intercession in all their needs and celebrate her birthday.
On September 9, a special train will be in operation from Chilaw (Bangadeniya to Matara). On September 10, a special train will be in operation from Matara to Chilaw (Matara to Bangadeniya).
