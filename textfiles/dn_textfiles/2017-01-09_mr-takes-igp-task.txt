MR takes IGP to task

The IGP who is at the beck and call of all higher ups addressing them as ‘sir’ is insulting the police service by trying to exert undue pressure on the media, Kurunegala district parliamentarian and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking to the media after paying homage to the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates at their temples and received their blessings.Rajapaksa said people should rise up against oppression and policemen in his security detail who took the side of the people had been transferred. The former President said he had not received any invitation so far to attend President Sirisena’s second anniversary celebrations. He said not even an iota of democracy, rule of law or good governance could be observed in the country today.
“The fall of the government is imminent any moment according to the present indications,” he said. He said there was information that three teams from Colombo had been sent to Hambantota by the government to attack and expel the people led by the Maha Sangha who demonstrated against the moves to deprive their ownership rights to their lands.
