Professionals duty bound to pay tax - Mangala

Many professionals such as lawyers, doctors, tuition teachers and architects who have benefitted from the country’s free education system do not give back by paying due taxes, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
“Many professionals render a great service to the country. Therefore, it is important that they pay tax”, the Minister added, addressing a media briefing at the Ministry.
The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) in the meantime had requested that the Finance Ministry provide doctors with an income tax ceiling of 12 percent along with other concessions.
Minister Samaraweera said having looked into their requests, they had decided to increase the Distress Availability Transport (DAT) for specialist doctors as a special case but they would not grant the tax ceiling for doctors,
“On average, a doctor in total makes around Rs.350,000 a month, so it is unfair if they are allowed to pay tax at a lower level.”
“Two months since the implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act, total government revenue has increased by 8 percent,” the Minister said.
He explained that when revenue was compared to June 13,2017 (Rs.256 billion) and June 13,2018 (Rs.276 billion), revenue this year had grown by 8 percent. In addition, in May of 2018, the Department of Inland Revenue had made Rs 5 billion more in income tax revenue than May of last year.
“In the last two months, we have had 69,000 new tax files opened.Earlier we only had a total of 400,000 tax files for a population of 22 million”,” Minister Samaraweera said.
“I am happy that people are voluntarily coming forward to open tax files, he added but noted that there were many more, especially professionals who were not paying tax.
