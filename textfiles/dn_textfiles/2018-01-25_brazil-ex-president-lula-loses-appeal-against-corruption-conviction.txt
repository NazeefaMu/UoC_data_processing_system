Brazil Ex-President Lula loses appeal against corruption conviction

An appeals court in Brazil has unanimously upheld a corruption conviction imposed last July on ex-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
 
While he can still take his appeal to a higher court, the decision could rule Lula out as a candidate for October’s presidential election.
 
The ex-leader, who governed from 2003 to 2011, had been favourite to win.
 
Speaking at a rally in Sao Paulo after the ruling, Lula said he would still contest the presidency.
