Muslim Council of Sri Lanka condemns London attacks

The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka in a statement yesterday condemned the London terror attacks, carried out in the name of Islam.
The organization in a statement issued under the hand of its president N.M.Ameen stressed that the ISIS is not Islamic and does not represent the Muslims or the message and spirit of Islam.
The message: The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka vehemently condemns the three cowardly acts of terror supposedly carried out in the name of Islam on innocent civilians.
“ISIS is not Islamic and doesn’t represent Muslims or the message and spirit of Islam. Islam forbids attacks on innocents, even in battle. ISIS continues to cause terror across the world to provoke a backlash against peaceful Muslims, which would encourage youth to take up terror as a means of revenge.
“We call upon the Muslims of the world to pray for the speedy recovery of the innocent victims who were injured, and who lost their lives. We also extend our heartfelt condolences and pray for the families of the people affected by this horrendous crime’.
