Cathay Pacific  enhances its website

Cathay Pacific has enhanced its website - www.cathaypacific.com - with an all-new online booking experience, providing customers with greater convenience, more choices and making it even easier to use.
The airline’s customer-centric ethos puts the needs of passengers at the heart of every decision it makes as it strives to provide an exceptional experience at all stages of the journey.
The introduction of the enhanced booking process underlines Cathay Pacific’s commitment to using data-driven insights to create personalised services and enables the airline to live up to its promise of a Life Well Travelled.
Featuring responsive web design technology, the upgrade delivers a faster experience by streamlining the booking process, while at the same time presenting customers with increased service and product options in a refreshed, user-friendly layout.
Responsive web design provides optimal viewing and makes an interactive digital experience possible across a wide range of devices – from desktop computer monitors to tablets, with easy reading and navigation features requiring a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling.
In addition to a refreshed look and feel, the booking process includes enhanced seat map displays featuring realistic aircraft seating layouts, allowing passengers to select their preferred seats more easily.
The new experience is now available to Cathay Pacific’s customers in all of its worldwide markets, including the airline’s home base of Hong Kong, Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, New Zealand and the United States.
Cathay Pacific General Manager Sales and Distribution, Toby Smith, said: “We are always looking for ways to improve our passengers’ experience at every stage of their journey, and that includes at the very beginning.
The new system’s improved flow and extra functionality makes it simpler for customers to search for flights and make bookings, whether they are at home, at work or on the move.
