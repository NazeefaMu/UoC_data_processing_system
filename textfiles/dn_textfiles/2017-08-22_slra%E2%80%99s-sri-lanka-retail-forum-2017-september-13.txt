Four sessions will discuss the key areas facing the industry; ‘Changing dynamics of the new consumer’, ‘Reaching the new consumer with digital dynamism’ and ‘Innovation in retail operations’. There will also be ‘Masterclass on emerging issues’.
The forum will take place on 13th of September 2017 and is a ‘must attend’ event for current and budding leaders in the retail industry of Sri Lanka. The Forum is organised by the Sri Lanka Retailers Association (Guarantee) Ltd.

The objective of the forum, which will feature global and local experts, is to provide cutting-edge insights on global retail trends to Sri Lankan retailers, learn from best practices of industry leaders and get inspired to adapt and adopt locally, and identify key turning points that Sri Lankan retailers must latch on to and key pain points that need to be tackled.
