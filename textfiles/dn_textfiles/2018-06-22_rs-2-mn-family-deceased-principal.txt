Rs. 2 mn to family of deceased principal

The Education Ministry made a donation of Rs. two million to the family of former Principal of Suchee National School of Hambantota Rohini Kumari Attapattu, who died in an accident while undergoing a leadership training programme held in the Kurunegala District several months ago.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam handed over the cheque to Thilakaratne Abeysinghe, husband of the late Principal on June 14.
The money was granted to the deceased’s family by the National Insurance Trust Fund as the late principal was a regular contributor to the Fund, the minister added.
