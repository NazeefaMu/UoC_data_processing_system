Surprise in store  for audiences in  ‘Mowgli’

Andy Serkis promised his ‘Mowgli’ will be closest to Rudyard Kipling’s ‘The Jungle Book’, which was set in the dark forests of India, and now actor Freida Pinto has revealed that the home audience will be treated with a “surprise” once the film releases.
The 33-year-old actor, who plays Messua in the movie, says the way Serkis has shot the film is “phenomenal” and Indian-origin actor Rohan Chand has done an excellent job as Mowgli.
“I have been waiting for ‘Mowgli’ to come out. It has been a long wait. It has been three years since we shot for it. So, it is going to be absolutely phenomenal. In terms of performances, Rohan Chand is going to blow everyone’s mind. He is a perfect Mowgli. Specifically for Indian audience, there is a little surprise, which I don’t want to ruin right now. We need to wait just a bit more,” Freida said.
In the film, the audience will see Mowgli try and assimilate himself into the world of humans in an Indian village.
Serkis also voice stars as the fun-loving bear, Baloo and Christian Bale lends his voice to the sombre panther, Bagheera - the man-cub’s friends.
The voice cast also includes Cate Blanchett as Kaa, Benedict Cumberbatch as Shere Khan, Naomie Harris as Nisha, Peter Mullan as Akela, Jack Reynor as Mowgli’s brother Wolf, Eddie Marsan as Vihaan, Tom Hollander as Tabaqui and Matthew Rhys as Lockwood.
