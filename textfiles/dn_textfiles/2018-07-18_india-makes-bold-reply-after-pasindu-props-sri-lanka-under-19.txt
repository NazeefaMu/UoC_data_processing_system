India makes bold reply after Pasindu props up Sri Lanka under 19

India made a sound start in their first innings by scoring 92 for one in reply to Sri Lanka’s first innings score total of 244 on the first day of the first test match played in Nondescripts Cricket Club on Tuesday. Indian skipper Anuj Rawat lashed a half century scoring 63 and was involved in a partnership of 89 with Atharwa Taide’s 26 runs before. Anuj was dismissed by Kalhara Senarathne
Sri Lanka’s first innings of 244 was built on a solid knock of 69 from Pasindu Sooriyabandara and a stroke filled 39 off 55 balls by opener Nishan Madushka and Nipun Dananjaya scoring 39 runs batting at number three. Sndun Mendis survived a confident run out attempt at 39 but failed to score a half century when Harsh Tyagi foxed him into edging a catch to Taide just before tea.
However, the wickets continued to tumble as Harsh Tyagi began to make inroads into the Lankan middle order batting getting three wickets including Pasindu and Sadun followed by the next four batsmen getting out cheaply.
Harsh Tyagi was the pick of the Indian bowlers claiming four wickets for 92supported by fellow spinner Ayush Badoni who ended up with four wickets for 24 runs.
The match will be continued today at 10 am.
