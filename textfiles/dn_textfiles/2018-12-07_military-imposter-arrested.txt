Military imposter arrested

A suspect who had impersonated an Army Major was arrested by the Kegalle Police on Wednesday.
Police said the 45-year-old suspect was a Lance Corporal at the Batalanda Army Camp. He is a resident of Parakaduwa, Ehaliyagoda. The suspect met the Kegalle Assistant Superintendent of Police a few weeks ago in a Major’s uniform. The suspect was to be produced at the Kegalle Magistrate’s Court.
