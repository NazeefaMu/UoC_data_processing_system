Excel Court launches Lanka’s first fully sustainable apartment complex

Developers of Excel Court, Park View Holdings Pvt. Ltd. (PVH) have unveiled for the first time in Sri Lanka, a design for an apartment complex that represents the eco-friendly future of apartment lifestyle known as ‘One Planet Living’.
Located in Sri Jayawardenapura, Kotte, Excel Court has been conceptualized to combine contemporary urban design with environmental sustainability and eco-friendly living. Excel Court brings a deeper meaning to the word luxury by introducing a sustainable framework and building a community rather than a mere concrete structure.
This sustainable development by Park View Holdings is dynamically led by Saliya Jayasuriya in collaboration with a Malaysian company specializing in 5-star hotel interior solutions.
Saliya Jayasuriya, Managing Director of Park View Holdings (Pvt) Ltd,said, “The Excel Court development will also reduce the dependence on crude oil to generate electricity, saving foreign currency over the life period of the solar panels.”
The ‘One Planet Living’ concept at Excel Court encapsulates ten visionary pillars that will secure ecological, economical, social and cultural sustainability. These are 1) Zero Carbon – A 15,000 sq. ft. solar roof generates all the power the complex needs. 2) Local & Sustainable Food is the concept of an urban vertical farm which produces chemical fertilizer-free, pesticide-free, weedicide free fruits and vegetables within the building. 3) Sustainable Transport is car-pooling using freely available emission-free electric vehicles charged with solar renewable energy. 4) Culture & Local Community – involves recruiting a pool of caregivers and drivers to replace the cultural norm of servants. 5) Equity & Local Economy is the availability of meeting rooms and a conference hall. 6) Zero Waste – Waste will be recycled, composted and used in the vertical gardens and farm with excess sold as organic fertilizer. 7) Health & Happiness – Organic food 8) Sustainable Water – Harvested rain water and recycled water is used for the vertical gardens and farm. 9) Sustainable Materials – Alternative aggregates to river sand make the walls soundproof, heat and fire retardant and reduces the carbon emissions of the building further. 10) Land use & Wildlife – The vertical gardens around the building will help protect and enhance the natural habitats for birds, bees, micro wildlife and butterflies, making sure the ecological balance is not disturbed.
