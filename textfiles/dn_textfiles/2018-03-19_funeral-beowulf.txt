The Funeral of Beowulf

As Seamus Heaney tells us in Stepping Stones: interviews with Seamus Heaney (2008), he was first asked for a translation of Beowulf by the editors of the Norton Anthology of English Literature in the mid-1980s. Although he made a start, he began to wonder, after 100 lines or so, whether he’d be “fit for the long haul” and it wasn’t until 1995 that he felt able to return to the task. In the introduction to the 1999 Faber edition of his translation, he suggests a number of reasons for this change of heart: his discovery of the closeness of certain Ulster dialect words to their Old English roots, particularly “thole” (“to suffer”) which comes from “olian” – a fact that became “the secret fulcrum of the whole exercise”; the crucial decision to translate the first word “hwæt” as “so” to get the poem off on the right idiomatic foot; and his recognition that one of his earliest poems, “Digging” (1996), follows the rules of Anglo Saxon metrics – lines of balanced halves with two stressed syllables, linked by alliteration across the caesura. Part of him, he realized, “had been writing Anglo-Saxon from the start”. Coming soon after he began teaching at Harvard and was hearing the “unmoored speech” of some contemporary American poetry, the commission would also be a way of ensuring that his “linguistic anchor” stayed “lodged on the Anglo-Saxon sea-floor”.
There is a tension in translation, of course, between the poet’s need to make a poem sound convincing to himself and the obligation to respect the feel and sense of the original: as Heaney says, any translation sits “half-way between a crib and an appropriation”. But he admits that the set-text nature of the Norton Anthology made him even more aware of this pull, which we can see and hear, perhaps, in some of the changes he made to this extract – the magnificent set-piece of Beowulf’s funeral – before the poem was published in its final form.

The Funeral of Beowulf (Beowulf, lines 3137–3182)
In memory of George Mackay Brown The Geat people built a fire for Beowulf, stacked it four-square from the ground up, and hung helmets on it, as he had instructed, surrounding it with war-shields and shining mail.
Then his warriors laid him in the middle of it, mourning a lord who had been far-famed and beloved.
On a height they kindled the biggest ever funeral fire; fumes of woodsmoke billowed darkly up, the blaze roared and drowned out their weeping, wind died down and flames wrought havoc in the hot bone-house, burning it to the core. They were disconsolate and wailed aloud for their lord’s decease.
A Geat woman too sang out in grief; with hair bound up, she unburdened herself of her sorrows, telling again and again of the dread that possessed her: her people invaded, enemies on the rampage, bodies in piles, slavery and abasement. Heaven swallowed the smoke.
Then the Geat people bagan to construct a mound on a headland, high and imposing, a marker that sailors could see from far away, and in ten days they had done the work.
It was their hero’s monument; what remained from the fire they bestowed inside it, behind a wall as worthy of him as their workmanship could make it.
And they buried torques in the barrow, and jewels and a trove of such things as trespassing men had once dared to drag from the hoard.
They let the ground keep that ancestral treasure, gold under gravel, gone to earth, as useless to men as it ever was.
Then twelve warriors rode around the tomb, chieftains’ sons, champions in battle, all of them distraught, chanting in dirges, mourning his loss as a man and a king.
They extolled his heroic nature and exploits and gave thanks for his greatness which was the proper thing for a man should praise a lord who is dear and cherish his memory when that moment comes when he has to be conveyed from his bodily home. So the Geat people, his hearth companions, sorrowed for the lord who had been laid low.
They said that of all the kings upon earth he was the man who had been mildest and gentlest, the kindest to his people and the keenest for renown.
