116th Battle of the Blues starts at Matara today

The preamble to the laws of cricket states that 'Cricket is a game that owes much of its unique appeal to the fact that it should be played not only within its Laws but also within the Spirit of the Game and any action which is seen to abuse this spirit causes injury to the game itself' and hence it is hoped that both teams would uphold the spirit of the game when St Servatius College host St Thomas College at the Uyanwatta Stadium for
the 116th edition of Matara's Battle of the Blues on the 25th, 26th and 27th of March!
This call is made as the game was shamed by a few players in the final few minutes of the 114th encounter in 2014 and the one day encounter last year (2015) between these two prestigious colleges in Matara !
The Servatians led by Ashen Deemantha this season play in division one of the schools cricket tournament and have an edge in this three day encounter, but the gritty Thomians led by Nimantha Kavishwara who play in division two of the schools cricket tournament are capable of holding their fort.
St Servatius were placed fourth in group C of the Schools division one tournament with out right wins against Holy Cross College Kalutara and Anuradapura Central College. They won on first innings against Dharmasoka, Gurukula and Lumbini while conceeding the first innings to Isipathana and Richmond. No decission was reached in the match with Moratu Vidyalaya. St Servatius reached the semi final stage of the division one tournament. The semi final match played at Uyanwatta had to be called off on the second day due to on field player agreesion before a result was reached.
St Thomas College playing in group C of the schools tournament registered outright wins against Devapathiraja, Asoka Vidyalaya and Tissa Central College Kalutara while registering first innings wins against Kegalu Vidyalaya and Sri Jayawardenapura College Kotte. The Thomians lost outright to Wesley and Karandeniya Central College to end fourth in their group with 103.76 points.
