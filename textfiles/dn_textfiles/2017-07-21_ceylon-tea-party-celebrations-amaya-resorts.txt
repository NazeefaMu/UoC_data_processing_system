Ceylon Tea Party celebrations with Amaya Resorts

Sri Lanka celebrated 150 years of Ceylon Tea on July 5th and to mark this grand occasion the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Tea industry hosted a tea party at 5pm in every time zone creating a 24 hour chain across the world.
Amaya Resorts and Spas too participated in this Ceylon Tea Party and was more than happy to show it’s appreciation for the tea that has made it’s stamp around the world and satisfied so many tea lovers and given the country the title of producing the best tea. The resorts – Amaya Beach, Amaya Lake, Amaya Hunas Falls, Amaya Hills and Amaya Langdale, hosted a High Tea at each of their resorts.
To mark this grand occasion Maliban Biscuits made two special biscuits, Earl Grey and Ginger biscuits with 150 years imprinted on it, which were served to the guests. Along with these biscuits, each resort served its version of High Tea with some mouth-watering finger foods and cakes pairing it with a perfect cup of Ceylon tea.
The guests from each and every Amaya Resort truly had a wonderful time and even got a little history lesson as to why our Tea is considered the BEST in the world.
