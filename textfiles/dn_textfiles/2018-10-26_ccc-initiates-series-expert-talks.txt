CCC initiates a series of Expert Talks

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) Young Leaders are initiating a series of Expert Talks, and its inaugural session will be held on October 29.
This Expert Talk Session will feature Sujit Christy, Director, Layers-7 Seguro Consultoria Ltd., sharing his expertise on how to ‘Preserve Your Privacy and Security in the Internet of Things’.
As the world becomes increasingly connected and the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand, consumers’ concerns about the hot-button issues of data security and privacy are deepening. The proliferation of connected devices coupled with consumer unease sends a clear message that in order to build trust, organizations must address privacy concerns, safeguard data and be open and honest about how personal information is collected, used and shared. Protecting data privacy is critical in today’s global digital economy; as such strategies are needed for enabling consumer trust and enhancing reputation and growth.
This Expert Talk will offer solutions to some of these challenges and also discuss the issue of more widespread education and communication of threats and how they might be better managed to preserve privacy and security. It will particularly benefit executives of the banking, insurance, logistic, and IT industries.
Sujit Christy is governance, risk and compliance professional, passionate information and cyber security adoption evangelist. He is a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA), Certified in Risk and Information System Control (CRISC) and a certified IT Disaster Recovery Professional.
He is also a regular contributor to the “know security” column in a weekly paper, Sri Lanka.
