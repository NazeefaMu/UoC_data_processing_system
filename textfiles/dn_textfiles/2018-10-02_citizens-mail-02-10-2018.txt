Kudos to Health Minister
I greatly appreciate Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna’s instructions to the Ministry Secretary to suspend the salaries of medical staff who did not report to their service stations on transfers.
All underdeveloped hospitals in rural areas are running short of doctors and other medical staff. Most of our poor sick people are suffering due to lack of adequate health staff.
Some of doctors and medical staff in developed areas get used to earn more and more money after their usual work in government service. Therefore minister’s action is reasonable.
