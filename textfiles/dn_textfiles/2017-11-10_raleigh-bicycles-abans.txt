Raleigh bicycles from Abans

Due to the advent of highly advanced technology and heightened urbanization in Sri Lanka, sedentary lifestyles have become progressively prevalent throughout our society.
Abans, along with Raleigh, has chosen to offer attractive and durable bicycles that provide us with a stronger incentive to maintain a healthier lifestyle.
Being a world-renowned UK brand that has been around for more than 100 years, Raleigh has specially designed each bicycle to suit differing intensity levels and road conditions. This enhances the flexibility of Raleigh bicycles so that they can be used for activities ranging from light cycling trips to vigorous mountain biking.
The Raleigh bicycle range possesses stunning aesthetics and innovative features that fully meet the needs of any bike rider. For instance, the MTB Gents bicycle is equipped with a 24-speed shimano gear system and alloy double disc brakes, making the bike ideal for strenuous exercise and long-distance cycling.
Another striking example is the Steel Folding bicycle which can be used by both men and women. Sporting a vibrant orange and white design, this bike is outfitted with a 6-speed shimano gear system, and alloy v-brakes for more efficiency on the road. The bicycle also includes foldable joints which amplifies its portability and mobility, so that you can easily tuck it into the trunk of your car whenever you decide to go for a ride.
Choose to take the next step towards a more active lifestyle by purchasing a progressive Raleigh bicycle from Abans, the exclusive authorized distributor for Raleigh in Sri Lanka.
