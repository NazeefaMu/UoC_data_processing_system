Offensive gesture was 'joke'

London: England's Dele Alli said he was having "a joke" with team-mate Kyle Walker after he was caught on camera raising his middle finger during Monday's 2-1 win over Slovakia. "Just to clarify, the gesture tonight was a joke between me and my good friend Kyle Walker!" Alli wrote on Twitter after the game. "Apologies for any offence caused! Great win 2nite." Television footage of the World Cup qualifier at Wembley showed Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Alli make the gesture in the 77th minute of the game, but it was not clear at whom it was aimed. Pictures and video footage of Alli's gesture were widely shared on social media, but manager Gareth Southgate played down the incident. "Kyle and Dele were mucking about and Dele's made a gesture towards Kyle," Southgate told reporters at Wembley. AFP
