Triple jump record holder left out of awards ceremony

I.M.Mohamed Ashan, who excelled in the triple jump event at the Provincial Level Competition held on August 27, 2016 and bagged the Gold medal by scoring 13.88 metres, has not been recognised at the Awards Ceremony, sources said.
The awards ceremony of the national and provincial level sports competitions in 2016 was held at the Jakerb Park in Trincomalee under the patronage of the Provincial Education and Sports Minister C.Thandayuthapani recently.
All the members of the sports club at Nintavur condemned the injustice meted out to Ashan. He not only won the top award for triple jump but also excelled at shot put. He bagged three gold medals in the Triple Jump and shot put events at school and provincial level competitions.
Sports lovers urge relevant authorities to take actions against the officers who removed Ashan from having part in the ceremony.
