Dortmund stun Bayern in feisty ‘Der Klassiker’

BERLIN: Borussia Dortmund defeated champions and arch-rivals Bayern Munich 1-0 on Saturday in a bad-tempered clash in “Der Klassiker” to leave upstarts RB Leipzig the shock Bundesliga leaders.
Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang prodded in on 11 minutes at Signal Iduna Park to propel Dortmund up to third on 21 points, three points behind Bayern.
But RB Leipzig are top, three points clear of the mighty Bayern, after their thrilling 3-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen on Friday. AFP
