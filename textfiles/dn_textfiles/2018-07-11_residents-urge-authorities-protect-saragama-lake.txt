Residents urge authorities to protect Saragama lake

Residents of Tiththawalla, Kurunegala complain that the Saragama lake in the area has become an environmental hazard, since many irresponsible residents divert household wastage to the lake.
The residents urge the authorities to look into the issue and take steps to clean the lake and punish those who contaminate water in the lake.
The lake is maintained by different authorities from time to time and now the responsibility is on the Irrigation Department, the residents said.
Plans are afoot to convert the lake to a water tank and it is going to be smaller than the lake.
The proposed tank will reduce the beauty of the lake, the residents said.
The Saragama Lake is said to have built by King Prakramabahu of the Kurunegala kingdom.
