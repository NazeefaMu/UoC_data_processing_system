Major boost for Malta Sri Lanka business ties Arrival of biz delegation

Malta-Sri Lanka Business ties will enjoy a major boost in the coming months, with the arrival of a business delegation who participated in a tour of Sri Lanka from May 3 to 8.
The tour commenced with “Malta: Your Gateway to Europe” event at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo in association with the European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka. A video message from Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was telecasted for guests attending the event. Muscat was one of the few leaders to openly support Sri Lanka’s bid to regain GSP plus concessions from the European Union.
Malta’s multi-tier financial firm ARQ sent two top representatives to Colombo, to discuss opportunities for Sri Lankan businesses to access the European market through Malta and strategies to develop overall economic resilience in Sri Lanka. Speakers at the event included ARQ Malta’s senior partner David Borg and Jean Paul Fabri, managing director of ARQ, who was a Commonwealth expert on building resiliency in island states.
“We believe that resilience-building has the potential of ushering a new era of growth in Sri Lanka. Our experience from other small states, primarily Malta, demonstrates that a policy effort towards building resilience can leave long-lasting effects on an economy and society,” Borg and Fabri said in joint statement.
The delegation called on Karu Jayasuriya Speaker of the House at his official residence.
The visit and event was organized by Blue Stone Management (Pvt) Limited and BBK Partnership (Pvt) Limited accounting BPO, which has quickly grown to employ 100 staff throughout our headquarters in Colombo, with offices in Jaffna and Vavuniya.
