‘Multi-millionaire ex - ministers unable to show how they earned’

Most Members of Parliament, after becoming ministers, serve themselves and their families forgetting the people who elected them. Some ministers of the previous regime who remain defeated are multi-millionaires. They find it impossible to show how they obtained such colossal sums of money to become owners of palatial buildings, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a meeting at Badagiriya Hambantota after inaugurating the construction work of the road that leads to the fisheries harbour and awarding of housing loans to low income group fisher folk at Badagiriya.
The minister said when the members of the previous regime were questioned by the CID and other authorities, they said that these palatial buildings are not their properties. “This was the type of ministers we had during the previous regime. These politicians are a shame to other politicians who perform their duties with trust and confidence,” the minister said.
“Today when an allegation is directed against ministers, they do not hesitate to resign from the ministerial posts. But such things never happened during the previous regime,” added the minister.
He said after COPE investigations, a large number of State sector officials were found guilty but none of them were punished according to the rules and regulations of the country.
