Royal will go all out to down depleted Zahira

Royal college Colombo will go out with all guns blazing to down depleted Zahira college when they take on the Maradana school in their Singer ‘A’Division inter-schools league rugby second round encounter at Zahira grounds in Maradana. Kick off will be at 4:30pm.
Reid Avenue boys, one of the strongest contenders this year for the Singer league title will be out for a bonus point win when they meet the wounded Zahira college who will miss the services of their play maker cum fly half Said Sinhawansa, hospitalised due to Dengue and will not play in this match. Incidentally he is the highest points scorer thus far in this years league rugby tournament.
Royal college coached by Isipathana old boy Sanath Martis, should have things their own way in this encounter. Fly half Ovin Askey will lead the Royal college outfit.
Isipathana goes out firm favourites to beat S’Thomas
High riding Isipathana College will go out as the firm favourites againstS’Thomas College Mount Lavinia in their Singer ‘A’ Division inter schoolleague rugby tournament second round match to be played at Havelock Parktoday at 4:30pm.
The Pathana lads have a sensational record in this year’s ongoing league rugby tournament where they won six and only had a surprise loss to the unpredictable Peterites in the first round.
Their cause has been severely bolstered by the presence of their ever reliable forwards along with their speedy three quarter line who are scoring tries at will against all opponents through their famous three quarter moves. On the other hand S ‘Thomas College possesses a good team with play maker and skipper Naveen Henakankanamge can play an outstanding game to bring victory to their school but has been blowing hot and cold and is feeling the sting of the last week defeat they had against arch rivals Royal College, hence this game will be a do or die battle for them aganst the formidable Pathana side.
Can Peterites turn table on Wesley
A close battle for supremacy can be expected today between third placed Wesley College and the giant killers St. Peters college, Bambalapitiya in the Singer ‘A’ Division league rugby tournament second round match at Longden Place, kick off will be at 4:30 pm.
A mammoth crowd is expected at Longden Place to witness this grand game of the 2017 league rugby tournament. Wesley have to force a win to have any chance of clinching the ‘A’ Division League rugby title for the first time as it has eluded them right through out their rugby history.
Today’s match should turn out to be a battle between St. Peters power-packed forwards and Wesley’s speedy three quarters. Peterite forwards have given a terrific display in the loose against unbeaten Trinity last week, where they pulled of a stunning win against all odds to beat the Kandy school by 15-13 and should maintain their supremacy in this game as well to pull off a stunner against the double blues.
