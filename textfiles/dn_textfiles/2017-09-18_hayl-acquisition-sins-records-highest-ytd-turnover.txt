Followed by the large deal on SINS, Crossings for the week (Rs.12.69Bn) amounted to ~86% of total week’s turnover, with SINS & CALF accounting for 73.9% & 7.3% of total crossings.

Following the edge up of tea and rubber prices, we expect some retail interest in Plantation sector over the next week.
Rs. 45bn additional tax revenue from new IR bill
Corporate tax proposals of the Inland Revenue Bill passed in parliament last week is expected to be effective from 1st April 2018 while individual tax proposals is expected to be effective from 1st October 2017.

The Act aims to reduce the gap between direct and indirect taxes by simplifying the tax structure where the multitude of tax rates prevailing in the current law have been rationalized into a three band income tax structure.
Accordingly, corporates in sectors including Banking, Finance & Insurance, Construction, Healthcare will be taxed at 28%, while sectors including Exports, SME’s, Education, Tourism and IT is to be taxed at 14%.
Liquor, tobacco and gaming meanwhile will be taxed at a higher 40%. Threshold for annual PAYE tax has been increased to Rs.1.2Mn cf. to Rs.0.75Mn earlier and monthly interest income of senior citizens has been exempted from tax up to Rs.125,000.00 while their rental income will be tax free up to 25%.
Meanwhile, WHT changes would increase Dividend income by 4% (cf. 10% currently) and the demolition of WHT on government securities (excluding Dollar denominated Development bonds) would draw local and foreign interest.
According to Moody’s, the new Act is anticipated to increase State revenues to help ease off the high fiscal deficits which weighs downs the country’s credit profile, and increase government revenues to 14.7% of GDP in 2017 & 15.0% in 2018.
IMF on the other hand, projects revenues at 16% of GDP by 2021 followed by the successful implementation of the new Inland Revenue Act.
