Hayleys unveils high capacity   solar power plant in Welikanda

Hayleys Group jointly with Windforce commissioned a ten mega watt solar power plant on Friday.
Located in Welikanda in the Polonnaruwa district, the plant has been installed with a solar tracking system that will follow the sun’s rays to ensure an incrementally higher yield of around 20% energy, than the fixed tilt system.
At full capacity, the plant could contribute 22,000 mega watt hours to the national grid plus generate enough electricity for roughly 10,000 homes.
“This is a momentous occasion for us as well as the entire Country. We are happy to dedicate this plant to the nation. A plant of this magnitude reinstates the country’s ambition of transforming itself to a green energy producer and we at Hayleys take pride in doing our part towards this” Hayleys Group Chairman Mohan Pandithage said. 
“Through renewable sources such as this, we could significantly bring down the per household cost of electricity, while adhering and aligning ourselves to the government’s energy policy and plan of meeting the Country’s total demand from renewable sources,” Pandithage said.
The new plant will help nudge Sri Lanka’s total installed Non-Conventional renewable capacity across the 500 MW mark, of which Hayleys Group’s installed capacity of renewable energy alone in wind, hydro and solar, crosses the 50MW mark, according to Dr Arul Sivagananathan, Managing Director, Hayleys Aventura.
Hayleys, plans to obtain carbon credits for this project in partnership with Sri Lanka Climate Fund. A scheme will be set up whereby local businesses and corporates could obtain accreditation to offset their carbon footprint.
