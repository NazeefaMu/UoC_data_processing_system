EDEX Entrepreneur Zone enhanced at EDEX Expo 2017

Sri Lanka's largest education exhibition and job fair, EDEX Expo 2017 conducted by Royal College Union (RCU) will be held at the BMICH, Colombo on January 20.
The main objective of conducting this annual exhibition is to encourage youth to continue their higher studies after school education.
The novel and a significant feature of this year's Expo will be the EDEX Entrepreneur Zone where youth are encouraged to start their own business while providing employment to job seekers.
EDEX Chairman Mahinda Galagedara requested schools and university students and also interested parties to attend the EDEX grand opening ceremony.
Galagedara said three Exhibitions are held in Colombo and Kandy every year and the objective of holding these Exhibitions are to create the awareness of Sri Lankan youth about existing local and international educational courses. He said the exhibition will facilitate spot admissions to selected academic, vocational, technical and professional courses and post graduate programmes.They will be offered by both local and foreign educational institutions.
He also highlighted the promise made by Government to create 1,000,000 new jobs and EDEX could achieve this target.
"We also urge a reforming of the education system that prepares our youth to realise their full potential, academically and socially as youth are not just qualified youth they need practical skills, soft skills and marketing abilities.
Some youth without knowing the importance of higher education leave the country and work as unskilled labourers and housemaids and it is extremely difficult to find young people for construction, plantations, hospitality industries and as a result some are proposing to import foreign workers to sustain certain industries.
"Our work includes providing career and higher education guidance placements, promoting market relevant skills, providing jobs to job seekers, sustainable living and many outreach programmes to offer equity to rural student communities.The EDEX Entrepreneurship Zone launched last year will witness a new enhancement in terms of the innovation theme.
Royal College Principal B.A. Abeyratne said students should know the importance of receiving higher education after the Advanced Level Examination.
“Accordingly, EDEX will immensely help them to follow various educational courses “
He also said it is our responsibility to empower youth, with education, skills development and training, so that they are ready and equipped to make a better tomorrow for themselves.
It is said all educational institutions which tie up with the EDEX organizing committee have agreed to offer discounted course fees , full or partial scholarships and many other offers with financial support options for the benefit students.
Former Chairman EDEX, Kamala Abeysinghe said the Expo will live up to its reputation to be a comprehensive platform offering choices , options in realizing opportunities in school to work transition, entrepreneurship and sustainability. He said large number of students who passed the AL Examination and not selected to universities due to cut-off marks have no idea about other higher studies that they should follow and thanked EDEX Committee to educate children on these problems. The EDEX Exhibition and Job Fair will be open from 10.00 am on the opening day and from 9.00am from January 21 and 22.
