Divided May Day rally will only benefit UNP: Lakshman

 The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has taken a decision to hold the party May Day rally in Galle. It will proceed with the decision although several parties are attempting to go separately, Science, Technology and Research State Minister Lakshman Seneviratne said.
 
Addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday, Seneviratne said if a party member wants to hold a May Day rally separately that would bring direct benefit to the United National Party (UNP) as the party would split into two.
“Hence, it would be considered as a statement made with some other intention which is not supportive to the party. No true party member would initiate such an act,” Seneviratne added.
“The present leader of the SLFP is none other than present President Maithripala Sirisena. It is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa himself who offered the leadership to him to maintain the unity of the party. Therefore, party members should act according to the decisions taken by the leader of the party. There cannot be two leaders in the SLFP,” he said.
The minister added that the Party Working Committee will take action against members who would go against Party rules.
Questioned whether the same rules are applied to the former President, the minister said the present President will hold a discussion with Rajapaksa before taking any action against him.
