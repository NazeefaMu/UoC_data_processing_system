Cinnamon Sweeps National Tourism Awards 2018

Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts swept away six awards at the Sri Lanka Tourism Awards 2018 held recently where they were recognized for the unique initiatives that contributed to the hospitality industry.
Cinnamon was the only brand to win more than two awards in all categories which were intensely fought by all leading leisure brands in the country.
The Sri Lanka Tourism Award 2018 honoured organizations and individuals for their contribution towards Sri Lanka’s tourism industry and Cinnamon was rewarded for excellence in the six categories; The Best Tourism Promotion Campaign, The Best Print Media Presentation on Travel & Tourism, The Best Five Star City Hotel, The Best 3-Star Hotel, The Best Themed Cuisine Restaurant, and The Best Conservationist/ Naturalist Award.
Dileep Mudadeniya, Vice President John Keells Group, Head of Brand Marketing, Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts and CEO Cinnamon Life Mall said, “We believe in creating experiences outside of our core requirement as a hospitality group to present Sri Lanka as the destination for travel for more reasons than one. Sri Lanka, while being known as a tropical island, should now be elevated to a place to visit for entertainment and destination events such as weddings and simultaneously be known as a socially responsible destination. The brand Cinnamon aims to set new standards to hospitality in the country in order to create a unique proposition for Sri Lanka as an island that offers myriad activities for the international visitor.”
The Cinnamon Magazine, a bi-monthly lifestyle magazine, received the award for the Best Print Media Presentation on travel and tourism.
Cinnamon Island Weddings won the award for the Best Tourism Promotional Campaign, as it was the first-of-its-kind promotion that disrupted the global destination wedding industry with a viral, 100% online marketing campaign, going on to penetrate the niche and booming global romantic tourism market.
Chitral Jayatilake, Head of Nature Trails, the award-winning eco-excursion and wildlife conservation arm of Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts was recognised as the Best Conservationist and Naturalist at the Awards.
Starting off as an avid nature photographer, he facilitated many international productions to document Sri Lanka’s rich biodiversity including the BBC’s famed Blue Planet II, guiding Nature Trails into becoming a globally acclaimed operation taking Sri Lanka to the world.
Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo walked away with award for the Best 5-Star Hotel in the Sri Lankan hospitality industry and was recognized for its trendsetting initiatives and for achieving overall excellence in unparalleled standards in product and service, corporate values and sustainable practices.
Cinnamon Red Colombo was awarded the Best 3-Star Hotel, an acknowledgement of its strategy to cater to the demands of the new age travelers–the new millennials, who are in constant pursuit of unique experiences, combining innovation and affordability for a relaxed uncomplicated stay.
