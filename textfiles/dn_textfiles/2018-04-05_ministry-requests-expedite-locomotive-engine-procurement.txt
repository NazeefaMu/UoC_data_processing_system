Aruwakkalu Waste-Management Programme:
Ministry requests to expedite locomotive engine procurement

The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry had requested the procurement of four locomotive engines to transport garbage from Kelaniya to a sanitary landfill site in Aruwakkalu, Puttlam, to be expedited.
The ministry added that the procurement process would take long under normal procedures and hence, Cabinet should look into approving the procurement decision of the Railways Department as soon as possible.
The transport of garbage to Aruwakkalu is seen as a solution to the garbage disposal problem in Colombo. As public opposition mounts to dumping of garbage in landfill sites in and around Colombo, the Urban Development Authority (UDA) under the Megapolis Ministry had taken responsibility to solve the garbage issue in Colombo.
