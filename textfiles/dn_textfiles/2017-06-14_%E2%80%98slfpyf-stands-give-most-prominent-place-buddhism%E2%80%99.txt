‘SLFPYF stands to give most prominent place to Buddhism’

“We are always stand to give most prominent place to Buddhism. It is the responsibility of the government to protect Buddhism while giving due respect and recognition to other religions, SLFP Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara said. He was addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday. He said the SLFP Youth Front has forwarded its proposals for the Constitutional Reforms based on the unitary states of the country, foremost place to the Buddhism, and non mergence of the Provinces.
He said the SLFP’s policy is based on the facts of unitary country, clean politics and sustainable development.
The present electoral system should be changed and a new system should be facilitated to emerge clean politicians to serve the people.
“There should be a stability in economy, politics and defence sectors,” he said. Referring to the recent changes in the Cabinet, he said the final decisions with regard to appointing ministers and deciding their subjects are always taken by the Party leadership.
“Since the Prime Minster decided the UNP ministers’ subjects, the President has to agree to those recommendations,” he said. “It should be considered if there are any detrimental effects on the people and the country by these decisions.
But since the NLB and the DLB are managed by a separate Chairman and a director board, there will be no negative impacts on the people and the country,” he said.
“Even during the previous regime, there were three ministers in charge of coconut cultivation, sugar and minor export crops, while there was a separate Agriculture Minster,” he said.
Kalutara District electoral organiser Asanka Ediriweera said there should be a database with all the details of people living in each Grama Niladhari division maintained by the respective Divisional Secretariat. ‘Then it would be easier to deal with rescue operations and catering to relief needs during a disaster,’ he said.
