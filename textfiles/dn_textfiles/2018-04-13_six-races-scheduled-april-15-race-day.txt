Six races scheduled for April 15 Race Day

A total of 6 races have been framed for 15 April Race Day that includes two Million races namely Race RTC Magic Million sponsored by Sri Lankan Airlines and Shivantha Thambaiyah Million.
Both the Million races are going to be exciting to witness as SriLankan Airlines RTC Magic Million inform horse Alcazaba will be facing a stiff challenge from Mehran who went a brilliant Mock Race on April 1 and Aventus who has been working well in the Morning Trials.
Shivantha Thambaiyah memorial sponsored by Dhiren Nirmalingam would be a very open race with Roswald having the edge over others and 1st April Class 1 & 2 winner Santos might come close if he produces the same style of victory as he did last time.
A total of 46 runners will be taking part in the 6 races framed highest number of runners on one race day at RTC.
And a whopping stakes close to 2.5 million would be given out on 15 April Race day – the highest stakes ever paid in the history of RTC and SriLankan racing.
Amongst the visiting foreign jockeys there will not be any Indian jockeys like Irvan Singh, and A Vishwanath but a Frenchman jockey Charles Perkins who would be making his presence felt at the Royal Turf Club Nuwara Eliya which comes with a good record of winners in France and Hong Kong racing circuit.
