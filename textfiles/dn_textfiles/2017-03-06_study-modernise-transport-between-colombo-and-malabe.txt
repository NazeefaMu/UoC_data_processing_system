Study to modernise transport between Colombo and Malabe

The preparatory study by JICA for the first elevated Light Rail Transit (LRT) line in Sri Lanka between Colombo and Malabe started recently.
The study will address key aspects such as current and projected traffic patterns, environmental and social impacts, economic viability, financial implications, optimisation of the route, inter-modal connectivity, implementation schedules and operation and maintenance systems.
The 25km route which would be covered by the study runs through Malabe, Battaramulla, Rajagiriya, Borella, Union Place, Kollupitiya and Fort.
As a detailed study has been conducted on the route by JICA during the feasibility study for monorail, it would be possible to shorten the period of the new study by using the same data.
The final optimum route would be determined with special focus on environmental and social considerations and inter-connectivity with other public transport modes.
Malabe to Fort is a high priority transport corridor which connects the administrative capital to the business district in metro Colombo. The CoMTrans Master Plan study conducted with JICA assistance in 2012 – 2014 found that the corridor carries the largest number of vehicles and has the lowest speed compared to all other corridors.
It is the one major corridor not served by a rail based public transport mode. The monorail study found this route economically viable if some of the private vehicle users would shift to public transport during the rush hours.
“The government agencies which are responsible for different aspects of land transport would need to coordinate and work towards prioritising public transport to transform Colombo into an advanced city. The government will maintain such policy consistency which would be crucial to provide equitable, efficient, environmentally sustainable and safe mode of transport to all citizens,” JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Kiyoshi Amada said.
