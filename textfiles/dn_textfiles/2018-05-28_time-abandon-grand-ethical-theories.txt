Time to abandon grand ethical theories?

Ethics today is in a curious state. There is no shortage of people telling us that Western civilization is facing a moral crisis, that the old foundation of Christianity has been removed but nothing has been put in its place. Christian writers such as Alister McGrath and Nick Spencer have warned that we’re running on the moral capital of a religion we’ve long abandoned. It’s only a matter of time before, like Wile E. Coyote, we realize we’ve run off a moral cliff, impossibly suspended in mid-air only as long as we fail to realize there’s nothing under our feet.
One supposed sign of this malaise is that scepticism about morality has never been higher. University philosophy lecturers consistently report that their new undergraduates tend to arrive assuming that all thinking people are moral relativists who believe that what’s right for some is wrong for others and that’s all there is to be said for it. Psychology has fuelled this scepticism, with researchers like Joshua Greene arguing that most moral judgements come straight from the “hot” amygdala, not the “cool” prefrontal cortex. On this account, moral principles are post-facto rationalizations of emotional reactions.
Corporate responsibility
Yet for such a sickly beast, ethics is energetically at work everywhere. You may doubt the sincerity of corporate social responsibility but the very fact that every reasonably sized company feels the need to demonstrate it says something about public expectations. “Ethical consumers” used to be a small band of idealistic hippies but now mainstream supermarkets boast of their fairly traded coffee and chocolate.
You can’t actually buy a banana at Sainsbury’s that doesn’t carry the Fairtrade label. In 1997 Robin Cook was laughed at for making the modest suggestion that “our foreign policy must have an ethical dimension”.
Now governments are routinely lambasted when they are seen not to have one. Sexual harassment has gone from being “just one of those things” to a moral failing for which you can lose your job and your reputation. For a nation that has lost its moral compass, we seem remarkably keen to march to an ethical beat.
Social psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists would not be baffled by this apparent contradiction. Many have long believed that morality is essentially a system of social regulation.
As such it is in no more need of a divine foundation or a philosophical justification than folk dancing or tribal loyalty. Indeed, if ethics is just the management of the social sphere, it should not be surprising that as we live in a more globalized world, ethics becomes enlarged to encompass not only how we treat kith and kin but our distant neighbours too.
Theoretical framework
Philosophers have more to worry about. They are not generally satisfied to see morality as a purely pragmatic means of keeping the peace. To see the world muddling through morality is deeply troubling. Where’s the consistency? Where’s the theoretical framework? Where’s the argument?
Sometimes, they have a point. Take ethical consumerism. Desirable though it is that more people are thinking about the moral consequences of their purchasing and investment decisions, too many of these rest upon unexamined assumptions about what really is ethical and what isn’t. Ethical Consumer magazine, for example, scores down companies that invest in GMOs or the arms trade and gives points to those who use vegan or organic ingredients. But many believe GMOs can be positively beneficial to society, organic products aren’t always the most ethical and eschewing animal products doesn’t make a company good. Nor can anyone who is not a pacifist object to selling arms per se.
Although popular ethics is often somewhat loose, it can also be inappropriately precise. Ethical Consumer’s score table for tablet computers, for example, gives the Sony Xperia Z tablet a 2.5 per cent higher ethical ranking than the Google Nexus 7 tablet. In moral philosophy, Jeremy Bentham’s hedonic calculus stands alone and ridiculed for its attempt to measure and quantify goodness. In corporate and consumer ethics, metrics are mainstream tools.
For instance, many organizations spend a lot of money on consultants who offer ethical audits. In principle, this is a very good thing, since you wouldn’t want to take a large multinational or a government agency’s word for its virtue. In practice, however, such audits easily turn into box-ticking exercises. Rather than measuring how good the organization is, they merely measure its ability to satisfy whatever criteria are set down. This introduces an unhelpful legalism into the process: just as many organizations feel justified doing anything as long as they avoid breaking the law, so they can end up believing they are good just because they haven’t breached their own or their sector’s codes of ethical conduct.
Philosophical ethics
There is then a curious combination of incoherence and vagueness about just what it is to be ethical, and a bogus precision in the ways in which organizations prove themselves to be good. All this confusion helps fuel philosophical ethics, which has become a vibrant, thriving discipline, providing academic presses with a steady stream of books. Looking over a sample of their recent output, it is evident that moral philosophers are keen to show that they are not just playing intellectual games and that they have something to offer the world.
Malcolm Murray’s Morals and Consent, for example, directly addresses the supposed crisis about morality’s foundations in a post-religious world. His opening sentence, “A morality rooted in the indefensible is worse than one rooted in the defensible”, is as clear and succinct a justification for his attempt to put ethics on a sound footing as you could demand. Like most moral philosophers working today, Murray offers a purely naturalistic account of morality, offering a version of contractarianism – the theory that morality is an implicit acceptance of mutual obligations and prohibitions – that emerged for evolutionary reasons. - Times Literary Supplement
