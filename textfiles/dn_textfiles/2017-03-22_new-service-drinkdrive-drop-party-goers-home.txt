New service  'DrinkDrive' to drop party goers home

An innovative new transportation service is working to save lives and encourage Sri Lankans to take the responsible route home.
First launched on Christmas Eve, 2016, DrinkDrive is a unique platform that provides professional chauffeurs who drive clients safely home in the client's own vehicle at a reasonable rate. The chauffeurs arrive in pairs and as one drives the client home, the other follows on motorbike.
The service was first conceptualized in response to rising incidents of accidents and fatalities caused by drunk driving. Over 2,800 fatalities were reported in 2015 alone in addition to a further 7,700 critical accidents. Seeking to provide a convenient and safe alternative, the new service enables users to ensure their safety and that of their friends and loved ones, without having to sacrifice their nights out, or pay for expensive alternative transportation. DrinkDrive is rapidly gaining traction in the Sri Lankan market, having already attracted over 2,000 members since launch. With demand soaring, the company is now working to launch a Loyalty Card for return clients and for customers who register themselves via the DrinkDrive website. Customers and employees are both provided with equal respect at DrinkDrive, and the Company actively seeks to promote a culture based on mutual respect and understanding. In this manner, the Company's employees are also encouraged to be a part of the success of DrinkDrive and its vital mission to save lives. Drivers interested in signing up with the Company are encouraged to submit their registration details through the 'Careers' page of the DrinkDrive website.
DrinkDrive is a subsidiary of OMBC Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. Supported by partners in Qatar and Sweden, OMBC also maintains a presence in the domestic tourism industry through its subsidiary, SriLankaGate. More information from www.drinkdrive.lk.
