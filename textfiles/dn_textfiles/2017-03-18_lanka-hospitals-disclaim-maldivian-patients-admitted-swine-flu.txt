Lanka Hospitals disclaim Maldivian patients admitted with swine flu

Lanka Hospitals Group Chief Executive Officer Dr. Prasad Medawatte yesterday, rejected claims circulating in social media that Maldivian patients diagnosed with swine flu admitted to the Lanka Hospitals have died.
Lanka Hospitals wishes to announce that only 12 Maldivian patients had been admitted currently at Lanka Hospitals, out of which 10 are surgical and 2 are medical patients; none with swine flu.
Further, the GCEO stresses that the rumours are malicious and defamatory aimed at tarnishing the positive image of the hospital. The GCEO adds that Lanka Hospitals continues to serve its patients without any disruption.
