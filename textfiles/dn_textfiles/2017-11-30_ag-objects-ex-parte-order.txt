AG objects Ex-Parte order

Additional Solicitor General Dilrukshi Dias Wickremasinghe PC appearing on behalf of the Attorney General raised objections for delivering an Ex-Parte order regarding the writ petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
“It is necessary to give notices on the respondents prior to delivering an Interim Order. I may be permitted to make my submissions prior to delivering this order. There are no provisions to issue an Interim Order without giving notices to the respondents,” ASG Wickremasinghe said.
Wickremasinghe made these remarks before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, a moment before the court delivered an Interim Order regarding the writ petition. Wickremasinghe said she was appearing in Court after reading a newspaper report, that Court is to deliver an Interim Order. She said the Attorney General will make submissions to vacate this order, on the next date.
