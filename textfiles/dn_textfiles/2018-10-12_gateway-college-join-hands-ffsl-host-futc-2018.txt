Gateway College join hands with FFSL to host FUTC 2018

The International Schools’ Football Under 20 Championship (FUTC 2018) will kick off on the 15th of October with the final scheduled for October 28 at the newly opened Gatway Football Field at Ratmalana. Twelve TISSL (The International School of Sri Lanka) teams will participate in 3 groups with the top two teams from each group and the two best 3rd places progressing to the quarter finals. TISSL is the Association of the Premier International Schools in Sri Lanka.
This year, for the first time, Gateway College will organize the Under 20 International Schools Football Tournament in collaboration with The Football Federation of Sri Lanka. Since its inception in 1997 Gateway has offered the highest global standards in academics as well as sports.
Football has a large fan-base within the school and interest for the game has spiked in the recent past.
As such the school has invested in a large property in Ratmalana, which houses a football field of the highest standards where this tournament will be staged. This year the school will partner with the Football Federation to organize an exciting event for Under 20 players of the TISSL schools.
In May 2014 the Federation organized the first Under 19 schools football tournament which gives promising school athletes an opportunity to become national stars. Gateway College was among the four international schools that participated in that inaugural event.
A memorandum of understanding will be signed between Gateway College and The Football Federation of Sri Lanka, who will henceforth jointly organize this annual event.
“We need to see more schools participating and I am expecting to promote more young teams through our federation in future,” said Anura De Silva, President Football Federation Of Sri Lanka at the press briefing held at the FFSL Auditorium.
Dr. Harsha Alles, Chairman Gatway Group stressed that whether the teams win or loose must have a good dicipline and its a new begining and also we must promote the game among other schools too. The Gatway Graduate School support the event for the youngsters to show their talents with higher standards he said.
