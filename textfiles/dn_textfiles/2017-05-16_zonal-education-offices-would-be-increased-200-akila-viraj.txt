Zonal education offices would be increased up to 200: Akila Viraj

By abolishing the existing system of maintaining Divisional Education offices countrywide, only Zonal Education offices would continue functioning in the future. Accordingly, the number of zonal education offices would be increased up to 200. Presently, only 98 zonal education offices are now functioning countrywide, said Kurunegala district UNP parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
“Since the expected services and goals are not achieved from divisional education offices, steps would be taken to do away with them,” he said.
The minister was addressing the Kurunegala district Coordinating Committee Meeting held recently in Kurunegala. He added that he would discuss this issue with the respective PCs too before implementing this proposed decision. Minister Kariyawasam further said that it has been found that there are excess teachers at many national schools and all these excess teachers would be transferred to Provincial Council schools to fill the existing vacancies for compulsory subjects at remote schools by now.
Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, NWP-PC Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake participated in this meeting.
