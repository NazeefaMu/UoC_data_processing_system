India to make Test debut at Pallekele during tour

SLC releases official tour itinerary :
India will play their first ever Test match at the Pallekele International Stadium when they make a full tour of Sri Lanka from July 26-September 3.
Since Pallekele first hosted the first Test in 2010 only five Tests have been played there so far against West Indies, Australia (2) and Pakistan (2).
The Test at Pallekele will be the third and final of a three-Test series and is scheduled to be played from August 12-16.
India will open their tour with the traditional first Test at Galle on July 26-30 followed by the second at the SSC from August 3-7.
Pallekele is also scheduled to host two of the five ODIs (2nd on August 24 and 3rd on August 27).
Sri Lanka and India have played only one ODI at this venue in 2012.
