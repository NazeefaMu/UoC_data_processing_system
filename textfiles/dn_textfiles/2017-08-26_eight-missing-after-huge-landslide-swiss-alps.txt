Eight missing after huge landslide in Swiss Alps

SWITZERLAND: Eight people are missing after a landslide hit a Swiss Alpine village close to the Italian border. Around 100 people were evacuated from Bondo and several other communities in the Val Bondasca region as the rockslip struck on Wednesday.
Police have said German, Austrian and Swiss citizens are among the missing.
A number of buildings were also destroyed by the river of mud and stone.
An army helicopter has been called in to help with the search for the missing.
An alarm system, which was introduced after a similar mudslide five years ago, allowed time for the evacuation.
Graubuenden police spokesman Markus Walzer said the cause of the mudslide was not yet known.
The weather had been good in recent days, he added.
