Sponsors can help bring in more fans

Greetings islanders and here we are at the kickoff weekend of another intense rugby season ...a season that promises absolutely everything in the middle for the 80mins... and little room for players still trying to upgrade their fitness, both mentally and physically.
Matches: CH v Kandy, Havies v Police
Army v Navy, Air Force v CR
Two weeks ago we watched tradition ....step up ... with the captain's game ...the younger CR team, outlasting a new look CH team, full of names and hopes...looking to make their own history before X’mas.
Rugby fans will be licking their proverbial lips, anticipating huge impact stories both in Kandy and Colombo.
Questions burning holes in all experts’ portfolios...
1. Can Kandy defend their league title this season under Gayan Weeraratne?
2. Will CR or Navy be dominant again after many moon?
3. Is it Havelocks on the silverware this year ...big guns still a force perhaps?
4. What's all the fuss and glam about a new look CH?
Naturally I am not of pundit or expert origin ...rather a former player still mighty keen about our island game and more curious George about the level of conditioning....how strong the warrior and how good the mind under pressure?
The season is, by definition, a massive stretch ...each game a real tester as Kandy discovered at the Racecourse against CH ...it's all on performance and effort on the day ...in the middle.
The battle upfront was unforgiving...the boilerhouse boys solid set, evenly shared by both front rows ...and it was only their ruck and maul game that outdid CH in the last quarter. Kandy are endowed with the luxury of Sri rep players from head to toe ...it’s hard to defend that level of quality ...especially their backs ...Roshan Weere at 9, Fazil M at 10, Gayan Weere and Danuska Ranjan at 12, 13, Ritchie D on the right wing and Williwara the left ...all runners, all finishers ...the entire national 7s Line to boot!
This is a nightmare lineup for all defence and counter attack plans ...give these boys any dirty ball under the most comprehensive drift plan...they will still punch major holes and hound goal lines with relentless efficiency.
It is difficult to anticipate many defence lines holding strong for all 80 minutes...so it’s just a matter of time before the lions and defending champions score.
Fundamentally, Havelocks or CR are probably likely to give threshold capital boys a run for their eco friendly money ...and round 1 presents some tantalizing possibilities... All sides are vulnerable under pressure. which means patience, both in attack and defence ...a great asset to have in possession.
Packweights will be key in the last quarter...as set play will be a much planned matter ...quite well handled by both set of 8s ...if anything the scrum half skills, our point of difference.
On that note, its absolute skill and efficient speed at 9, that will change all that ...the quality of Weeraratne and Sooriyabandara, a luxury to behold and shudders for those trying to close them down.
Coaches generally like to think their base is safe and all options in hand ...that gives them freedom to plan their attack and defence game ...in numbers and zones ...both 22m areas, their speed zones ...finishing being the elusive grail right from the kick off to the final whistle ...the coaching staff a little shy to dream too much …especially if you are playing a superior Kandy, Havies, CR or Navy.
Weekend 1, panned out quietly but surely, very much according to plan ...with the predicted teams, pushing past to record fairly decent wins and some relief...
Kandy, Havelocks, CR, and Navy all shaping past to win game 1 and enjoy their socials ...if that assurance remains for week 2 is very different indeed, as the quality of opposition will change all the dynamics…and last week’s win and confidence ...merely a thought at the start of the new Dialog rugby league and nothing else.
Each weekend will carry a comprehensive set up and line up as a serious test, whatever the teams playing at home or away.
Traditionally all the forces team, by definition, carry superior fitness among their squads, in the first 4 weeks...call it Defence Services syndrome ...slightly in contrast to the club sides, still fighting rusty muscles and better breathing recovery in the weeks ahead …this has its own sense of logic and tough for those analysts trying to make sense of the big teams current performance levels.
All considered ...professional club rugby is starting to upgrade their set up and the playing environment is certainly a far cry from 2 seasons ago.
The level of professionalism and player wellness, a bigger focus and a critical part of the transfer process this year.
Teams are counting the days in defined anticipation, as to when they get to reveal their new look lineup ...New captain's skills in leading hopes and ambitions out each weekend...but most of all the ever magnetic chance of winning the confrontation...some magical scores and greatest of all …the execution of their game plan and substitute recycling ...that changed their eventual result ...assuring a decent W for the home team and their die hard supporters.
My parting thought to the entire rugby family of islanders...who will be adrenaline charged for their home team ...what can Dialog do with Sri Lanka rugby …to make the match an unforgettable experience for all us fans, give us more interaction, and the opportunity to meet our stars in the middle? A genuine fan zone, memorabilia, signed merchandise and match pictures autographed and available....this might pull in the numbers and finally see Colombo crowds match the enthusiasm and fanatical loyalty the Kandy boys enjoy and thrive on.
Aloha rugby fans ...let's get closer, understand the nature of this great game and enjoy the warriors this weekend.
It's only going to get more intense and more compelling...Cheers islanders.
