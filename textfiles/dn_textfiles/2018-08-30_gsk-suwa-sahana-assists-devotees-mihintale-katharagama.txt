GSK Suwa Sahana assists devotees in Mihintale, Katharagama

GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) brands Panadol and Iodex recently hosted Suwa Sahana initiative in Mihintale and Katharagama. 
In line with Panadol and Iodex’s brand promise of not letting pain get in the way of life, the Suwa Sahana initiative by GSK has been helping pilgrims to Mihintale and Katharagama and other religious and cultural sites for nine consecutive years
GSK’s Suwa Sahana program took place from June 26-28 in Mihintale, at the Archaeological Museum and from July 25-28 in Katharagama, in the area between Kiri Vihara and Dewalaya.
Relief was provided to pilgrims in the form of foot and head massages, as well as other therapeutic sensorial experience.
Additionally, Panadol was prescribed free of charge by pharmacists stationed at dedicated Suwa Sahana stalls. Free samples of Iodex balms and Iodex headfast were also provided at the location. All this allowed the Suwa Sahana stalls to serve as a de facto first aid and pain relief zone, accessible to anyone in need during the pilgrimage. 
Speaking about the meritorious Suwa Sahana initiative, SmithKline Beecham Sri Lanka Chairman and Managing Director, Sunil Mehra said, “Having built a deep and abiding, longtime trust within Sri Lankan households, Panadol and Iodex have undoubtedly become an important part of their everyday lives. Taking into account the significant role that religious pilgrimages and spirituality play in the national psyche, we are pleased to have come forward once again to improve the lives of the devotees via our Suwa Sahana Pain Relief Zones. It is also important that these efforts tie in to our core principle of giving back to the community.”
Hosted by its popular Iodex and Panadol brands, GlaxoSmithKline’s Suwa Sahana program positively impacts the lives of millions of Sri Lankans annually. Due to the immense community service benefits resulting from Suwa Sahana projects every year, GSK intends to continue and even build on this important corporate social responsibility program over the foreseeable future.
