Increase in cigarette sales

The number of cigarettes smoked in Sri Lanka annually was higher in 2016 and 2015 than 2014. Cigarette sales in 2014 were much lesser than in 2015 and 2016, Executive Director of Verite Research Dr. Nishan De Mel said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said that in 2014, 3,560 million cigarettes were smoked in Sri Lanka, but, in 2015 the number had increased to 3,960 million. In 2016, the figure stood at 3,790 million.
“Smoking should be reduced by at least 25 percent. The profit of the cigarette company has been increasing faster than the tobacco tax income increase of the Government. A formula should be introduced as soon as possible to decide the tax on tobacco,”De Mel said.
ADIC Executive Director Pubudu Sumanasekara said that people have not resorted to smoking beedi after the increasing in cigarette spices as stated in certaon media reports. There are cheep cigarettes in the market. It is a daunting task to make the Finance Ministry and certain media institutions realise the truth about the tobacco industry,” he added.
