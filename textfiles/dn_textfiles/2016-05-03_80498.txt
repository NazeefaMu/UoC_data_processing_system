‘MR needs human shield like Prabhakaran’

 
 Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa needs a human shield just like late LTTE Leader Prabhakaran did during the last stages of the war, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa said.
Addressing media during a press briefing at the Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry in Colombo yesterday he said military personnel cannot be provided to the former President to travel around the country to topple the government. Military protection cannot be provided to the former President because there is no war in the country now. Only police protection can be provided to him similar to any other politician as in any other country.
According to Minister Soysa, the SLFP Central Committee took a decision to let a section of the SLFP to remain in the opposition because the government is not completely an SLFP led government and there is a need for an opposition. But holding two separate May Day rallies cannot be approved on any ground. The SLFP lost two elections because of racism and there will be no transactions between the SLFP and racists in future.
Minister Soysa pointed out that the National Government will continue for a certain period to achieve certain targets and thereafter the leaders of the two main political parties will decide whether to continue the partnership or to go on their separate paths.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga governed the country with one majority seat with the assistance of the JVP and the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa took 18 UNP MPs to the government to end the war.
This is not the first time it happened in the country's history.
