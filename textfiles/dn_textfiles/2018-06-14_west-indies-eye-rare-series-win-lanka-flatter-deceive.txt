2nd Test starts at St Lucia’s today
West Indies eye rare series win  as Lanka flatter to deceive

GROS ISLET, Wednesday: With a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, the Darren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in St Lucia could witness something momentous when West Indies take on Sri Lanka in the second Test here starting on Thursday. And it's not just Sri Lanka reuniting with the venue they famously flagged off fifteen years ago; it's as much about the hosts having a sniff at a series win, something so rare that it's trumped only by the compliments for a perpetually rebuilding Windies side.
2012 was the last they won a home series against a team other than Zimbabwe and Bangladesh -- both of whom were overwhelming also-ran, and not without a reason. It's about time for an encore for the Windies, and with an evolving batting order (read: Shane Dowrich) and upgraded confidence (read: Kieran Powell), they look ready to do it against better sides.
Which brings us to Sri Lanka, who deserve a thorough interrogation. Long gone are the days when you could hit the Caribbean shores and be allowed to suffer a misfortune, returning with scars -- not necessarily metaphorical -- telling the tale of a lesser player than you assumed yourself to be. You don't come here now and lose. Not anymore. You aren't playing the great West Indies, which is what makes Sri Lanka's loss to the Windies modernistically ordinary.
Kusal Mendis broke through with a stunning second-innings hundred while Lahiru Kumara impressed with his hostile seven wickets in the game, both the players recompensing for the team even in a loss. Those positives aside, what could knock them sideways is the absence of Angelo Mathews, who has returned home for personal reasons. Dinesh Chandimal, in light of this, will need to take up a more mature role that demands immediate binning of that half-cocked slog he played in the second innings.
