Point of view
Negative investor sentiment continued to drag domestic equities, with markets losing ground for the 3rd consecutive week to close at an YTD low 6,354.92.
The benchmark ASPI lost 46 points (0.72%) over the week (cf. 67 points loss in the previous week) to close the week below the key 6400-mark for the 1st time in 5 months.
Continued losses in local markets were driven mainly by lackadaisical buying interest by investors, with investors showing higher selling interest than buying interest which was reflected in the activity levels on the bourse.
Activity levels on the CSE consequently hit a 3-week low as turnover declined 46% W-o-W to Rs.2.8Bn (cf. 5.2Bn).
Daily average turnover subsequently declined to Rs.0.57Bn (cf. 0.97Bn YTD daily average) with JKH accounting for 29% of the weekly turnover and Sampath Bank accounted for 16% of the week’s turnover.

The low activity levels were primarily due to poor participation levels by Local Institutional and HNI investors who remained on the sidelines this week.
Crossings for the week accounted for just 31% of the week’s turnover with blue-chip JKH accounting for the majority (67%) of the week’s crossings.
The continuous drop in Index value meanwhile converted the YTD return on the ASPI to negative (-0.2%), while the YTD loss on the more liquid S&P20 SL index widened further to 3.6%.
Foreign investors however, indicated interest towards Sri Lanka’s relatively undervalued equities, and net foreign inflows for the week amounted to Rs.0.6Bn, reversing last week’s net outflows of Rs.1.4Bn.
Foreign investors have poured in Rs.0.8Bn into the CSE so far in Jun’18 (reversing the net outflow of Rs.0.6Bn in May), and this has helped support Q2’18 net foreign inflows to the Bourse which have improved to Rs.1.9Bn (cf. outflow of Rs.2.6Bn in Q1’18).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for cues from further economic and political developments.
IMF approves the 5th disbursement under EFF
The IMF this week approved the 5th tranche ($252Mn) under its Extended Fund Facility with Sri Lanka, adding that the country continues to make important progress under the program, with major achievements including the initiation of the new Inland Revenue Act and energy-pricing reforms.
The IMF added that the authorities’ efforts to improve the policy mix through fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy, and landmark structural reforms are supporting the economic recovery, despite recent shocks.
The Group noted, that sustaining this reform momentum remains critical if the country is to strengthen its resilience to shocks, particularly given the ‘still sizable public debt and low external buffers’.
The IMF also welcomed the Sri Lankan authority’s recent approval of an automatic fuel pricing formula, adding that this was a ‘major achievement towards reducing fiscal risks’ from loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
The Group added however, that an automatic pricing formula for electricity along with a restructuring plan for Sri Lankan Airlines, and further strengthening SOE governance and transparency remains vital for a continued fiscal reform process.
The Group also encouraged the CBSL to continue to manage the monetary policy prudently despite the price shocks and market volatility while continuing the efforts to improve international reserves with exchange rate flexibility as first line of defense in response to volatile global capital flow.
The IMF estimates Sri Lanka’s GDP growth in 2018 at 4.0% while inflation to stabilize around mid-single digit.
