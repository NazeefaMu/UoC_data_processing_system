Ring in demand

Wealthy Chinese and Russian couples snap up replicas of Princess Diana’s ring

Wealthy Chinese and Russian couples are behind a surge in demand for replicas of Princess Diana’s iconic sapphire and diamond engagement ring.
Orders for the famous ring, which Prince William gave Kate Middleton, have soared, according to the Royal family’s favourite jeweller.
Garrard, which made the original piece ordered by Prince Charles, said there had been ‘a significant uplift in sales’ in recent months.
Chief executive Joanne Milner said: ‘The Diana ring is our most popular piece of jewellery.
‘In one week alone in December, we had three orders for them and had to work flat out to make them in time for Christmas.’
The surge in popularity has been put down to the spending power of the growing Russian and Chinese middle classes. The 14-diamond and 12-carat sapphire ring was reportedly worth £28,000 when the Prince of Wales picked it out in 1981. In today’s money it would cost around £108,000,
The jewellers behind the classic ring will not make an exact replica, but rather similar versions – the smallest of which costs £5,000. The jeweller’s chief executive added: ‘We would never make an exact replica because we treat that ring like a bespoke piece and every bespoke piece is strictly a one-off.’
Yet Diana’s ring was not strictly bespoke as Charles chose it from the Garrard’ s catalogue - possibly because it reminded him of a sapphire and diamond brooch bought from the jeweller’s by Prince Albert for Queen Victoria. (Daily Mail)
