Nutty matter!

Individually they’re tiny, but together they’re giants. Jackie Chan’s Mr. Feng is the ultimate weapon in the new poster for ‘The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature’. But whatever you do, don’t call him cute!
Surly Squirrel (Will Arnett) and the gang are back. We are once again in Oakton where the evil mayor has decided to bulldoze Liberty Park and build a dangerous amusement park in its place. Surly and his ragtag group of animal friends band together to save their home, defeat the mayor, and take back the park.
‘The Nut Job 2’ also features the voice talent of Katherine Heigl (The Nut Job), Jackie Chan (Kung Fu Panda 3), Peter Stormare (Penguins of Madagascar), Bobby Cannavale (Ant-Man), Isabela Moner (Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life), and Maya Rudolph (The Angry Birds Movie).
‘The Nut Job 2’ will begin screening at MC Colombo, Empire Arcade, Liberty Lite and City Cinema Mt. Lavinia (4.15pm) for the August school holidays from August 11. It is a 3D film and is a CEL release.
