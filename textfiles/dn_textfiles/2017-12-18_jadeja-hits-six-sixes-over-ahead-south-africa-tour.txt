Jadeja hits six sixes in an over ahead of South Africa tour

NEW DELHI, Saturday: Swashbuckling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja smashed six sixes in an over in a local cricket match, sending selectors a reminder of his short-form prowess after being omitted from India’s recent Twenty20 squads.
Jadeja scored 154 off just 69 deliveries in his explosive innings during a district-level T20 game on Friday in India’s western Gujarat state, including a total of 10 sixes.
The 29-year-old left-hander has been left out of India’s one-day and T20 squads of late, last playing the shortest version of the game at international level in July against the West Indies.
However, he has been a match winner for India in Tests -- a format in which he is currently ranked second in the world among all-rounders.
Only four batsmen have ever achieved the feat of hitting six sixes in one over in first-class or international matches.
India’s Yuvraj Singh and South Africa’s Herschelle Gibbs recorded the sixes in international cricket, while Gary Sobers and Ravi Shastri did so in first-class games.
However, Jadeja’s innings will not be added to that list as it only came at local level, between Jamnagar and Amreli districts.
A wily left-arm spinner, Jadeja is expected to play a key role when India tour South Africa in January for a three-Test series.
India will also play six one-day internationals and three T20 matches in the tour, for which squads have yet to be announced.
