NCCSL against death penalty

The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) yesterday expressed its regret over the decision to implement legislation applying the death penalty to individuals found guilty by law for drug-related offences.
The NCCSL reiterated its continued opposition to the death penalty and wishes to place on record its stand on this important matter, the statement said.
