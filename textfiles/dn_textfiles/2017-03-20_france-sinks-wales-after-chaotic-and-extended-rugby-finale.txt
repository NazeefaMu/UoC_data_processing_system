France sinks Wales after chaotic and extended rugby finale

PARIS, Saturday - France beat Wales 20-18 thanks to a converted try by Damien Chouly 20 minutes after full time had elapsed following an extraordinary and chaotic finale to their Six Nations match on Saturday.
The clock showed 99 minutes and 55 seconds when replacement flanker Chouly dotted the ball down after nine penalty scrums, and Camille Lopez slotted over the conversion as France saved, like Wales, their place in the second pot ahead of the 2019 World Cup draw.
France ended the championship in third place with Wales finishing fifth.
Wales had victory in their sights when Leigh Halfpenny's sixth penalty gave them a 18-13 lead but France won a five-metre penalty scrum with one minute left. Eight scrums later, after Wales prop Samson Lee was shown a yellow card and a series of controversial incidents including a biting allegation, France finally got over the line for the second time.
“I'm an old man but I had never seen anything like this,” said France coach Guy Noves, who responded angrily to a reporter suggesting Wales winger George North had been bitten in stoppage time.
Noves bit his hand and said: “Look, there's a bite mark, here.”
There was also confusion surrounding late replacements with France prop Uini Atonio being substituted by Rabah Slimani. “I was told he was injured so I took my responsibilities,” said Noves when asked if the substitution was tactical. – Agencies
