Another 10,000 houses for plantation sector

Air India starts Colombo to Varanasi flight for Hindu devotees :
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday assured 10,000 more houses to the Plantation sector and the extension of the 1990 Indian Ambulance Service to the rest of the country as he promised the Tamils of Indian Origin community that India, “would continue to be a part of the onward journey” of Tamils of Indian Origin and work tirelessly along with the Sri Lankan Government towards their “social upliftment in all possible ways”.
“Air India has also started a direct flight from Colombo to Varanasi in India, to make it easier for Hindu devotees seeking pilgrimage there,” the Indian Prime Minister said.
The Indian Prime Minister also hoped that Sri Lanka would be an active participant in celebrating International Day of Yoga next month.
Addressing a large gathering of around 35,000 people who had trekked 5 km up a hill to the Norwood Sports Complex in Dickoya, Modi observed that he was the first Indian Prime Minister to have visited the plantation community.
The highlight of his visit to the Estates was to open the refurbished 150 year Dickoya Base Hospital. At a generous grant of Rs.1,200 million from the Government of India, the hospital is expected to cater to around 300,000 people in the area; of whom 80 percent work in the plantation sector. The hospital, which would be the second largest in the Nuwara Eliya District was welcomed with great appreciation among the audience who make up one of the poorest communities in the country. Only 8 percent in the community, according to the Department of Census and Statistics own a house and the Indian Housing Scheme has built 4,000 houses thus far.
To the community of ‘Tamils of Indian Origin’, Modi acknowledged their labour and contributions made to the country, “Ceylon Tea is famous the world over but what is not known is that it is your sweat and toil that makes it the brew of choice for many in the world,”he said.
“Sri Lanka is the third largest exporter of tea, because of your hard work.It is your labour of love that makes Sri Lanka able to meet 17 percent of the world demand of tea and bring in USD 1.5 billion in foreign exchange into the country,the Prime Minister continued.
As the community nears 200 years since its first arrival in the country, Modi remembered their “forefathers; those men and women of strong will and courage, who undertook the journey from Indian to Ceylon. Their journey may have been uphill and the struggle hard but they never gave up. Today,we remember and salute that spirit,”he said, while he added that the community had also to fight hard to win their rights and uplift their welfare thereafter but they did it in ‘peacefully’.
“We will never forget, Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, who fought for your rights and upliftment”, he added to great cheer and applause and observed that the Indian Tamil community had adapted well to Ceylon, “You are a children of the Tamil mother but Matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala,” Prime Minister Modi added.
“There is no better sign that a multilingual society living in peace and harmony and that calls for celebration and not confrontation, Premier Modi said.
“We take much joy in the success of the Indian origin diaspora across the world”, said the Indian Prime Minister and he hoped that the relationship across the Palk Strait could be further nurtured to ultimately contribute to the uplift of all Indians and Sri Lankans.
