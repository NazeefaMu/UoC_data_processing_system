‘Deathstroke’: movie in the works

DC villain Deathstroke is getting a solo movie for himself at the Warner Bros studios. Reportedly, director Gareth Evans of ‘Raid’ fame is in early negotiations to helm the standalone movie based on the assassin.
The movie would serve as a starring vehicle for Joe Manganiello, who was earlier attached to feature as Deathstroke in Ben Affleck-directed solo Batman film. It is doubtful if the actor will still appear in the movie, which is now being directed by Matt Reeves.
No deals have been closed with Evans or Manganiello yet.
Deathstroke was created by Marv Wolfman and George Perez and first appeared in DC Comic ‘The New Teen Titans #2’ in 1980.
The character has a grudge against Green Arrow but his original enemy was the Teen Titans. PTI
