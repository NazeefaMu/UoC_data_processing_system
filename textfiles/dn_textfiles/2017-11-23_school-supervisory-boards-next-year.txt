School Supervisory Boards from next year

Kurunegala District UNP Parliamentarian and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said his ministry will set up School Supervisory Boards to monitor school management, administration and the management of physical resources.
These Boards would be set up with effect from January 2018.
The objective is to regularize and update the quality of education in government schools.
The minister was speaking with the Daily News in Kuliyapitiya, Kurunegala, yesterday.
Accordingly, all government, private and international schools countrywide would be supervised by the officials of the newly formed Supervisory Boards, Minister Kariyawasam said. “All infrastructure facilities and human resources would be provided next year without any shortage to remote and urban government schools. More school leavers would be directed towards vocational training courses to qualify for local and foreign jobs.
About 500,000 unemployed youths who passed out from schools recently after completing their Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations would be directed to follow professional vocational training courses next year, the minister said.
