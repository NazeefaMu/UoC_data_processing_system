Voice of Heart

Sheron Nanayakkara is perhaps one of the only female Sri Lankan radio presenters to have the opportunity to present a morning show on a foreign radio channel. While many Sri Lankans are employed in Dubai as domestic maids and other trades, she has succeeded in taking the country’s reputation to a very high level, by having been selected to present the morning show on Dubai radio channel Heart 101.7 from Sunday to Thursday from 6 am to 10 am.
She does not sound like an announcer regardless of whether she is reading from a script or ad-libbing, she sounds like she is talking to you naturally, as if she was sitting right next to you having a conversation.
With a well-rounded intelligence she carries herself in a stately and unafraid manner. She is secure in knowing what she wants in her career and in being emotionally intelligent she has the ability to keep her eyes on the bigger picture turning obstacles into opportunities.
On-air media superstars are those with the natural ability to communicate. Being natural starts with sounding natural, not by trying to emulate someone you admire. For Sheron Nanayakkara announcing and radio was a lifelong dream that came true.
Having always dreamed of being a radio presenter, she got her opportunity to get into radio straight out of school. “E FM was looking for presenters and I called them up and told them I was interested. I had two interviews with them and I was hired. I Joined E in 2004 and was with them until 2008,” she told the Daily News.
Not being confined to radio, she joined Radio One, which ultimately became Prime Radio and started her TV career in 2010. She also presented the morning show on Prime TV, which was a part of ITN.
Her smile and bubbly nature makes everyone around her cheerful and being behind the microphone on radio or facing the camera on TV, for Sheron, it all came naturally.
Speaking to Daily News on how she chose her career path, she said, “As a little girl I used to practise how to do interviews in front of my mirror. I always wanted to be on radio and television.”
Being an adventurous and independent person, Sheron was never one to miss out on an opportunity. Having got the chance to move to Dubai, initially for a short stint, she jumped at the idea. Eventually she left Sri Lanka and decided to pursue her career options in Dubai. “I left SL and moved to Dubai, and got into Real Estate, as my mom had her own real estate company when growing up. Negotiating and sales is in my blood. I was in real estate for four years and by the time I left for Sri Lanka, I was the Leasing Manager in a leading real estate company in Dubai and had a team of 11 to 15 agents working under me,” she said.
Having met her life partner in Dubai, Sheron found all the more reason to continue her stay there.
“I was privileged to get back into radio in Dubai last November. That too, is to do a morning show with two other presenters for a brand new station. My voice was one of the first voices to be ever heard on the station.
It’s been an honour ever since, as I do represent my country, in a place where Sri Lankan’s are known to be domestic maids,” she added.
Her fluency in handling the English language always raised questions as to whether Sheron was educated overseas. But according to her, Sri Lanka is where she had gained her education throughout her life. However, she loves to read during her spare time and is also an ardent cricket fan, who would never miss a game, if Sri Lanka is in it.
“I’m often asked which country I was raised in or where I moved to do my studies, and for me, it has always been Sri Lanka. And yes for me cricket is my first love and no matter where I live, I will always support my country and I am proud to call myself a Sri Lankan,” she noted.
When asked if Sri Lankans living in Dubai contact her through her radio programme, she said, “I do get loads of messages from the Sri Lankan community living in Dubai, as most know me from Sri Lanka. It’s an over whelming feeling to be in a place where I can represent my country to a wider audience.”
Sheron has also had several rare opportunities that most Sri Lankan presenters have not had. For instance, she has had the privilege of interviewing some of the top entertainment personalities.
“In my short span here, I have interviewed Ricky Martin, the Singing Dentist, RedOne, and Brian McFadden from Westlife and Keith Duffy from Boyzone.”
Having come this far in her chosen field, for Sheron her success is her own. She had to work her way up to reach her dreams. Speaking of her journey to where she is today, “No one has helped me to get to where I am today, except my family especially my mom. It’s all the hard work I put in from day one. I know it’s a cliché to say “ follow your dreams” but that’s exactly what I did, I had many setbacks, and mostly of people dragging me down, but I had my eyes on a dream and I knew I wouldn’t stop until I live my dream. And this is it. I am living my dream. “
