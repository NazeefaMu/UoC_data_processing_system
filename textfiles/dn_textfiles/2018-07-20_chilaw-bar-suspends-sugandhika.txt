Chilaw Bar suspends Sugandhika

The Chilaw Bar Association has unanimously decided to temporarily suspend attorney Sugandhika Fernando from its membership on account of certain controversial statements made regarding lawyers and the Judiciary recently.
The decision was taken, at a meeting held on July 18 afternoon, due to the inconvenience caused to the Chilaw Bar Association by repeated actions derogatory of the legal profession taken by Attorney Sugandhika Fernando, a spokesperson for the association said.
He said a five-member committee comprising senior lawyers was also appointed to conduct an investigation into the statements by Fernando regarding the Chilaw Bar Association and the Judiciary.
The suspension will be effective until the investigation report and the decision of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka is received on the matter.
